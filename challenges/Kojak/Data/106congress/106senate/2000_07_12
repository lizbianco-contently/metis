Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours of debate.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this tax has been discussed at length \nover the last several years. Several years ago, we reduced some of the \nimpact of this tax, but not much. This tax is among the most often \nraised issues when I am among constituents.\n  A number of people have said during the course of the debate that the \ntax does not affect many Americans. Statistically, that is accurate, it \ndoes not. Therein lies something very important for us to consider \nabout this tax, and there is good news in this.\n  The fact is that while there are a limited number of Americans \naffected by it, the vast number of Americans, a huge majority, think it \nshould be eliminated. Why is that? Why would a tax that is rather \nisolated cause a vast majority of Americans to want to do away with it? \nIt is because Americans are still fair about these things, and they do \nnot think this is a fair tax. They do not like the concept of any \nfamily working its entire life, building a business, and then the \nGovernment, which did not do much to make the business successful--if \nit was not in the way--tapping in saying: Now that belongs to us, not \nyou who produced it, but us. They do not like that.\n  I suspect a lot of Americans contemplate there will be a time when \nthey will have grown their business, and they know it is going to take \nyears to do it and hard sweat and worry and anxiety. Then the idea that \nbecause the founder or the developers of that business had reached the \nend of their lives and it no longer belonged to that family, it is \ninconsistent with the way Americans think. They do not think it is \nfair, and they do not like it hanging over their heads.\n  I have always taken that as a sign of great news that Americans still \nhold a fundamental American value that it belonged to those who worked \nand earned it and that the Government ought not impose an egregious and \nunfair tax. Even if it does not affect me, I do not think it should \nhappen. We should take heart from that because therein lies our ability \nto ultimately make the tax system more fair across the board. No one \nhas much faith in it. They are cynical about it. They are paying the \nhighest taxes they have ever paid. There is a latent desire to fix the \nsystem, and it shows itself vividly in the death tax, or the estate \ntax.\n\n  Another thing which causes me to want to see its elimination is I do \nnot\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nthink it is imposed fairly. An undue burden, as with many taxes, falls \non the small business person, the small business family, the reasonable \nsize family farm or ranch. A lot of people who are ensnared by this tax \ndo not even know it has hit them because their assets are in property \nor equipment of which they really do not know the total value. They get \npushed over the edge. Suddenly, this reaper comes through and falls on \nthis small family business, small family farm, or ranch.\n  It is devastating because you have to pay the tax in 9 months--I \nthink that is correct--and those kinds of businesses and those kinds of \nfarms do not have a huge cash account at some financial institution. \nThe value in that estate is in land and equipment and goodwill.\n  So when the Government says: It is worth $4 million, and you owe us \nover $2 million. What are the family's options? Very limited. There is \nno $2 million. So the business has to be sold or half the farm has to \nbe sold or broken up, components of it sold, so they can raise enough \ncash to pay this insatiable appetite in Washington, DC, to get hold of \neverybody's assets, which means the people who are employed by that \nbusiness or farm are typically looking for another job; they are in a \njob line somewhere.\n  It is disruptive. It is not useful for the economy. It costs jobs. \nThere are millions and millions of dollars spent by larger businesses, \nmostly, to avoid this; and to some extent they can, which is again why \nI say it is pushing this down on what we would call the small business \nor farm. They are taking the principal hit here.\n  First, they cannot afford the consultants to figure out how to \nminimize it. Often they do not know they are going to be impacted by \nit, and they do not have the cash to pay it. So the assets have to be \nturned over and sold. And if you have to do it in 9 months--I do not \nknow how many people around here have ever gone through the process of \nselling even a home, but sometimes that ``For Sale'' sign stays out \nthere a long time. You can take your ``For Sale'' sign down, but the \nGovernment does not allow you to delay this tax. You are going to pay \nit. So if you have to sell that farm or that business at a fire \nsale price, you have to sell it. Tough luck, says Uncle Sam.\n\n  I ran a small business for about 38 years. That is a long time. I do \nnot remember anybody from Washington ever coming in to help me run it. \nIn fact, more than once I almost got the idea they would just as soon \nwe did not run it; we were fighting them off. Somewhere they got the \nidea they would own half those assets. I know I am joined by millions \nof Americans who do not agree with that.\n  Just to restate it, it does not affect a large number of Americans, \nbut a huge number of Americans want it gone. They do not think it is \nfair. They think it is inappropriate, and it is. They think it is \nconfiscatory, and it is. I think they hold to the American dream and \nfigure one day that could impact them, and indeed it might.\n  Mr. KYL. Would the Senator yield for a brief comment, a question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Sure.\n  Mr. KYL. The point the Senator just made is validated by a Gallup \nPoll that just came out, conducted from June 22 to 25. It shows that 60 \npercent of adults favor this proposal that would eliminate all \ninheritance taxes, compared to 35 percent who oppose it--almost 2-1 \nsupport for elimination of the death tax.\n  Interestingly enough, to the point the Senator just made, only 17 \npercent of Americans say they would personally benefit from the tax \nelimination, while 43 percent say they would not benefit.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Two-to-one.\n  Mr. KYL. Yet they support its repeal because they understand it is \nunfair.\n  To the point of the Senator from California yesterday, who said this \nall boils down to whose side are you on, no, it does not. What it boils \ndown to is that the vast majority of the American people, \nunderstanding, even though it may not affect them, it is a totally \nunfair tax, agree with us that it should be repealed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the Senator citing the poll. I have known \nfrom previous data of its overwhelming support. I think the point that \n2-1 they favor eliminating it and 2-1 they think it probably will never \naffect them--as I said, I always take heart in this because it \ndemonstrates the deep reserve of fairness among Americans about tax \npolicy and about their Government.\n  This is not a fair tax, nor is it implemented fairly. It \ndiscriminates against those who do not have the resources to try to \nameliorate it. So it just really builds up on the small farmer, small \nbusinessperson. They are paying an unfair burden here, on top of which, \nI would add, it creates turmoil in the workplace. It costs us jobs. It \ncreates enormous anxiety and puts an undue and unnatural pressure on \nthe financial decisions those who are impacted by it have to make.\n  You cannot manage the transaction of the sale of a business typically \nin 9 months; there are too many forces at work. It is very difficult to \ndo. I have been through that, too. So you are creating a timetable that \nis unnatural and, therefore, you create another burden on the family in \nabout as difficult a time as you can imagine. They have already \nsuffered an enormous personal loss, and then here comes Uncle Sam: OK, \n9 months, belly up.\n  So I appreciate the work of the Senator from Arizona and all those \nothers who have come to speak in favor of the elimination of the tax. I \nknow we are going to be successful. I do not know how long it is going \nto take. Because Americans do not want this tax. So whether it occurs \nin this current debate, which I hope it does, or one to follow, I know \nthis is going to be changed.\n  I end with this. I do not go to a single meeting in my State where \nthere are not several people who raise this question. My State is \ndeeply agricultural, so we have thousands of small farmers. This is \nlike a loaded gun pointed at their head. So they are waiting for us to \ndo something about this because they know it is unfair. And it is \ncreating an unnatural worry in a community, I might add, that is \nalready under enormous stress. Agriculture is all across the country. \nThis adds to that burden. It does so in a very dramatic way.\n  I thank the Senator for according me some time here this morning and \nwish him luck on the success of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I heard the speech of my good friend from \nGeorgia on the House bill. After very thorough consideration of this \nmatter, I reach a different conclusion, I must say to my good friend \nfrom Georgia. Frankly, I urge my colleagues to oppose the House bill to \nrepeal the estate tax. I do this for three reasons.\n  First, there is a significant chance that the debate will be \nconducted under the restrictions of cloture, which denies Senators a \nfair opportunity to propose amendments.\n  Second, the House bill reforms the estate tax the wrong way. There \nare all kinds of ways to reform the estate tax. The House bill is the \nwrong way.\n  Third, the House bill crowds out and pushes aside other more \nimportant priorities in which the vast majority of the American people \nare far more interested.\n  Before getting into those arguments in detail, I will provide some \nbackground about the estate tax. Nobody likes paying taxes, whether it \nis income taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, corporate taxes, or estate \ntaxes. Of course, if one asks in a poll, would you like to have a \ncertain tax repealed, the vast majority of Americans would say, yes, I \ndon't like paying that tax, repeal it. Unfortunately, we all know we do \nhave to pay some tax. After all, in a civilized society, there is some \nrevenue that has to be raised to support society's governmental, \norganizational purpose and structure. The only question is, obviously, \nhow much and what is the balance.\n  We should aim to have a tax system that raises the minimum amount of \nrevenue that is necessary and does it in a fair and balanced way. For \nmore than 80 years, there has been a consensus that the estate tax is a \nsmall but important part of a fair and balanced tax system. It has been \na bipartisan consensus.\n  The Federal estate tax was first proposed by President Theodore \nRoosevelt. It was repeated by his successor, William Howard Taft. In \nfact, in\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nhis inaugural address in 1909, President Taft said that it may be \nnecessary to raise additional revenue and that if so ``new kinds of \ntaxation must be adopted, and among these I recommend a graduated \ninheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of \ncollection.'' That was President William Howard Taft.\n  A few years later, in 1916, Congress needed to raise additional \nrevenue primarily to prepare for possible involvement in World War I. \nCongress had to make hard choices. Congress could either raise tariff \nrates or it could come up with an alternative. This is what the House \nCommittee on Ways and Means said:\n\n       It is probable that no country in the world derives as much \n     revenue per capita from its people through the consumption \n     tax as does the United States. It is therefore deemed proper \n     that, in meeting the extraordinary expenditures for the Army \n     and the Navy our revenue system should be more evenly and \n     equitably balanced and a larger portion of our necessary \n     revenues collected from the incomes and inheritances of those \n     deriving the most benefit and protection from the government.\n\n  Congress enacted the estate tax in 1916. It has been amended several \ntimes. For example, in 1932, in response to revenue needs generated by \nthe Great Depression, the rates were increased significantly. In 1981, \nunder President Reagan, the rates were cut significantly, with the top \nrate falling from 70 percent to 55 percent. Today the Federal estate \ntax applies to estates with a value of more than $675,000. That \nthreshold amount is scheduled to rise to $1 million by the year 2006. \nThere are special rules for farms and for family businesses.\n  All told, the tax applies to the estates of about 2 out of every 100 \npeople who die each year. That is about 2 percent. It raises $28 \nbillion a year. To put that in perspective, it is 3 percent of the \namount that is raised by the Federal income tax. under the estate tax.\n  That brings me to the House bill we have before us today. The House \nbill works in two steps. First, over the first 9 years, the House bill \ngradually reduces estate taxes down to a top rate of about 40 percent. \nThen in the year 2010, a full 10 years after enactment, it completely \nrepeals the estate tax. At the same time the House bill imposes a new \nrequirement, something of which not many Senators are aware. People who \ninherit estates worth more than certain amounts must maintain what tax \nlawyers call the ``carryover basis'' of inherited assets. That is in \nthe House bill.\n  All told, the 10-year cost of the House bill is $105 billion. But it \nis important to note that the House bill is constructed to disguise the \nreal long-term costs. In the 10th year, when the estate tax is \ncompletely repealed, the cost is almost $50 billion a year, and the \ncost will rise each year after that. I have seen estimates up to $750 \nbillion over the second 10 years.\n\n  That, in a nutshell, is the House bill.\n  As I said at the outset, I oppose the bill. I do so for several \nreasons. My first concern is with the process. Once again, the majority \nmay invoke cloture as a first resort. This limits debate. It limits the \nability for Senators to offer amendments. Most important of all, it \ndenies the American people an opportunity to have their elected \nrepresentatives conduct a full, unfettered public debate about a very \nimportant issue. I hope that we can avoid cloture and have an open \ndebate.\n  I have another concern about the process. This is a serious issue, \nwhether we repeal a Federal estate tax. We are considering a proposal \nthat can be fairly described as radical--total repeal. That is pretty \nradical. The House bill would completely repeal a tax that has been an \nintegral part of the Federal tax system since 1916; repeal it, lock, \nstock, and barrel, get rid of it totally, with no amendments and no \nhearing. That raises many serious questions.\n  One is the impact across income levels. I am not talking about class \nwarfare. Believe me, that is one thing I don't like to get into; I \ndon't believe in it. That is bashing the rich. Rather, I am talking \nabout fully understanding the impact of this proposal on the overall \nfairness and balance of our tax system, a subject we have not \naddressed. It hasn't even been raised; we haven't had the opportunity.\n  Another question is about the new rules to maintain the carryover \nbasis of certain inherited assets--very complicated, totally new, not \ndebated, not even known by a majority of Senators. In some cases, this \nwould require recordkeeping across several generations. Just think of \nthat, requiring new recordkeeping across several generations. I \nremember back when Congress tried to do something similar in 1978. The \nnew law was extraordinarily complex. It created a fierce public \nbacklash, and we quickly repealed it.\n  We would do the same if this were ever enacted into law; I guarantee \nit. Do we want people to have to keep track of the price that their \ngreat-great-grandparents paid for property and investments? Under the \nHouse bill they will have to.\n  Another question is the impact on charitable giving. A great deal of \ncharitable giving comes from bequests. People make these bequests \nprimarily because they want to help communities. That is a good cause. \nBut we all know in some cases there is a tax planning element because \ncharitable contributions are deducted from the value of an estate. Do \nwe know how repeal of the estate tax will affect charitable giving? Has \nthat been discussed, debated? Many estate tax lawyers I talk to tell \nme: Max, if you repeal the Federal estate tax, it is going to have a \nsubstantial effect on charitable giving. There will be a substantial \nreduction in charitable giving, major, big time, if you repeal the \nFederal estate tax.\n  Another question is the impact on States. Currently--this is not well \nknown; how could it be, there hasn't been a hearing; we had no \nopportunity for amendments--currently an estate receives a credit for \ninheritance and estate taxes that the estate pays to a State \ngovernment. As a result, these State taxes generally don't increase the \noverall burden on an estate. Instead, they shift revenues from the \nFederal Government to the States. It is about a third.\n  The long and short of it is, about a third of all the Federal estate \ntaxes that are collected go to States. We, therefore, collect the \nrevenue that goes to the States. Under a total repeal, that is the end \nof that. Does anybody know that? Do the States know that? Do the \nGovernors know that? I don't think they have focused on this because \nthey don't know about it. How could they? There have been no hearings.\n  If the Federal estate tax umbrella is repealed, many States may face \nstrong pressure to reduce or eliminate their own inheritance taxes and \nestate taxes--resulting in unintended consequences, unthought-out \nconsequences, unknown consequences.\n  Still another question is how repeal of the estate tax will affect \nthe concentration of wealth. As we all know, one reason the estate tax \nwas enacted and later strengthened was to limit the accumulation of \nhuge fortunes that can be passed on to create economic dynasties. Are \nwe prepared to say that today this is no longer an issue?\n  Now I am not trying to be judgmental, Mr. President, believe me. I am \njust raising very important questions that have to be discussed, \ndebated, and thought out. I am not suggesting I have all the answers. I \nam simply saying these are very serious questions that deserve more \ntime and attention than we are giving them. After all, we are not \nreferring the House bill to the Finance Committee for a hearing where \nthe questions can be addressed. In fact, the Finance Committee hasn't \nheld a hearing on estate taxes in this Congress. I will repeat that. \nThe Finance Committee has not held a hearing on estate taxes in this \nCongress. Instead, we are rushing the House bill to the floor under \ncloture.\n  Why are we doing this? Why not hold hearings so that we can more \nfully understand the implications of the House bill? That is just my \nfirst concern in the process.\n  Now my second concern. While the House bill reforms the estate tax, \nit reforms it in the wrong way. There is a right way and a wrong way to \ndo things. The House bill reforms the wrong way.\n  For a long time, I have supported reform of the estate tax. Most of \nus here do. I have worked on special rules for farms and ranches. A few \nyears ago, I worked closely with Senator Dole on reforms for family-\nowned small businesses.\n  Despite these and some other improvements, the estate tax still hits\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\nsome people too hard, especially those who own farms, ranches, and \nsmall businesses. We should fix that. We should fix it now. We need to \nhelp our farmers and our small businesses. The amendment that I and the \nmajority of my side support will do that.\n  The House bill that we may adopt, would do very little for those \nestates, very little for those farmers, ranchers, and small business \npeople--until 10 years later when, under their bill, it is fully \nrepealed.\n  On the other hand, the alternative that Senators Moynihan, Conrad, \nand I propose would reform the estate tax in the right way. It would do \ntwo things that are simple but effective.\n  First, we dramatically increase the amount that is exempt from the \nestate tax. Currently, it is $675,000. We increase it to $1 million per \nspouse right away. And a few years later, we begin to increase it again \nuntil it reaches $2 million. For a couple, that would be $4 million.\n  Second, we increase the family-owned business exclusion to $4 million \nper spouse. For a couple, that is $8 million.\n  These simple changes have a huge effect. The first year, we would \nexempt over 40 percent of the estates that currently are subject to an \nestate tax. The fact is, it is much more relief for estates in this \nrange than the House bill would provide.\n  As this chart shows, the Democratic alternative is on the left. This \nchart shows who is left paying taxes after the first year. On the left \nside, you can see the bar there, which represents the Republican bill, \n50,000 Americans would continue to pay estate taxes in the first year, \njust like they would under current law. In the first year, as it shows \non the right side, under the Democratic alternative, only 30,000 \nAmericans would pay estate taxes. Guess what. That basically continues \nfor 9 years--not totally, but basically.\n  So the Democratic alternative provides relief--significant relief--in \nthe first 10 years. The Republicans' doesn't. There is some near the \nend. But there is a cliff effect after 10 years, with all of the \nconsequences we have not even talked about.\n  These simple changes have a huge effect. The first year, we would \nexempt over 40 percent of the estates that are currently subject to an \nestate tax. Under the Republican alternative, none would be exempt over \nthe first 10 years. Over the longer term, when the provisions take full \neffect, the Democratic proposal would exempt two-thirds of all estates, \nthree-quarters of all small businesses, and 90 percent of all farms and \nranches that would otherwise have to pay estate tax.\n\n  Remember, only 2 percent of the estates pay an estate tax. But we are \nsaying in the Democratic alternative that three-quarters of those who \ncurrently pay--three-quarters of the small businesses, two-thirds of \nall estates, and 90 percent of all farmers and ranchers would be \nexempt.\n  This chart shows that, under current law, the Democratic alternative \nexempts three-quarters of all family-owned businesses. The Democratic \nalternative exempts 95 percent of farms. On the left, under current \nlaw--this is a huge bar. That means those folks are still paying. Under \nthe Democratic alternative, very few pay. You can see that.\n  This other chart is showing the same thing with respect to all estate \ntaxes. That is, over the first 10 years, fewer Americans will be paying \nestate taxes than under the House bill.\n  Next year, it is expected that about 2.5 million Americans will die. \nRoughly 50,000 will have estates that would pay an estate tax under \ncurrent law. Under the House bill, every one of these estates will \nstill pay an estate tax, but at slightly lower rates, with the greatest \nrate reductions going to the larger estates.\n  Again, the greatest rate reductions will go to the larger estates; \nwhereas, under the Democratic alternative, the bulk--almost all of the \nrelief--is immediate, and it goes to farms, ranches, and small \nbusinesses. The small business exclusion is raised to $8 million per \ncouple eventually, and the unified credit is raised to $4 million \neventually.\n  So under our substitute, fully 20,000 of those 50,000 estates won't \npay an estate tax at all in the very first year. They will be exempt, \nperiod. The exemptions will be concentrated on the farms, ranches, and \nthe small businesses that need relief. That is the right kind of \nreform, not the wrong kind, which I mentioned earlier.\n  My third concern is about priorities. At the end of the day, that is \nwhat this debate is really about. We provide complete relief to estates \nworth up to $4 million, and farms, ranches, and small businesses worth \nup to $8 million--complete relief.\n  The proponents of the House bill insist that we go much further, at \nan additional cost of about $40 billion over 10 years. In later years, \nthe cost will be much higher, about $50 billion a year. They argue, in \nsupport of the House bill, that whatever the size of an estate, we \nshould not impose a tax at the event of death rather than when an asset \nis sold, and we should not impose rates as high as 55 percent.\n  These are serious arguments. I don't dismiss them out of hand. \nSenator Kyl, in particular, has presented an articulate case. But \nreasonable people can differ. When we get the facts out and determine \nwhat is really going out, different people can reach different \nconclusions. I think it comes down to priorities.\n  It seems to me that we in this Chamber could agree in an instant to \nprovide relief to the vast majority of farms, ranches, and small \nbusinesses and, indeed, for the vast majority of estates that are now \nsubject to the tax. We can do it for a cost of $60 billion over 10 \nyears--less than in the House bill.\n  So the real question, then, is whether it makes sense for us to spend \nanother $40 billion to provide relief for people who are, by any \nmeasure, very well off and can take care of themselves.\n  Again, it is a question of priorities. Despite the euphoria the new \nestimated budget surpluses seem to induce, we all know that, in truth, \nthere is no free lunch. If we reduce tax revenue by another $40 \nmillion, we will have much less for other priorities, such as health \ncare and prescription drugs, which are much more important to most \nAmericans.\n  Providing middle-class working families relief from payroll taxes is \none example; providing incentives for education and savings, and \nproviding incentives for research and development, which will keep our \neconomy on the cutting technological edge, those are other alternatives \nand higher priorities of the American people which will help make our \neconomy stronger, and providing prescription drug coverage so that \nseniors don't have to choose between food and medicine. Many, as we \nwell know, have to make that choice.\n  Oh, yes. Let's not forget that we are paying down the national debt. \nThat is pretty important.\n  I hope cloture is not sought. I hope that at some point soon we have \na real opportunity to discuss and resolve our differences.\n  After all, there are some positive signs. The President has signaled \nthat he has an interest in compromise.\n  Enlightened business leaders are now suggesting there can be a \ncompromise. In other words, if we want to write a law rather than \ncreate a political issue, we can achieve a compromise that makes \nmeaningful reforms in estate tax and also address other pressing \nnational needs. That would be good news. I hope it happens.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I believe under the agreement that I am \nnow allotted 15 minutes. I want to comment briefly.\n  My friend from Montana indicated a concern a number of times about \nlimiting debate. I have to suggest that this debate could have been \nchanged had there been an agreement on his side. The idea that there is \nnot an opportunity to offer amendments in limited debate is not a very \nvalid argument. That is because that side has not agreed.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I agree with the statement of the very distinguished Senator from \nMontana. Reasonable people can disagree, and they can use the same \nstatistics and come to different conclusions. We do that every day in \nthis Chamber.\n  I wonder, after listening to the debate--whether it is Montana, \nMinnesota, or whatever the State being\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nrepresented by the other side of the aisle--how Montana could be so \ndifferent from Oklahoma.\n  Eleven months ago, I did a tour of very small areas in Oklahoma--\nShattuck, Boise, and Gage--places you probably never heard of, with \nvery small populations. These people are not wealthy. They are small \nfamily farmers and ranchers. In that part of Oklahoma, they normally \nhave three sources of income. It is either small grain or cattle or \noil. When all three are down, we have real devastation out there. We \nhave a lot of family farms that are not even making enough money to \nbreak even.\n  I remember going out there and talking about the various agricultural \nprograms. I talked about crop insurance. I talked about transition \npayments. But when the subject of estate taxes came up, they forgot \nabout all of the other Government programs having to do with \nagriculture. They said: It would be the greatest thing in the world for \nus to be able to survive as a family institution and pass this on to \nthe next generation.\n  These people live day to day. They are not wealthy people. They have \nto really save to buy halfway modern farm equipment. They say: The \ngreatest single thing you could do for us would be to allow us to pass \nthis on to the next generation.\n  I think that dwelling on the small percentage of total estates \nsubject to the death tax isn't really an adequate reflection of the \ndamage inflicted by the death tax, which is about 1.9 percent out of \nthe approximately 2.3 million deaths each year, and 4.3 file a return; \nthat is, 98,900. Not all of these are taxable. There is an effect in \nOklahoma on small businesses and farms.\n  If you look at the ``1995 White House Conference on Small Business \nIssue Handbook''--we had several people there as part of that group who \nmade this handbook--more than 70 percent of all the family businesses \ndo not survive through the second generation, and fully 87 percent do \nnot make it to the third generation.\n  I ask the Senator from Wyoming about the source of some of these \nfigures which we hear, such as the loss of $40 billion in tax revenues. \nI don't know where they come from. I certainly question them.\n  The current Federal death tax accounted for only $23 billion in 1998, \nor a meager 1.4 percent of $1.7 trillion in total Federal receipts, a \nlevel that has remained fairly stable over the years.\n  I suggest there are two factors that are not being considered. One is \nthe cost of compliance and one is the economic impact.\n  There are some studies which illustrate that we could actually end up \nincreasing tax revenues by altogether eliminating the death tax.\n  A December 1999 study by Congress' Joint Economic Committee said:\n\n       The compliance costs associated with the estate tax are of \n     the same general magnitude as the tax's revenue yield, or \n     about $23 billion. . .The estate tax raises very little, if \n     any, net revenue for the Federal Government.\n\n  In 1998, the Heritage Foundation came up with a similar conclusion. \nThey said:\n\n       The cost of compliance means that the $19 billion collected \n     in the Federal death taxes last year actually cost taxpayers \n     $25 billion.\n\n  It is actually a net loss, according to their study.\n  A recent report from the Institute for Policy Innovation says:\n\n       Reducing estate taxes would generate sizable economic gains \n     with little revenue loss. Over the next 10 years, doing away \n     with the estate tax would produce $3.67 in output for every \n     $1 of static revenue loss.\n\n  Finally, Alicia Munnell, a former member of President Clinton's own \nCouncil of Economic Advisors, in a 1988 economic review, estimates that \nthe costs of complying with estate tax laws are roughly the same \nmagnitude as the revenue raised.\n  This came right out of the White House.\n  The other factor I am very sensitive to--because before I came to \nthis body or to the other body down the hall, I spent 30 years in the \nreal world--I know what it is like and how tough it is out in the real \nworld. I wish every Member of the Senate had that kind of 30-year \nexperience. I can remember the years I spent working long hours hiring \npeople and expanding the economic base.\n  There is one statistic that is hardly ever used around here. Every 1 \npercent increase in economic activity produces an additional $24 \nbillion of new revenue.\n  If you look at the motivation of many of us--I am not the only one in \nthis Chamber. I am not the only one certainly in Oklahoma or in this \ncountry who spent the majority of his life working, not for himself but \nfor the kids. Would I have worked those hours and would I have taken \nthe time to go out and generate the jobs and revenues for this country \nif I had known that I could not have passed them on to my children?\n  I say this: For probably the last 20 years of the 30-some years I \nworked in the real world, I worked for my four kids and now my \ngrandkids.\n  If anyone in this Chamber who was opposed to the 1993 Clinton/Gore \ntax increase--which some have characterized as the largest single tax \nincrease in the history of this country, and the increase in estate \ntaxes at that time--if they were offended by that and felt we increased \ntaxes too much, as even the President said he did, this is your \nopportunity to undo some of that damage.\n  Finally, I consider this to be a moral issue. I think any time you \nhave the Government saying you must spend your savings on yourself and \nnot give to your kids, it becomes a moral issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Wyoming.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understood that Senator Schumer was \ngoing to speak, according to the list that I have.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we had 15 minutes. The Senator from \nOklahoma used part of it. I intend to use the remainder. We are a \nlittle behind on time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That put us behind.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will use about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is an interesting debate. It has gone \non now for a substantial amount of time. We talked about all of the \ndetails. Of course, that is a proper thing to do. There are all kinds \nof ideas in the Senate, which is the way it is supposed to be. That is \nwhat the Senate is about.\n  There are many, particularly on that side of the aisle, who want to \nspend more--that more spending is the better thing to do. There are \nothers who believe there should be a limit on spending--a limit on what \nthe Federal Government does. But that is a judgment we need to make. \nSome apparently think that it is better to penalize spending, to make \nit more difficult for people to amass money. Others believe we ought to \nencourage savings. That is what the system is about. It causes people \nto be able to work and save for themselves.\n  There are some who believe we ought to be in the business of \nredistributing income. Of course, we are dealing with that all of the \ntime. Others believe we ought to encourage enterprise and \nentrepreneurship. These differences, philosophical and others, are as \nthey should be. It is the role of the Senate to do that. It is also the \nobligation and role of the Senate to come to closure.\n\n  The idea that we drag these things along is exasperating. We have 35 \ndays left in this session to finish many things, including the very \nimportant appropriations bills. As we move toward the end, of course, \nwe have an administration that is interested, as always, in shutting \ndown the Government and blaming the Congress so they get all the \nappropriation things they choose.\n  The House adopted this bill by a vote of 279-136, which is greater \nthan a two-thirds majority. This estate repeal, this death tax repeal, \nover a 10-year period, does away with the death tax. It takes death out \nof the formula. It would not eliminate taxes. Those properties and \nvalues passed on to someone else will be a basis, and when and if those \nare disposed of, there will be a tax on them. It isn't a matter of not \ntaxing them; it takes death out of the proposition.\n  Interestingly enough, despite all the concerns about revenue impacts, \nthe tax raises only 1 to 2 percent of overall Federal revenues. That is \nrelatively small. As a matter of fact, the Joint Economic Committee \nindicated a probable loss of income taxes because of businesses that \nhave to be shut down as\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\na result of estate taxes, thus causing a deficit.\n  This idea that we will eliminate taxes, that people don't pay taxes \non the property, isn't true. They will be paid on the basis of whenever \nthey are disposed of.\n  There are a number of things that need to be dealt with. One is that \nthe death tax kills jobs. No question about that. Many small businesses \nand farms have to sell their properties. Jobs are eliminated. Those \npeople who lose their jobs are taxed at 100 percent. I happen to be \nfrom the West where we are interested in keeping open space. \nAgriculture does that. Many agriculturists will have to sell their \nlands when they have to pay this estate tax. It will be developed. It \nruins that idea.\n  Certainly double taxation is involved here, so there are some \nphilosophical issues that we ought to take into account. Again, I will \nstay away from the details. We have had a great deal of talk about the \ndetails.\n  Instead of talking about the fact that we have lots of money, there \nare a million things for which we can spend it. We have had more \ndifficulty holding down the size of the Federal Government, and that is \nmore important when we have a surplus than when we have a deficit \nbecause there are a million things for which we can spend it. We ought \nto talk about what is the legitimate role of the Federal Government; \nwhat is the role of State and local governments.\n  Do we just involve ourselves in everything because there is money \navailable? I don't think so. We have a constitutional government, a \nconstitutional limitation. We ought to talk about that. We ought to \ntalk about saving Social Security. We are doing that. We ought to talk \nabout strengthening health care. We are doing that. We ought to pay \ndown some of the debt. And then, frankly, we talk about taxes. Money \nought to go back to the people who own it, who are paying in. Fairness \nought to be a part of this whole equation. I hope it will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am here to talk about the estate tax and what we ought \nto do about it. I want to make a couple of points.\n  First, I give the person who named it the ``death'' tax a lot of \ncredit. I don't think this issue would have the velocity it does if it \nwere not called that. At certain times, words somehow convey things. \nSometimes they are correct; sometimes they are incorrect. I believe if \n``junk'' bonds had been called high-yield bonds, we would have a \ndifferent economic history. As we have learned, junk bonds play a \nuseful role in the economy. For a while, when they were called \n``junk,'' people changed their views. Words have a funny way of \nworking. When we say death tax, people say that sounds horrible. It \nalmost sounds like something from Star Wars.\n  Second, I am not one who says that this is a great thing and we must \nhave it in place. In one particular area I think there is great \nresonance for eliminating this. That is, that any organic business--a \nfarm, a small business, and frankly a large business--that would have \nto be broken up because of the extent of the tax should not be. A \nbusiness is an ongoing organism. It employs sometimes 10 people and \nsometimes 10,000 people. To have to break that business up to pay any \ntax, to me, is counterproductive. That is why I have floated a proposal \nto my colleagues that eliminates this for any ongoing business that is \npassed down through the family and delays the payment of the tax until \nthat business is broken up, either by the next generation or the \ngeneration after that. That makes sense to me.\n  If we were in a world of unlimited dollars, I would be for immediate \nrepeal of the whole thing--not just the family part. But we are not. We \nhave to make choices. That is what this is all about. If you had to \nmake one argument about what the debate concerns, it concerns choice. \nWhat are our choices? It has been well documented by many of my \ncolleagues that 98 percent of the American people right now do not pay \nthe estate tax. It has been documented that the amount of income is \ngoing up and up and up. You have to be millionaire before you pay that \ntax. Soon you will have to be--whatever the word is--a ``dual'' \nmillionaire, have at least $2 million before you pay the tax. Only 2 \npercent of Americans are affected. Of the 2 percent who pay, the very \nwealthiest, the billionaires, pay a huge proportion of that tax.\n  Do they resent it? I guess they do. I give them credit for having \nbuilt up their businesses and earned all this money. They say they pay \ntaxes all along; why should they pay it again. By that argument, no one \nshould pay taxes any time. We pay a sales tax. We pay an income tax. We \npay corporate taxes. We pay property taxes. They often hit the same \npeople more than once. That is unfortunate.\n  Why do I say this is a choice issue? You have to compare. Since we \ndon't have unlimited money, we have come to a consensus. We ought to \nbuy down the debt and save Social Security which takes the majority of \nthe now projected $4 trillion surplus. What do we do with the rest? I \nagree with my friend from Wyoming that tax cuts should play a part. We \nshouldn't have all spending proposals. I believe there ought to be a \nmix. Once we buy down the debt, we ought to have some tax reduction and \nsome necessary spending proposals. Education and health care and \ntransportation would be my priorities.\n  When we do tax cuts, who do you want to help? What best helps \nAmerica? I am here to talk about a proposal that I think 95 percent of \nall Americans would prefer rather than what is being proposed here; \nthat is, to make college tuition tax deductible, particularly for \nmiddle-income people.\n  College is a necessity in America these days. We know that. We know \nthe old-time way of a job being handed down from great-grandfather to \ngrandfather to father to son or great-grandmother to grandmother to \nmother to daughter is gone. We know that only people in America whose \nincome level has actually gone up during this prosperity are those with \nthe college education. So college is a necessity for families, for \nparents, for individuals. It is a necessity for the individual's well-\nbeing, but it is also a necessity for the well-being of America. \nBecause as we move into an ideas economy, we surely will not stay the \nNo. 1 country in the world if we do not have the best educated people. \nPraise God, so far we do. But that could flow away.\n\n  One of the main impediments to us staying No. 1 and continuing to \nhave the best educated people in the world is the high cost of college \ntuition. If you are a family who is solidly in the middle class--let's \nsay you make $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year--you get no help with \nthose tuition bills. If you are poor, we give you a lot of help. We \nshould. I love seeing ladders where poor people can walk their way up \nand establish themselves in America. If you are rich, you don't need \nit. You can afford that high college tuition. But if you are a middle-\nclass person, if you are that hard-working majority of Americans right \nthere in the middle--let's say the husband and wife work and let's say \ntheir total income is $65,000, $70,000; that is pretty good until the \ntuition bill hits; until they see they have to pay $10,000 or $15,000 \nor $20,000 or even $30,000 to send their child to the best possible \nschool--you don't get any help at all.\n  We can. We can next week when we debate the estate tax. I ask my \ncolleagues, where would it be better spent? To help the very wealthy in \nAmerica not pay the estate tax--again, all things being equal why not--\nor is it better to help the middle class pay for their children's \ncollege? Why, when people struggle to save their $10, $20, $50 every \nweek to pay for college, does Uncle Sam then take a cut when we know \nthat this is good for America? When you send your child to college, you \nare not only helping that child and your family, you are helping \nAmerica. You are helping us achieve the best educated labor force in \nthe world. So why, when families struggle, and struggle they do, does \nUncle Sam take a tax cut?\n  I make a good salary as a Senator. I have no complaints. God has been \ngood to me and my family. But we have two daughters, beautiful \ndaughters, the love of our lives, 15 and 11. We are up late at night \nfiguring out how we are going to pay for their college education.\n  There are millions of American families whose children do not go to \ncollege because it is expensive, too expensive.\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\nThere are millions more--I was in Niagara Falls this Monday, 2 days \nago. I heard of a family, the Maskas, with seven children. They are \ntrying to send each one to college. A few of them are in college at the \nsame time. But do you know what they had to do? They had to tell one of \ntheir young children, even though he was doing very well in school and \nhad good boards, that he had to go to a nearby junior college because \nthey couldn't afford the college he deserved to get into.\n  So it is not only people who can't get into college; it is people who \nscale down the college they choose because they cannot afford the more \nexpensive schools. Tuition has gone up more than any part of our \nbudget. The cost of health care, from 1980 to 1995--which everyone \ntalks about having a huge amount of increase--went up 175 percent; 250 \npercent is tuition.\n  The bottom line to all of us in this Chamber is simple. It is not \nwhether we are for or against removing the estate tax in the abstract. \nIt is a choice--choice--choice--choice: Do we take these hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, which I believe I agree with my colleague from \nWyoming should be sent back to the people--and send them to the very \nwealthiest people or do we give some back to the middle class to help \neducate their children and get them the best college education \npossible?\n\n  I daresay the vast majority of voters in every one of the 50 States \nbelieves it is better to vote for the proposal that I will make on the \nestate tax bill. I have done it jointly. I do not know if we will be \noffering it together, but the proposal was put together by myself, the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, and \nthe Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith. It is bipartisan. I urge my \ncolleagues next week, when the estate tax bill comes to be debated, if \nit does, to decide the choice. Do we return the money to the wealthiest \n2 percent, especially those who do not have ongoing farms or \nbusinesses--because we are going to deal with them--or do we send it to \nthe millions of middle-class Americans who are up late at night, \nworried about whether they can afford to send their children to school, \nand who right now get virtually no help from Washington?\n  Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. So there is some order here, we wanted to go back and \nforth. It is now the Republicans' turn. It is my understanding Senator \nDomenici will speak. Following that, so colleagues on my side of the \naisle will know, Senator Harkin will have 15 minutes. Then the last \nspeaker we will have is Senator Lautenberg and he will have whatever \ntime we have remaining, probably about 13 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. As I understand it, I agree: Senator Domenici, then \nSenator Harkin, and then we have Senator Hutchison.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask from the time of the Democrats, the \nminority, that Senator Harkin be given 15 minutes and Senator \nLautenberg be given the remaining time that we have. I ask that in the \nform of a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think almost everyone has heard the \nname Dr. Milton Friedman. I would like to start my brief remarks by \nquoting this very distinguished Nobel prize winning economist, who \nnotes:\n\n       The estate tax sends a bad message to savers, to wit: that \n     it is OK to spend your money on wine, women and song, but \n     don't try to save it for your kids. The moral absurdity of \n     the tax is surpassed only by its economic irrationality.\n\n  You could stop there and say no more, and ask, do we really have a \ntax on the books of the United States that will lead Americans to waste \ntheir money rather than save it to leave to their children? And then to \nbe add the economically irrational absurdity. One could just read that \nindictment and conclude that it is a good source of information, a \nNobel winner in economics, a splendid proponent of entrepreneurial \ncapitalism and what makes it work and what detracts from its working. \nDr. Friedman's quote could be the sum and total of my speech. I could \nstop there.\n  But let me proceed on with a couple of facts. These are real. It does \nnot raise very much money. It is a big trap for the unwary. It is \nviewed as the most confiscatory tax, with its rates reaching 55 \npercent, and if coupled with the generation-skipping tax, the practical \neffect of the tax is that it can grab as much as 85 cents on the \ndollar. I do not believe we in America ought to have any tax on the \nbooks that can take as much as 85 percent of any dollar, earned or \nowned, by any American. So that is the debate.\n  It hits a diversity of people. Two groups most adversely affected are \nsmall businesses and family farms, which are absolutely frightened of \nthe concept that at a point in time when they most need their managing \npartner, when the business or farm needs its key person the most, that \nkey person has died, by definition, and up to 55 percent straight on--\nwithout generation-skipping trusts protecting children--55 percent of \nthe estate would go to the Government.\n  There are all kinds of excuses and explanations. It is payable over \ntime. Yes, some would say: Thank you, Federal Government, as you take \n55 percent of everything we saved and earned and built up; it is \ngenerous that you let us pay that 55 percent over time.\n\n  I do not know if that means anything. It probably means the \nGovernment got to the point where it was absolutely absurd trying to \nmake them pay that 55 percent all at once because the horror stories \nwere so rampant that Congress would say: What are we up to? After \nlistening to that for a while, they made it payable on the installment \nplan.\n  Again, my own sense of what this does and what my constituents have \ntold me is consistent with Dr. Milton Friedman: The Estate Tax \npenalizes savers. Someone who is getting old may have accumulated an \nestate perhaps made up of a nice house, a nice summer cabin, and may \nown two filling stations. Try that on as to whether they are a real \nrich person: A really nice house, a summer cabin, and two filling \nstations of the modern type today. They are going to pay a huge amount \non the appraised value of that estate, and let's add to it that they \nsaved and have $50,000 in the bank. All of these assets were acquired \nwith money that had already been taxed as income under the Federal \nincome tax.\n  It is a double tax; I do not think anybody would doubt that. Nobody \nwould come to the floor and say it is not. Assets are purchased with \nafter-tax dollars and then taxed again under the estate tax.\n  The approach in the bill before us is a very fair approach. There are \nsome who think the bill allows rich people to avoid paying taxes. It \ndoes not. The change is a timing change. Death would not be the taxable \nevent. Instead, a family business or farm or other asset inherited \nwould be taxed when it is sold, but it is not a giveaway, as some \nallege, because the basis for calculating the tax at the time of the \nsale would be the same as if the original owner had sold it. It would \nbe taxed on a carryover basis.\n  That means, to make it very simple, if your entire assets are three \nwarehouses when death occurs, the three warehouses have a value at the \ndate of death, but they are not taxed then. When one or two or three of \nthose warehouses are sold by the inheritor, they pay a capital gains \ntax using the original value, which might have been the value 10 or 15 \nyears ago when the asset was first acquired.\n  If they make a very large amount of money when they sell it, that is \ntaxed as capital gains. It is changing the taxable event from the date \nof death that triggers the tax to the date of an actual sale by one who \ninherits it. That is the event.\n  It seems to me when everybody has that understood--some of the people \nwho are saying this is not a fair approach, and some Americans who have \nbeen listening might say, Is this really fair--they will come down on \nthe side that this is a much fairer approach than taxing on the value \non the date of death.\n  I compliment the chairman of the Finance Committee for his fine work. \nHe is correct that this is one tax that should be abolished. This is a \ngood and\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nfair tax policy, and it moves us toward tax simplification, which, in \nand of itself, is commendable and something we are always trying to do \nwith our Tax Code but succeed rarely. We talk much and succeed rarely.\n\n\n                        new mexico water rights\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to talk about some other things \nthat should be abolished. Last week, the Solicitor of the Department of \nthe Interior issued a two-paragraph memorandum that he calls a legal \nopinion. In that memo opinion, he attempts, in one fell swoop, to \noverrule New Mexico water law and the rights that are established under \nNew Mexico water law which are called the rights of prior \nappropriation, the cornerstone of water rights, and the right to use \nwater and how to allocate water when water is stored.\n  In that same opinion, as I view it, he has abolished our water law \nand nationalized the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, one of the \nlargest irrigation districts--if anyone has flown over Albuquerque, \nthat big green belt is the Rio Grande, and anything you can see in \nAlbuquerque on that part of the river is part of the conservancy \ndistrict. That conservancy district is not, as the Solicitor said, ``an \nagent of the Federal Government.'' He is going to have plenty of time \nto prove that for he is going to be challenged in every court wherever \nwe can, and perhaps even in the Congress, on whether that is an \nappropriate conclusion.\n  Let me tell you about the creation of this Middle Rio Grande \nConservancy District and its mission.\n  First, it was created by the State of New Mexico by our State \nlegislature in 1923. It was the Conservancy Act of New Mexico. It was \nnot created by the Federal Government. It was created by New Mexico. It \nowes the Federal Government no money. It paid off its last rehab and \nconstruction loan in 1999.\n  Solicitors at the Department of Interior or any other lawyers just do \nnot walk around nationalizing assets. In some countries, dictators do, \nbut certainly it is not the way we do things in America.\n  The partial effect of this memo is to overturn New Mexico and western \nwater law. In our State, water is a precious commodity. I wish we had \nmore of it so it would not be so precious, but it is precious and we \nhave too little of it.\n  In New Mexico, we have endangered species. We have more than one, but \none lives in the lower reaches of the Middle Rio Grande River. We have \na silvery minnow. And in the river right over the mountains is a blunt-\nnosed shiner. I wish we had fewer endangered species and more water--\nthat would be very good--but such is not what has been dealt New \nMexico.\n  We have a water rights system, and it essentially is a seniority \nsystem. This Solicitor ignores that basic premise. Adding insult to \ninjury, the matter was already before our Federal courts, and on June \n19, 2000, Interior Solicitor Leshy issued a brief opinion stating that \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, the entity that manages some of the water, \nhas title to the water in this Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District. \nHow he will ever make that stand up I do not know, but I hope there are \njudges left who will get to the heart of this issue and determine that \nis not a policy nor is it fact.\n  In October of 1999, the Bureau of Reclamation biological assessment \nstated the bureau did not have a controlling property interest in this \nMiddle Rio Grande conservancy facility.\n  On Thursday, the Albuquerque Bureau of Reclamation area manager sent \na letter to the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District that they \noperate as agent of the United States and should operate its \n``transferred works'' allow 300 cfs of water to bypass San Acacia Dam \non the lower river for the silvery minnow.\n  This places all the burden on these farmers and none on the rest of \nthe users, which is inconsistent with New Mexico law again. This places \nall the burden on this one group.\n  The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District's position is that \nproviding water for the fish should not all be borne by their \nwater users, i.e. the farmers. The burden should be shared. There are \nmany big water rights holders including the city of Albuquerque. The \nBureau of Reclamation countered that it has title to the Conservancy \nDistrict's water so it can claim it, but that it does not have \nauthority to take the Albuquerque city's water because it is other \npeople's water.\n\n  New Mexico says that the Federal Government must comply with State \nlaw and get a permit to change irrigation water to water for fish \nhabitat. It further admonished that the Federal Government has no \nauthority to interfere with the state's interstate delivery \nobligations. I believe the federal government's strategy is to divide \nthe parties, as well as to avoid a hearing on the merits of the \nbiological need for wet water for the fish.\n  To conclude, if we are ever to have cooperation to preserve this \nendangered species, the silvery minnow, this is exactly the way not to \ndo it. There was a burgeoning working together, cooperative group. I \nwas part of it. Many environmental groups were part of it.\n  We were looking for a way to collectively and collaboratively create \nsome habit activities, and then construct some habitats for this \nminnow, and to do it with the full assistance of the Federal \nGovernment. Along comes this Leshy opinion and out the window goes all \nthat. Now it is full speed ahead with litigation on all sides, and \npeople working in the Congress to see what we can do to be fair.\n  If I have not used all my time, I yield whatever I have to the \ndistinguished floor manager, the Senator from Wyoming. I thank the \nSenate for the time given me this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for up to \n15 minutes.\n\n\n      THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it seems as if we can take all kinds of \ntime on the Senate floor--hours, days--talking about how we are going \nto benefit the richest people in America, many of whom inherited their \nwealth. After all, that is what estates are; they are wealth that is \npassed on from one generation to another. I do not have anything \nagainst that, but it seems to me we spend an undue amount of time \ntalking about how we are going to help the richest, most well-off \npeople in our country, who, by and large, can pretty well take care of \nthemselves.\n  So I am going to diverge a little bit because I want to talk about a \ngroup of individuals in this country who do not fall into that Fortune \n500 or 400 or whatever it is--the Forbes 400--people who have the big \nestates. I want to talk about a group of people who have been \ndiscriminated against in our society for far too long and with whom we \nin Congress had made a pact 10 years ago and President George Bush \nsigned into law the Americans with Disabilities Act to say that we, as \na nation, are no longer going to tolerate discrimination against any \nindividual in this country because of his or her disability.\n  July 26--a couple weeks from now--will mark the 10th anniversary of \nthe signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. As those of us who \nworked so hard for the ADA predicted, the act has taken its place among \nthe great civil rights laws in our history. On July 26, 1990, we, as a \ncountry, committed ourselves to the principle that a disability in no \nway diminishes a person's right to participate in the cultural, \neconomic, educational, political, and social mainstream.\n  By eliminating barriers everywhere--from education to health care, \nfrom streets to public transportation, from parks to shopping malls, \nand from courthouses to Congress--the ADA has opened up new worlds to \npeople with disabilities. People with disabilities are participating \nmore and more in their communities, living fuller lives as students, \ncoworkers, taxpayers, consumers, voters, and neighbors.\n  As part of the anniversary celebration--the 10th anniversary of the \nsigning of the Americans with Disabilities Act--I recently announced \nthe ``A Day in the Life of the ADA'' campaign. I am asking people \nacross the country to send stories about how their lives are different \nbecause of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We are going to be \nusing these stories to celebrate our accomplishments and to learn more \nabout what we still must do to give all Americans an equal opportunity \nto live out the American dream of independence. We already have \nreceived many\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\nwonderful stories that show how the ADA is changing the face of \nAmerica. I look forward to receiving many more.\n  I ask the people to either send these stories by e-mail to \nadastories@harkin.senate.gov or send them to ``A Day in the Life of the \nADA,'' c/o Senator Tom Harkin, 731 Hart Senate Office Building, \nWashington, DC, 20510.\n  We want to tell these great stories in the celebration that will take \nplace on July 26. There will be ceremonies at the White House. We will \ntake time here in the Congress to talk more about the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, what it is, what it was meant to do, and what it has \naccomplished.\n\n  The ``A Day in the Life of the ADA'' campaign will create a \nhistorical record of the profound impact the ADA has had on the daily \nlife of people with disabilities. I will share with you a couple \nstories I have already received.\n  I spoke with a woman in Des Moines, IA, who told me that not only had \nthe ADA helped her son, who has a disability, get a job working at a \nrestaurant, but that because of the fact he has that job he has become \na role model for other kids with disabilities, to show them that they, \ntoo, can get jobs and work.\n  I recently met and spoke with Theresa Uchytil from Urbandale, IA. \nTheresa is this year's Miss Iowa and hopefully will be next year's Miss \nAmerica. She was born without a left hand. She told me that the ADA has \ngiven her and other people with disabilities confidence to pursue their \nown dreams.\n  I received a letter from a woman in Waukegan, IL, who is blind, who \nwrote:\n\n       The ADA has allowed me to receive my bank statements in \n     braille. This might seem like a small victory to some. \n     Obviously such people have never been denied the ability to \n     read something so personal as a bank statement.\n\n  I heard from a man in Greenbelt, MD, just outside Washington, DC, who \nis deaf. I will quote him. He said:\n\n       When I turn on the TV in the morning, I can watch captions \n     and public service announcements because of the ADA. When I \n     go to work and make phone calls, I use the telecommunication \n     relay services enacted by the ADA. In the afternoon I go to \n     the doctor's office and am able to communicate with my doctor \n     because the ADA has required the presence of a sign language \n     interpreter. After the doctor's office, I decide to go \n     shopping and am able to find a TTY (as required by the ADA) \n     in the mall to call my family and let them know that I will \n     be a bit late in arriving home. . . . In short, the ADA has \n     had a major impact on almost every facet of my life.\n\n  I heard from a man in Berkeley, CA, who has cerebral palsy and uses a \nwheelchair. He said:\n\n       The ADA has made me able to live independently. I can now \n     get into most every restaurant, movie theater or public \n     place. The ADA has put me on a level playing ground with the \n     rest of society. I realize that if I had been born any other \n     time before I was, I would not be able to lead the life I do. \n     I am going back to school in the fall. I hope to educate \n     people by either being a teacher or a lawyer. I do not think \n     that this would have been possible without the ADA.\n\n  These are only a few of the many stories we are receiving. I \nencourage others to send in their stories, again, to create a \nhistorical record of the profound impact the ADA has had on the daily \nlives of people with disabilities, their families and friends, and \nevery American. I encourage everyone to share their stories, their \nfamily stories, about how the ADA has improved their lives.\n  For example, I would like to have stories about how the ADA has \neliminated segregation in education and health care and the workplace, \nhow the ADA has increased the accessibility of schools and colleges and \ngovernment and the workplace for people with disabilities. I would like \nto hear stories about how the ADA has made it possible for people with \nand without disabilities to enjoy the smaller things that many of us \ntake for granted--going out to a birthday party dinner as a \nfamily, going to a movie with a friend, a loved one, or a family \nmember, going to a museum with friends on a Sunday afternoon, or just \nplain going out to the grocery store to shop for groceries.\n\n  The ADA has improved people's lives. I need stories that show how the \nADA has improved people's lives in any other way, maybe some I have not \neven thought about.\n  We will share these stories to show how the ADA has benefited people \nwith disabilities and how it has benefited all of American society--by \nintegrating and pulling people from all walks of life into every facet \nof our lives in America: in education, in the workplace, travel and \ntransportation, and government services.\n  Again, during this time of debate on the estate tax bill, and what we \nare going to do to help some of the richest people in America, I want \nto take this time to let people know there are a lot of Americans out \nthere who, because of what we did 10 years ago in passing the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, are leading fuller, richer, more independent \nlives.\n  We celebrate that this year on the 10th anniversary on July 26. I ask \neveryone to help build this record of the ADA successes, again, by \nsending their stories either by e-mail, at \nadastories@harkin.senate.gov, or ``A Day in the Life of the ADA,'' c/o \nSenator Tom Harkin, 731 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. \n20510.\n  By doing this, we will build a historical record. We will show how \nthe ADA has indeed made us a better country, how the ADA has made it \npossible for people from all walks of life, regardless of their \ndisability, to work, to travel, to enjoy their families and friends. \nThis is what we ought to be talking about in the Senate. This is what \nAmerica is about, not about helping the few at the top who already have \ntoo much but by helping those who have been discriminated against for \nso many years, shoved into nursing homes, into dark corners, \ndiscriminated against in every aspect of their lives, people with \ndisabilities, and how we as a society came together 10 years ago, \nRepublicans and Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion to say we are going \nto end this kind of discrimination once and for all.\n  That was one of the great bipartisan victories I have seen in my 24 \nyears in the Congress. These are the kinds of things we ought to be \ndebating and doing.\n  I take this time to encourage these stories to be sent in, so when \nJuly 26 rolls around and we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, we will have personal stories about \nhow it has helped people from all over the country.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the motion \nto proceed to H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. While this \nlegislation has long been one of my priorities as chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business, it is of critical concern to a \nsector of the United States economy that employs more than 27.5 million \npeople, generates over $3.6 million in sales, and has grown by 103 \npercent in the past four years. That sector is women-owned businesses.\n  As one of the fastest growing segments of the economy, women-owned \nsmall businesses are essential to America's future prosperity. In \nrecognition of this growth and their contribution to our economic life, \nI led a bipartisan group of policy makers last month to convene the \nNational Women's Small Business Summit, New Leaders for a New Century, \nin Kansas City, Missouri. With the support of Senators Kerry, \nFeinstein, Hutchison, Snowe, and Landrieu, we set out, through this \nsummit, to listen to women-owned small-business owners. Our goal was to \nelicit their views, concerns, and policy recommendations on the \nobstacles that women entrepreneurs face every day as they strive to run \nsuccessful businesses.\n  One issue that we heard loud and clear was that the ``death tax'' has \nto go. In fact, repeal of the estate tax was the number one tax \npriority identified by the summit participants. So it is particularly \ntimely that the Senate is considering this crucial legislation that \nwill eliminate a tax that discourages hard work and innovation rather \nthan encouraging and rewarding it.\n  Mr. President, I believe we can now agree on both sides of the aisle \nthat the estate tax is highly detrimental to small and family-owned \nbusinesses and farms in this country. Indeed, according to recent \nfindings, the estates of self-employed Americans are four times more \nlikely to be subject to the estate tax than Americans who work for \nsomeone else. In addition, because owners of small businesses do not \nknow when they will owe the estate tax or, consequently, how much they \nwill owe, the tax exacts excessively high compliance costs.\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\n  For example a June 1999 survey by the Center for the Study of \nTaxation found that eight of ten family-owned business reported taking \nsteps, such as estate planning, to minimize the effect of this tax. \nMoreover, the Upstate New York survey revealed that the average \nspending on estate planning was almost $125,000 per business. \nSimilarly, a survey by the National Association of Women Business \nowners found that the estate tax imposed almost $60,000 in estate-tax-\nrelated costs on women business owners.\n  These costs translate into thousands of dollars of valuable capital \nthat women-owned businesses are pouring down the drain simply to ensure \nthat the estate tax does not become the grim reaper for their \nbusinesses. And if anyone thinks that wasting these funds is not \nimportant, they should note carefully that access to capital was the \nsecond most pressing issue area identified at the National Women's \nSmall Business Summit.\n  Mr. President, compliance costs pertaining to the death tax also \ndirectly affect the availability of jobs. In the Upstate New York \nsurvey, an estimated 14 jobs per business have been lost because of the \ncost of Federal estate-tax planning to those same businesses. A study \nby Douglas Holtz-Eakin found that the estate tax caused an annual 3 \npercent reduction in desired hiring by sole proprietors. A 1995 Gallup \npoll also found that three out of five businesses would add more jobs \nover the coming year if the estate tax were eliminated.\n  If nothing else, this legislation boils down to one simple issue--\njobs! Small businesses are the top job creator in this country, and the \ndeath tax is sending those jobs to the grave. Existing businesses are \nnot hiring as many workers because of estate-planning costs, and when \nthe owner dies, this tax can cause the business to be liquidated just \nto pay the government. And when those doors close, they close hard and \nfast on the jobs that the business provided in our local communities. \nThat is a reality we simply cannot ignore or allow to be concealed by \nerroneous claims that repealing the death tax is just a tax cut for \n``the rich.''\n  Mr. President, the cost of the estate tax is high not only for small \nbusiness owners, but for those seeking employment and for the overall \neconomy. It is time that those costs are eliminated by repealing the \nestate tax once and for all. I urge my colleagues to support the motion \nto proceed and the underlying legislation for the continued success of \nAmerica's women-owned businesses and the jobs they create.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the estate tax better \nknown as the ``death tax'' is an onerous tax that should be eliminated. \nA recent poll revealed that 77 percent of the voters believe that the \ntax is unfair.\n  This tax is slowly destroying family businesses by slowing growth. \nAnd it's unfair that families who have worked their entire lives to \nbuild a successful family farm or business should be penalized.\n  Individuals who look forward to leaving something behind for their \nchildren should not be punished by confiscatory, anti-family taxes.\n  In fact, after years or even generations, children are often forced \nto sell the family farm or business just to pay the tax. This is both \nunfair and unconscionable.\n  However, not only is it the children who must suffer the loss of the \nfamily business, but the workers and their children who suffer when \nthey lose their job because the business they've been working at is \nliquidated to pay the death tax.\n  But it doesn't stop there. The local community, particularly small \ntowns suffers as well because their customers can no longer afford to \nbuy their products after having lost their job.\n  The estate tax is outdated, it raises little money, and it imposes a \nlarge cost on the economy.\n  In 1999 the estate tax generated about $24 billion. However, it is \nestimated that administrative costs to enforce the tax are over $36 \nbillion.\n  A recent analysis by the Heritage Foundation, found that the U.S. \neconomy would average nearly $11 billion per year in additional output.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers states that 40 percent of \nits members had spent more than $100,000 on attorney and consultant \nfees related to death tax planning. In addition 3 out of 5 members pay \nat least $25,000 a year to prepare for the death tax.\n  A 1998 study by the Joint Economic Committee found that if the death \ntax was repealed, as many as 240,000 jobs would be created and \nAmericans would have an additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal \nincome.\n  A February 2000 study by the National Assoc. of Women found that the \ndeath tax has a negative impact on female entrepreneurs.\n  According to the study, business owners found that female \nentrepreneurs spent on average nearly $60,000 on death-tax planning.\n  Some have argued that it is the rich who benefit from eliminating \nthis tax. Mr. President, the wealthy and powerful, including many in \nthis body, who can afford high priced legal and financial advise to \navoid the taxes.\n  Therefore, who's left holding the bag but the middle-class.\n  This tax is unfair and it is anti-family. We must repeal this tax \nnow. Mr. President, I urge passage of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have to conclude by 11:30. If Senator \nLautenberg is prepared to take his time now, then we will pick up the \nremainder with the last speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, may I ask what the parliamentary \nsituation is regarding the time allocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was allotted the remainder of the \nDemocratic time, which is 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are going to take a couple of \nminutes to develop our opposition comments regarding the elimination of \nthe inheritance tax. The repeal of it is an interesting prospect but \nnot one that has much merit. My strong opposition to the ultimate \nrepeal of the inheritance tax will be obvious with my comments.\n  This legislation would provide a huge windfall to a handful of very \nwealthy individuals at the direct expense of ordinary, hard-working \nAmericans.\n  Without meaning to brag, I had a successful business operation before \nI came here. I was chairman and CEO of a very large company with over \n16,000 employees, a company that I began with two other fellows from my \nhome city of Paterson, NJ--a mill town with a great industrial past, at \nthe time I was growing up there, but with a dismal current situation--\nthe three of us, by dint of hard work. My parents and the parents of \nthe two brothers with whom I was associated were all immigrants. My \nparents were brought as infants by my grandparents, and my colleagues' \nparents came at a later date and time in their lives. We were poor.\n  I just retraced these roots with a newspaper because I am in the \nprocess of ending my Senate career come January 2001. We were very \nsuccessful. That company we started without anything today employs \n33,000 people. It is one of America's leading examples of what happens \nwhen there is hard work and initiative and there is creativity in this \ngreat country of ours.\n  I am one of those people who will fit in the 2 percent who are going \nto be principally affected by the reduction and ultimate elimination of \nthe inheritance tax. I have four children. I am a proud grandfather. I \nhave seven grandchildren, the oldest of whom is 6.\n  When I am called upon to ascend to a different place, there is going \nto be an estate. My children have never said to me: Dad, you have to \nget rid of the inheritance tax, or, Dad, make sure we are well taken \ncare of. They have had a decent life.\n  I stand here to say, yes, my estate is going to pay a lot of tax when \nI go, a lot of tax. It is OK; it is all right with me. It has to be all \nright with my children.\n  Talking about the three of us who ran the company ADP, we succeeded \nin this country not just because we were willing to work hard and we \nhad some smarts and we did the right thing. We were made successful \nbecause of the resources available in this country. We were made \nsuccessful because lots of people who struggled to make a living and \nsupport their families did the work\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nthey had to. We were made successful because this great land in which \nwe live provided the opportunity.\n  We could be just as clever and just as hard working in lots of other \nplaces around the world, but we never could have accumulated the \nresources we had. Neither could Mr. Gates or the other people now \nalmost legendary multibillionaires. They couldn't have done it without \nlots of little people, lots of people doing the scut work, doing the \nhard labor, or using their brains that were developed by investments \nthrough our society, through this Government, helping to develop \nschools that would cultivate the thinking and the creativity that went \ninto making their contribution. A lot of them, as was true in my own \ncompany, got rewarded, but they were not in the $20 million estate \ngroup or even higher. They weren't in the number 374 with an average \namount of assets of $52 million.\n  They are not in that group. The group isn't very large, but it is \nvery powerful. This group is very powerful. When they speak, everybody \nhere listens--just about. They hear from the leaders of these \ncompanies. They hear from the people who bought the boats, the private \nyachts, and the airplanes. Now there is almost a contest within our \nsociety--and I know some of these folks--about who can build the \nbiggest yacht. They are up to over 300 feet now. That is the largest \nprivate yacht sailing the seas. It has a crew of almost 50 people. I \ndon't know what is going to happen to that man's estate, but I don't \nthink he deserves to have that estate protected without acknowledging \nthe fact that he owes something back to this society. He has an \nobligation--his estate has an obligation to make sure something remains \nso there can be other entrepreneurs, business leaders, scientists, and \nphysicians created, to make sure this country is able to carry on.\n  Part of what is in the basic ethic of this Nation of ours--and it \ngoes back to its founding days--is hard work; do your share. I used to \nhear in my household from my grandmother that you had to ``leave \nsomething over for those who need help.'' You could not just take it \nand walk away. What is going to happen to that work ethic?\n  Bill Gates is worth, they say, somewhere around $100 billion. I don't \nknow him personally, but I hear he is a real good guy, very \nphilanthropic. He gives away a lot of money to very noble causes. But \nif he chose to say, look, my estate will pay the 55-percent tax, that \nwill leave, by my calculation, $40 billion or $60 billion to be divided \namong his children. I don't hold him out to be evil or the devil. I use \nthe arithmetic description to try to make the point; it is to make the \npoint that we ought to be very careful.\n  None of us like taxes. I don't like them. But I know they are \nnecessary. If you want to belong to ``Country Club America,'' you have \nto pay the dues--especially if you succeed, as only you can in this \ncountry of ours because of the resources that are here. Some of them \nare natural resources. We have a wonderful location and the ability to \nship goods from our oceans. This is one incredible place. Boy, are you \nlucky to belong to ``Country Club America.'' But I think it is \nnecessary to pay your dues. I think it is necessary for me to pay dues. \nI think it is necessary for my estate to pay dues. My estate will be \nassessed at the high rate. It is not going to leave my kids poverty \nstricken, nor is it going to leave the 346 wealthiest people who will \nleave estates at $52 million poverty stricken.\n  I don't even think the heirs to estates of from $10 million to $20 \nmillion--there are 688 of them and they will pay $3.7 million in \ntaxes--will be impoverished. We are looking at estates of from $5 \nmillion to $10 million. There are roughly 1,800 of them. Those estate \ntaxes will be $1.9 million. That leaves $4 million to the \nbeneficiaries. That doesn't sound like impoverishment.\n  Look at what the picture is. On this chart, we have the 374 largest \nestates. If the Republican tax plan goes through, they will save $11.8 \nmillion each. That is just 374 estates. And roughly 300,000 estates \nwill pay zero estate tax.\n  Is that fair? That is the question. Is it fair that we take such good \ncare of people who have a $50 million estate, on average? And some are \nsubstantially larger. Where is the conscience here? Roughly, 2 percent \nof the people in the country have estates that pay any tax at all. Out \nof the 2.3 million, only 2 percent have any inheritance tax at all. \nMost people don't leave estates that hit inheritance tax levels. They \ndon't pay taxes. By the way, all through this successful person's \nlifetime--and some are successful because they pick the right father--\nthose estates pay a very small portion of the inheritance tax revenues. \nBut we want to reduce the portion that they do.\n\n  All of the rest of the people in America, the people who work hard \nand try to provide for their kids, the people who try to educate their \nchildren so they can go on and succeed in their own right, they don't \npay any estate tax because before you must pay estate taxes, you have \nquite a hurdle to get over.\n  Also, for the benefit of those considering this, let's remember that \nif it is a husband and a wife in a family, that family can give $20,000 \na year to each child. If they have three kids, they can give $60,000 to \nthose kids. The wealthy people we are talking about can do that. They \ncan give $60,000 to those children, and if it is a 20-year lifetime, \nyou are talking about $1.2 million that you can give away absolutely \ntax free. You can do that to lots of people. They don't have to be your \nkids. They can be your friends, your neighbors, or distant relatives. \nYou can give a lot of money away in a lifetime. Then you get a $1.3 \nmillion exemption before you start paying any tax at all. So we are \nlooking at a tax that is not fair.\n  This Nation has its taxes structured on the basis of graduated \nincomes, and you pay higher taxes. We have had tax reductions. Now, \ncapital gains is 20 percent. The maximum rate we have on income is 39 \npercent. I am always willing to look at ways to reduce that.\n  Frankly, I think maybe one of the things we ought to consider--and I \nhaven't run the costs on it--is to say that for people over 65 we even \nstart reducing that 20 percent. Maybe by the time somebody is 70, there \nwould be no capital gains tax, and maybe that will stimulate their \ninvestments into the economy and charities--the amount of money given \nphilanthropically--because there is a pebble in the shoe, and also a \ngenerosity of spirit. Some people say they would rather give it to a \nuniversity, a hospital, or a library, than just leave it out there to \nbe taxed. That is a good idea. I know very few people who have these \nbig fortunes who don't do a lot philanthropically. I also know some \npeople who are in the multibillions of dollars worth of estates who \nhave said they are not going to leave anything to their kids, that they \nwill have given them their head start in a lifetime.\n  I see that the Chair is poised to strike the gavel. I thank you for \nthe time I have had. I hope we are mindful of the public reaction. \nTaking care of the rich is not an obligation in which we have to \nspecialize.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on this side, I believe we have 17 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). There are 16 minutes 35 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to both \nSenators from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of this \nbill. There is no question that what the Senator from New Jersey has \njust said has some resonance when you talk about paying dues to \nsociety. But this is not money that has never been taxed before. This \nis money that was taxed when it was earned. It is money that was taxed \nwhen it was invested. It has been taxed and taxed and taxed. Who could \nsay that an average family who now pays 40 percent of their income in \ntaxes is not giving back enough to society?\n\n  On top of all of the taxes they paid on this money, now we are saying \nwe want to change the American dream, which has always been to come to \nour country--come to America where you have the freedom to work as hard \nas you want to work, do as well as you want to do, and give your kids a \nbetter chance than you have. That is what the American dream has always \nbeen. Those who are against this tax are saying: No, no. That is not \nthe American\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\ndream anymore. What we are saying in America is come to America and you \ncan be this successful, and as long as you don't go beyond this, it is \nOK.\n  We should not put boundaries on success in America. That built our \ncountry. Hard work of people who are judged on what they are and not on \nwho their grandparents were is what has built this country.\n  The estate tax takes away part of the incentive for people who work \nso hard to give their kids a better chance than they had.\n  It hurts small business. Seventy percent of all family-owned \nbusinesses do not survive through the second generation, and 87 percent \ndon't make it to the third generation. That affects the small business \nitself, but it affects a lot of people who have jobs in those small \nbusinesses. It is the little people who are getting hurt because they \ndon't have jobs anymore.\n  I have read stories where the main employer in a small town had a \nfamily-owned business and could not make it because they had to sell \nthe assets of the business in order to pay inheritance taxes.\n  Among a survey of black-owned enterprises, nearly one-third say their \nheirs will have to sell the businesses to pay the death tax, and more \nthan 80 percent report they do not have sufficient assets to pay the \ndeath tax. In fact, the president and CEO of the National Black Chamber \nof Commerce has written a letter in support of this bill because he \nsays the total net worth of African Americans is only 1.2 percent \nversus 14 percent of the population.\n  The CEO of the National Black Chamber of Commerce supports the bill \nbefore us today. He said African Americans have been stuck at 1.2 \npercent of the total net worth of this country since the end of the \nCivil War in 1865, and that getting rid of the death tax will start to \ncreate a new legacy and begin a cycle of wealth building for blacks in \nthis country.\n  The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce supports the bill before us \ntoday. They write: When one family loses its business due to the unfair \nestate tax, which really is a death tax, the face of an entire \ncommunity changes. Employers become ex-employers. The economy suffers \nand a thriving self-supporting group of individuals vanish.\n  This is a gut issue for small businesses in our country.\n  The reason is that the assets of a small business are not readily \nsellable. The assets of a farm and a ranch are oftentimes valued at \nmuch more than their actual productivity. So if they have to have a \nvaluation that puts them in the category of needing to pay an estate \ntax, they have no choice; they have to sell the land in order to pay \nthat tax.\n  It is not right. It is not perpetuating the American dream.\n  Let me talk about conservation and the effect of the death tax on \nconservation. This is an article published in the Dallas Morning News, \nwritten by David Langford of San Antonio, the executive vice president \nof the Texas Wildlife Association. He says it so much better than I \never could.\n       Since 1851, my family has worked the land in the Texas Hill \n     Country. Through the ups and downs of the past 148 years, we \n     have run flour mills, farmed, ranched and offered hunting and \n     fishing opportunities.\n       Our land also serves as a habitat for many species of \n     birds, including two endangered migratory songbirds--the \n     golden-cheeked warbler and the black-capped vireo. As a \n     result, my family and I consider ourselves stewards of \n     precious natural resources.\n       But as is the case for much of the wildlife habitat in this \n     country, the estate tax threatens to tear it apart. The need \n     to pay large estate tax bills often forces families to sell \n     or develop environmentally sensitive land. The estate tax is \n     the No. 1 destroyer of wildlife habitat in this country.\n       Although we have managed to hold our land together, it \n     hasn't been easy. Before my mother died in 1993, we did \n     everything we could to protect our family's land. Like \n     millions of other family businesses, we paid accountants, tax \n     attorneys and estate planners to help manage our assets in \n     ways to avoid the tax, but it still came to this.\n       In order to pay the estate taxes and keep the land together \n     when my mother died, we had to sell almost everything she \n     owned, including her home. My wife and I had to sell nearly \n     everything we owned, including our home, and move into a two-\n     bedroom condominium. We also had to borrow money for 35 years \n     from the Federal Land Bank.\n       Because the value of the land has increased since 1993, if \n     we were killed in a car accident tomorrow, my children would \n     owe more inheritance taxes than the amount I originally had \n     to borrow to pay mine. But that isn't the end of the story. \n     Not only would they pay more taxes than me, but they still \n     would inherit my 35-year note that they would have to \n     continue to pay.\n       Could my children then keep the land? The short answer is \n     no. It probably would become a subdivision.\n\n  Mr. President, these are people whom I hear the other side keep \ncalling ``rich,'' needing to pay their debt to society. These are \npeople who care so much about the land that has been in their families \nsince 1851 that they now live in a two-bedroom condominium to keep that \nland together.\n  That is not the American way. That is not right in this country. It \nis not good for the environment. It is not good for conservation. It is \nnot good for small businesses that create jobs. And it doesn't produce \n1 percent of the revenue of this country.\n  It sends a powerful message that you can only succeed in America this \nmuch, and if you have this much, we will take part of what you have \nworked so hard to earn, what your parents and grandparents may have \nworked so hard to give you, and we are going to say, I'm sorry, you've \ndone too much.\n  Mr. President, that is not the American dream. I agree with the U.S. \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce; I agree with the U.S. Black Chamber of \nCommerce. They want the opportunity for their members to create a \nstability through the generations for their families. I stand with the \npeople who want to keep their land together, to keep a tradition in \ntheir families. That is the American way. I hope we will send this bill \nto the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this has been a great debate. I count \nmyself privileged to have the opportunity to close it.\n  I am proud of my colleague from Texas. If Members were not moved by \nthe story the Senator portrayed, of people being forced to sacrifice \ntheir homes to keep their family farm together, then they don't have a \nheart and they don't care about the values that at least I consider to \nbe the underpinnings of America.\n  No issue better defines the difference between the two great \npolitical parties than this issue. I am prepared to have every election \nin American history determined on this issue and this issue alone. The \nissue is very simple. People work their whole lives, they pay taxes on \nevery dollar they earn; they scrimp, they save, they sacrifice, and \nthey build up a business or they build up a family farm, and, when they \ndie, they pass that business or that farm on to their children. In \nfact, that is the reason many people work and sacrifice.\n  My mama didn't graduate from high school, but she had a dream I was \ngoing to college. She sacrificed her whole life to achieve that dream. \nWe don't believe that, when people have worked a lifetime to build up a \nfamily farm, or family business, or family assets, that their children \nought to have to sell off their parents' life's work to give the \nGovernment up to 55 cents out of every dollar of everything they have \naccumulated in their lives. We think it is fundamentally wrong. We \nthink it is un-American. And we believe it ought to end.\n  When we cut through all the political rhetoric of everything our \nDemocrat colleagues have said in this debate, their reasons for \nopposing repeal of the death tax come down to two arguments. The first \nargument is, force people to sell off that family business, force them \nto sell that family farm, force them to sell off the lifework of their \nparents because Government can spend the money better.\n  We reject that. We believe that is a clear indication that somehow \nthe opponents of repeal don't understand what America is really about. \nThose of us who favor repeal of the death tax don't believe Government \ncan spend that money better. And we don't think it is right to take it \nfrom the people who built those assets up.\n  The second argument our Democrat colleagues make in opposition to \nrepealing the death tax is that repeal would help rich people. When we \nreduce this argument down, it is an argument that the Government ought \nto level families, that somehow if a person were born in a family that \nowned a family business or family farm, that is not fair--the fact that \nyour parents sacrificed and worked and scrimped to\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nbuild it, it is still not fair for you have it, and at least part of it \nought to be taken away from you.\n  Let me explain why I reject this logic. First of all, the only thing \nI have ever been bequeathed or expect to be bequeathed was, when my \ngrandmama's brother, my great uncle Bill, died, he left me a cardboard \nsuitcase full of sports clippings. Had it been baseball cards, I would \nbe a rich man today.\n  The family of our agriculture commissioner in Texas, a lady named \nSusan Combs, owned a ranch that had been in the family for four \ngenerations. When her father died, she was forced to sell off part of \nthat ranch to pay death taxes. Now our Democrat colleagues would have \nus believe that is good because that levels society.\n  How did it help me? How did making Susan Combs sell off ranchland \nthat her family had owned for four generations help me because my \nfamily didn't own a ranch or didn't own a business? I cannot see how I \nwas helped, or how my children are helped. How does tearing down one \nfamily help build up another? How does destroying the life dream of one \nfamily build a life dream for another family? We do not believe it \ndoes. We think this is fundamentally wrong.\n\n  Granted, some rich people may benefit. But so will a lot more people \nwho are not rich. I do not have any inherent objection to people being \nrich. If they didn't steal the money, if they worked hard for it, if \nthey created jobs for people from families like I am from and they \nbenefited from it, that is what America is about. I do not have a hate \nfor rich people. I do not understand our Democrat colleagues who say \nthey love capitalism but seem to hate capitalists, who claim to love \nprogress but appear to harbor a distaste for the people who create it. \nWe do not believe we can build up America by tearing down families. We \nbelieve we can build up America by giving people a chance to compete \nand use their God-given talents. But we don't want people to have to \nsell off their farm or sell off their business to give Government a new \ntax on money that has already been taxed. We do not think death ought \nto be a taxable event.\n  I congratulate those who have been involved in this debate. I think \nit is a good debate. I think it is a debate that defines what we stand \nfor and what our Democrat colleagues stand for. We believe when you \nwork a lifetime to build up a business or a family farm, it ought to be \nyours for keeps. If we are successful, we are going to kill the death \ntax--yes, you will still have to pay taxes on any gain if the business \nor farm is sold--but when you build up a family farm or build up a \nfamily business, it is yours for keeps. When you die, the people you \nbuilt it for, your children, are going to get it. If you want to give \nit away, if you want to donate it to Texas A, that is God's work; or \nif you want to contribute it to trying to cure cancer, but you ought to \nget to decide how it is disposed of, not the Federal Government, not \nsome bureaucrat at the IRS, and not some politician in Congress. That \nis what this debate is about. It is an important debate. I urge my \ncolleagues, when we cast our votes on this bill, to vote to kill the \ndeath tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/12/senate-section/article/S6497-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 8\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to H.R. 8 at the conclusion of morning votes on Thursday and it \nbe considered under the following agreement:\n  That there be up to 10 amendments for each leader, with one of the 10 \namendments for the minority leader described as the ``Democratic \nalternative'';\n  That no more than 20 amendments be in order, they be first-degree \namendments only and limited to 40 minutes equally divided in the usual \nform, with the exception of the Democratic alternative, which would be \nlimited to 2 hours equally divided, and an additional 90 minutes for \neach leader to be used at their discretion.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following disposition of the \namendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, \nall without any intervening action or debate.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that either leader be able to make \nthis agreement null and void at any time during the consideration of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this has been very delicately developed with \na lot of careful consideration and very aggressive work with our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I know Senator Daschle has \nSenators who have tax amendments they would like to offer.\n  I should emphasis that this is not the last effort to try to make our \nTax Code fairer this year. We will have the reconciliation bill that \nwill involve marriage penalty tax elimination, and obviously tax \namendments would be offered in that area. We still have legislation \nthat would eliminate the Spanish American telephone tax, which we \nprobably can't get to until the first of September. But it is something \nwe should eliminate. Obviously, there will be an opportunity for \nadditional tax-related amendments to be offered to these two.\n  There may be a number of amendments on both sides that Senators would \nlike to offer that maybe cannot be included in this type of agreement. \nBut this is not the last train out of Dodge, thank goodness. We will \nhave other opportunities to develop a fairer Tax Code, and Senators \nwill have an opportunity on both sides to offer amendments.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for his effort. I did not want us to just get \nto a cloture vote which might or might not pass. But if it failed, we \nwould get no result.\n  I think the death tax needs to be eliminated. It needs to be phased \nout. There may be some modifications in the bill as we go forward. But \na result is what we should always seek for the American people--not \njust a show vote. This could get us to that point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, while the majority leader and I have \nprofound differences of opinion with regard to the estate tax and what \nto do with estate tax policy, I have been very appreciative of his \nwillingness to work with us to accommodate the opportunity for Senators \nto offer amendments, which is what this agreement will allow.\n  This is a fair agreement. This isn't everything that our caucus or \nour colleagues have indicated they would like. There are far more \namendments than this agreement will allow. But I underscore a comment \njust made by the majority leader. This is not going to be the last word \non tax policy in this session of Congress. There will be other \nopportunities. I will do my utmost to accommodate Senators who have \namendments they want to offer, if they are not going to be offered as \npart of this agreement.\n  I thank all of my caucus for their willingness to accommodate this \nagreement and for the opportunity to work through a very difficult set \nof procedural circumstances. This is far better than the old way that \nwe were likely to be subscribing to, which is a cloture vote denying \namendments of any kind, and maybe even denying an ultimate result. This \nwill allow an ultimate result.\n  I hope we can have a good debate. I hope we can deal with these \nissues in a way that will afford us a real opportunity to consider \nalternatives. I think this agreement allows that.\n  I appreciate very much the majority leader's willingness to work with \nus. I appreciate especially the indulgence and the cooperation of all \nmembers of the Democratic caucus.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/12/senate-section/article/S6497-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6497-S6498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 3185\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

One very positive outcome of the storm is the way in which the \npeople in Minnesota have come together.\n  I thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd for accepting this amendment. \nIt would restore about $7.2 million needed in emergency funding. It is \ncritically important, and I thank my colleagues for their support. \nPeople in northern Minnesota will appreciate their support as well.\n  I say to Senator Grams, I have to leave the floor soon, but I also \nsupport the amendment he is introducing. I have another engagement. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor on that amendment with my colleague.\n  It is my understanding this amendment will be approved. I wonder \nwhether we could now voice vote it.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I think we want to let the other Senator \nfrom Minnesota speak.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am sorry.\n  Mr. GORTON. The managers are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I join with Senator Wellstone to speak \nabout the urgent need for cleanup and fire threat reduction funding in \nnorthern Minnesota. I first want to thank Senator Gorton for his \nwillingness to work with me on this crucial issue for our state.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I've been working with my colleagues \nin the Senate, including Senator Wellstone, Senator Gorton and Senator \nStevens, for months to ensure that this crucial funding would be \navailable for the Superior and Chippewa National Forests. I've made my \nrequest repeatedly, in both letters and\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\nin conversations with the Appropriations Committee and the Senate \nLeadership. My colleagues on the Appropriations Committee gave me their \nassurance that the needs of Minnesota would be met.\n  I just returned from hearing over five hours of testimony in northern \nMinnesota on last year's storm and its dramatic aftermath. Regardless \nof political affiliation or the specific interests of those testifying, \neveryone agreed that the most crucial need in northern Minnesota was \nthe reduction of the tremendous amount of downed timber scattered \nacross the Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area \nWilderness. Right now, there are over 450,000 forested acres in \nnorthern Minnesota upon which lie millions of broken, dead or dying \ntrees. Right now, those downed trees pose a fire threat that the Forest \nService cannot model. If they're not first burned in a catastrophic \nfire, many of those trees will become ridden with disease, creating \nanother threat for nearby forested areas that weren't impacted by the \nstorm.\n  While much of the area most impacted by this storm lies within a \nfederally designated wilderness area, the region is also known for its \nmany homes and resorts and for the diversity of recreational activity \nit offers. Most importantly for those of us who represent the area is \nthe protection of the lives and property of those who live in and visit \nthis wonderful area of Minnesota. That's why I've insisted that there's \nan immediate need to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire and provide \nthe Forest Service with the funding it needs to conduct cleanup and \nfire threat mitigation efforts.\n  I want to take a moment to address the process through which we \narrived at this point. As I said earlier, I've been working with the \nAppropriations Committee for a number of months to secure this \nimportant funding. I first wrote to Senator Stevens on March 15th \nseeking emergency funding in a supplemental appropriations bill for \ncleanup activities this year. I then wrote to Senator Gorton on April \n12 asking that he include $9.249 million in emergency funding to \naddress the pressing needs of the Superior and Chippewa National \nForests. When the Agriculture Appropriations bill passed through the \nAppropriations Committee, I was pleased that my request had been \napproved and would soon be before the full Senate. And finally, when \nthe Military Construction Conference Report was brought out of \ncommittee, we were successful in getting a $2 million down payment on \nthe $9.249 million and a commitment that the remainder would soon \nfollow in either the Interior bill or in the Agriculture bill. As I \nsaid earlier, the agreement reached today between Senators Gorton, \nByrd, Wellstone and me fulfills the commitment I received almost two \nweeks ago.\n  There have, however, been some suggestions that the funding we're \ndiscussing today had been approved in the House of Representatives and \nthen stripped out by the Senate. However, the House has never passed a \nsingle dime in emergency funding for northern Minnesota. I would also \nlike to address claims that the Senate had somehow stripped this money \nout and ignored the needs of northern Minnesota. I've been in almost \nconstant contact over the past few months with the Senate Leadership \nand with the Appropriations Committee. I have been assured repeatedly \nthat this money will be available for Minnesota and that the pressing \nneeds in this region of my State would be met no later than on the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill and hopefully on this bill. I'm \ngrateful that now those needs will be met, consistent with the previous \nassurances I had received.\n  I would also like to mention that this is not the end, but the \nbeginning of our efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of the \npeople who live in or visit northeastern Minnesota. Reducing the threat \nof fire, protecting human life and property, and ensuring the continued \neconomic viability of this region of our State should be our number one \npriority. I intend to see to it that those concerns are addressed by \nthe Federal Government in the coming weeks, months, and years.\n  To that end, I intend to secure, through an amendment I have already \nfiled, additional funding of $6.947 million for blow-down recovery and \nfire threat reduction efforts in northern Minnesota for fiscal year \n2001.\n  As, again, Senator Wellstone mentioned, he is joining me on this \namendment as well in support of this request. This money will provide \nthe Forest Service in northern Minnesota with the funding they need in \nthe coming fiscal year so that they can continue the cleanup efforts \nbeyond October of this year. This is a massive cleanup effort that will \ncost millions of dollars and will continue for years past fiscal year \n2001. I hope we can reach agreement with Senator Gorton and Senator \nByrd to accept this important amendment as soon as possible.\n  Again, I thank Senator Gorton, Senator Stevens, the staff of the \nAppropriations Committee, and Senator Wellstone for working with me for \nso many months to secure the funding needed to protect the lives and \nthe property of the people of northern Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Washington \nwhether we can voice vote my amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. I believe we are ready to take a voice vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3772) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington \nand my colleague from Minnesota for their help.\n  Mr. GORTON. We are working with the two Senators from Minnesota on a \nfollow-on amendment. I hope we will be in a position to accept that \nrelatively quickly.\n  Mr. President, two amendments were inadvertently left off the list \nfor consideration. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thomas' \namendment regarding a management study be included, and Senator \nLincoln's amendment on black liquor gasification be included under the \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we started with 112 amendments. We have \nadopted 1 and added 2, so we are now at 113. With that, the floor is \nopen. I believe the Senator from Michigan is here to speak on one of \nhis amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to talk with respect to one of the \namendments on that list of 113, one that I had planned to offer, which \nwould basically be an amendment that embodies a bill I introduced, S. \n2808, the purpose of which was to temporarily suspend the Federal \ngasoline tax for 150 days, while holding harmless the highway trust \nfund and protecting the Social Security trust fund.\n  Obviously, this is not the type of legislation that would normally be \nbrought on an appropriations bill. I have traveled throughout the State \nof Michigan in recent weeks where we are confronting gasoline prices \nthat are so high that the motorists in our State and people in \nindustries that depend on the purchase of gasoline and other fuels are \nup in arms at a level I don't believe I can ever remember.\n  Whether you are in the Abraham family, which owns a minivan and pays \n$50 to fill up the tank, or whether you are a family that has multiple \nminivans and fills up more than one tank a week, or whether you are a \nfarmer who has many needs in the production of agricultural commodities \nfor the use of motor vehicles and other machines that require oil and \nfuel, or whether you are in the automotive industry that depends on the \npurchase of SUVs, light trucks, and other American-made automobiles and \nmotor vehicles, or whether it is the tourism industry that requires \nreasonably priced gasoline in order to make sure that summer vacation \nplans are carried out--and tourism is an economic sector that remains \nstrong--regardless of your role in my State, you are very upset because \ntoday the price of gasoline in Michigan is almost 75 to 80 cents higher \nthan it was a year ago. In\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\nfact, this Monday, a national survey of gasoline prices indicated that \nin the city of Detroit, in the metropolitan area, we have the highest \ngasoline prices in America.\n  Something needs to be done about this. We have heard Senator \nMurkowski and others on the Energy Committee talk about a variety of \nlong-term strategies, ranging from the development of domestic energy, \nto addressing alternative energy sources, to conservation. We have \ntalked a little bit here about regulations that have increased the cost \nof fuel development. We have talked about it in the Senate and have \nheard about issues that range from whether or not the oil companies are \nin some sort of collusive effort and are gouging the consumers of \nAmerica.\n  We have heard all of these things. But the bottom line is, taking \naction in any of those areas will not dramatically change the price of \ngasoline in the short run. We may, if we develop more domestic energy \nsources, be in a better position to control production and supply and, \nas a consequence, price. We may, if we address certain regulations, \nmake it possible to change the price. But none of that is going to \nhappen overnight.\n  In my State and across the Midwest, and really across the entire \ncountry, people want action sooner, not later. There is only one thing \nwe can do as a Congress that will bring action sooner rather than later \nwith respect to the price of gasoline, and that is to temporarily \nsuspend the Federal tax on gasoline of 18.4 cents. Overnight, at every \nfilling station in America and every gas station, the price of gasoline \nwould theoretically come down by about 18 cents. Believe me, people \nwill show up to buy that less expensive gasoline.\n  In Michigan, just a few days ago, a gas station, having heard my plea \nto suspend the Federal gas tax, reduced the price of gasoline for 2 \nhours at that station in the Detroit metropolitan area by 18.4 cents. \nThere were lines of traffic a quarter mile virtually in every direction \nto get into that station because people who had been desperate to pay \nless for gasoline had the chance to do so--for 2 hours at least.\n  Our State's economy and the Nation's economy is being affected by \nthese high fuel costs. Recently, I conducted a hearing in Warren, MI. \nWe heard from people in the Michigan agricultural community who \nindicated to us that, according to their estimates--and, in fact, we \nheard from a family farmer himself who said they expect their net \nfamily farm income this year to be approximately 35 percent lower than \nit was projected to be. But we heard from people in the Michigan \nautomotive community who indicated that already they were beginning to \nsee indications of a shift from the purchase of new vehicles made in \nAmerica to the purchase of imported vehicles.\n  I think many of us remember back when we had energy problems in the \n1970s and we saw a shift away from American-manufactured vehicles to \nforeign imports, and what that did not just to the economy of Michigan \nor the auto industry but its rippling effect across the entire economy \nof this country.\n  We heard from others as well. We heard from consumers who came to \nthat hearing and talked about the impact on their families and the sort \nof things they could no longer afford to do.\n  It is not only people who came to the hearing that I heard from. Last \nweekend, I was up in Traverse City, MI, to participate in the annual \ncherry festival. I was confronted by a group calling themselves the \n``Traverse City Gas Can Gang.'' When I was walking in the parade, they \nwere imploring me, and virtually all other political figures present at \nthat parade, to do something about the gasoline tax because basically \nthey couldn't afford the price of gasoline.\n  I had a press conference in the city of Alpena, MI, and a lady senior \ncitizen attending the press conference told me she had to walk to the \npress conference. She was interested in what I had to say about gas \nprices. She walked because she couldn't afford to pay for gas in order \nto drive. She was not a young constituent. She was an elderly senior \ncitizen.\n  But I am not the only one confronting these kinds of constituents. \nThese high prices across America are substantially more than they were \na year ago. The metro Detroit area currently suffers under the highest \ngas prices in the country. Even though the price has come down from \napproximately $2 a gallon, it is still approximately $1.85 a gallon \nthis week. These prices are 40 cents a gallon higher than they were in \nMay of this year. That is a 27-percent increase in 2 months.\n  Of course, it is not in Michigan alone. Across the country people are \nconfronting the same kind of significant increases. In June of 1999 gas \nprices in my State averaged just over $1.13 a gallon in Detroit, $1.17 \na gallon throughout Michigan. One year later, gas prices were averaging \n$2.14 a gallon in Detroit, and just under $2.08 a gallon in the State \nof Michigan as a whole. That is almost a 90-percent rate of inflation \nfor gas in the State.\n  As I pointed out, former Soviet Republics don't suffer inflation this \naggravated. Even with the recent slight drop in gas prices, it is still \n56 percent higher this year than it was 1 year ago.\n  There are a lot of possible explanations. There are a lot of factors \nthat have come into play. This Congress and this Senate have a \nresponsibility to deal with the long-term issues. But we also have a \nresponsibility to provide relief in the short term, if we can. That is \nwhat can be accomplished if we were to temporarily suspend the Federal \ngas taxes. Eighteen cents a gallon would make a big difference to the \npeople in my State.\n  This is not insignificant. It is more than a 10-percent reduction in \nthe price of regular gasoline. For the typical one-car or one-minivan \nfamily, that would mean savings of $150 over the next 5 months. For \nthose who are in the trucking industry, of course it would reduce their \ndiesel prices by almost 25 cents a gallon. That would make a huge \ndifference for them in terms of their bottom line as well.\n  My proposal is designed to simultaneously reduce the price at the \npump and protect the road-funding dollars that many of our States, \nincluding certainly mine, are counting on from Washington. We would \nreplenish any lost revenue to the highway trust fund at the same time \nwe would suspend the gas tax.\n  As you know, we are confronting for this year as well as for the next \nyear record high surpluses of non-Social Security dollars. Our proposed \namendment would, in fact, use those non-Social Security surplus dollars \nto make sure that highway funding remains constant.\n\n  It is our projection and estimation that over the next 5 months the \nsuspension of the gas tax would reduce the highway trust fund by \napproximately $6.5 billion. Our amendment would replenish those dollars \nfrom the general fund.\n  Indeed, the language of our amendment states specifically that \nnothing in this subsection may be construed as authorizing a reduction \nin the apportionments of the highway trust fund to the States as a \nresult of the temporary reduction in rates of tax.\n  In short, the proposal embodied in my legislation and in the \namendment I had planned to bring to the Interior bill would suspend the \ngas tax and make sure the highway funds continue to flow by using non-\nSocial Security surplus dollars.\n  When we initially sought to bring this amendment on the Interior \nappropriations bill, it was unclear what the Senate schedule would be \nwith respect to other appropriate legislation where we might bring this \namendment. I am happy to hear this morning that a unanimous consent \nagreement was entered into which will allow us to take up tomorrow the \nestate tax--the death tax--legislation that has been discussed over the \nlast day and a half, and that amendments such as this one would be in \norder at that time.\n  Indeed, I have already been in consultation with our leadership as to \nsecuring one of those amendment slots to bring this amendment in the \ncontext of the tax bill, which is clearly a more preferable vehicle for \nus to address these issues. It is my plan to return to the floor \ntomorrow when that tax bill is before us with one of the amendments to \nbe offered on the Republican side.\n  Before I leave, I wish to make it very clear to my colleagues that \nthis is a serious problem--not only in Michigan but across the country. \nIf we continue to have to pay gas prices of the level we are paying \ntoday, even though they\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nhave come down slightly in the last couple of weeks, it is going to \nhave a very serious impact on the economy of this country. It is going \nto hurt our agricultural sector, our tourism sector, our automotive \nsector, and it will have a rippling effect across America. That means \nit is not only a problem for somebody who owns a minivan or for \nsomebody who drives a truck; it is going to ultimately be a problem for \nall of us.\n  I believe over time a lot of this will be alleviated as supply and \nproduction increases by Saudi Arabia and others begin to take effect. \nBut I can't wait that long. My constituents can't wait that long. We \nneed to do something sooner, not later.\n  I believe the one thing that makes sense to do, that we can afford to \ndo, that will make a difference immediately, and that will provide the \nconsumers in my State with an opportunity to be able to afford \ngasoline--or at least more easily afford gasoline--is for us to \nrecognize that we are going to have a huge surplus this year, a \nprojected surplus next year, and that a little bit of that surplus over \nthe next 5 months can be used to protect the highway trust fund and \ngive consumers a break. I believe in doing that.\n  We will do something that will be immensely supported by the people \nacross America who have to fill up their tanks once or twice a week by \naverage working families in this country for whom a rise of 63 percent \nor 90 percent in the price makes a big difference. I believe it is an \naction that we should take. The last time we voted on it, there were \napproximately 43 votes in favor of a gas tax suspension. But that was \nbefore these prices crested to the level of today. I believe the Senate \nshould have one more vote on this. I look forward to this debate \ntomorrow.\n\n  At this time, I will withdraw from the list my amendment and allow \nthe Senator from Washington to continue with other amendments on this \nbill. I thank him for his indulgence. I look forward to debating this \nissue tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Michigan \non two fronts: One, that we will not have to deal with the amendment on \nthis bill--at least not on the subject of the bill itself--and \nsubstantively for bringing up a vitally important issue; and for his \ndedication, which I am certain was key to giving him the ability to \nbring this amendment to the floor of the Senate on a bill for which it \nis relevant and in a way that Members of the Senate will be able to \nvote on it. I wish him good fortune in that quest. His case was \npersuasively stated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3773\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3773.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington (Mr. Gorton) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3773.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 167, line 15 of the bill, insert the number ``0'' \n     between the numbers ``1'' and ``5''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is a technical amendment. It is to \ncorrect an improper citation to public law referenced in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3773) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3801\n\n   (Purpose: To approve the reprogramming of funds for computational \n         services at the National Energy Technology Laboratory)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on behalf of my colleague from West \nVirginia, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington (Mr. Gorton), for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3801.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of Title III of the bill insert the following:\n       ``Sec.  . From funds previously appropriated under the \n     heading ``Department of Energy, Fossil Energy Research and \n     Development,'' $4,000,000 is immediately available from \n     unobligated balances for computational services at the \n     National Energy Technology Laboratory.''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this confirms a reprogramming of an energy \nprogram in the State of West Virginia over which there have been some \ntechnical difficulties, and assures that money previously appropriated \nwill be used for the purpose stated in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3801) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3802\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the amount provided for the State of Florida \n   Restoration grants within National Park Service land acquisition)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I send a further amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3802.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 127, line 11, strike ``$10,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$12,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this corrects a figure in the bill to \nbring it into conformance with the committee report and the intention \nof the committee in passing a bill. In other words, it was simply a \ndrafting error.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3802) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote on all three amendments.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, that is all I can deal with at the present \ntime. I repeat--and I know my friend from Nevada is with me on this--we \ndo have a very substantial number of additional amendments. It looks as \nif somewhere between 6 and 10 may require rollcalls. I particularly \nurge we start the debate on significant policy amendments to this bill. \nThis is a request to Members who were eager to list amendments for \ndebate to come to the floor and present those amendments.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, this bill may not be around very long. \nThis may be the only opportunity to offer these amendments because the \ntwo leaders have outlined a tremendously difficult legislative program \nin the next 2\\1/2\\ weeks. This may be the only time in the Sun for some \nof these amendments.\n  Mr. GORTON. We are going to the tax bill tomorrow with 20 amendments \nor so in order for it. Members desiring to deal with this Interior \nappropriations bill need to present themselves on the floor with those \namendments as promptly as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3803\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for expenses resulting from windstorms, \n                            with an offset)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for Mr. \nGrams and Mr. Wellstone, and I ask that it be immediately considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Senators \n     Grams and Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 3803.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 126, line 16, strike ``$207,079,000,'' and insert \n     ``$202,950,000, of which not more than $511,000 shall be used \n     for the preconstruction, engineering, and design of a \n     heritage center for the Grand Portage National Monument in \n     Minnesota,''.\n       On page 165, line 25, strike ``$618,500,000,'' and \n     inserting ``$622,629,000, of which at least $6,947,000 shall \n     be used for hazardous fuels reduction activities and expenses \n     resulting from windstorm damage in the Superior National \n     Forest in Minnesota, $3,000,000 of which shall not be \n     available until September 30, 2001''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment was discussed a few moments \nago by Senator Grams and approved by Senator Wellstone. It deals \nfurther with the emergency in Minnesota they discussed earlier. I was \ndelighted at the wonderful cooperation between those two Senators. I \nagree with their description of the emergency. I ask the amendment be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3803) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the chairman of the subcommittee and I are \nhere on the floor. We are very eager to have Senators who want to call \nup amendments come to the floor and call up their amendments. I urge \nSenators: Make haste and come while the time is running and ripe. At \nsome point we have to call up our amendments or go to third reading. It \nis a little early to go to third reading, but I would plead with \nSenators not to wait. This is an excellent opportunity. If I had an \namendment to the bill, I would be eager to see a moment such as this \nwhen other Senators are not seeking recognition, and I would be eager \nto come to the floor, work out my amendment with the two managers, and \nbe on my way back to the office and other things.\n  So I make that urgent plea because at some point, if Senators do not \ncome to the floor with their amendments, I may move to go to third \nreading and get the yeas and nays on that. Of course, if that motion \ncarries, there can be no more amendments. I am not saying I will do \nthat yet, but there will come a time. That is a good fiddler's tune: \nThere will come a time, there will come a time someday. This is your \nchance, now. Staffs of Senators who are working on amendments, this is \nyour chance. Get your Senator here and let's get the amendments and get \nvotes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3804\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funds for Payment in Lieu of Taxes \n                                program)\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Grams, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3804.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 112, line 20, strike ``$693,133,000'' and insert \n     ``$689,133,000 of which not to exceed $125,900,000 shall be \n     for workforce and organizational support and $16,586,000 \n     shall be for Land and Resource Information Systems''.\n       On page 113, line 14, strike ``$693,133,000'' and insert \n     ``$689,133,000''.\n       On page 115, line 19, strike ``$145,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$148,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with a \nprogram called Payment In Lieu of Taxes. Last year there was an \nappropriation of approximately $135 million. This year we intended to \nincrease that amount. We have a letter that came from 57 of our \ncolleagues urging an increase. We have changed the amendment to where \nit would be an increase in funding over the proposal by $3 million, \nbringing it up to $148 million.\n  This is substantially below what the authorizations are. However, I \ndo understand the difficulty of the funding. I appreciate the \nopportunity to work with the chairman and the ranking member.\n  Basically what this does, of course, is provide payments to the \nStates for the public lands that are owned there, public lands that if \nthey were privately owned would be taxed and would be an income source.\n  These counties, despite the fact there is no taxable income, continue \nto carry on their services--lease services, hospital services, other \nkinds of services. So really it is sort of a fairness issue when the \nFederal Government has substantial amounts of ownership.\n  In Wyoming, 50 percent of the State belongs to the Federal \nGovernment. We have counties that run as high as 96 percent being \nfederally owned lands and many that are over half. So this is sort of a \npayment to them. The Nation, of course, benefits from this ownership, \nbut the counties have to pay the ticket.\n  I will not go into great detail. But I urge this amendment be agreed \nto.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter that was sent \nto the chairman be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2000.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton, Chairman,\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd, Ranking Member,\n     Subcommittee on Interior, Senate Appropriations Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Gorton and Byrd: We write to request your \n     support for a multi year process that will lead us to full \n     funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program on \n     public lands across the country.\n       We believe the most favorable course of action would be to \n     appropriate the full authorization level of PILT by FY 2010. \n     The Bureau of Land Management has informed us that the \n     authorized PILT funding level under PL. 103-397 in FY 2005 \n     will be approximately $335 million based on current inflation \n     rates. We realize there are many important needs to be \n     addressed in the Interior Appropriations bill this year. \n     However, a five-year $20 million per year increase would help \n     more than 2000 counties and local governments meet the \n     mandates imposed upon them by an ever increasing public land \n     base. Additionally, it would allow the federal government to \n     work toward fulfilling a commitment it made to counties in \n     1976 when Congress passed the original PILT act in a fiscally \n     responsible manner.\n       You are keenly aware that counties, on behalf of the \n     federal government, provide many critical infrastructure \n     servides--including police, search and rescue, fire fighting, \n     road maintenance, garbage collection and other services. \n     Because of the amount of public lands in these counties, they \n     do not have the ability to raise the necessary funds through \n     traditional property taxes.\n       In the past public lands provided many economic benefits to \n     local communities through multiple use activities such as \n     grazing, mining, oil, gas and timber. The monies generated \n     also stayed in public land counties. These resource \n     activities face ongoing pressures and hardships, and are \n     being replaced by people recreating in these areas. The \n     effect is an increased demand for services often far in \n     excess of resources that the tourism dollars bring to these \n     rural communities.\n       It is common for federal land ownership in some counties to \n     exceed 50 percent to more than 90 percent. With the trend \n     toward additional acquisitions by the federal government of \n     private taxable land, we believe it has become an absolute \n     necessity that Congress meet its obligation and begin a \n     process that will lead toward full funding of PILT within a \n     reasonable period of time. Absent this, we fear counties will \n     have no choice but to reduce or eliminate essential public \n     services on public lands due to budgetary constraints. Please \n     know you have our full support as we move forward working \n     with you\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\n     on an incremental increase for PILT which allows for this \n     critical program to eventually realize its full authorization \n     level.\n           Best regards,\n         Craig Thomas; Mary L.

Mr. President, we have worked with the Senator from \nWyoming on this subject, a subject in which he has been interested, I \nbelieve, ever since he came to the Senate, and one in which I am \ninterested as well.\n  The bill does include an increase for this Payment In Lieu of Taxes. \nThis money is very important to many counties--rural counties almost \nentirely--that have much or most of their property owned by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I would like to be more generous than this. I think this is about as \nfar as we can go. I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from \nWyoming to come up with a reasonable increase. I am willing to accept \nit. I believe my colleague is as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3804) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and Senator Byrd for \naccepting the amendment, and also Senators Hatch, Grams, and Burns for \ncosponsoring this amendment. I think it is useful. I appreciate it very \nmuch.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3774, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent my amendment No. 3774 be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator has a right to recall \nhis amendment.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3774) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting Senator Slade \nGorton and Senator Robert Byrd, the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee that brings this legislation to the floor. The \nInterior appropriations bill is a very important piece of legislation, \nbut it faces the classic problem of trying to meet unlimited needs with \nlimited resources. Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd had a very difficult \ntask, but they have done quite a remarkable job and have certainly \nearned my compliments and I hope the compliments of my colleagues for \nthe job they have done.\n  I wish to speak for a few moments, however, about a very difficult \nproblem that is encountered by a group of Americans who suffer some of \nthe highest unemployment rates, some of the most difficult health \nproblems, and the most difficult challenges of any Americans. I'm \nspeaking of Native Americans.\n  We have in North Dakota four Indian reservations. I frequently visit \nthese reservations and meet with the tribal chairs, men, women, and \nchildren who live there. The conditions in some cases on these \nreservations are very much like those of a Third World country. The \nunmet health care needs are devastating. The unemployment rates in some \ncases are as high as 50, 60, and 70 percent because these areas are so \nremote and there are simply no jobs. And the quality of education \nregrettably is not up to the standards it should be.\n\n  As I talk about these problems today, I want to point out that this \nbill, for the first time, makes some significant steps in the right \ndirection. This is an important moment. This appropriations bill does \nmake some important progress in dealing with the issues of Indian \nhealth care and Indian education.\n  Yet there is so much left to do. The people in America who live in \nIndian country have the highest rates of poverty in our country. Over \n30 percent of Native Americans live in poverty. The unemployment rate \non Indian reservations in North Dakota averages 55 percent. Compare \nthat to the unemployment rate of around 4 percent in the United States \nas a whole.\n  To help address the problems that Native Americans face, President \nClinton recommended a $1.2 billion increase, government-wide, for \npriority health care, education, economic development, and other \ninfrastructure needs in Indian country. I am particularly pleased about \nthe President's recommendations in some key areas, including the $300 \nmillion he proposed for BIA school replacement and repair. This is $167 \nmillion more than the current level, the largest ever single year \ninvestment in BIA school infrastructure. The President's budget also \nproposes a $200 million, or 10-percent, increase in the Indian health \nservices budget.\n  The increased funding levels in the Senate bill, even though they \nrepresent significant progress under difficult circumstances, still \nfall significantly short of both the President's budget request and \nwhat we need to do. Unfortunately, the House-passed Interior bill is \nfar, far worse. We are going to fall short once again of meeting the \nactual needs of Native Americans.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the health care needs in Indian \ncountry. A Native American living on the reservation is 12 times more \nlikely to have diabetes than the average American--not double or triple \nor quadruple but 12 times more likely to have diabetes--and 3 times \nmore likely to die from diabetes. An American Indian is five times more \nlikely to die from tuberculosis, four times more likely to die from \nchronic liver disease, 3 times more likely to die in an accident, \nespecially an automobile accident, and nearly twice as likely to commit \nsuicide.\n  I recently visited the Indian Health Service hospital in Fort Yates, \nND. I have here a picture of that hospital. It has been around for a \nlong while. It doesn't have an emergency room. The folks who use that \nhospital don't have access to an operating room, and they therefore \ncan't deliver babies because they don't have an operating room. The \nemergency room is in the midst of the waiting rooms, so when an \nemergency occurs, everyone in the waiting room has to clear out. It is \nnot visible in this picture, but there is a little old trailer house \nwhere the dentist practices. The 1 dentist practicing in that trailer \nserves 5,000 people.\n  Now this dentist is no doubt providing the best service that he can \ngiven the circumstances he has to work in, but just imagine the kind of \ndental care that is provided by 1 dentist for 5,000 people. Do you \nthink that dentist is constructing difficult bridges or other \ncomplicated treatments for teeth that are in trouble, or is he more \nlikely pulling teeth? This is at Fort Yates, ND, on the Standing Rock \nIndian Reservation.\n  The current funding for the Indian Health Service is about 43 percent \nless per capita than health care spending for the U.S. population \ngenerally. The Indian Health Service spends about $1,400 per patient, \ncompared to the national per capita amount per patient of $3,200.\n  Let me also talk for a moment about education on the reservations. \nAgain, I appreciate the leadership of Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd \nin providing $276 million for BIA school replacement and repair in this \ncoming fiscal year.\n\n  The Federal government has a trust responsibility to provide an \neducation\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\nto Indian children. This is not a luxury or some discretionary choice. \nWe have a trust responsibility to Indian children, just as we have a \nresponsibility to provide for an education for the children of our \nmilitary personnel residing on or near military bases. The Federal \ngovernment runs the Department of Defense school system. We also have a \ntrust responsibility to run the school system through the BIA. We have \nnot done that very well. We are woefully short of the funds that are \nneeded to keep these schools up to standard. Even with the funding \nincreases in the Senate bill, there will continue to be a nearly $700 \nmillion backlog in repair and replacement of BIA schools.\n  The GAO says the schools that are serving these Indian children are \namong the poorest schools in the Nation. Yes, that is among all \nschools, even those in the inner-cities, where they also have a lot of \nproblems. But the worst school facilities in the Nation are those on \nthe Indian reservations.\n  This is a picture of a school on the Turtle Mountain Reservation. \nThis happens to be the Ojibwa Indian School. This is a fundamentally \nunsafe school, as many health and safety investigations have found. One \nday, my fear is that something awful will happen at that school and \npeople will say, How did that happen? It will happen because nobody \npaid attention to the warnings.\n  This is a picture of the fire escape. Notice, it is a wooden fire \nescape, which is rather unusual--a fire escape made of wood. This is \nclearly a fire code violation.\n  The children of the Ojibwa school are attending classes in trailers \nthat have been constructed because the main school building is over 100 \nyears old and has been condemned. So the kids are now put in the mobile \nunits and are required to scurry back and forth, up and down these \nstairs, in the dead of winter in North Dakota, with temperatures at 30 \nbelow zero and with the wind blowing. The people who have inspected \nthese facilities from time to time have found all kinds of problems \nwith them. This wooden fire escape is simply one of many.\n  This is a picture of the plumbing at the school in Marty, SD, the \nMarty Indian School. Take a look at that plumbing. See if you want to \ntake a drink of the water from those pipes. Or take a look at this \nrusted radiator. Not exactly the modern radiator needed to keep the \nstudents warm in the dead of a South Dakota winter.\n  Or, to return to another picture of the Ojibwa school, where the \nground beneath the gymnasium is giving way. For safety purposes they \nhave put up plywood, and that plywood is all that separates children \nfrom danger as the ground gives way under the corner of the gymnasium.\n  We have to do much better than this. We can and should do better than \nthis. We have a responsibility to these kids. I have come to the floor \nmany times and talked about these needs. I know I am repetitive, and I \nknow people say that they have heard it all before. But frankly, a lot \nof these people don't have much of a voice in this appropriations \nprocess.\n  A little third grader, Rosie Two Bears, once asked me: Mr. Senator, \nare you going to build me a new school? I realize I can't build Rosie a \nnew school even though she desperately needs one. She goes to a school \nthat is terribly inadequate. Rosie goes to a school with sewer gas \ncoming up through the floors of one classroom, which they had to \nevacuate once or twice a week. She goes to a school in which there are \n150 students with 1 water fountain and 2 toilets, a school with no \nplayground.\n  The fact is, we can do better than that. This bill makes some \nsignificant improvements in health and education. For that, I commend \nall the folks involved. On the Appropriations Committee, I tried to \nmake even more improvements, and I'm glad I was able to do that \nmarginally in the area of tribal college funding. However, I come to \nthe floor to say we have to do better.\n  The superintendent of the Wahpeton Indian school, Joyce Burr, told me \na while ago about a little girl attending that school. Many of these \nkids are sent to that school from around the country, and they come \nfrom troubled backgrounds, many without much of a family or home to go \nback to. Joyce told me the little girl came to her near Christmastime, \nwhen the school was going to close during the 2 week holiday at \nChristmas and the children would be sent back to their reservations, to \ntheir families. This little girl, a third or fourth grader, went to the \nsuperintendent and said: I would like to stay over at the school during \nthe Christmas break. I know the school isn't going to be opened, but I \npromise if you let me stay here I won't eat very much. She had no place \nto go, so she was asking if she could stay at the school all alone over \nthe Christmas break, promising, ``If you let me do that I won't eat \nmuch.'' We must do much better for these children.\n\n  On the other end of the education spectrum, with respect to tribal \ncolleges, I want to say we are starting to make some progress there, \nfor which I am very grateful. The tribal colleges represent an \nextension of educational opportunity and a way out of poverty. I went \nto a tribal college graduation once and met the oldest graduate in the \ngraduating class. She was 42 or 43 years old, with four children, whose \nhusband had left her. She was cleaning the toilets and the hallways at \nthe tribal college and decided she was going to try and improve her lot \nin life by attending the college.\n  The day I was there, she graduated. I can hardly describe the smile \non her face that day. This woman decided, with grim determination: I am \ngoing to graduate from this college. I know I am cleaning the hallways \nand bathrooms, but I want to do more than that. Through grit and \ndetermination, the help of relatives and scholarships, and because the \ntribal college was right there, guess what--the day I showed up to give \nthe graduation speech, this proud woman graduated from college. Good \nfor her.\n  Or the instance of Loretta. Loretta had dropped out of school. She \nwas an unwed teenaged mother. Now she is a doctor, a Ph.D., a real \nexpert on education who eventually went on to teach at a tribal college \nfor awhile. She did that by herself, but she did it because we put in \nplace a system of tribal colleges that give people like Loretta the \nopportunity to go to school and get a college education. That is why \ntribal colleges are so important. Frankly, we contribute only about \nhalf as much per student at tribal colleges as we do to other colleges \naround the rest of the country. We need to do better than that. I am \npleased to say this piece of legislation starts down that road.\n  Let me conclude where I began. I am here because I am pleased we are \nmaking progress. These are important, critical issues. We cannot ignore \nthe circumstances that exist on Indian reservations. It is easy enough \nfor some people to say that this is the way Indians want to live. That \nis not the case at all. These are Americans who are beset by poverty, \nlack of opportunity, lack of jobs, a bad health care system, and a \ncrumbling education system that we must improve. I believe we are \ntaking the first steps in this legislation to do that. For that, I \ncommend my colleagues who brought this bill to the floor --Senator \nGorton and Senator Byrd.\n  I say to them, I will be back again next year, as we continue our \nwork in the Appropriations Committee, saying that we have done a lot, \nwe have made some first important steps and thanks for that. But let's \ncontinue to try to address these education and health care needs on our \nreservations for Indian Americans. Let's try to do even more in the \ncoming fiscal year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator is eloquent and persistent and \nhas had great successes, and I am sure he will have great successes in \nthe future. I thank him for his comments and his support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if I can engage in a discussion \nwith the distinguished chairman, Senator Slade Gorton, on the bill \nbefore us.\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\n  By way of some opening remarks directed at the fine, excellent job he \nhas done on this bill, I want to talk with him for a moment about what \nwe have done for the U.S. Government-owned-and-maintained Indian \nschools in the United States in the Interior appropriations bill.\n  First, when we are finished supplying the numbers for the Record, \nwhich are obviously in the bill, it should not go unnoticed that this \nis the first time we have substantially--and I mean substantially--\nincreased the money for the construction of Indian schools owned by the \nU.S. Government. Let's not be confused with public schools. These are \nschools that if the Federal Government does not pay for, I ask my \nchairman, nobody will pay for them, right; they belong to us?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is entirely correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And they are maintained by us. As the accounts will \nshow, not only are we in a terrible state of disrepair, in terms of \nthose schools that need management money, but we have a huge backlog of \nschools that should be built--that is, built anew--because the \nfacilities that Indian children are occupying are truly intolerable.\n  Thus far, have I stated what the Senator from Washington has \nattempted to accomplish in this bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico is correct, but I really need \nto say more to respond to him in the affirmative. He has perhaps been \nthe most eloquent, though he has been certainly strongly supported by \nthe Senator from North Dakota on that side of the aisle, our friend, \nSenator Inouye, from that side of the aisle, and the Senators from \nArizona, in attempting at least to begin with the huge backlog in the \nabsolute necessity of constructing new Indian schools that are 100 \npercent our responsibility and for renovating and repairing those that \ncan constructively be renovated and repaired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico also knows how difficult this has been in \npast years because while the President of the United States has always \nasked us for big increases in the budget really for spending more money \nthan we thought overall was appropriate to spend, he has always ignored \nthese Indian school needs.\n  This year, in this budget, the President did dramatically reverse \nhimself and did ask for a generous appropriation for new Indian school \nconstruction. That partnership, and the bipartisan partnership on the \nfloor of the Senate, gave me the ability of drafting this bill to begin \nboth appropriate new construction and a large number of repairs and \nrehabilitation.\n  I would be deficient in my own duty if I did not say that the first \nperson who saw this need--not only saw this need but spoke eloquently \nto this need--was the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it not true one other major function of activities \nthat we must do in behalf of Indian people has to do with health care, \nwherein we have hospitals and medical facilities that are run by the \nU.S. Government for the Indian people? There, again, we have just been \nbarely getting by in terms of keeping them open and properly \nmaintained, and they are rather good medical facilities, I say to the \nAmerican people. It is not like the public schools that we are ashamed \nof because they are in such disrepair.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. The Indian schools.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Indian schools, yes. They are in such a state of \ndisrepair. Indian health is in pretty good health. In this bill, the \nPresident asked for substantially more money, and we were able to fund \na substantial increase in Indian health money in the Interior \nappropriations bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico, in this instance, as in the \nearlier instance, is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for a period of about 4 years, I was \njoined with bipartisan letters that we sent to the President of the \nUnited States and to the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs saying: Will you please put in your budget a 5- or 6-year \nproposal to pay for the great backlog we have in Indian school \nconstruction which, I repeat, only we can make. It is not a question of \nsomebody being generous or kind in building an Indian school. These are \nIndian schools we own, we operate, and we pay the teachers--we being \nthe United States of America.\n  The President, after a visit--not the last visit he made to Indian \ncountry which was to New Mexico, but one just before that, which was \nhis first visit to Indian country as a President--came back and talked \nabout doing something to enhance economic development--that is, jobs--\nfor Indian people.\n  I was very privileged to be at the White House and discuss the issue \nwith him personally, after which time we joined with a bipartisan group \nof Senators and put together a package that strengthened our \nconstruction and maintenance of schools, that did somewhat more for \nIndian health and a few other things. The aftermath of that was the \nintroduction of a bill, and the aftermath of that is the bill on the \nfloor which increases funding in these very important areas.\n  In closing, the funding in this bill, which essentially resulted from \nthat meeting in the White House to which I just eluded, and then \njoining a bipartisan group of Senators, really is not going to move us \nmuch in the direction of better jobs in Indian country for the Indian \npeople. All of these things that I mentioned are a necessity.\n  Essentially, there is something basic that the Indian leaders and \nlocal communities and the National Government are going to have to do \nthat will make the climate in Indian country better for private sector \njob growth. I do not levy any criticism at anyone individually, but it \nis quite obvious that tax credits alone will not do it, for we did that \n4 years ago. The most extensive tax credits were passed to give Indian \ncommunities a chance to bring in private sector jobs. It is still on \nthe books. It is a huge tax credit per Indian employee. We passed \naccelerated depreciation at the same time. If somebody builds a plant, \nthey get to accelerate the depreciation much more rapidly than if they \nwere next door in non-Indian country.\n  The problem is that the combination of all of that has not worked to \ncreate any large acceleration in the number of Indian people being \nemployed in Indian country in permanent jobs.\n  I submit it will take a kind of a change in the attitude of Indian \nleaders. I think they are beginning to understand that. Businesses will \nnot go even to an Indian reservation in America with tax credits and \nother benefits if, in fact, they are not satisfied with the business \nclimate on the reservation; that is, if they can go 50 miles to a \ncommunity off reservation and believe they have a lot more certainty of \nlaw, more certainty with reference to rules and regulations, they are \nnot going to be coming to Indian country.\n  I have been urging that the Indian leaders, while they claim their \nsovereignty, understand that every government entity that claims \nsovereignty, from time to time, shows that sovereignty by giving up a \nlittle bit of it, by waiving a piece of it, or by entering into an \nagreement where they share responsibilities with another unit of \ngovernment, frequently called intergovernmental agreements. These \nthings are going to have to happen if we are going to bring jobs to \nIndian country.\n  There is much more to be said about it. There are many people who \nhave tried, and I do not know just when it will work or when it will \nstart working to any significant degree, but I am confident that this \nyear we took a giant step in terms of the public responsibility. There \nare things moving around, either at the White House or out in Indian \ncountry, that are trying to move this whole attitude issue in a \ndirection of business feeling more comfortable on Indian country.\n  I thank the chairman, again, for the bill with reference to the \nIndian people and I thank the committee that worked with him to bring \nit here.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3795.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] for himself, Mr. \n     Hutchinson, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Smith of Oregon, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3795.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  . REVIEW COMMITTEE FOR FOREST SERVICE RULES.\n\n       (a)(1) From the amount appropriated for ``Forest \n     Products,'' a sum of $1,000,000 shall be made available until \n     expended to the Secretary of Agriculture for the purpose of \n     reviewing certain proposed rules concerning the planning and \n     management of National Forest System lands referred to in \n     paragraph (2).\n       (2) The proposed rules subject to this section are the \n     proposed road management and transportation system rule, and \n     proposed special areas--roadless area conservation rule \n     published at 64 Federal Register 54074 (October 5, 1999) and \n     65 Federal Register 11676 and 30276 (March 3 and May 10, \n     2000), respectively.\n       (b) With the funds allocated pursuant to subsection (a)(1):\n       (1) The Secretary shall appoint an advisory committee in \n     accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and \n     subsection (d) of persons knowledgeable, and reflecting a \n     diversity of viewpoints, concerning issues related to the \n     planning and management of National Forest System lands. The \n     appointments shall be made as soon as practicable after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) The advisory committee shall--\n       (A) review and evaluate the proposed rules referred to in \n     subsection (a)(2) and their prospective implementation, \n     particularly as to their cumulative effects and the manner in \n     which they relate to each other, are integrated, and will \n     function together, including any inconsistencies or conflicts \n     in their goals, purposes, application, or likely results and \n     determined whether and in what way they may be improved; and\n       (B) submit a written report to the Secretary describing the \n     results of the review and evaluation of the proposed rules \n     required by, and any recommendations for improvement of such \n     rules determined pursuant to, subparagraph (A), including any \n     supplemental or minority views which any member or members of \n     the advisory committee may wish to express.\n       (3) The Secretary shall make the report of the advisory \n     committee required by paragraph (2)(B) available for public \n     comment and submit the report to the Congress, together with \n     a written response of the Secretary to the report and the \n     public comment on the report.\n       (c) No funds appropriated by this Act or any other act of \n     Congress may be expended for further development or \n     promulgation of the proposed rules referred to in subsection \n     (a)(2) prior to 60 days after the date of submission to the \n     Congress of the report of the advisory committee and the \n     response of the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b)(3).\n       (d)(1) The advisory committee appointed pursuant to \n     subsection (b)(1) shall have no more than 15, nor less than \n     9, members who may not be officers or employees of the United \n     States. The Chair of the advisory committee shall be selected \n     from among and by its members.\n       (2) The members of the advisory committee, while attending \n     conferences, hearing, or meetings of the advisory committee \n     or while otherwise serving at the request of the Chair shall \n     each be entitled to receive compensation at a rate not in \n     excess of the maximum rate of pay for grade GS-18, as \n     provided in the General Schedule under section 5332 of title \n     5, United States Code, including travel time, and while away \n     from their homes or regular places of business shall each be \n     reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of \n     subsistence as authorized by section 5703 of title 5, United \n     States Code, for persons in Government service employed \n     intermittently.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, amendment No. 3795 to the Interior \nappropriations bill deals with the U.S. Forest Service's proposed \nroadless initiative. My amendment would earmark $1 million from the \nForest Service's timber sales account and direct the Secretary of \nAgriculture to charter an advisory committee, under the provisions of \nthe Federal Advisory Committee Act, to review the proposed rules and \nthe accompanying draft environmental impact statement for the roadless \narea initiative. The advisory committee would be charged to provide the \nSecretary with advice on improving the proposed rule and the draft \nenvironmental impact statement.\n  My amendment would further prohibit the Secretary from spending any \nadditional appropriations under this or any other act on the further \ndevelopment of the roadless area rule until the Secretary has received \nthe report of the advisory committee.\n  Let me tell you why I am offering such an amendment. To date, the \nsubcommittee that I chair, the Forests and Public Land Management \nSubcommittee, has held three oversight hearings on the roadless area \ninitiative launched by our President last fall. I can tell the members \nof this committee unequivocally that this is the most slipshod \nrulemaking effort I have seen--the worst example--in over 20 years as a \nfederally elected official.\n  Let me note an example we have found in an examination of the \ncommuniques with the White House. For example, this is a letter to \nRaymond Mosley, Director of the Federal Register. This comes from an \nofficer within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  She says:\n\n       Would you please correct our mistakes. In our haste to get \n     the notice to the Register as quickly as possible, we failed \n     to notice that the document heading was missing.\n\n  There has been such a phenomenal rush to judgment on this effort to \nfulfill the President's political agenda with this issue that all of \nthe people have made mistakes and have had to go to the Federal \nRegister's office to amend them. It is not unlike what we saw Katie \nMcGinty do just this week with TMDL rules, where this Senate, 2 weeks \nago, spoke to the fact that this rule ought to be delayed. The \nPresident withheld his signature of the MILCON appropriations bill, \nallowing the EPA to accelerate.\n  I suspect when we begin to examine the rules that have come out of \nEPA, signed by Katie McGinty yesterday, we will find the same kind of \nmistakes were made only because of a quick political rush to judgment \nto try to either circumvent the acts of Congress or to deny the public \nthe kind of input that is important and justifiable in these kinds of \nprocedures.\n  Among the numerous procedural violations of the Federal statute, I \nthink the most egregious is the willful violation of the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act, an act that this administration has had trouble \ncomplying with many times. I could cite examples where other courts \nhave ruled after the fact of the rulemaking that, yes, this \nadministration had been in violation of FACA. Our oversight record and \nthe executive branch's documents obtained during the oversight process \nprovided a clear record of these violations.\n  Between May and July last year, a small group of environmental \nactivists met with the White House, the Department of Agriculture, and \nForest Service officials to develop what eventually became the proposed \nrule about which we are talking. All of these meetings were held behind \nclosed doors with no notification provided to the public. Advice and \nmaterials were solicited from the environmentalists by executive branch \nofficials in the form of legal memoranda, technical documents, polling \ndata, media relations material, and paid advertising in support of the \nproposal. Here is an example: George Frampton, head of CEQ, from Mike \nFrancis at the Wilderness Society. Through all of these processes, what \nthey are suggesting is that we submit to you the necessary materials \nfrom which you can move to deal with this issue.\n  I think it is fascinating we find Mike Francis saying: I attach a \ndraft of the ``letter to the chief'' concept that Charles, Mike, and I \nhave worked on as an idea to provide historical linkage to the \nPresident.\n  Ironically, the very letter that George Frampton then sends to the \nSecretary of Agriculture proposing this rulemaking was a parallel \nletter, almost identical, word for word. Mr. Frampton, before our \ncommittee, did make reference to the fact that, yes, they were very \nsimilar, if not alike. That letter came from the Wilderness Society \nitself.\n  In many cases, these materials were used by executive branch \nofficials in charge of developing the proposed rule. For example, the \npolling data was used by lower level officials to brief their \nsuperiors. In another instance, there was direct consultation between \nthe outside groups and the administration to coordinate paid and earned \nmedia efforts.\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\n  Let me repeat that. Government officials sat down with outside groups \nprior to the rulemaking process and determined that they would launch a \npaid media campaign. There was even dialog within these memoranda that \nwe gathered that suggested dates and times and the kinds of media \nmarkets we are talking about. Of course, I have referenced the letter \nto the Secretary from George Frampton, which is a mirror image of the \nletter that was proposed by staff at the Wilderness Society.\n\n  In response to the questions before my subcommittee, administration \nofficials conceded that the issue of compliance with the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act was never raised in their meetings or \ndeliberations, and counsel was never consulted on the matter.\n  This group of environmental advisers was in every way but one an \nadvisory committee to the Federal Government. The one exception was \nthat the committee was never chartered under the provisions of the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act. Had they been chartered, the \ncomposition of the committee would have had to have been balanced or at \nleast more balanced than it was, and their meetings would have had to \nhave been published and open to the media and to the public. In other \nwords, the process of sunshine and public participation would have had \nto have been involved in this very process.\n  Those are citing just a few of the differences and what I believe are \nsubstantial violations. Left to its own devices, the administration \nwill not correct the legal violations. They have been cited and \nexamples have been given, both in my committee and at a comparable \ncommittee in the House. Lawsuits have been filed. Yet they will not \nrespond. They are simply charging ahead to a pre-November deadline so \nthat all of this fits into the political context that they chose to \nbring it into by the very announcement of the President last October.\n  I think, therefore, it is up to Congress to correct these violations \nand the resulting inequities. We must, unfortunately, intervene if we \nwant to see the rule of law followed and direct the Secretary to follow \nthe law and charter an advisory committee legally under FACA. Then a \nbroader range of interests will have the opportunity afforded to a \nselected few with connections to high-level administration officials as \ninsiders and friends. The advice they will offer to improve the \nproposed rule will be offered in the sunlight of public disclosure and \nultimately cause the reaction, as it should, of public opinion. It will \nnot be offered in secret, and it will not be offered behind closed \ndoors as it was. This would restore the rule of law and sunshine in \nGovernment.\n  The reason I offer this is the magnitude and the significance of the \nissue. Some who are from States that are not impacted by large public \nlandownerships or some who oftentimes think that environmental votes \nare just easy and free to make because they have little or no \nconsequence to their constituency ought to react to this by saying that \nthe administration stepped beyond the rule of law, clearly outside of \nthe intent of what Congress designed in the Federal Advisory Committee \nAct.\n  This is the magnitude, the significance of what I am talking about. \nThis chart is significant only as a visual. These red areas represent \napproximately 42 million acres of existing Forest Service wilderness. \nEvery acre of this 42 million was heard before a House and Senate \ncommittee. It was a give and take between the delegates of the State \nand other Senators and Representatives. It was debated on the floor of \nthe House and the Senate, and it was ultimately passed, all 42 million \nacres of existing Federal Forest Service designated wilderness. In \nother words, the public process was full.\n  What the President announced in October and what has been going on \nbehind closed doors--with now a few public hearings--is the yellow or \nnearly 60 million acres of public lands now up for redesignation by \nthis President.\n  What does that represent? It represents the whole State of \nMassachusetts and the whole State of Rhode Island and the whole State \nof Connecticut and the whole State of New Jersey and the whole State of \nDelaware and the whole State of Pennsylvania and the whole State of \nMaryland and the whole State of West Virginia. Sixty million acres of \nland are being decided by this President and a few of his \nadministrators with Congress not speaking a word. Never before in the \nhistory of this country has an action of this magnitude been taken \nwithout full public process and without action and participation on the \npart of the Congress itself.\n  What I am suggesting by my amendment is meager in relation to the \nimpact of what is going on behind the doors of the White House and USDA \nand the Forest Service. I am asking for $1 million out of the forest \nroad fund.\n  I am asking that the Secretary inform an advisory committee of \nindependent people, and that they advise us on the fact that FACA was \nor was not violated. I think the significance here is, if the President \nhad operated under the law, or we believed that he did, I may not be \nhere on the floor; although, I probably would be because I am dedicated \nto a public process. I believe that what my colleagues did in the \nsixties--the Democratic Party--in causing all meetings to be open and \npublic and registered, and being the primary authors of the act, I \nthink that is the right thing to do because I think the public ought to \nbe involved. That is why we are here today--to involve the public in \nsomething that represents all of these States, 60 million acres of the \npublic's land and the ultimate future of how that land will be managed. \nThat is what is important about this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes, briefly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator has made reference to the fact this is going \nto be an open, public process by this advisory committee. In the \nSenator's amendment, there is no reference to any public meeting by \nthis committee. On page 2, line B(3), there is a reference that this \nadvisory committee report will be available for public comment. That is \nthe first use of the word ``public.'' There is no reference to the \nsunshine committee having any public hearings.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If I may answer, it is because this committee is \nformulated under FACA. Go to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and \nthere before you will be all the terms by which this committee will be \nstructured. So instead of listing page after page of documentation, I \nam simply saying that the Secretary will constitute a committee under \nFACA to make determinations as to whether the appropriate actions have \nbeen taken.\n  So the Senator is right; I didn't list all of those things. But you \nand I operate under the Federal Code. The Federal Code is there and \nthat is why we have done that.\n\n\n                    amendment No. 3795, as modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Just one more question, briefly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for that. It is almost like a debate \non the floor. Will the Senator consider putting this language in: The \nadvisory committee shall have public sessions, open for public review?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Most assuredly I will. I think the Senator knows exactly \nwhat I am saying. If he wants the guarantee that FACA will be used, I \nwill be happy to restate it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the words ``full public meetings'' \nappropriately be placed at the right stage of this. I will work to \ncomply with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3795), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.  . REVIEW COMMITTEE FOR FOREST SERVICE RULES.\n\n       (a)(1) From the amount appropriated for ``Forest \n     Products,'' a sum of $1,000,000 shall be made available until \n     expended to the Secretary of Agriculture for the purpose of \n     reviewing certain proposed rules concerning the planning and \n     management of National Forest System lands referred to in \n     paragraph (2).\n       (2) The proposed rules subject to this section are the \n     proposed road management and transportation system rule, and \n     proposed special areas--roadless area conservation rule \n     published at 64 Federal Register 54074 (October 5, 1999) and \n     65 Federal Register 11676 and 30276 (March 3 and May 10, \n     2000), respectively.\n       (b) With the funds allocated pursuant to subsection (a)(1):\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\n       (1) The Secretary shall appoint an advisory committee in \n     accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and \n     subsection (d) of persons knowledgeable, and reflecting a \n     diversity of viewpoints, concerning issues related to the \n     planning and management of National Forest System lands. The \n     appointments shall be made as soon as practicable after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) The advisory committee shall, with full public \n     participation and open public meetings in accordance with the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act--\n       (A) review and evaluate the proposed rules referred to in \n     subsection (a)(2) and their prospective implementation, \n     particularly as to their cumulative effects and the manner in \n     which they relate to each other, are integrated, and will \n     function together, including any inconsistencies or conflicts \n     in their goals, purposes, application, or likely results and \n     determined whether and in what way they may be improved; and\n       (B) submit a written report to the Secretary describing the \n     results of the review and evaluation of the proposed rules \n     required by, and any recommendations for improvement of such \n     rules determined pursuant to, subparagraph (A), including any \n     supplemental or minority views which any member or members of \n     the advisory committee may wish to express.\n       (3) The Secretary shall make the report of the advisory \n     committee required by paragraph (2)(B) available for public \n     comment and submit the report to the Congress, together with \n     a written response of the Secretary to the report and the \n     public comment on the report.\n       (c) No funds appropriated by this Act or any other act of \n     Congress may be expended for further development or \n     promulgation of the proposed rules referred to in subsection \n     (a)(2) prior to 60 days after the date of submission to the \n     Congress of the report of the advisory committee and the \n     response of the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b)(3).\n       (d)(1) The advisory committee appointed pursuant to \n     subsection (b)(1) shall have no more than 15, nor less than \n     9, members who may not be officers or employees of the United \n     States.

The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, Senator Craig, \nthat under our Constitution this body was enacted to have two Senators \nfrom every State. I hope every State is concerned with what happens in \nother States. I will be the first to admit that it is very easy not to \npay attention to the speech the Senator just made because, obviously, \nthere are whole States--many of them--that don't have this problem \nbecause they have no vast public ownership in the midst of their \ncities, out in their countrysides, or built right up against \ncommunities, be it the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service. \nSo there is a tendency not to pay attention when a couple of States \ncome to the floor and show some very dire problems that exist in the \nmanagement of the public domain.\n  I have a few issues today that won't all be raised on this amendment \nI will offer. But before the Interior bill is finished, I will talk \nabout some very serious problems out in the Southwest, which is more \nthan one State. Over the last 3 or 4 weeks, New Mexico has had its \nshare and then some. So I want to talk about, first, a substitute that \nI am going to offer, which the distinguished Senator Craig understands \nI will offer. I hope we can vote on both his suggested amendment and \nthe one I am offering as a substitute.\n  But I think we have come to the conclusion--he and I and others--that \nif we can pass the substitute today and have it go to conference with \nthe distinguished chairman and ranking member supporting it in the \nmanner that it will receive support in the Senate--which I think is \nrather overwhelming--we will be satisfied that that is a good day's \nwork and something that is very important for the forests of our \ncountry, which many Senators don't know about because they don't have \nany public forests. But they can take it from a group of us that the \nforests of the United States, whether they are run by the Forest \nService or whether they are run by the Bureau of Land Management, are \nin terrible shape today.\n  Of course, there are people in the country who can talk about how \nthey got that way. But I say to my good friend from Illinois, I know he \ndoesn't have time, but it would be a pleasure to take him out to some \nareas surrounding Santa Fe, NM, or the areas that our good friend, \nSenator Feinstein, will talk about in her State, or that Senator \nBingaman has observed as he toured Los Alamos. The fire there and the \nfire on the other side of the State took almost 30,000 acres. It would \nkind of pale in comparison to that incendiary on the top of the hill \nthat almost burnt down Los Alamos.\n  Let me tell you the reason we are offering this substitute. It is \nbecause there is an emergency existing in our forests that has to do \nwith cleaning up the forest so that we can lower the threshold for \nfire. Anybody paying attention to the 48,000 acres that burned around \nLos Alamos would quickly come to the conclusion that the forest was \nalmost like a storage of gasoline on the ground in barrels, and that \nwhen a fire started, it was just like gasoline burning because we never \ncleaned the forest. All over the place were knocked down trees with \ndebris and trees that were so close together that if they started \nburning, it was just like the wind. The wind was blowing at 35 to 45 \nmiles an hour in both of our fires. With the hazardous waste on the \nground that we never clean up because either we don't have enough \nmoney, or there are certain people in the country who fight even \ncleanup, where you take the small logs in the forest and you take the \nkindling that has been accumulating and take it out of there and either \ncontrol burn it or let it be used by those who can find usage for that \nkind of a resource.\n\n  So we have a substitute today that is called the Hazardous Fuel \nReduction Act. We are asking the Senate to find that an emergency \nexists out there in our forests. I am very pleased to say that a number \nof Senators concur that there is an emergency and that we ought to put \nsome money up in the state of emergency and get on with cleaning up \nthese forests.\n  I thank my cosponsors today. We have done this without a lot of work \nbecause I have to do this rather quickly upon my return from New \nMexico, seeing that the city of Santa Fe, NM, could possibly burn \nbecause the community is in direct contact with the forest. The \nwatershed for the city of Santa Fe, which many people like to visit, is \nright up in the mountains and is filled with kindling and with \nhazardous waste waiting to burn. So what I have done is ask a few \nSenators to join me today. I will quickly summarize what we are doing.\n  The Senators who joined me are from both sides of the aisle. On the \nDemocratic side, we have Senator Feinstein and my colleague, Senator \nBingaman. On the Republican side, in addition to myself, we have \nSenators Kyl and Craig. I am sure Senator Craig would quickly indicate \nwith me that if we wanted to circulate it, we would get many more \nSenators. The point is, we want to get this disposed of on this bill \nand not cause a great delay for the two distinguished managers.\n  Let me say up front that we don't change any environmental laws. We \nhave worked at this, and we have had everybody work at it. We have not \nmodified NEPA and we have not changed any other laws of that type in \nthis measure. This measure will allow the Secretaries of Agriculture \nand Interior to use all current authorities for fuel reduction \ntreatments. It will give new authority for using grants and cooperative \nagreements for fuel reduction.\n  It is at the sole discretion of the Secretaries. There is nothing \nmandatory about it, that they can provide jobs to local people in the \nlocal communities for fuel reduction activities.\n  In my State--which might be different from California--there is a \nvery huge built-up desire on the part of people living in the rural \ncommunities of New Mexico to want to join in partnership through their \ncommunities and put people to work helping to clean up the forests.\n  There is nothing in this substitute that says we are going to log the \nforests. Yet if there is an opponent who comes to the floor to argue \nagainst this by some who do not want it, they will\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\nsay it is just another way to log the forests. If anybody says that, \nread the amendment. I don't choose to read it today, but it does not do \nthat. In cleaning the forest, they will cut some small logs, but it \nwill be pursuant to a plan which will show that the primary reason for \nall of this is to get rid of some of that hazardous fuel that has been \npiling up waiting to be burned.\n  In addition, the Secretaries will be able to include in some of this \nwork nonprofits and cooperative groups, such as the YCC, or other \npartnerships and entities that will hire a high percentage of local \nfolks. The Secretary has to publish a list.\n  The other things were options and discretionary. This one has to be \npublished by September 30, identifying all urban wild land interfaces.\n  That is what we are worried about--not the whole forest, the \ninterface, the communities at risk from wildfire, and, identify where \nfuel reduction treatment is going on, or will start by the end of the \nyear. Then by May they will have to say why they have not and cannot \ntreat the rest of these communities where the interface has occurred. \nFor any reasons not limited to lack of funds, they will have to state \nwhy.\n  Finally, the Forest Service has to publish its cohesive fire \nstrategy, which they have in draft form. They haven't published it. \nThey will have to publish it and simply explain--not delay, but just \nexplain--any differences in current rulemaking and how the new policy \nof closing roads could impact with firefighting. I know they don't want \nto do this.\n  The truth is that is the only way the public is going to find out how \nconflicts are occurring and whether they should be resolved or whether \nwe should leave them lingering out there in a state of combat, ending \nup almost daily with lawsuits filed with one side trying to beat the \nother with some select group of environmentalists in nature most of the \ntime filing these lawsuits.\n  I repeat that there is nothing that exempts environmental, labor, or \ncivil rights laws. There is a lot of permissive language in here and \nvery little that is mandatory.\n  But from what this Senator has seen of the forests after these two \nenormous fires, it is pretty obvious that the professionals will want \nto employ these techniques to get started where the interface of \ncommunities with forests have occurred to some major degree.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3806 To Amendment No. 3795, As Modified\n\n      (Purpose: To protect communities from wild land fire danger)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The Secretary shall also \n     provide 30 days for public comment on the Cohesive Strategy \n     and the accompanying explanation.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, many of you for a \nweek or more watched on the nightly news as the forests surrounding Los \nAlamos National Laboratory, America's most renowned scientific \nlaboratory, in spite of some of the negatives that have come forth with \nreference to security--that laboratory which has supplied us with the \nvery best by way of science expertise and nuclear weapons expertise, \nnot the second best, but the best for the entire era when it was \nAmerica versus the Soviet Union--we watched each night as that fire got \ncloser and closer to that laboratory. In fact, it burned some \nbuildings, albeit none were critical to the future of the laboratory.\n  We watched it move literally huge distances at night when the winds \nwere blowing. We watched it go from an adjoining forest called \nBandelier National Forest. We watched it grow from a tiny spot where \npark people had impropitiously started a fire to clear away a piece of \nland. They started with their torches, and there it went out of \ncontrol--48,000 acres, 440 residences burned to the ground. When you go \nback and look, you see that these forests were in desperate need of \nbeing cleaned so that the kindling on the surface would be at a much, \nmuch lower temperature.\n  That brought forth from this Senator and others a very significant \ncry: Let's get on with doing some of this cleanup. Let's give them \nadditional authority in this bill and some emergency money. Let's see \nif we can get it done.\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\n  I thank the cosponsors. I thank the chairman for his attention and \nfor his giving me confidence to offer this amendment because this is \nthe appropriate vehicle. It is my hope that Senator Slade Gorton will \nsupport this measure before we are finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico. I think this \namendment is both needed and timely. It would provide emergency funding \nto address what has become a very dangerous fuel buildup on millions of \nacres of national forests.\n  In April of this year, the General Accounting Office released a \nreport entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in Fire \nAdapted Ecosystems, a Cohesive Strategy.'' The underpinning of this \nreport is this comment:\n\n       The most expensive and serious problem relating to the \n     health of national forests in the interior west is the over-\n     accumulation of vegetation.\n\n  The report goes on to say that throughout much of the interior west, \ndense vegetation and dead material is continuing to accumulate. Each \nyear in the absence of treatment, more forests become high risk, choked \nwith dense accumulations of small trees and dead wood. These \naccumulations of fuel and more damaging fires are more dangerous and \nmore costly to control, especially during drought years.\n  As the GAO report points out, many experts attach a sense of urgency \nto the management of these ecosystems. Because of the high proportion \nof the total area classified as high risk--in this report it is what is \ncalled class 3--combined with the fact that without treatment more \nvegetation will grow into these high-risk conditions, it is apparent \nthat time is running out for a strategy to successfully avert high \ncost/high loss consequences.\n  That is the backdrop for this amendment. The amendment would provide \nemergency funding to move ahead on this program. Because dead and dying \nand small-diameter trees and thick underbrush have accumulated in our \nnational forests, the possibility of serious and highly destructive \nforest fires have dramatically increased. Without any action on our \npart, it is going to continue to increase in the future.\n  Senator Domenici, several of our colleagues, and I share the belief \nthat we have a true emergency on our hands. The Forest Service has \nidentified 24 million acres of land in the continental United States as \nbeing at the absolute highest level of catastrophic fire risk. Almost \nfully one-third of this--7.8 million acres--lies in California. That is \nmore than any other State.\n  Last year in my State--and we counted it forest fire by forest fire--\nover 700,000 acres of forest burned down. Several people lost their \nlives and dozens of structures were burned. Seventy-thousand of these \nacres were prime California spotted owl habitat in the Lassen and \nPlumas Forests.\n  Last year, $365 million was spent nationally by the Federal \nGovernment putting out fires and rehabilitating the land. Of this, $144 \nmillion, or approximately one-half of the U.S. total, was spent in one \nState; that is, California. I think the money would be much better \nspent preventing fire rather than cleaning up after that fire.\n  The entire Sierra Nevada mountain range national forests continue to \nbe classified as the highest fire risk. This includes the newly \ndesignated Sequoia Monument, over 361,000 acres. It includes the Plumas \nand Lassen Forests in and around Quincy, where forest fires in the past \nhave destroyed homes and businesses and spotted owl habitat. It \nincludes areas such as the Lake Tahoe Basin, where one-third of the \nforests are either dead or dying. And the probability of major fire \nconflagration remains and grows each year. Such a fire would \npermanently destroy the water quality of the lake.\n  Through the turn of the 20th century, the U.S. population was \npredominantly spread out and agrarian. Forest fires burned naturally at \nfairly predictable intervals, and they burned hot enough to restrict \nencroaching vegetation and prevent fuel from loading up on the ground \nbut not hot enough to kill old growths. Forests in the United States \nsurvived in this fashion for literally thousands of years.\n  By the middle of the 20th century, however, an increasing population \nbegan to occupy new urban wild land zones on what had once been \nforests. Suddenly, forest fires had to be put out or suppressed in \norder to protect the surrounding communities. It seemed intuitive to \nsimply continue fighting fires as they arose and leave the forests \nuntouched. So nothing was done to groom the forests, to remove dead and \ndying trees, to reduce undergrowth, to prevent subsequent \nconflagrations.\n  What is called ``fuel load'' has grown to astronomic proportions in \nmany of our national forests. Dead and dying trees, which were no \nlonger consumed by fire, lingered while brush began to build up at \nground level. Newer, different species of trees, no longer stifled by \nnatural fire, began to crowd out some of the older growth trees. \nForests became crowded and severely fire prone.\n  Anyone who wants to look at that should get a copy of this report. On \npage 23 of the report it points out how our forests have changed in \nspecies composition and forest structure. The first picture taken is \nthe forest in 1909. We see old growth trees; we see them spaced; we see \nvery little vegetation on the ground. That is because there had been \nthese hot, fierce fires in the past.\n  Next is a 1948 photo of that same part of the forest. We see changes. \nWe see changes in the species composition, the structure, as fire had \nbeen excluded for many years.\n  In a picture in 1990, the area is totally dense and we cannot see \nthrough it. At that time--and most of our forests are like this now--we \nhad an overabundance of vegetation. This stresses the site and \npredisposes the area to infestation from pests, disease outbreaks, and, \nof course, catastrophic fire.\n  That is where we are today.\n  It is evident to me that the Forest Service's decade-old policy of \nfire suppression has failed. It is time to look anew at how we can \nbetter manage our forests.\n  In California, for example, fire-intolerant Douglas and white fir \nhave grown underneath old growth ponderosa pine. What is the result? \nThe newer firs, which are not resistant to fire, create potential fuel \nladders that permit a fire to reach the top, or what is called the \ncrown, of old growths for the first time. Old growth pine which \npreviously was impervious to fire, since rarely did a fire ever reach \nall the way up to its crown--with this new fuel ladder, fire threats to \nold growth pine have become very real.\n\n  Drought periods have further stressed the forests, predisposing them \nto infestations of pests, disease, and of course severe wildfire. The \nbark beetle has gone through the Tahoe forests like a forest fire. One \ncan see miles of forests standing dead after an infestation. The dead \ntrees remain, year after year after year.\n  California forests provide homes for dozens of endangered and \nthreatened species, including the marbled murrelet and the spotted owl. \nIt is an understatement to say that today the risk of fire is the most \nserious threat to these species. I really believe that to be true. It \nmay be the most immediate short-term environmental threat our western \nforests face. That is why this amendment and this funding is so \nimportant. It is imperative that the Forest Service use all available \ntools to clean up the forests and reduce fire risks.\n  The one-size-fits-all approach of the Forest Service, I believe, must \nbe changed. Each forest is different. Topography is different, \ngeography is different, climate is different, soils are different, \nvegetation is different, the kind and type of trees are different, in \ndifferent places throughout the United States. What is proper \nstewardship for a California forest may not be proper stewardship in \nPennsylvania or Alaska or Montana. We have to look at the area and look \nat the fire risk differently. A flexibility of management must be \nemployed to fix the problem. Dead and dying trees should be removed. \nOvergrowth should be thinned. Mechanical treatment and controlled burns \nmust each be used separately and carefully in conjunction with each \nother. If we don't do this, incidents of serious fire will only \ncontinue to increase.\n  As I said, it is only a matter of time before a cataclysmic fire \nstrikes Lake Tahoe, with potential loss of life, habitat, and property. \nAlready, run-off and problems associated with erosion have\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\nthreatened Lake Tahoe's world-renowned crystal blue waters. The last \ntime I was there, scientists told me that if we don't reverse the trend \nof eutrophication of the water, which removes its clear crystal blue \nlook, in 10 years it will be too late and we might as well not bother. \nA serious fire could make this happen even sooner.\n  This amendment helps provide funding to remove dead and dying trees \nfrom Lake Tahoe National Forest where almost one-third of that forest \ntoday is dead or dying.\n  Last year, Senators Reid, Boxer, Bryan, and Congressman Doolittle, \nCongressman Gibbons, and I introduced the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act to \nauthorize the necessary funding to deal with this problem. It is very \ntimely that this bill will be marked up by the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee on Thursday and has already been marked up \nat the subcommittee level in the House.\n  The Domenici-Feinstein amendment could be used in that forest. It \ncould almost be used in the Quincy area. In 1998, Congress \noverwhelmingly passed the Quincy Library Group Project.\n  This legislation authorized a 5-year demonstration project based on \nthe forest management plan assembled by the Quincy Library Group, a \ncoalition of local environmentalists, public officials, timber industry \nrepresentatives, and just plain concerned citizens who came together in \nthe Quincy Library so they could not yell at each other, to resolve \nlongstanding conflicts over timber management of national forests in \nthe area.\n  The project, which is only a pilot, is to see if there is not a \nbetter way to manage our forests by combining strategic fuel breaks \nwith selected mechanical thinning and controlled burn. I have had some \ndisagreements with the Forest Service in the past over Quincy, but I \nbelieve the project is back on track and I am determined to see, if I \ncan, that funding is appropriated to complete the project to the letter \nof the law.\n  I want to quickly speak about one other thing. One of the possibly \nmost cataclysmic fires could occur in the newly designated Sequoia \nNational Monument. This is about 366,000 acres. Once the monument was \ndeclared, two timber mills closed down. I have been working with the \ncommunity in that area to be able to put forward a removal of hazardous \nfuels. These trees are the largest trees in the world. Around these \nlarge trees have built up this dense underbrush, this fuel load that I \nhave spoken about. If this is not removed, this underbrush creates the \nkind of fuel ladder that can effectively destroy the Sequoias.\n  The State of California additionally has prepared an adaptive \nmanagement plan and had been working in the Sequoia area. What they \nshowed was, as you clear certain limited areas around the giant \nSequoias, that the giant Sequoias actually grew bigger and grew fatter \nand were much healthier for it. It is my hope that over the next few \nyears we can reduce the fuel loading on 24 million acres that the \nForest Service has identified as being at this level 3. Level 3 is the \nmost significant fire threat. Then focus on the other 18 million acres \nat jeopardy.\n  Let me just recount. One-third of all of the national forests at \ncatastrophic fire level in the United States are in the State of \nCalifornia. It is the entire Sierra Nevada range, it is the Sequoia, it \nis part of the Plumas and Lassen National Forests, and of course the \nTahoe National Forest. There is, indeed, a lot to be done if we are not \nonly to protect our endangered species but also protect the property \nand the people who live in these areas as well.\n  I think Senator Domenici's legislation is timely. It is well thought \nout. I think making this an emergency and moving in the class 3 areas \nand being able to remove this underbrush is a major step forward in \nprudent forestry management all throughout the West.\n  I thank the Senator. It was a delight to work with him. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to clarify where \nwe are because I think some of our colleagues are slightly confused as \nto the amendment I offered dealing with the roadless area review and \nthe FACA committee process, and the amendment our colleague from New \nMexico has offered, and the Senator from California has just spoken to, \ndealing with fuel reduction in our forests.\n  There is no doubt, what I was attempting to do dealt specifically \nwith the roadless area rule specific to whether there had been a \nviolation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. I was asking the \nSecretary to formulate an advisory committee to review that.\n  I had visited with Senator Domenici and several things came together \nthat I think are important for us to deal with in the immediate. First \nof all, there have already been two lawsuits filed against this \nadministration on the Federal Advisory Committee Act process as it \nrelates to the roadless area review process. We believe a judge will \nmake a decision on those two lawsuits, as to their validity and their \nripeness, by mid-August. What is important here is for the courts to \nclarify whether FACA, as a law, is either real or dead letter.\n  Let me explain that. This administration has been accused and found \nin violation of FACA on several occasions. But the problem is, once the \ncourt has made that determination, the rule was already on the ground. \nSo it is like they violated the law, but so what. The process is over \nwith.\n  What the court will decide this time is, Is FACA a law that should \nintervene prior to a final rule and cause an administrative agency to \nchange its course of direction or action prior to a final rule? That is \nwhat will happen in August.\n  I have decided it is important we do not get in front of that ruling \nby the courts. I think it is very important for this Congress to know \nwhether the law it crafted, known as the Federal Advisory Committee \nAct, is a dead letter or if it is operative. Right now, based on \nfindings, it is a Catch-22: Yes, they violated the law but so what; the \nrule is already in place.\n  That is not the intent of Congress. The intent of Congress is to \ncause a cause of action change in a rulemaking process if the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act has been violated.\n  Then enters the Los Alamos fire and Senator Bingaman and Senator \nDomenici trying to resolve that particular crisis of bad policy and bad \ndecisionmaking coming together to not only create a catastrophic \nenvironmental situation but also ultimately to cost the taxpayers of \nthis country $1 billion, or somewhere near that. That is the tip of an \niceberg of a current forest health problem to which the Senator from \nCalifornia has spoken so clearly.\n  What the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from California saw, \nwitnessed, experienced, with hundreds of lives and hundreds of families \nand lives displaced----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thousands.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is the nature of a catastrophic event that is in the \nnature of forest health.\n  We now have 22 million acres of our forested lands in crisis because \nof the fuel loading that has been talked about because of a management \nstyle of the last 50 years. Yet there seems to be no desire to deal \nwith this on a constructive, environmentally positive basis that begins \nto remove that fuel.\n  The amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, of which I am now a \ncosponsor, which is a substitute offered to my amendment, goes at this \nproblem in a very real and direct way. That is why I think it is so \nimportant that we move forward. I have been advised--and I agree--we \nshould allow the courts to act on the Federal Advisory Committee Act. \nWe will find out whether we have a real law or whether we have a false \nlaw; whether it works or it does not work. We will know that by mid-\nAugust. If they rule otherwise, we have either to come in and revise it \nor I think the Congress should act and intervene against the President \nin his rulemaking process, outside the public policymaking process of \nthe Congress itself. But in the meantime, there is no question in my \nmind, with my activities, looking at the U.S. forest-managed lands--\nlast week I was in Great Falls, MN. Last year, on July 4, they had a \n472,000-acre blowdown. There are fuel loading problems in that State \nand every other State in the Nation that has public forested lands, \nthat are phenomenal in their nature.\n  Let me explain. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, talked \nabout literally having barrels of gasoline on the ground, in equivalent \nBtus of fire capability. It is believed that in\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nthese areas, 22 million acres, at least at the top of the stack, that \nfuel loading equivalency is nearly 10,000 gallons of gasoline per acre \nin equivalent Btu or firepower.\n  Yet our Forest Service and this administration choose not to do \nanything about it. If we are good stewards of the land, we will not \nallow the stand-altering, environmentally crazy policy of catastrophic \nfire of the kind in the forests of New Mexico and the kind that are \nburning across the West today to be the policy of the management of our \nforests.\n  I would be the first to tell you we ought to reenter fire as a \nmanagement tool of the ecosystems of our forests, but fire ought not \nenter an acre of land that has 10,000 gallons of gasoline stored in the \nform of slash and dead and dying timber in equivalent Btu's. That we \ncannot tolerate, or it will truly destroy the land as we know it, the \nenvironment as we know it, the riparian areas as we know them, and \ncertainly habitat for any wildlife, let alone any kind of constructive \nmanagement that would provide the needed fiber for our public in home \nbuilding, paper, and so many materials we have wisely used our forests \nfor over the years.\n  I support Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Feinstein \nas a cosponsor of this substitute. It is critically important.\n  In closing, in the substitute there is an important analysis, and it \nis an analysis that deals with the roadless problem. If the amendment \nof the Senator from New Mexico becomes law, it will cause the Forest \nService to develop a cohesive strategy for protecting people and \nsustaining resources in fire-adaptive ecosystems; in other words, a \nfire strategy to deal with these kinds of fuel loadings. It would then \nhave to place that strategy against the other rulemaking processes that \nare underway.\n  One of those rulemaking processes is the roadless area review or the \nroadless area protection proposal, to see whether that proposal denies \nthe Forest Service the ability to manage these lands to protect them \nfrom catastrophic fire. I find that an important test and a necessary \nanalysis of where we are going and how we want to manage these lands.\n  It also causes them to look at the areas of concern of the Senator \nfrom California--the Sierra Nevada framework and the Sierra Nevada \ndraft plan environmental impact statements. All of those deserve to be \nexamined in light of the fire situation we have on these public lands \nat this moment. We cannot idly sit by and watch hundreds of thousands, \nif not millions, of acres a year burn in wildfires, destroying wildlife \nhabitat, destroying fiber that could be constructively used and, most \nimportant, dramatically altering the ecosystems of those areas that \nembody these catastrophic fires.\n  I support the substitute. It is important we stay in focus on the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act. The courts will rule in August, and \nthen Congress will be able to act according to that ruling if, in fact, \nthe courts have decided the Federal Advisory Committee Act is a dead \nletter in public law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, for this amendment and indicate I am very glad to be a \ncosponsor of it. It is an important amendment which is much needed in \nmy State and throughout much of the country.\n  The problem has been well described by Senator Domenici, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Craig, and others. I do not need to elaborate on \nthat to a great extent, except to say there are many communities in our \nState of New Mexico which genuinely feel threatened because of the fact \nthat they are adjacent to our national forests and the forests have \nbeen allowed to build up underbrush in a way which makes them a fire \nhazard--communities such as Santa Fe and Los Alamos, which have been \nmentioned, Ruidoso, Cloudcroft, and Weed. I know my colleague was \nvisiting with citizens in the small community of Weed, NM, about this \nvery issue. There is no question the time has come when it needs to be \naddressed, and this amendment will allow us to do that on an emergency \nbasis. It is, as I said before, much needed.\n  Let me give a little background. Even before this year's catastrophic \nfires, which have really been a wake-up call to all of us about the \nsignificance of this problem, particularly the fire at Los Alamos, the \nCerro Grande fire, but the Scott Able fire in the southern part of New \nMexico, the Cree fire in the southern part of New Mexico, and the \nViveash fire in northern New Mexico--we have had a series of fires. \nOver, I believe, 65,000 acres in my State have burned so far this year. \nThat does not begin to approach the number of acres perhaps in \nCalifornia, as cited by the Senator from California, but it is a great \nmany acres for our State considering the amount of forests we have. \nWell over 400 homes have been destroyed in our State. So the problem is \nvery real.\n  Last year, in the first session of this Congress, I was very pleased \nthat, on a bipartisan basis, Senator Domenici and I cosponsored a bill, \nS. 1288, entitled the Community Forest Restoration Act which attempted \na demonstration project in New Mexico to begin dealing with this \nproblem of the urban wild land interface, to begin thinning of forest \nareas near these communities.\n  In putting this legislation together, we were able to get the \ncooperation not only of the communities themselves but of many of the \ngroups which take a great interest in the health of our national \nforests, including several of the major environmental groups. I thought \nthis was major progress. The bill passed the Senate unanimously. It \nwent to the House of Representatives. It has been marked up in \nsubcommittee. It will go to the full committee next week.\n  This legislation was very small. It was a demonstration project. It \nwas aimed only at New Mexico communities, but it set a good precedent \nfor the type of thing we are talking about, where the Forest Service \nand the other Federal land management agencies could make grants \navailable to community groups to deal with this problem in a very real \nand responsible way.\n  I particularly appreciate the statement Senator Domenici made in his \npresentation that this amendment, to provide substantial additional \nfunding to the land management agencies to deal with the problem, does \nnot involve any change in environmental laws.\n  Also, this amendment does not involve any change in NEPA, the \nNational Environmental Policy Act. This does not waive that law. This \namendment is consistent with those laws. We are providing resources and \ndirecting that a substantial effort take place to deal with this \nproblem around the communities that are adjacent to our national \nforests. It is very important that this happen.\n\n  I want to have printed in the Record three documents that are \nimportant as background. One is a letter that the New Mexico delegation \nsent to Mike Dombeck, the Chief of the Forest Service, on May 19 of \nthis year, urging that the Forest Service come forward with a proposal \nfor how they will begin to address this problem. The second document is \na response by Chief Dombeck to me on the subject. And the third is a \nfollowup response to Senator Domenici from Chief Dombeck, also alluding \nto what the Forest Service thought they could do to address this very \nreal problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these three letters be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me mention one other aspect of this \nwhich I think is significant, and that is the Forest Service has a \nprogram called a Cooperative Fire Protection Program which they try to \nuse to educate people who own homes in or near the forests and also to \nwork with people who have private homes in our forests, that are \nprivate property, so the benefits of some of this clearing, some of \nthis thinning we are talking about can also be realized by the people \nwho have those homes, and those homes can be better protected as a \nresult.\n  One thing that became obvious to me as a result of the Los Alamos \nfire was that there had been a thinning that had taken place around the \nlaboratory itself, around many of the structures of the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory; and because of that, because of that thinning \nactivity, there was a dramatic\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nreduction in the fire risk to those facilities. We had much less damage \nthere than we wound up having in the town of Los Alamos, where, of \ncourse, no similar thinning or no similar fire risk reduction \nactivities had occurred.\n  I think it is very important that we try to take what we have learned \nabout how to reduce the risks of fire and apply that in a responsible \nway, and do so as soon as possible.\n  For that reason, I am very pleased to see this amendment being \nconsidered. Again, I compliment my colleague for proposing the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\n\n                                               Forest Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2000.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici.\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: With the Senate in final stages of \n     completing the fiscal year 2000 emergency supplemental \n     appropriation, I want to provide you with the information you \n     requested on Forest Service capability to significantly \n     reduce the risk of catastrophic fire in wildland-urban \n     interface areas.\n       I know you agree that the tragic fires in New Mexico and \n     those currently burning in Colorado, are focusing our \n     attention on the critical need to reduce hazardous fuels \n     throughout the national forests and particularly areas \n     adjacent to urban interface areas. The emergency supplemental \n     appropriation gives us an opportunity to immediately take \n     action to avoid similar fire disasters in the future.\n       Enclosed is information identifying agency capability to \n     respond in the immediate and near future based on estimates \n     for completing environmental assessment work. This work can \n     be accomplished within existing authorities. We have \n     established projected implementation based on the date that \n     all planning under the National Environmental Policy Act, \n     Endangered Species Act and other statutes will be completed:\nAcres:                                              Implementation date\n    59,722........................................................(\\1\\)\n    189,098..................................................12/31/2000\n    291,575..................................................09/30/2001\n\\1\\ Currently ready.\n       I want to be sure that as the supplemental bill moves \n     through the appropriations process, you have all the \n     information you need to provide focus on the need to address \n     this critical issue without letting the legislation get \n     overburdened and consequently threatened by other agendas. My \n     staff and I are ready to respond in order to assure you have \n     all necessary information available.\n                                              Mike Dombeck, Chief.\n\n\n       Wildland Urban Interface Hazardous Fuel Treatment Projects\n\n       Listed below are the acres by Region grouped by the date \n     all NEPA, ESA, review, and other planning actions will be \n     completed and the projects will be completed and the projects \n     will be ready for implementation.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Thank you for your letter dated May \n     19, 2000. Like you, I am deeply concerned about the potential \n     for unnaturally intense, catastrophic fires and their impact \n     on communities in New Mexico and throughout the United \n     States. The events of recent weeks make clear that we cannot \n     stand by idly and allow the health of our forest and \n     grassland ecosystems to deteriorate to the point that they \n     cannot provide basic ecological services and pose a risk to \n     the safety of our communities.\n       Unhealthy forest ecosystems evolved through decades of past \n     management and fire suppression. Restoring their health and \n     resiliency and protecting our communities from unnaturally \n     severe wildland fires will take many years. That reality, \n     however, is no excuse for inaction.\n       If emergency funds were made available, we would limit \n     their use to the urban-wildland interface or within \n     designated municipal watersheds that are determined to be at \n     highest risk of unnaturally occurring catastrophic fire. Our \n     activities would focus on the least controversial areas by \n     concentrating on restoring fire-dependent ecosystems and \n     reducing fire risks adjacent to wildland urban interface \n     areas. We would define urban-wildland interface in one of the \n     two following ways:\n       Where urban or suburban populations are directly adjacent \n     to unpopulated areas characterized by wildland vegetation. \n     (Urban and suburban areas are defined as places where \n     population densities exceed 400 people per square mile of \n     area.)\n       Where people and houses are scattered through areas \n     characterized by wildland vegetation. These are areas where \n     population density is from 40 to 400 people per square mile.\n       Treatment methods to minimize fire risk and restore land \n     health in the interface areas would include: thinning, \n     removal or over-accumulated vegetation and dead fuels, \n     prescribed fire, and fuel breaks. All required project level \n     planning, monitoring, consultation, and implementation would \n     be included in our vegetation treatments. Our objective would \n     be to leave forested areas in the interface in a range of \n     stand densities that more fully represent healthy forest \n     conditions.\n       Priority for treatment will be given to interface areas \n     that historically experienced low intensity, high frequency \n     fire and where current conditions favor uncharacteristi- \n     cally intense fires.\n       Projects may also be undertaken in other fire regimes where \n     threats to populations or their water supplies are acute.\n       We would ensure that additional appropriations are spent in \n     a manner that maximizes on-the-ground accomplishments and \n     minimizes controversy, delay, and litigation. For example, \n     projects would be implemented using service contracts that \n     hire local people, volunteers and Youth Conservation Corps \n     members, or by using Forest Service work crews, where \n     appropriate. Where tree removal is necessary to reduce fire \n     risks, these emergency appropriations would only be used to \n     remove trees that are under 12 inches in diameter. \n     Merchantable material that is generated as a byproduct of \n     vegetative treatments could be sold under a separate contract \n     to local industry or the public. We must also monitor our \n     progress and report our results to Congress and the American \n     people to demonstrate our accountability.\n       The type of program I describe will lead to demonstrable \n     results and improvements in the near future. I must make \n     clear, however, that a one-year emergency appropriation will \n     not remedy what ails our forests and threatens our \n     communities. We must fund and build a constituency for active \n     forest restoration based on ecological principles. For \n     example, we can partner with local communities to reduce fuel \n     hazards, improve building codes, and suggest fire resistant \n     landscaping to reduce fire risk. Such efforts can reduce \n     insurance premiums, prevent wildland fires from destroying \n     homes, reduce costs associated with fire suppression, and \n     protect our treasured forests.\n       We expect to soon release a strategy to more broadly \n     address wildland fire risks across National Forest System \n     lands. We need a sustained level of funding to ensure that we \n     can restore fire-dependent ecosystems and protect the lives \n     and property of people in our communities. Restoring our \n     forests not only makes our communities safer, it provides \n     jobs--high paying, quality, family wage jobs.\n       Thank you for your continued interest in the health of our \n     lands and the well-being of our communities.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mike Dombeck, Chief.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                     May 19, 2000.\n     Dr. Michael Dombeck,\n     Chief, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mike: As you know, fires in New Mexico over the past \n     week have burned more than 65,000 acres in New Mexico and \n     destroyed well over 400 homes. While we commend Forest \n     Service efforts to assist in protecting the lives of New \n     Mexico's citizens, their property, and the public's \n     resources, we are deeply concerned about the potential for \n     future, unnaturally intense, catastrophic fires and their \n     impact on communities in New Mexico and throughout the West.\n       The events of the past two weeks in New Mexico demonstrate \n     that we cannot simply allow ``nature to take its course.'' \n     The risks to our communities, Native American resources, and \n     public resources are too great. We must take action to \n     protect our communities and the forest resources upon which \n     they depend. Inaction is not an option.\n       In order to provide adequate, or potentially additional, \n     funding to assist the Forest Service in proactively \n     addressing the risk of catastrophic wildland fires that can \n     threaten communities in the West, as well as the health of \n     our lands and waters, we need your assistance. A good first \n     step in providing us with the information we need is the \n     release of the Forest Service report on the subject currently \n     under review by OMB.\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\n       In addition, we would like you to address what actions the \n     Forest Service can undertake to minimize catastrophic fire in \n     the wildland-urban interface; identify appropriate size \n     limitations for thinning of trees; and provide information \n     about specific contractual arrangements that should be \n     employed to most effectively address the risk of wildland \n     fire in the urban-wildland interface.\n       Thank you for your continued interest in the safety of \n     communities and the health of our lands and waters. We look \n     forward to your prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeff Bingaman.\n     Pete Domenici.\n     Tom Udall.\n     Heather Wilson.\n     Joe Skeen.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. \n3790.\n  Mr. GORTON. This one is not done yet.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe we have not finished this amendment yet.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to call up my amendment and to then debate it at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I think there \nare just two more relatively brief speakers, and we can then finish \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would set this amendment aside, but I have to go. I \ncould come back, I suppose.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then, if it is brief, why don't you go ahead, I suppose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama may proceed to call up his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3790\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the publication of certain \n               procedures relating to gaming procedures)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3790.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mr. Graham, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Grams, \n     Mr. Reid, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Bayh, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3790.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 225, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to publish Class III gaming procedures under part 291 \n     of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the debate \non this amendment be set aside pending the time that Senator Campbell \nand others would be here to debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be set aside until such time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for some time now the Senate has been \ndebating, somewhat interchangeably, two issues; one involves protection \nfor roadless areas and the other involves the important issue of fire \nprevention.\n  I would like to take just a minute or 2 to discuss each one of these \nso that it is clear where we are with respect to this debate.\n  The original amendment offered by the senior Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nCraig, my longtime colleague on the Forestry Subcommittee, would have, \nin effect, presented the Senate with a referendum on the President's \nroadless proposal, a major environmental initiative, certainly \nsupported by millions of Americans. There have been more than 180 \npublic meetings on this roadless initiative, and more than 500,000 \ncomments. This is certainly the centerpiece of the President's \nenvironmental agenda.\n  So had we been presented here in the Senate with an up-or-down vote \non this roadless proposal, despite my friendship with the Senator from \nIdaho, I would have had to oppose that original amendment strongly. To \nme, the President's proposal on roadless areas makes sense for one \nreason: Protecting additional unspoiled areas can produce gains for \nfish runs across this country, as well as improving habitat and \nwatershed quality. These environmental gains outweigh the benefits of \ncommercial development on these particular lands.\n  A lawsuit is pending in Federal court concerning the FACA issue as \nrelated to the roadless initiative. Certainly Congress should allow the \njudicial process to operate without interference.\n  Several of my colleagues have noted that oral arguments are going to \nbe heard on August 7 in that lawsuit. There will be plenty of time for \nthe Senate to act with respect to any issues involving the Federal \nAdvisory Committee. But I say, as the ranking Democrat on the Forestry \nSubcommittee, I think it would be a great mistake for the Senate to, in \neffect, ashcan the President's roadless area proposal. Fortunately, the \nSenate is not going to be asked to vote up or down on that issue today.\n  I have, for some time, along with a number of other colleagues, \npursued an effort to modernize our policy with respect to both road and \nroadless areas. There is much that we can do that protects both habitat \nand also resource-dependent communities. But to have had a referendum \non the President's roadless area proposal today, with a lawsuit \npending, and with millions of Americans in support of that proposal, \nwould have been, in my view, a very serious mistake.\n  Now we are presented with a substitute proposal, initiated by the two \nSenators from New Mexico, involving fire prevention. At this point, we \nare talking about something very different than the original Craig \nproposal. We are talking about an effort to protect homes and \nbusinesses, and, by the way, habitat as well.\n  I want it understood for the record that this amendment is not going \nto affect the completion of the roadless area initiative. That is why I \nam pleased to be able to say that I intend to support this fire \nprevention initiative. Again, this new amendment does not affect the \nroadless area proposal.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Oregon because \neverything he said speaks for me.\n  I will be brief, but I think it is important that I put some comments \ninto the Record because I have a sense that perhaps Senator Craig may \nbe back with a similar amendment at another time, and I think it is \nimportant to lay the groundwork for why I would not support it at that \ntime.\n  I do support what Senators Domenici and Bingaman have brought us. I \ncompliment them for bringing this to us. I know they have been very \ncareful not to do anything in this amendment that would, in fact, stop \nany environmental rules from going forward, in particular the roadless \nrule that we are in the midst of promulgating.\n  I will be supporting the Domenici-Bingaman amendment. I am pleased in \nthe way it has been presented. It is, in fact, a substitute for the \nCraig amendment.\n  Let me ask my friend from New Mexico, does he want to have the floor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, thank you, I say to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right.\n  Mr. President, I have such a good feeling about Interior \nappropriations bills. My friend, Senator Byrd, and Senator Domenici and \nSenator Gorton have worked hard on this Interior bill.\n  For California it is so important. It is wonderful. I just got a \nreminder note from Senator Byrd on the wonderful things in this bill, \nfor which I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Funding for \nthe historic Presidio, for Lake Tahoe, so many others, the Manzanar \nhistorical site. For those of you who may not remember, it was the site \nwhere Japanese-Americans were essentially interned. We are going to \nmake a monument out of it.\n  So when I see an antienvironmental rider come on this beautiful bill, \nit is always distressing because, to me, the Interior appropriations \nbill, it seems to me, should be a positive statement of good things \nthat we are doing for the environment.\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n  So when I heard a rumor that Senator Craig would offer his amendment, \nI decided at that time I would try to talk the Senate out of adopting \nit. And this has become unnecessary.\n  So let me quickly say, I am pleased that what is before us does \nnothing to stop this roadless policy from going into effect.\n  As Senator Wyden has stated, there have been countless meetings on \nit. The fact is, the roadless areas are the remaining gems of a forest \nsystem that has been degraded by centuries of logging and other types \nof heavy use. If we look at the big picture, we are really talking only \nabout setting aside 2 percent of all our land in this country as \nroadless areas. What an important thing that is for us to do because it \nwill in fact preserve our beautiful, priceless environment for future \ngenerations and preserve the fishing industry, stop erosion. It is a \nvery important environmental initiative.\n  So there is no misunderstanding, we know there are many inroads into \nthese roadless areas. In the next 5 years alone, we are going to see \nmore than 1,000 miles of roads inventoried. We are moving into these \npristine areas.\n  At some point, we have to say enough is enough in terms of \ndestruction of our natural wilderness and our wonderful natural \nheritage. I think the U.S. Forest Service has taken a bold and positive \nstep forward with its effort. I am very glad that nothing in this bill \nwill stop them.\n  Let me cite a couple of poll numbers. A recent poll done by some \npollsters from the other side of the aisle found that 76 percent of the \npublic supports the protection of roadless areas, and in my home State, \nasking Republicans and Democrats that question, 76 percent of \nCalifornians support roadless policies.\n  We have editorials that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Oct. 15, 1999]\n\n               Clinton Seeks Legacy of Forest Protection\n\n       In recent years, the Clinton administration has been \n     pushing for a more balanced national forest policy, with a \n     group of timber-oriented congressional leaders resisting \n     every step of the way.\n       The administration's approach, under U.S. Forest Service \n     Chief Mike Dombeck, was hardly radical. It was entirely \n     consistent with the preservationist vision of President \n     Theodore Roosevelt at the turn of the century when he greatly \n     expanded the amount of national forest. It certainly jibes \n     with the views of most Americans that conservation should get \n     greater priority on public land.\n       President Clinton this week took a bold step toward \n     cementing those values by protecting about 40 million acres \n     of U.S. forest land from road building. The proposal would \n     effectively halt logging and mining in those still-pristine \n     areas. About 4 million of the acres are in California, \n     including significant parts of the Sierra Nevada.\n       The timber industry, predictably, howled.\n       ``These are not the king's lands, they are the serfs' \n     lands, they are the people's lands,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, \n     R-Idaho, arguing that Congress should decide forest policy. \n     In a letter to Dombeck, he argued that the Clinton plan would \n     limit forest access.\n       The Clinton plan will not curtail access to any of the \n     380,000 miles of logging roads in national forests--about \n     eight times the length of the interstate highway system. \n     These roads, typically dirt trails wide enough to accommodate \n     a tractor-trailer, have often contributed to erosion, creek \n     sedimentation and other environmental problems.\n       This modest but essential effort to curtail further \n     intrusion into the nation's forests will not spell doom and \n     gloom for the timber industry. Less than 5 percent of timber \n     cut in the U.S. comes from national forests, and less than 5 \n     percent of that volume comes from roadless areas.\n       It is important to note that the Clinton plan is not a done \n     deal; it is the first step in a regulatory process that could \n     take more than a year and most certainly will be influenced \n     by public input.\n       Notably missing from the president's eloquent call to \n     conservation was a commitment to include Alaska's Tongass \n     National Forest, the nation's biggest and the heart of the \n     world's largest remaining expanse of coastal temperate rain \n     forest. Tongass has been a major battleground for lawsuits \n     and legislation over logging in an area with healthy \n     populations of grizzly bears, bald eagles and salmon.\n       These are the people's lands, natural treasures, and \n     Americans who care about conservation must ensure their \n     voices are heard in what promises to be a contentious \n     process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From The Sacramento Bee, Oct. 22, 1999]\n\n     Fight Over Forests--Which Public Lands Should Remain Roadless?\n\n       President Clinton used the Shenandoah Valley as the vista \n     for his recent announcement to seek permanent protections for \n     up to 40 million acres of pristine, roadless national \n     forests. A more appropriate backdrop would have been \n     somewhere between a rock and a hard place. Seeking to \n     manufacture a legacy of forest protection in his remaining \n     months in office, Clinton faces an uphill struggle.\n       The president and Congress are supposed to work together to \n     pass laws that protect forests as wilderness. This is how \n     approximately 34 million acres of the 191 million acre \n     national forest system are now officially protected with the \n     wilderness designation. These 40 million acres that are the \n     target of Clinton's new effort are not now legally designated \n     as wilderness, yet function in nature as such. There are no \n     roads on these lands--each of 5,000 acres or greater--and in \n     many cases they are adjacent to a designated wilderness area.\n       The Republican-led Congress, beholden on this issue to an \n     extractionist ideology, is simply incapable of working with \n     the president on wilderness issues, with the sole notable \n     exception of an emerging bipartisan effort in western Utah. A \n     compromise that could serve multiple interests--additions to \n     wilderness areas in return for additional certainty on other \n     lands for timber harvests--is not possible in this political \n     environment. As Republicans use riders attached onto \n     appropriation bills to thwart forestry planning efforts, many \n     environmental groups have taken up the call for no logging \n     whatsoever on any public lands. The average American, \n     meanwhile, uses more paper products than anybody else on \n     Earth.\n       As Clinton wades into this ideological war, he has few \n     options. Legally, the strategy with the best chance of \n     permanency is to embody new protections for roadless areas \n     within an environmental impact statement that offers a \n     scientific basis for the action.\n       The strategy may prove to be a long shot. On forestry \n     issues in the Sierra, for example, the administration has \n     been unable since 1993 to finish an environmental impact \n     statement that offers final guidelines on how to protect the \n     California spotted owl. Courts, meanwhile, have stalled \n     Clinton's logging strategy for national forests in the \n     Pacific Northwest. Environmental groups successfully \n     challenged the adequacy of the environmental impact \n     statements, which did not include surveys for certain rare \n     species such as mollusks.\n       Ironically, the very legal techniques used by roadless \n     advocates to challenge logging plans will be handy weapons to \n     attack Clinton's roadless plan--if the Forest Service manages \n     to produce the environmental documentation before he leaves \n     office. There's not much time left to count mollusks on 40 \n     million acres of roadless America. In the forests, the \n     biologists better start counting. And in Washington, leaders \n     on both sides of the aisle should contemplate a bipartisan \n     approach to forestry policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                  Clinton's Legacy as Preservationist?\n\n       For someone who paid no attention to environmental issues \n     during his first year in office, Bill Clinton may wind up \n     with an impressive legacy as a preservationist. In addition \n     to his earlier programs to restore the Everglades and to \n     protect Yellowstone, the forests of the Pacific Northwest and \n     the redwoods in California, the president recently set in \n     motion a plan that would, in effect, create 40 million acres \n     of new wilderness by blocking road building in much of the \n     national forest.\n       In recent months, his secretary of the interior, Bruce \n     Babbitt, has been exploring the possibility of additional \n     action under the Antiquities Act of 1906, a little-known \n     statute that allows presidents, by executive order, to \n     protect public lands from development by designating them as \n     national monuments. If used intelligently, the act offers \n     Clinton a useful tool to set aside vulnerable public lands \n     before he leaves office.\n       Because it allows a president to act on his own authority \n     and without engaging Congress, the Antiquities Act is an \n     attractive weapon to any president whose time is running out \n     and who wishes to quickly enlarge his environmental record.\n       In 1978, President Jimmy Carter designated 15 monuments in \n     Alaska, which in turn accelerated passage of a bill that \n     added 47 million acres in Alaska to the national park system. \n     Near the end of his first term, Clinton created the Grand \n     Staircase-Escalante national monument on 1.7 million \n     unprotected acres in Utah.\n       In the last 93 years, all but three presidents--Richard \n     Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush--have designated at \n     least one national monument. There are now more than 100.\n       Congress has never revoked a designation, though it has the \n     power to do so, and some monuments have become revered \n     national parks, like the Grand Canyon. Yet Congress has never \n     really liked the law because it so clearly gives the \n     president the upper hand.\n       All it can do is rescind a designation, which is \n     politically difficult. After Clinton's Grand Staircase-\n     Escalante designation in 1996, a bill requiring congressional \n     approval of any designation exceeding 5,000 acres passed the \n     House, but died in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\n       Babbitt is considering a dozen sites.

Partridge)\n\n       The Clinton administration's recent proposal to protect \n     roadless areas in our national forests is already under \n     attack in Congress. One often-repeated objection is that \n     roads are needed for logging, logging is necessary for a \n     healthy forest, and our forests are suffering a health \n     crisis. As prescriptions go, this one verges on quackery.\n       The term ``forest health'' is so poorly understood and \n     defined nowadays that it's virtually useless. When first \n     coined, in 1932, it referred solely to insects and tree \n     diseases. Now people use it to encompass fire, storms, or \n     virtually anything. But all of the data, both from the Forest \n     Service and studies by many forestry researchers including \n     me, indicate there's been no change in the real condition of \n     our forests, other than through excess and ill-advised \n     logging.\n       In terms of disease and insects, there has been no \n     difference in true forest health for at least 50 years. In \n     fact, a report from the U.S. Forest Service indicated that \n     between 1952 and 1992 the amount of damage from disease, \n     insects and all other major causes--including fire--was less \n     than 1 percent of the standing commercial timber throughout \n     the United States. And the numbers stayed at those levels the \n     entire time, with no ups and downs. The same thing is true of \n     both public and private lands.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Unfortunately, this basic reality often gets distorted in \n     order to accomplish some kind of cutting plan. In the Pacific \n     Northwest, for instance, we hear that in many regions the \n     Douglas fir is threatened by bark beetles. But when we go to \n     those areas and investigate, we find that a significant \n     problem just doesn't exist. There are some beetles, all \n     right, but the overall beetle population is in decline and \n     the amount of damage is extremely low. Of course if you only \n     look for trees with beetles, you'll find them. But in the \n     whole forest the mortality rates hover around the historical \n     rates of 1 to 2 percent. And this is true of root diseases \n     and other pests, of different species of trees, and in \n     different areas of the country.\n       Claiming harm to forest health is merely an excuse to log, \n     but logging in the roadless areas is plain foolishness. The \n     reason they weren't logged long ago is that early loggers \n     knew there was little worthwhile timber in these areas.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Widespread clearcutting has also brought changes in the \n     water cycles, creating rapid runoff and melting during the \n     spring, leaving little available water during the summer, \n     when it's needed most. Even the local weather has been \n     affected: If you change the structure of the forest, you \n     change wind patterns and rainfall as well.\n       In spite of this, I'm more optimistic than I was 15 years \n     ago. Back then, nobody would listen to such concerns. All \n     they could think about was the product and not the results of \n     producing that product. Now even the industry is more \n     sensitive to what it's doing, and it's changing some logging \n     practices.\n       We need to continue to improve the way we maintain our \n     forests. If we cut timber, we have to do it more gently than \n     in the past. And we have to stop using wrong-headed excuses \n     like ``forest health'' to log in the few and fragmented \n     remaining roadless areas that America still treasures. If we \n     destroy such areas through needless incursion, we will leave \n     our descendants far poorer than justified by the small \n     immediate profits, and they will wonder what sort of \n     physicians made such poor judgments about health.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From the Central and East County Contra Costa Times, Oct. 26, 1999]\n\n                        Forests Need Protection\n\n       President Clinton has directed the U.S. Forest Service to \n     produce an environmental impact statement and develop a \n     proposal that potentially will protect more than 40 million \n     roadless acres of its 155 national forests and 20 grasslands. \n     Reactions from the two most vocal sides insist Clinton has \n     erred, but he is moving in the right direction.\n       The timber industry is angry about losing future access to \n     these woods. Where will its product come from? Hmm. Well, \n     probably the same place it comes from now--and that's not \n     primarily federal forests. Only 5 percent of the annual \n     timber load comes from national land and only 5 percent of \n     that comes from areas that could come under protection. \n     Besides, the 380,000 miles of road already in forests--more \n     miles than the interstate system--will still be usable.\n       That the plan provides for only 40 million acres and only \n     inventoried, roadless areas 5,000 acres or larger upsets many \n     environmentalists, as does not including Alaska's Tongass \n     Forest. The heart of the world's largest remaining expanse of \n     coastal temperate rainforest, Tongass is under siege, its \n     supporters feel. Logging does take place in specified areas, \n     and efforts to increase cut levels in Tongass are already in \n     progress. Supporters feel an urgent need for more federal \n     protection and were intensely worried when this proposal that \n     excludes Tongass was chosen by Clinton.\n       The plan also deals almost strictly with road-building; it \n     will prohibit it, which hampers development. \n     Environmentalists would of course like the regulation to stop \n     logging, mining, many kinds of recreation and other \n     exploitation.\n       Clinton went with what was the weakest of his choices of \n     plans, particularly making no rule to protect wildlife, to \n     avoid needing congressional approval. His is an effort to \n     have something happen instead of nothing. Part of the \n     proposal also calls for a 60-day (only about 45 days to go \n     now) public review and comment process, and all sides are \n     hoping your voice will make a difference on what the final \n     plan becomes. (Send comments to: U.S. Forest Service-CAET, \n     Attn: Roadless Areas NOI, P.O. Box 221090, Salt Lake City, UT \n     84122.)\n       We encourage you to support this effort. Only about 18 \n     percent of the 192 million acres of federal forests are now \n     protected from development. Roadless areas are reference \n     areas for research, bulwarks against invasive species, and as \n     aquatic strongholds for fish as well as vital habitat and \n     migration routes for wildlife species, especially those \n     requiring large home ranges. Tongass by merit of its \n     uniqueness should be included in any plan that will protect \n     it.\n       We also would like to see forest lands remain untouched \n     where they can so that they will still be around for \n     centuries to come and our children won't have to explain to \n     their grandchildren what forests were.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. These editorials are in favor of roadless protections. \nThe two Senators from New Mexico have offered us a great service \nbecause they have essentially, by their amendment, stopped us from a \nvery controversial amendment that was antienvironment, that the \nadministration would have been very opposed to, and may well have \ncaused a veto of this bill. I thank them again.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, I hope he will not \nbring this back to us. I think it would drive a wedge into the heart of \nour environmental heritage. I hope that will not happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to add \n$240 million to the budgets of the Bureau of Land Management and the \nForest Service for fuels reduction on our public lands.\n  In April 1999, the General Accounting Office reported to the Congress \nthat 39 million acres on the national forests in the interior West are \nat high risk of catastrophic wildfire. The GAO also stated in that same \nreport to Congress that the ``most extensive and serious problem \nrelated to the health of national forests in the interior West is the \nover-accumulation of vegetation, which has caused an increasing number \nof large, intense, uncontrollable, and catastrophically destructive \nwildfires.''\n  As we've seen this summer on the Rim of the Grand Canyon in my state \nof Arizona, on the Hanford Reach in Washington State, in the community \nof Los Alamos, New Mexico, and now in Colorado and other western \nstates, it's time to pay the piper. If we don't spend the money now to \ntreat the forests and other public lands, mechanically and through the \nuse of fire, we will pay later--and we will pay a lot more.\n  The National Research Council and FEMA have recognized wildland fires \nin California in 1993 and Florida in 1998 as among the defining natural \ndisasters of the 1990s. The 1991 Oakland, CA fire was ranked by \ninsurance claims as one of the ten most costly all-time natural \ndisasters. And in terms of damage, the magnitude of these catastrophic \nfires was compared with the Northridge earthquake, Hurricane Andrew and \nthe flooding of the Mississippi and Red River.\n  As the findings of these organizations reveal, we are setting \nourselves up for costly and deadly disaster unless we act now and send \nmoney to the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management for \nhazardous fuels reduction in the wildland/urban interface.\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\n  In response to the GAO report, the Forest Service is working on a \nCohesive Strategy to restore and maintain fire-adapted ecosystems \nacross the interior West. I've seen a draft of that report, and the \nprice tag on the draft is about $12 billion over 15 years to treat 60 \nmillion acres on the National Forest. As I understand it, the Forest \nService had hoped to release a final Strategy about a month ago, but \nthis Administration's OMB has put a hold on the Strategy as too \nexpensive.\n  I'm not willing to wait until Flagstaff or Tucson or any other \ncommunity virtually surrounded by the National Forest burns. I support \nproviding the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management with \nemergency funds, assuming that the Administration designates these \nfunds as emergency funds as required by the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n  Mr. President, I also want to draw my colleagues' attention to the \ncomments of Stewart Udall that were published in the Arizona Republic \non Thursday, July 6th. As my colleagues know, Stewart Udall, who now \nlives in the fire-threatened community of Santa Fe, New Mexico, served \nas Secretary of the Interior and represented Arizona in the House of \nRepresentatives. Mr. Udall notes with complete accuracy that we have \naltered the ecology of our forests and that it is only a matter of time \nbefore these man-made tinderboxes will ignite. Mr. Udall implores \ncitizens to unite and demand restoration plans and aggressive, science-\noriented, landscape-scale restoration action plans to prevent Los \nAlamos-style disasters.\n  Mr. Udall praises an organization of which I, too, am proud, the \nEcological Restoration Institute, located at Northern Arizona \nUniversity, and its leader, Dr. Wallace Covington. Mr. Udall opines, \nand I agree, that with appropriate support, the Ecological Restoration \nInstitute can show other forested states how to use controlled burns \nand mechanical thinning to eliminate the threat of devastating fires.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these remarks of Mr. \nUdall be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, July 6, 2000]\n\n                   Let's Begin To Manage Our Forests\n\n                         (By Stewart L. Udall)\n\n       Santa Fe.--As I survey the charred remains of the ``Cerro \n     Grande'' fire that raged through Los Alamos, N.M., and its \n     National Nuclear Laboratory, I am reminded that we have \n     created an environment that invites a monster to rampage \n     through our forests and threaten many communities.\n       In the Southwest, we have whetted its appetite by providing \n     an overabundance of ponderosa pines and by mismanagement that \n     has built a ladder of small, sickly trees that allows fires \n     to leap into the crowns of old-growth yellow-bellies and into \n     our mountain towns and homes. Meanwhile, we have wasted \n     precious time looking for someone to blame and arguing over \n     the definition of logging.\n       By altering the ecology of our ponderosa pine forest lands \n     for a century, we have created unnatural conditions where \n     fire can no longer play its natural role. Unhealthy forests \n     abound in the West, and it is only a matter of time before \n     these man-made tinderboxes are ignited and hapless ``disaster \n     areas'' are proclaimed by presidents.\n       Before Western settlement began, fire strayed mostly on the \n     ground, working its way through the grasses every few years \n     as nature's steward, cleaning up the debris on the forest \n     floor. Scientists at the Ecological Restoration Institute in \n     Flagstaff have been telling us that the size and frequency of \n     the recent fires have never before occurred in our ponderosa \n     forests. They report, too, that the fires are growing larger, \n     more damaging and more expensive and difficult to suppress.\n       Concerned citizens must unite and demand restoration plans \n     and action that will reduce dangers and initiate campaigns to \n     restore our forests and make them resilient and sustainable. \n     Party lines and political agendas have no place in the \n     upcoming battle. Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona and \n     Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, have set an \n     excellent example by locking arms and supporting projects to \n     show what can be done to restore forest lands.\n       It will be incredibly short sighted if Arizona's affected \n     cities do not, working in concert with the Forest Service, \n     develop aggressive, science-oriented, landscape-scale \n     restoration action plans and begin to implement them soon. \n     Preventing Los Alamos-style disasters from decimating Arizona \n     communities will test the grit and gumption of the Forest \n     Service. And if emergency measures or funds are needed to get \n     action started, it will also test the foresight and \n     leadership of the state's congressional delegation.\n       Arizona's Ecological Restoration Institute is a national \n     asset. It is led by Dr. Wallace Covington, a scientist who \n     knows more about the ecology of ponderosa forests than any of \n     his colleagues. With appropriate support, the institute can \n     show other ponderosa states how to use controlled burns and \n     thinning to eliminate the threat of devastating fires.\n       In a rich country, it is downright stupid to spend billions \n     each year to put out destructive fires when modest resources \n     can be invested to prevent such disasters. The bill presented \n     to the federal government for fire suppression and \n     reparations at Los Alamos is mounting daily toward $800 \n     million. Experts are telling us this conflagration could have \n     been prevented by forest-management measures costing $15 \n     million to $20 million. When will we get smart?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nintroduced by the Senator from Idaho, Senator Larry Craig, to require \nthe United States Forest Service to establish a Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act committee to study and report on the proposed roadless \narea initiative and proposed transportation guidelines rule.\n  I have serious concerns regarding the process implemented by the \nUnited States Forest Service in developing these proposed rules. The \nHouse Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Forests and Forest \nHealth initiated a review on October 28, 1999, requesting documents \nfrom the Forest Service and the White House regarding development of \nthe proposed roadless rule. While reviewing thousands of pages of \ndocuments provided by the Clinton administration, the committee found \nthat the administration had held a number of meetings with, and used \ndraft language, legal memoranda, and survey research data prepared by, \na select group of representatives from national environmental \norganizations including: the Heritage Forest Campaign; the Wilderness \nSociety; Natural Resources Defense Council; USPIRG, Earth Justice Legal \nDefense Fund, Audubon Society; and the Sierra Club.\n  In addition, the committee found no evidence of any effort to meet \nwith or involve other groups or interested parties, and that the USFS' \npush to complete the proposed roadless initiative led to the use of \npoor data and errors in documentation, as is evidenced by letters from \nthe National Forests and regional offices to the Washington Office \nexpressing concern over the accuracy of the information being \ntransmitted. For example, in one letter a USFS employee stated, ``This \nis an estimate that I hope we are not held accountable for.''\n  This reliance by a Federal agency upon a select group of individuals \nfor the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations is a de facto \nestablishment of an advisory committee, an activity that must be \nconducted in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). \nFACA requires any agencies that establishes an advisory committee to \nfile a formal charter, publish notice of all meetings in the Federal \nRegister, ensure that all meeting are open to the public, keep minutes \nfor each meeting, designate a Federal officer who must be present at \neach meeting, and must ensure that membership of the committee \nrepresents a cross section of groups interested in the subject--in this \ncase the management and use of national forests.\n  This provision is also contained in the National Forest Management \nAct of 1976 (NFMA).\n  Unfortunately, the United States Forest Service's proposed roadless \nrule was developed without meeting any of the above FACA requirements. \nInstead, the Forest Service developed this rule in meetings with a \nsmall, insular group that represented only one, limited interest. \nFurthermore, the meetings were conducted behind closed doors and \nwithout any public notice.\n  Once again, the Clinton/Gore administration has demonstrated its \nunwillingness to include those most affected by federal land management \ndecisions in developing land use policy. Instead of finding a way to \ninclude state and local governments, industry, recreationists and any \nother group interested in using and enjoying our national forests, this \nadministration has chosen the politics of divisiveness and has excluded \nthose who will ultimately have to live with the final decision from the \ndevelopment process. The\n\n[[Page S6518]]\n\nonly inevitable conclusion from this kind of politics will be first, \nexclusion from the process, and finally exclusion from the forests \nthemselves.\n  I support this amendment, and encourage the Forest Service to take \nthis opportunity rethink its current process and to reconsider its \nproposed actions at a more appropriate level. The decisions being made \npursuant these rules would be more responsive to local communities and \nforest health concerns if they were conducted properly and not in \nviolation of current law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as manager of this bill, I have been \nextraordinarily gratified by this debate on something I thought might \nbe very controversial, but the Senator from New Mexico and his allies \nhave given us a wonderful, totally bipartisan compromise on a \nsignificant issue, one I believe personally to be very constructive and \nvery important. Rather than say anything more about it, I think we \nshould take advantage of this opportunity and call for the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the secondary \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank everyone. There have been so \nmany people working on this amendment. It has boiled down to a page and \na half, but it is a very good amendment. It will permit the Forest \nService and the BLM to do a lot of things they otherwise would not be \nable to do.\n  I am very thrilled today. I had originally nicknamed this bill \n``happy forests'' because I thought maybe if we cleaned them up and \ntook all this gasoline, using that figuratively, that is waiting around \nto burn them down--I thought they might just smile; they might just be \nhappy forests. I want to say that is going to be the title of the bill. \nIt has another fancy title. But when it passes today, let us just put \nin the Record, Senator Domenici is going to call this the happy forest \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Hearing none, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3806.\n  The amendment (No. 3806) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3795, as modified, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3795), as modified, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3807\n\n (Purpose: To make emergency funds available to the United States Fish \nand Wildlife Service for salmon restoration and conservation efforts in \n                          the State of Maine)\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Ms. \n     Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 3807.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 121, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       For an additional amount for salmon restoration and \n     conservation efforts in the State of Maine, $5,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended, which amount shall be made \n     available to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to \n     carry out a competitively awarded grant program for State, \n     local, or other organizations in Maine to fund on-the-ground \n     projects to further Atlantic salmon conservation or \n     restoration efforts in coordination with the State of Maine \n     and the Maine Atlantic Salmon Conservation Plan, including \n     projects to (1) assist in land acquisition and conservation \n     easements to benefit Atlantic salmon; (2) develop irrigation \n     and water use management measures to minimize any adverse \n     effects on salmon habitat; and (3) develop and phase in \n     enhanced aquaculture cages to minimize escape of Atlantic \n     salmon: Provided, That, of the amounts appropriated under \n     this paragraph, $2,000,000 shall be made available to the \n     Atlantic Salmon Commission for salmon restoration and \n     conservation activities, including installing and upgrading \n     weirs and fish collection facilities, conducting risk \n     assessments, fish marking, and salmon genetics studies and \n     testing, and developing and phasing in enhanced aquaculture \n     cages to minimize escape of Atlantic salmon, and $500,000 \n     shall be made available to the National Academy of Sciences \n     to conduct a study of Atlantic salmon: Provided further, That \n     the amounts appropriated under this paragraph shall not be \n     subject to section 10(b)(1) of the National Fish and Wildlife \n     Foundation Establishment Act (16 U.S.C. 3709(b)(1)): Provided \n     further, That the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation shall \n     give special consideration to proposals that include matching \n     contributions (whether in currency, services, or property) \n     made by private persons or organizations or by State or local \n     government agencies, if such matching contributions are \n     available: Provided further, That amounts made available \n     under this paragraph shall be provided to the National Fish \n     and Wildlife Foundation not later than 15 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act: Provided further, That the entire \n     amount made available under this paragraph is designated by \n     Congress as an emergency requirement under section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)).\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting the Senator \nfrom Washington and the Senator from West Virginia for crafting an \nexcellent bipartisan appropriations bill for these very important \nprograms that matter so much to each of us in all our States. They have \nworked very well together and brought to the Senate for its \nconsideration a bill that deserves support. I commend their efforts in \nthat regard.\n  The amendment I am offering on behalf of myself and the senior \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, concerns an issue of tremendous \nimportance and urgency to the State of Maine. The issue involves the \nFederal Government's proposal to list the Atlantic salmon in the State \nof Maine under the Endangered Species Act. More specifically, the issue \nbefore us is whether the Federal Government will support the efforts of \nthe State of Maine and other organizations to restore and conserve the \nAtlantic salmon in our State. Our amendment would appropriate $5 \nmillion in emergency funds for this very purpose.\n  I will give all of my colleagues an idea of just how critical it is \nfor these funds to be invested in our State this year. This situation \nis truly an emergency. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service have proposed to list certain \nAtlantic salmon in Maine as an endangered species. Under an agreement \nreached last month between the services and the two organizations that \nfiled suit in Federal court seeking emergency listing of the salmon, \nthe services have agreed to make a final decision on whether or not to \nlist the Atlantic salmon as endangered by November 17 of this year.\n  I emphasize this point: The services have already given up their \nstatutory and--what is usually a matter of course--routine ability to \nseek an extension of time in which to make a determination of whether \nor not to list the Atlantic salmon in our State under the ESA. In \nshort, the time is now to demonstrate a Federal financial commitment to \nsalmon in our State and that a listing under the Endangered Species Act \nis not necessary to conserve and restore Maine's magnificent Atlantic \nsalmon.\n  The stakes are decidedly high and the services' rush to judgment \nunfortunate. A decision to list the Atlantic salmon under the ESA could \nthreaten the livelihood of thousands of Mainers, particularly in the \neastern part of the State of Maine. This is one of the most beautiful \nsections of our State; unfortunately, it is one of the most challenged \neconomically.\n  At risk is a $68-million-a-year agriculture industry employing 1,500 \nMainers, a $100-million-a-year blueberry industry supporting 8,000 \njobs, a developing cranberry industry into which more than $500 million \nhas been invested already, and a forest products industry that is the \nlinchpin of Maine's economy. As Maine's independent Governor, Angus \nKing, put it, a listing would be ``a devastating economic blow to a \nregion of the State least able to endure it.''\n  The $5 million we are seeking would make a substantial contribution \nto salmon conservation and restoration\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\nefforts in our State. The funds would be made available to the National \nFish and Wildlife Foundation, which has made a commitment to us to work \nvery closely with the State of Maine to ensure that every single dollar \nis spent effectively. The funds would be used to assist in land \nacquisition and conservation easements to benefit Atlantic salmon, to \ndevelop irrigation and water use management measures, to minimize any \nadverse effects on salmon habitat, to develop and phase in enhanced \nagriculture cages to minimize the risk of escape, to install and \nupgrade weirs and fish collection facilities, and to conduct risk \nassessments, fish marking, and salmon genetics studies and testing.\n\n  The need for these emergency funds is right now. As noted, a listing \ndecision is expected to be made early in the next fiscal year. The $5 \nmillion we are requesting needs to be appropriated prior to the Federal \nGovernment making its decision on whether or not to list the species, \nif it is to make a difference. We strongly believe that vigorous and \neffective salmon conservation and restoration efforts are needed in the \nState of Maine, but that listing the salmon as an endangered species is \nsimply not the way to go. If these emergency funds are not appropriated \nthis year, we will have missed an opportunity to convince the services \nthat listing Atlantic salmon as endangered is not warranted. And we \nwill have missed an opportunity of great importance to the people of \nDowneast Maine.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for their invaluable assistance on this critical matter. \nSenators Gorton, Byrd, and Stevens have worked very hard to help us get \nto this point, and I have confidence that they will see this crucial \namendment through to its enactment.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the amendment is acceptable to both \nmanagers of the bill, and I will urge its adoption following the \nremarks by the senior Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Collins \nin offering this amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill to make \navailable $5 million in emergency supplemental funding for the \nrestoration of Atlantic salmon. This is an issue that is critically \nimportant to the State of Maine. In 1997, the Fish and Wildlife Service \nand the National Marine Fisheries Service (the Services) \nenthusiastically endorsed the Maine Atlantic Salmon Conservation Plan \nas the best possible approach to restoring these fish to Maine rivers. \nUnfortunately, this five-year plan was essentially shut down less than \nhalfway into its implementation when the Services re-initiated a \nproposed listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on November 17, \n1999.\n  This short-sighted action has placed in jeopardy an innovative and \ncooperative restoration strategy involving habitat restoration, water \nquality improvement, and widespread restocking programs statewide. The \nServices have yet to demonstrate what additional benefits will be \nafforded the salmon through such a designation despite my repeated \nrequests for such information.\n  We in Maine have worked hard and made many sacrifices to restore our \ntreasured Atlantic salmon. I continue to believe that a fully \nimplemented Maine Plan remains the best means of restoring these fish \nand there is no benefit in cutting short such a promising effort.\n  Unfortunately, the Services have entered into an agreement with \nlitigants that requires them to make their final listing determination \nby November 17, 2000. This action precludes the possibility of seeking \na six month extension, as allowed under the ESA, to resolve any \nquestions of scientific uncertainty. Many such questions have been \nraised. Questions range from whether or not these fish actually \nconstitute a genetically distinct population segment as defined by the \nESA to whether the Services' river specific hatchery stocking program \nhas produced any benefits and is an appropriate restoration strategy. I \nhave asked the National Academy of Sciences to thoroughly review the \nquality of the science that forms the basis of this proposed listing. \nThis information will guide future restoration efforts in Maine. The \nfunding under consideration today will make such a review possible.\n  Additionally, the Services have not undertaken a quantitative risk \nassessment to ascertain the relative importance of various factors \nwhich may influence salmon survival. Without such a risk assessment, we \nhave no way of knowing if the Services are focusing on the right \nproblems or potential problems and there is no clear way for the \nServices to evaluate what more needs to be done. In essence, the \nServices have no way of knowing if they are asking the impossible of \nthe State. The State of Maine has been asking for such an assessment \nfor over one year. Since the beginning, the Maine Plan has been \nincredibly dynamic and has evolved to address new problems or concerns. \nIn fact, the State has addressed in some form every concern raised by \nthe Services. This risk assessment will provide the necessary guidance \nto again strengthen salmon restoration efforts and target limited \nresources most effectively.\n  This risk assessment is but one example of the critical activities \nthat need to take place prior to November 17th if the Services are to \nmake an informed decision as to whether or not to list. The State of \nMaine is poised to take further action, such as upgrading weirs at the \nriver mouths, conducing genetic analyses, and testing fish marking \ntechniques, that might render a listing unnecessary. Unfortunately, \ndespite the tripling of the State budget for salmon restoration, there \nis not sufficient funding available to complete these critical \nactivities. If the State is able to complete these priority items prior \nto the November 17th deadline, we may be able to render a listing \nunnecessary. I would hope that the Services will adhere to the letter \nand spirit of the Endangered Species Act and fully consider the \nrestoration activities paid for by these funds when making their final \ndetermination whether or not to list.\n  I would like to thank Senators Gorton, Byrd, and Stevens for all of \ntheir assistance in making sure that this money is made available to \nMaine. I know that they share my concerns regarding the importance of \nthe recovery of U.S. salmon populations, particularly Senators Gorton \nand Stevens who have been working hard with people in their home states \nto restore populations of Pacific salmon. The funding we are seeking \ntoday was originally included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill. I \nam pleased that the managers acknowledge how time sensitive this issue \nis and are receptive to including it on this bill which is moving more \nrapidly. I can assure you that this money will make a tremendous \ndifference in our efforts to restore Atlantic salmon in Maine. Thank \nyou.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have at least three reasons to urge \nadoption of the amendment of the Senator from Maine. The first, of \ncourse, is the eloquence that she has evidenced in presenting it and \nher persistence in pursuing this particular course of action.\n  Second is that this is directly analogous to the first amendment we \nadopted today by the two Senators from Minnesota. It is a decision, \neffectively, that we have already made that this money should be \nappropriated on an emergency basis. It is included in another bill that \nis slower to pass. Unfortunately, it was not included in the military \nconstruction bill, which did have a number of emergency expenditures in \nit.\n  The third comes even closer to home for this Senator because, as the \nSenator from Maine knows, Washington and Oregon, and for that matter, \nCalifornia, do have listed salmon species.\n  I may say to the Senator from Maine, we got an advance appropriation \nand it didn't prevent the listings from taking place, by any stretch of \nthe imagination. But I think it did help my State and the other two \nStates to prepare for what is going to be a long campaign toward their \nrecovery. The hope that a listing may be prevented is a worthy goal on \nthe part of the Senator from Maine. But even if it doesn't happen, this \nwill have helped in connection with whatever the steps are thereafter. \nIf the junior Senator from Maine would not mind, we can accept this \namendment now and, of course, give other Senators an opportunity to \nspeak. So she is ahead and she might as well win while she has a \nchance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we in the minority share the feelings \nexpressed by the distinguished manager of the bill. We, too, yield to \nthe eloquence and the grace of the distinguished Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues for their \ngracious comments and willingness to work with me on this very \nimportant issue. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3807) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment at the \nclose of my remarks. It involves a section of this bill which I believe \nwas authored by Senator Domenici of New Mexico. I just spoke to him a \nminute ago to tell him I will be offering this amendment to strike his \nsection. He said to proceed. He will come to the floor in a few \nmoments, and I am sure he is following this debate in the meantime.\n  First, I thank Senator Byrd and Senator Gorton for their fine work on \nthis Interior appropriations bill. I think I have expressed the \nfeelings of many Members of the Senate that this is a spending bill \nthat is near and dear to our hearts. It involves so many of our \nNation's greatest treasures, and the stewardship which they showed on \nthis bill will not only reflect their feelings, but will inure to the \nbenefit of generations to come, if we do it right.\n  This bill is considerably different and, in my estimation, \nconsiderably better than the bill in previous years. In the past, there \nhave been the so-called environmental riders that have been added on a \nvariety of different issues. Most of them involved public lands and how \nthey were to be used.\n  I come from the State of Illinois. We have some public land in \nIllinois. We have a national forest in Illinois. We have part of a \nNational Park System--a very small part. I know that some of my \ncolleagues from the Western States have a much different situation. \nMany of them represent States where the majority of the land is owned \nby the Federal Government. I am sure that is an awkward situation, at \nbest. I can't quite imagine all of the ramifications of that policy, of \nowning that public land and managing it. But I am sure it affects their \ndaily lives and the economy of their States.\n  Having said that, though, I think all of us, whether we live in one \nof those States with a large portion of publicly owned land or whether \nwe live in some other part of the country, have a vested interest in \nthis debate about the use of the public lands. The reason we have a \nvested interest is twofold. First, these lands are being managed now by \nthis Presidential administration in a temporary way. Soon there will be \nanother President. It could be President Gore; it could be President \nBush. I am not certain what the outcome of the election will be. But \nthe next administration will then be handed the responsibility of \nmanaging this public land.\n  Each successive administration, each President, and Congress, for \nthat matter, have a voice in determining how that land is to be \nmanaged. And if they do the job right, in my estimation, they will hand \noff to the next generation succeeding an even better stewardship of \nthis Federal land. I drew from my desk a quote from the Congressional \nRecord. It is a quote from a former Republican President of the United \nStates by the name of Theodore Roosevelt. For those familiar with the \nadministration of President Theodore Roosevelt, you know he created the \nfirst national park and that he had a special interest in conserving \nand protecting our natural heritage and, particularly, in establishing \npublic lands to protect them for future generations. This short quote \nsummarizes his philosophy and, I might add, my own:\n\n       We must ask ourselves if we are leaving for future \n     generations an environment that is as good or better than \n     what we found.\n\n  That is a very simple, straightforward statement. I keep it in my \ndesk here because, quite honestly, when the Interior appropriations \nbill comes up, that question is being asked of us. Are we going to \nmanage the public lands of America in a way that future generations \nwill look back and say we did a good job and protected that legacy from \nprevious generations? It has been handled and managed well under your \nstewardship.\n  I think that is the test. It is the test of this appropriations bill, \nand it is the test of every amendment to that appropriations bill. That \nis half of the test. The other half of the test goes beyond our \nobligation to explain to future generations, if we did a good job--it \ngoes to the question as to whether or not we have met our \nresponsibility to God's creation because on these public lands we find \na great many species, a lot of different plant life, wild flowers, \ngrasses, which are things that, frankly, depend on our good \nstewardship. If we don't treat those lands well, we not only stand to \ndisappoint future generations, we stand to destroy our natural legacy.\n  So when we talk about environmental issues, a lot of people like to \ncategorize those as some kind of bureaucratic gobbledygook jargon in \nWashington. I think it is much more than that. It gets down to those \ntwo fundamental questions. At the end of the day, when we are called to \njudgment for our public service, can we say to future generations that \nthe public lands you entrusted us with are given to you in at least as \ngood a shape as we received them, and maybe better, and that we \nprotected God's creation in a reasonable and thoughtful way during our \nyears of management? That is the underlying debate that we hear on the \nfloor of the Senate when we discuss so-called environmental \nriders; that is, questions of environmental policy raised in the \nInterior appropriations bill.\n\n  Let me address the specific issue before us in the amendment I will \noffer. The Bureau of Land Management is part of the Department of the \nInterior. It is entrusted with administering millions of acres of our \nNation's valuable and diverse public lands located primarily in 12 \nWestern States, including the State of Alaska.\n  Currently, the BLM manages more Federal lands than any other public \nagency. BLM oversees some 40 percent of our Nation's Federal lands--\nroughly 264 million acres of surface land predominantly in the western \npart of the United States. But acreage alone doesn't tell the story.\n  Our Nation's public lands contain a wealth of natural, cultural, \nhistorical, economic, and archaeological resources that belong to \neverybody. They are, in fact, part of the Treasury of the United \nStates--not in dollar terms, but when you want to measure the assets of \nthis country, you would certainly step back and say: I want to include \nnot only what we find in our Treasury but our Grand Canyon, \nYellowstone, Yosemite, and all of the land owned by the people of this \ncountry. These are our assets that we have a responsibility to protect \nand manage.\n  The natural and ecological diversity of the BLM-managed public lands \nis perhaps the greatest of any Federal agency. BLM manages extensive \ngrasslands and forests, islands, wild rivers, high mountains, arctic \ntundra, and desert landscapes. As a result of the diversity of habitat, \nmany thousands of wildlife and fish occupy these lands. These fish and \nwildlife species represent a wealth of recreational, national, and \neconomic opportunities for local communities and States in our Nation.\n  The single most extensive use of public land under the jurisdiction \nof the BLM is grazing in the lower 48. Of the roughly 179 million acres \nof public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management outside of \nAlaska, grazing is allowed on almost 164 million acres out of 179 \nmillion, and millions of these acres also contain valuable and \nsensitive fish, wildlife, archaeological, recreation, or wilderness \nvalues.\n  At the present time, the BLM authorizes through the issuance of \ngrazing permits approximately 17,000 livestock operators to graze on \nthese 164 million acres of public land. These permits and public land \ngrazing that they allow are important to thousands of Western livestock \noperators. Many of these livestock operators and ranchers use these \npermits to help secure bank\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\nloans to provide important financial resources for their operations.\n  BLM typically issues grazing permits for a 10-year period on public \nlands. Many current grazing permits were issued in the late 1980s and \nare now expiring in large numbers over 2- or 3-year periods of time. \nThese permits numbering in the thousands present the BLM with an \nunusually large and burdensome short-term renewable task.\n  We addressed this very issue in previous Interior appropriations \nbills. Can the Bureau of Land Management keep up with expiring permits \nor leases and reissue them in timely fashion so that someone who is \nusing the land, the livestock operations, can continue their business, \nnot lose money, and not face uncertainty when it comes to financing \ntheir operations?\n  The unusually large number of expiring grazing permits has created a \ndual dilemma for the Bureau and for its many public constituents. \nWestern livestock operators who currently hold these expiring permits \nare worried that delays in the processing by the Bureau may cause them \nto lose their permits or otherwise threaten their ability to use the \npermits to secure bank loans for their operations.\n\n  Conservationists-environmentalists--meanwhile believe that the Bureau \nhas a responsibility to perform responsibly for the governmental and \nenvironmental stewardship of these lands and analyze the grazing to \nmake certain that if there is to be a renewal it is done in a \nreasonable and responsible way.\n  It is entirely understandable to me being from my State that ranchers \nare concerned about issues of security and predictability. So are my \nfarmers. I understand this. Likewise, we require the BLM to wisely \nmanage and protect our public lands for all Americans.\n  The on-the-ground permit level decisionmaking that should legally \naccompany the BLM's permit renewal process is fundamentally important \nto the ecologically sound and multiple-use management of our Nation's \npublic lands.\n  The BLM must conduct what we call a NEPA, which is the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, compliance and land use planning performance \nreview before reauthorizing permits. In other words, before they give \nthe permit back to the livestock operator to go back on public land to \nuse it for grazing, they take a look at public land: How are we doing? \nAre we doing this in a responsible environmental way so ultimately the \nland is not so degraded or changed as to lessen its value or to \nendanger species and wildlife? That is a responsibility of BLM. It is \nan important one.\n  To meet the review requirements under NEPA and other existing Federal \nlaws and regulations, the BLM uses a lot of different teams composed of \nagency professionals who look at wildlife, range, wild horse, bureau \nand cultural, and recreation wilderness activities. The BLM also \nsolicits public comments and relevant information from a wide array of \npeople interested in range management, including hunters, fishermen, \nand many others.\n  The simple fact is this: On most public land, grazing allotments and \nall of the important decisions that determine the condition of public \nrangeland resources are contained in the terms and conditions of the \ngrazing permits and in the annual decision about the amount, timing, \nand location of livestock grazing. These decisions determine whether \nstreams in the areas will flourish or be degraded and whether wildlife \nhabitat will be maintained or destroyed. Public involvement in this \nprocess is essential for balanced public management. Without the \napplication of NEPA and related laws, the American public has no real \nvoice in public rangeland management.\n  Let me at this time give you an illustration. A picture is worth more \nthan a thousand words. Any Senator is good for a thousand words at the \ndrop of a hat. This picture will tell you an interesting story of a \nNEPA review of grazing on BLM land.\n  Let me drop some of these acronyms and abbreviations and try to speak \nEnglish so those following the debate will understand.\n  The ecological picture here is one of the Santa Maria River in \nwestern Arizona, which has improved dramatically as a result of permit \nmanagement changes under the environmental policies of the BLM.\n  It is important to note that the BLM continues to allow grazing in \nthe areas you are looking at. However, they change some of the \nconditions of the grazing. As a result of environmental considerations, \nthe grazing permits on the Santa Maria River in western Arizona now \ncontain terms and conditions requiring livestock to be kept away from \nthe rivers and streams during the spring and summer growing season.\n  The Santa Maria River in western Arizona is a rarity. It is a free-\nflowing river in the midst of a vast, hot, low-elevation desert.\n  The riparian corridor provides essential habitat for dozens of \nspecies of wildlife, including 15 species listed by Federal or State \nagencies as threatened, endangered, or some other special status. The \nriparian area of Santa Maria and its ability to support wildlife were \nseverely degraded by many years of uncontrolled and unmanaged livestock \ngrazing in the river corridor.\n  The vegetation was literally stripped away. Water was so polluted \nthat streambanks were trampled and miles of riverbed areas and riparian \nareas were nearly as barren as the surrounding desert.\n  This is the picture of the overgrazed area around the Santa Maria \nRiver in Arizona. There is the ``before'' picture. Let me tell you a \nlittle bit about the ``after'' picture, which I will refer to in a \nsecond.\n  For decades, the BLM issued new grazing permits to ranchers along the \nSanta Maria River with no terms and conditions to protect the riparian \nareas.\n  Even though the BLM developed the land-use plan that required the \nriver to be rested from livestock grazing, that requirement was not \nincluded in the permits. In the late 1980s, a portion of the Santa \nMaria River received an unplanned reprieve from grazing. The rancher \nwho held the permit went bankrupt and had to sell all his cattle.\n  The result of 3 years of rest from grazing can be seen in the second \nphoto. These are roughly the same areas. This one looks like a stripped \ndesert; the second is much different. This is a stream bed from the \nSanta Maria River, showing the natural vegetation and grass that has \ngrown back in the grazing area. The riparian vegetation has begun to \nreturn, the stream banks are rebuilding, and the water is cleaner than \nin other portions of the river.\n  In the early 1990s, the bankrupt rancher sold out to a new rancher \nwho wanted to restock the river corridor with cattle and start the \ngrazing again in this area. The BLM proposed to transfer the grazing \npermit to the new rancher with no NEPA analysis; that is, no \nenvironmental analysis and no public review. The transferred permit \nwould have had the same terms and conditions and ultimately resulted in \nthe same condition as seen in the before picture.\n  A number of individuals and organizations challenged the BLM decision \nto renew these permits without a NEPA review and public comment. As a \nresult of the environmental assessment, the grazing permits on the \nSanta Maria contain terms and conditions requiring that livestock be \nkept out of the riparian area during the spring and summer growing \nseasons. There is now a chance for vegetation to recover and water \nquality and wildlife to be restored.\n  The reason this part of the debate is important is it relates \ndirectly to the amendment I will offer. If the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico remains in this bill, permit level management \nchanges that I have just described will be much more difficult to \nobtain.\n  Let me speak for a minute about section 116 of this bill that I would \nstrike. This is the so-called grazing right. Most Members of the Senate \nhave received letters from virtually every major environmental group in \nWashington, asking them to join in supporting my amendment to strike \nsection 116. Here is the reason. This is the third attempt in an \nInterior appropriations bill to allow grazing permits to bypass current \nenvironmental regulations. Section 116 allows renewal of grazing \npermits that expire in fiscal year 2001 under the same old terms and \nconditions in which the permits were first issued.\n  Last year, I offered substitute language to similar offerings by the \nSenator from New Mexico. My language\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\nwould have addressed ranchers' needs for the Bureau to process grazing \npermits in a timely fashion and in a manner by which ranching \noperations and financial arrangements would not be needlessly \ndisrupted.\n  My intent last year was to not only protect the environment but to \nprotect the ranchers, as well, to give them certainty as to when the \nnew permits would be issued, and to also say that, where necessary, the \nBureau of Land Management could step in and make the environmental \nchanges to protect an area, changes that could avoid this and result \nmore in this type of situation, which I think most of us would agree is \nbetter stewardship of the land.\n  However, I am pleased to report that my efforts to hold the BLM and \ntheir feet to the fire successfully on their own resulted in change. My \namendment didn't succeed. But they went on to work to solve the backlog \nof expiring permits.\n  The bottom line is this: There is no longer any need whatever for \nsection 116 in this bill.\n  Let me show a chart in reference to the activity of the Bureau of \nLand Management. The BLM issued 3,872 fully processed grazing permits \nand leases in fiscal year 1999. In fiscal year 2000, the Bureau of Land \nManagement is scheduled to issue 2,893 fully processed grazing permits \nand leases; 1,408 have been holdovers from the previous year, but they, \ntoo, will be renewed this year. In fiscal year 2001, the Bureau of Land \nManagement will only be faced with 1,646 permits that have expired, and \na small carryover of 484 from the previous year, for a total workload \nof 2,130 permits in the next fiscal year. This number is fully within \nthe capability of the Bureau of Land Management.\n  We will hear from the other side, those supporting this environmental \nrider--that is opposed by virtually every environmental group in the \nNation's Capital--that we have to put this rider in place to renew old \npermits without review because the ranchers and livestock operators \ncannot be certain that the BLM will meet its obligation to issue the \nnew permits as the old ones expire.\n  The numbers tell a totally different story: 3,872 permits reviewed \nand approved by the BLM in 1999; this year, another 2,885; in the year \nfor which we are appropriating, the numbers will be down around the \n2,100 range. Clearly, the BLM has the capability to handle many more \npermit renewals than we envision in the next fiscal year. There is \nno need for this environmental rider to create exception and to tell \nthe old permit holders they don't have to go through the process. The \nprocess is there. It is timely. It will give them the certainty they \nwant about their future. All but 79 of the expiring 2001 permits will \nbe completely processed in 2001.\n\n  The BLM has decided to carry over the permits because they concern \nareas near the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and in the \nBookcliffs allotment. Because of the environmental sensitivity of these \nareas, the Bureau of Land Management will conduct an environmental \nimpact statement instead of the regular environmental assessment.\n  The question arises, if the BLM will no longer have a backlog of \npermits, why is there such concern that section 116 be included in this \nbill? Although that question can be easily reversed, the concern is \nthat section 116 will create incentives for livestock operators to \ndelay renewal of their permits in hopes of avoiding environmental \ncompliance by gaining an automatic renewal of their old permits under \nthe old terms and conditions.\n  Section 116, as presented in this bill, undercuts meaningful \nopportunities for public involvement in a range management process. Is \nthat important? Remember the picture from the Santa Maria situation; \nthe BLM didn't come up with policies that resulted in the second photo. \nThe lands lying in rest for 3 years, and public comments, led to \nchanges in permits, which means that instead of desert, we are going to \nhave a very beautiful area, an important area for habitat which is not \nenvironmentally damaging.\n  Section 116 undercuts that opportunity for public comment because it \nprovides for an automatic renewal of the old permit without going \nthrough public comment or environmental review. They have to renew \nunder section 116 the old permits under the same terms and conditions \nfor an indefinite period. It effectively eliminates public input into \nthe stewardship of public lands.\n  The Senators in support of 116 are saying to the people of this \ncountry who own these lands all across America: Get out of the way. We \ndon't want you to be part of the process. We don't want you to sit back \nand determine whether the livestock operator who has been on this land \nfor 10 years has done a good job from an environmental viewpoint.\n  Frankly, that is why we are here. Those in Congress and in the \nadministration who have responsibility for the management of the land \nhave to leave it to future generations in at least as good shape as we \nreceived it. If we cannot take an objective appraisal of how a rancher \nor livestock operator has managed the land, if we cannot decide that \nperhaps there needs to be a change because the way he is managing the \nlands is destroying it, then frankly we are running away from our \nresponsibility.\n  Section 116 in this bill, which I strike, does exactly that. It takes \nthe public out of the process. It takes the Government, looking at this \nfrom an environmental viewpoint, an ecological viewpoint, out of the \nprocess. It says it is an automatic renewal, no questions asked or \nanswered. That is why this section 116 is opposed by a wide array of \ngroups, including the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the U.S. \nPublic Interest Research Group. It is important to note that the League \nof Conservation Voters views this as a very important vote, as well.\n  Let me address specifically the situation involving the State of New \nMexico. The BLM says that New Mexico, which is the home State of the \nSenator who has offered this, will process and issue all fiscal year \n2001 expiring permits, as well as all carryover permits from fiscal \nyear 2000. So if we hear the argument on the floor that this backlog is \nhurting the State of New Mexico, the home State of the Senator who \noffered section 116, the facts don't back it up.\n  By September 30 of this year, New Mexico is committed to fully \nprocessing and issuing all 379 carryover 1999 permits and leases and \n179 of the year 2000 permits, for a total of 558. New Mexico plans to \nissue 192 fiscal year 2000 permits, using Public Law 106-113.\n  In fiscal year 2001, 221 permits and leases will expire in New \nMexico. Like the BLM as a whole, in fiscal year 2001, New Mexico will \nprocess and issue all fiscal year 2000 carryover and fiscal year 2001 \nexpiring permits, a total of 413.\n  This environmental rider, this section, was sold to us in years gone \nby as a necessity because of the backlog of cases on permits. The \nargument no longer holds. The BLM is fully capable of issuing new \npermits after the environmental consideration and public comment \nperiod, without hardship to the livestock operators and ranchers.\n  Let me address one other aspect of this which I think is very \nimportant. The reason why section 116 should be stricken from the bill \ngets to the heart of the question. Assume for a minute that you have a \npermit for your cattle to graze on public lands. Assume that the permit \nis about to expire and you are now in a position where you are having a \nreview by the Bureau of Land Management. They come to a conclusion that \nthe way you have used your permit over the last 10 years has been bad, \nyou have damaged the land, you have damaged the water quality, you have \ndestroyed habitat for wildlife, you may have threatened some species \nthat live in that land. So they want to change, in the next permit \nprocess, the way that you, for example, graze your cattle. If you \nremember the example from the previous photograph, the Santa Maria \nRiver, they decided at certain times of the year cattle could not graze \nnear the river, for many of the reasons I just explained.\n  If section 116 goes forward as proposed by the Senator from New \nMexico, if there is a dispute between the Bureau of Land Management and \nthe permit owner, all the permit owner needs to do is to appeal the \ndecision by the BLM, and, frankly, he gets to live under the terms of \nhis old permit with no restrictions on when the cattle can graze and no \nrestrictions on activity\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\nthat might be damaging to the environment. That is the net effect of \nsection 116, that we allow any bad actors who are destroying the \nenvironment on our land, our public land, to continue under the old \nterms and conditions and not face changes that would be in place.\n  If section 116 were not part of this bill, the Bureau of Land \nManagement could step in with a full force and effect order and say: \nEven while we are debating and appealing this question, you have to \nstop grazing your cattle near these streams and rivers in the summer \nand spring seasons when the area is the most vulnerable.\n  The bottom line is, those who support section 116 think environmental \nconcerns should be removed, take second place to moving forward and \nrenewing the old permits. That is the bottom line. That is what this \ndebate is all about. Those who believe, as I do, that this land belongs \nto us and future generations, that this land is in fact the habitat for \nmany species and wildlife that need to be protected, believe, I hope, \nsection 116 should be stricken.\n  Aldo Leopold wrote a great book called ``A Sand County Almanac.'' It \nis one of the classics, legends, when it comes to the West and the \nenvironment. This is what he said about the land:\n\n       Having to squeeze the last drop of utility out of the land \n     has the same desperate finality as having to chop up the \n     furniture to keep warm.\n\n  I hope Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, will step \nback and acknowledge the obvious. The BLM can meet its obligation. It \ncan renew these permits. It can do it in an environmentally sound way. \nIt can leave this land in as good shape as we received it and maybe \nbetter. It can leave a legacy to future generations, and even future \nranchers, of which they can be proud. We do not need to carve out an \nexception here. We do not need to walk away from our environmental \nresponsibility. We do not need to take the public out of the process of \ndebating the future of public lands.\n  A few minutes ago one of my colleagues from Idaho came to the floor, \nvery critical of the Clinton administration because he said they went \nthrough a process on roadless lands in the national forests and they \nwere not public enough. The facts are otherwise. There was room for a \nlot of public comment. But now we are going to hear those who defend \nsection 116 come forward and say: Take the public out of the process. \nAutomatically renew the permits. Don't make the evaluation.\n  That is shortsighted. That does not meet the standard and test that \nTeddy Roosevelt and so many others before us established for this \nNation. If we do this, we are not managing this land in the best \ninterests of the taxpayers and the best interests of our children and \nin the best interests of God's creation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3810\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to renewal of grazing \n                          permits and leases)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3810.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 116.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \ncomments of the Senator from Illinois on striking section 116. Let me \npreface my point by saying the language in the bill is the same \nlanguage that was in last year's bill. There is a reason for it. \nContrary to the argument being voiced by one side of the aisle, this is \ncompromise language. It passed the House and the Senate last year. It \nwas cleared by the Council on Environmental Quality and signed into law \nby the President.\n  As part of his speech, the Senator from Illinois showed us a picture \nof rangeland in poor quality. Well, I could take that same picture in \nYellowstone Park. There is not one cow in Yellowstone Park, not one. \nThere are a lot of buffalo, though. It is all managed by educated, \ncompetent land managers. The problem is, they have a hard time cutting \nback on the herd there. So let's not say that all the ranchers in the \nworld are the rapers and the pillagers of the land, because we can see \nrange in worse shape being managed by the National Park Service.\n  I go back on open range, range country, with the BLM and Government \nland back to the 1950s, and even a little before that. I can remember \nriding into Chicago with cattle for J.C. Penney at the old \nInternational Stock Show. So I know a little bit about these cattlemen. \nI know a little bit about grass. I know a little bit about rain. I know \na little bit about sunshine.\n  If it had not been for the ranching community in our public lands \nStates, there would also be no wildlife on that range because there is \nno water. For the most part, the land that was not claimed under the \nHomestead Act was land without water. Water was later developed on that \nland by the people who leased it from the government. To water their \ncattle they built reservoirs and wells. They also used pipelines. \nAnyplace livestock can graze, one will find wildlife.\n  There was an organization formed just after World War II. The country \nwas coming out of a depression and also some devastating years of \ndrought in the thirties. There are probably not a lot of folks standing \naround here who know much about that. I do not see that much gray hair \naround.\n  An organization was formed to improve the range. It was called the \nSociety for Range Management, long before Government had established \nany kind of environmental rules, long before there was an establishment \nof the BLM and guidelines for the men and women who would judge the \nquality of the range. Government did not fund the Society for Range \nManagement. It was strictly funded by those stockmen who ran livestock \non public lands. The Taylor Grazing Act was then established, and that \nis what governs how we handle permits today.\n  I want to talk about the Society for Range Management. Every year--\nand I started this in Montana by the way--we have Montana Range Days. \nAbout 300 to 400 people show up for a 3-day camp. They sleep on the \nground, and they sleep in the back of pickups. The people run from \nlittle shavers in the first grade to seasoned stockmen. During the 3 \ndays, we identify the grass, the foliage, noxious weeds, the carrying \ncapacity of a particular strip of range.\n  I started that when I went into the broadcast business in 1975 \nbecause rangeland is the basis for the economies in the eastern \ncounties of Montana. And as a result, the grazing permits on public \nlands are vital for Montana.\n  The range today carries a lot more livestock, a lot more recreation, \nand more activity overall because of a group called the Society for \nRange Management. They have been responsible, and that is something we \nshould recognize. Oh, sure, you can take a picture of an area after a \ndrought and it won't be pretty. But as I said, I can show you that in \nYellowstone Park where the buffalo took the grass into the ground. I \ncan show you that in Jackson Hole. I can show you that around Devils \nTower in the Black Hills, and the rangeland of North Dakota. I could \nprobably show you some pastures in the State of Illinois that are \nprivately owned and are overgrazed. There are always one or two bad \nexamples that one can magnify and say the whole world is doing this to \nmy or our land.\n  I have yet to see any government organization that has taken care of \nits land, or our land, as well as a private landowner who has made an \neconomic and cultural investment in that land. It just does not happen.\n  Last year, we compromised with those opposing the language that we \nwould solve the problem of renewing the permits. We told them that in \naccepting this compromise, the language before us today, we would have \nto come back each year until the Bureau of Land Management cleared up \nthe current backlog of permits.\n  The State of Montana does not have as much BLM acreage as some other \nStates. I do not think we have as much as our neighboring State to the \nsouth,\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\nWyoming. They probably also have more people employed by the BLM \nbecause of the environmental laws that have been passed. Some of those \nBLM folks are very good land managers, but they are also hamstrung by \nsome very narrow-minded people who think they know more about the \nrangeland than they do or the stockmen who run it.\n  In the meantime, there is a huge backlog of grazing permits that have \ngone unapproved, and that is the heart of Section 116. If they get the \nbacklog cleared up, this language goes away. What is to fear? If the \npermit work is done and the permits have gone before the board, this \nlanguage goes away. We are making sure everybody plays fair--just fair. \nThat is all we are doing.\n\n  We are good to our word, and with the BLM's failure to process the \nbacklog of permits, we have used the same compromise language we did \nlast year to prevent kicking family ranchers off the land through no \nfault of their own. They get their work done. That is the bottom line. \nIt cannot get any more definitive than that.\n  I do not want America to think that what I heard spoken before is an \naccurate assessment of our public lands because I will show you land \nmanaged by a stockman that lays next to what the Government manages, \nand there is a big contrast. It is huge. I will take the stockman's \nland 9 times out of 10 because I have seen it. I have seen the growth. \nI have seen the maturity and the things we put in place in range \ncountry to make it better, and we have done it with our own money. We \ndid not do it with Government money. We did it with our own money to \nimprove that range country.\n  I support my good friend from Illinois in the area of good \nenvironmental practices, but it is my belief that it is not just \nGovernment employees who understand good environmental practices. It is \ndone all through farm and agricultural country, whether it be on public \nlands or private lands.\n  This change does nothing to impact the compromise language of a year \nago.\n  I oppose striking section 116. I think it is necessary, understanding \nthere are those who do not want anything, anybody, or any livestock on \nthose lands whatsoever, and particularly people. I can put faces on the \npeople who use these lands very conservatively and improve these lands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Durbin, I apologize for \nnot being present on the floor when he gave what is always an eloquent \nspeech, which he also did in this instance, with some very marvelous \nbackground information. Since that graphic is so alive, I suggest that \nthe Senator should know when the vote starts he has to take it down.\n  In any event, the good Senator from Illinois said there is no good \nreason to continue to support the Domenici amendment from last year. \nIncidentally, on an up-or-down vote on the Durbin amendment last year--\nhe will get up and say it is a different amendment, but essentially it \nis the same issue--58 Senators voted against Senator Durbin in favor of \nthe Domenici amendment and 37 voted against the Domenici amendment, and \n5 did not vote. I am looking at those who did not vote on the Domenici \namendment, and I think the numbers will get more lopsided, I say to the \nSenator from Illinois, because more of them will go my way than his \nway.\n  So we want everybody to understand that we still need what we needed \nlast year. I will answer the rhetorical question, which was, there is \nno good reason for doing this again. I will say, there are 1,300 good \nreasons to do it this year, for there are 1,300 Americans--some in my \nState, some in the State of the Senator from Montana, some in the State \nof the Senator from Wyoming, but there are 1,300 permits that are still \nnot done, and those are for the years 1999 and 2000. We have 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths left in 2000. But there are 1,300 permits backed up for \nprocessing that are not completed.\n  Let me make sure that in just a few minutes everybody understands \nwhat this means.\n  If you were to come around 5 years ago or 6 years ago and ask, what \nis the issue with the National Environmental Policy Act and the grazing \npermits--as I told my friend from Illinois last year, it did not exist \nbecause nobody thought that renewing a grazing lease qualified under \nthe National Environmental Policy Act--get this--as a major Federal \naction.\n  But it has happened in this administration. They have concluded that \nthese 10-year leases we give to ranchers, which are policed by the U.S. \nGovernment, are subject to NEPA. Be it the Forest Service rangers or \nthe BLM rangers--they police these permits. They see that they are \nmanaged right. That is their job.\n  Incidentally, during that 10-year lease, if they violate it, they are \npenalized. If they do not take care of things, they get their allotment \ncut. It is not operating in a vacuum. It is operating all along with \nthe rancher trying to make a living and the Government saying: Do it \nright.\n  Then here comes this administration and it says: Why don't we make \nboth Forest Service permits and BLM permits go through a National \nEnvironmental Policy Act review for each and every one.\n  I can tell the Senator, they heard from me then, but all they heard \nfrom me were two things: One, it really isn't needed; and, two, if you \nare going to do it, you will never get it done on time.\n  I turned out to be right on both scores because, I say to the good \nSenator from Illinois, in my State, for each and every NEPA evaluation \nthat preceded a lease renewal, about one from my entire State was \nchanged significantly. That means across the board, 99 percent-plus of \nthe time, the NEPA analysis found nothing needed to be dramatically \nchanged.\n  As I said to the administration way back then, NEPA analyses aren't \nneeded. And then secondly, I said: You will not get them done on time.\n  Lo and behold, 2 years into that process, we started getting letters \nfrom ranchers and property owners saying: Look what is happening. They \nare making us do a NEPA statement, but they have not done the work yet, \nfor the Government does the NEPA statement. They have said: What is \ngoing to happen when our lease expires?\n  Nice question. The administration could say: We are not ready to give \nit to you because we have not done the environmental impact statement \non each and every grazing lease, which almost everybody looking at the \nland says is unnecessary. But let us conclude that they had authority \nadministratively to impose NEPA. Incidentally, they never got authority \nfrom Congress. Senator Scoop Jackson was the author of the NEPA law.\n  It would be very interesting if we could ask him from his place, \nwherever he is on high: Scoop, did you ever think that a grazing lease \nrenewal was a major Federal action under your law? And I swear, if he \nis listening, he is turning over in his grave because ``major Federal \naction'' meant a major Federal action, not renewals of every single \nlease on the grazing lands of America, which are thousands.\n  Nonetheless, when I offered my amendment last year, all it said was: \nLook, Federal managers, because of your own fault, you did not get the \nNEPA work done. Here is all the money you need. How much money do you \nneed? I remember in the Interior bill they asked for more funding. The \ndistinguished chairman gave them that money, so they had no more \ncomplaints. They got every bit of the money they needed to do it.\n  They set about to complete each and every impact statement on leases \nthat were expiring. The problem is, they have not gotten it done yet. \nAll we said is, since you are the ones that are supposed to get it \ndone, and you did not get it done, then you renew their lease. Give \nthem the renewal, but write in this law and on that renewal that as \nsoon as the NEPA work is finished --get this, my good friend, the \nPresiding Officer--as soon as the NEPA work is done, whatever your \nconclusions are, you have a right then to impose them on the permit.\n  I have every confidence in the world, since I believe only one lease \nin New Mexico had any major changes made because of NEPA, that this law \nthat I am asking to continue again--because they are still behind--will \ndo no damage to the public domain.\n  Let me make it very clear. There are some marvelous environmental \ngroups in the United States. They have taken on some fantastic causes. \nAlbeit they\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\ndo not like my voting record, that is all right with me. I like some of \nthe things they have done. I do not necessarily ask how they want me to \nvote before I vote. I saw too much of that when I was a young Senator.\n  I saw Senators come to the floor, knowing little or nothing about it, \nwho said: How are the environmentalists positioned on this vote?\n  They would say: They are an aye. They would vote aye.\n  I just do not happen to be one of those Senators. I am kind of proud \nof that, to be honest. I do not think anybody should come to the floor \nand say, I better vote with them. I hope I am informed before I get \nhere.\n  In spite of what I just said, and that some of the brightest \nAmericans are leading these environmental groups, believe it or not, I \nsay to my fellow Senators, they have made this little amendment a major \nAmerican environmental test. Using my name, they have spread it far \nacross the country: The Domenici amendment is calculated to destroy the \npublic domain, to let ranchers ranch without having the Federal \nGovernment oversee their growing malignancy which is destroying \nranchlands.\n  I say to my friends, it did not destroy any because they did not find \nanything wrong on most of them. There is a chance they will not get \ncompleted on time, and we just ought to stay where we were last year \nbecause there are too many Americans who are desperately afraid of the \narbitrary action that can be imposed on the rancher by lawsuits. They \nare afraid of arbitrary actions of people who represent the Federal \nGovernment.\n  They kind of cry out to us, when we go meet with them, saying: Just \ndon't do another thing to us, not giving us our lease renewal, when we \nhad nothing to do with the reason for the denial.\n  I can't put it any more succinct. That is the way it is.\n  I urge every Senator to do something very simple, and just send a \nword back that the proof in the pudding is that the NEPA reviews are \nnot saving the public domain. They are just costing a lot of money, \ntaking a lot of time. At least we ought to say to the ranchers who \nmanage well--which is the overwhelming number--we are not going to hold \nyou hostage out there and do what the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois recommends, which is that it is no longer mandatory that you \nproceed in a manner that the Domenici amendment last year said. That \nlaw allowed the renewal and then, in due course, when the NEPA analysis \nis finished, act accordingly, with the Government losing no rights. He \nwould say the Government may do that if they want to. Everybody should \nknow, if you turn the amendment into a ``you can do it if you want to, \nFederal Government,'' you know what is going to happen, at least for a \nwhile: The environmental pressure on the Department will be great \nenough that they won't do it for anybody. A ``may'' will turn into \n``thou shalt not.''\n\n  I don't think that is fair. I have high regard for the Senator from \nIllinois. We were just talking before this debate, saying maybe one of \nthese times we are going to be on the same side. I was thinking, if \nthat happened, we might just overwhelm the Senate. We might get 99 \nvotes.\n  In any event, I am sure hoping he doesn't get 99 votes tonight. I am \nhoping I get the same number I got last year, maybe even a few more who \nhave thought about it a little bit. Those who understand that it is \nkind of ridiculous to claim this amendment that Domenici put in this \nbill is going to wreak havoc on the public domain.\n  I will go anywhere to debate this issue with anyone as to whether \nthis justifies being a major environmental issue. If it does, we must \nnot have very many environmental issues around. They must have paled \nfrom the horizon if one of the major environmental issues in America is \nthis issue. This is an issue where the Government doesn't do its work \nand therefore can't give the rancher a 10-year permit renewal, which he \nmight be completely entitled to. The agency just hold them in abeyance \nand says: When we get through with our work, we will give you a lease. \nIn the meantime, maybe you will lose your financing.\n  A lot of Senators know about ranchers and financing. I wonder what \nthe banks would do if their leases were not as certain as they have \nbeen because the BLM or the Forest Service can just say maybe we will \nbe able to renew the permit.\n  I have spent a lot of time on the floor between the happy forest and \nperhaps the happy solution to this environmental issue. We will have a \nvote pretty soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I won't take a long time. My friends have \ncovered many of the details.\n  This issue is not about the pictures that were shown by the Senator \nfrom Illinois. It has nothing to do with overgrazing or not \novergrazing. That is not the issue. I hate to see it be left that way \nbecause it really has nothing to do with that. It has to do with what \nhappens until the BLM can get to that piece of land to make the study \nto decide what to do with the lease. It is pretty simple.\n  Here is what it says:\n\n       The terms and conditions contained in the expiring permit \n     or lease shall continue in effect under the new permit or \n     lease until such time as the Secretary of Interior completes \n     the processing of such permit or lease in accordance with all \n     applicable laws and regulations, at which time such permit \n     may be canceled, suspended or modified, in whole or in part, \n     to meet the requirements of such applicable laws and \n     regulations. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to alter \n     the Secretary's statutory authority.\n\n  I am sorry to say that doesn't fit much with what the Senator from \nIllinois described when he discussed this bill. I do think we need to \nbriefly talk about what does it do.\n  It allows the BLM to have more time to complete the necessary \nenvironmental reviews for renewing permits and leases. By providing BLM \nmore time, they are less susceptible to litigation and therefore less \ncostly to the taxpayer, and it is more likely that BLM will not rush to \nfinish their job and do a complete job of their review when the time \ncomes. The language provides a better method for stewardship of Federal \nlands by having the BLM and the rancher work hand in hand on it. It \nprovides the means for the agency to utilize sound processes and \nprocedures. That is what they claim they have not had time to do. This \nprovides that.\n  It subjects the permittee or lessee to potential modifications by the \nBLM of the terms and conditions, once the reviews are completed. It \ndoesn't give them carte blanche. BLM is still able to revoke a \npermittee's grazing privileges at any time. They can do that.\n  It provides more stability, consistency, and security to ranching \nfamilies. That is very important to us. Fifty percent of Wyoming \nbelongs to the Federal Government. Most of that is BLM land. It is \nmultiple-use land; it was designed to be under the law. This is a \nrenewable resource, and it is done that way. I know that doesn't mean \nmuch in Chicago, but it means an awful lot in Wyoming, out where the \nFederal lands are. We have to talk about that.\n  The language eases the end-of-the-year backlog, of course, for BLM.\n  What does the language not do? It does not lessen the responsibility \nof the rancher in abiding by the terms and conditions of the permit or \nlease. It does not limit BLM's authority to manage grazing on public \nlands. It does not exempt the permittee or the lessee from any \nenvironmental law. It does not grant a permit in perpetuity. It simply \nprovides for 10 years, until it is changed by the BLM.\n  It does not allow BLM to delay or ignore compliance of any \nenvironmental law or regulation, since BLM is mandated in those time \nlines to do those things.\n  Why is this language necessary? Frankly, it is very disappointing \nthat the Senator from Illinois is back the second year in a row to \nfight against western livestock ranchers. This issue--BLM not being \nable to complete the required environmental renewal process on expiring \ngrazing permits--is not the permittee's fault. The backlog was created \nby the administration, by the BLM. For some reason or other, the \nSenator from Illinois prefers to penalize the ranchers rather than hold \nthe agency accountable.\n\n  Striking this section in the bill is really detrimental to management \nof these lands. The Senate language, which I agree with, states:\n\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\n\n       The inability on the part of the Federal Government to \n     accomplish permit renewal procedural requirements should not \n     prevent or interrupt ongoing grazing activities on public \n     land.\n\n  When they get back to doing their job, it continues on. It is pretty \nsimple. It has worked. It can work in the future. I think it is \nimportant we have the same language President Clinton signed into law \nlast year.\n  As a matter of fact, after being contacted by the cattlemen, he said:\n\n       . . . the final 2000 budget does provide BLM with $2.5 \n     million that will enable the agency to effectively conduct \n     detailed reviews before renewing livestock grazing permits \n     and leases to ensure environmental compliance. I am confident \n     this funding will help us protect both the public lands and \n     the livelihood of hardworking ranchers.\n\n  That was from President Clinton's letter.\n  That is where we are. What we need to do is vote against this \namendment and allow the system to continue to work as we proved it can \nwork last year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in a few moments we may be voting on a \nmotion to strike section 116 of this appropriations bill. That is the \namendment offered by our colleague from Illinois. I hope Senators will \njoin with us, as they did last year, in opposing this kind of striking \nof language.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has said it so clearly, as have the \nSenator from Montana and the Senator from Wyoming. They have caused all \nof us to understand where we are in the process of reexamining the \ngrazing permits of western livestock grazers.\n  I don't think we have put it in the context we ought to for the \nSenator from Illinois. If we had, maybe he would be less inclined to \ncome to the floor with this issue in hopes of gaining another \nenvironmental certificate this year from the Sierra Club for his \ncharging, dynamic rhetoric on behalf of the environment.\n  Let me for a moment, if I may, deal with this in a hypothetical way. \nWhat if there had been a lawsuit in Rosemont, IL, that suggested the \nair traffic coming into O'Hare Airport was causing air congestion \nwithin that air shed and that air quality could not be arrived at there \nwithout changing the character of the management of the O'Hare Airport \nby reducing its flights by 50 percent?\n  Of course, the Senator from Illinois and I know--he lives in that \nregion; I fly in and out of that region--if you do that, O'Hare Airport \nis out of business. Thousands and thousands of people would be laid \noff, if that were to become a Federal rule or a restriction against \nthat activity. More importantly, this is a hypothetical case.\n  There is a lawsuit that the air traffic coming in and out of O'Hare \nhas created a situation that disallowed that area from gaining its air \nquality standards. So EPA is in there examining it and establishing a \nrule to see whether O'Hare can continue to manage its air flights in \nand out in a way as to sustain its viability and meet the air quality \nstandards. But the rule hasn't been made at a time that the judge has \nsaid: Either get it done or I will enforce a reduction in air traffic \nby 50 percent.\n  The Senator from Idaho likes that idea, so I come to the floor on the \nappropriations bill for the Department of Transportation and say: I \nwant to strike an amendment the Senator from Illinois has in there. \nLet's extend this period of time and allow EPA to complete its \nrulemaking process so that we can keep O'Hare alive.\n  I think it is important that we put all of these kinds of things in \ncontext. Illinois is not a public grazing State. Idaho is, New Mexico \nis, Arizona is, Montana is, and so is Wyoming. What the Senator from \nNew Mexico has said is that under today's environmental laws, and \nyesterday's environmental laws, these grazers will be allowed to graze \nduring that period of time in which the permit process, through an \nexamination by BLM or the Forest Service, is ongoing to reassess their \npermit and to adjust and change it in concert with current \nenvironmental law. I don't know why he would want to stop that. \nObviously, he tried last year and the Council on Environmental Quality \nagreed with us, we defeated that amendment, and the environment is \nbetter today because of it.\n  I hope our colleagues will stand with the Senator from New Mexico, as \nthey did last year, and say to the Senator from Illinois that we are \nnot going to put ranchers out of business. We live with environmental \nlaw, we are sensitive to it, and we believe in it. We are not going to \narbitrarily do as I suggested in my hypothetical case with O'Hare \nAirport, which is an area that is not of my interest, but it is an \ninterest of the Senator from Illinois because it is in his State. I \ndon't know much about it, but in my example I want to come in and \narbitrarily change the name of the game. Of course, he would work to \ndisallow that, and this Senator would respect the Senator from Illinois \nfor saying that is not my business; that is the business of the Federal \nAviation Administration and the State of Illinois, the city of \nRosemont, and the Senator from Illinois--not the Senator from Idaho. I \nthink that is the issue here.\n  In 1878, the diaries of a cavalry officer in charge of the cavalry in \neastern Oregon, northern Nevada, and southern Idaho reflected the \nfollowing:\n\n       I believe the grazing lands of this region to be 50 to 60 \n     percent depleted.\n\n  That was in 1878. Why? No BLM management. No Federal land management. \nNo standards. Large grazing herds out of the Southwest swept through \nthat country and their history, of course, has filled our history books \nwith the nostalgia of the great trail drives. But there was a young man \nwho was used to the land, and at that time he made an observation that \nthe grazing in the region he used to ranch in and that these Senators \nare concerned about had already been depleted by over 50 percent--in \n1878.\n  I can say to the Senator from Illinois, because of the standards \nestablished by the grazing industry, the environmental community, the \nFederal Government, U.S. Forest Service, and BLM, many of those lands \nare much better today than they have ever been. In fact, everyone who \nknows the western grazing lands and the riparian zones the Senator so \neloquently spoke of know that they are hundreds of percent better than \njust a few decades ago. In fact, let us not forget that when the \nSecretary of the Interior, at the beginning of his tenure back a few \nyears ago, wanted to go out and find some bad grazing examples that he \ncould talk about to change his grazing land policy, his staff came back \nand said: Mr. Secretary, we can't find any. We can't find the kind of \nexamples you want to bad mouth the grazing industry and management \npolicies of the Forest Service and BLM because grazing has \nsubstantially improved and is continuing to improve.\n\n  That is what the Domenici provision, section 116, is all about--\ncontinuing that relationship of progressive improvement, \nenvironmentally, for the benefit of our country and for the benefit of \nthe wildlife, but also for the benefit of the grazing industry.\n  Improved grazing and better grass in our country means fatter cattle. \nBy the way, we sell them by the pound. I am not at all embarrassed for \nsaying that. That is the way the industry works, in a balanced and \nnecessary way. I thought it was important to bring this debate into \ncontext to the Senator from Illinois, who knows more about the subject \nI proposed hypothetically than I do. I suggest that I probably know a \ngreat deal more about public land grazing than he does. I and my family \nhave used public lands for grazing for over 100 years. I have walked on \nthem, I know the changes, and I have helped to get improved standards. \nWe are doing it right on the public lands of the West today, and a \ngreat deal better than we used to do it. I think it is important that \nwe recognize grass as an asset and a natural resource that can be used \nfor a multitude of reasons. One of those reasons is to produce red meat \nprotein for the American consumer. That is what the issue is about. I \nhope my colleagues will join with me in denying the Senator from \nIllinois his motion to strike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I want to speak on another subject, so I will yield to \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, if there is no other \nSenator wishing to speak the first time on\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nthis, I will speak briefly in conclusion. I have spoken to the chairman \nof the committee. It is my hope that I can ask for the yeas and nays \nand that we can schedule a final vote on the amendment, as well as on \nany other pending amendments at a later hour when all Senators \nreassemble. If that is acceptable, I will speak for a few moments in \nconclusion.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the majority leader has indicated that he \nhopes we can continue debating this bill and finish it tonight, or at \nleast get to a point tonight where it can be finished, perhaps, with a \nvote on final passage tomorrow. I think that is possible, and this will \nbe part of it.\n  So I hope the Senator from Illinois will finish his remarks on it. We \nwill ask for a rollcall, and then we will set voting on it aside until \nwe find out how many other amendments there are. I believe the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Bryan, wishes to come in with an amendment that would \nrequire a vote. The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, may have an \namendment. Senator Nickles may have one. I am not sure about the \nSenator from Alabama. But there are a fairly small number that will \nrequire votes. I strongly suggest that anyone who feels that his or her \namendment cannot be accommodated as a part of a managers' amendment--\nand we have a very large one now that includes many of the proposals \nmade--if anybody wants to have a vote or debate, they really need to be \non the floor very promptly to do so because we would like to go ahead \nand finish. With that, I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say in conclusion on this amendment \nthat I have the highest respect for my friend from New Mexico. I often \nwonder why each year I decide to take on the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and the powerful Appropriations Committee, with usually \npredictable results on the floor of the Senate. He has, much to my \nconsternation, read last year's rollcall, which is another dagger to my \nheart on this same issue.\n  Notwithstanding that, I am going to soldier on here because, as the \nSenator from New Mexico does, there are times when you stand up and \nfight for something you believe in, even if you may not prevail. I \nstill have the highest regard for him and all of my colleagues on the \nother side of the issue. I respect the fact that many of them have a \nmuch more personal knowledge of ranching and livestock operations than \nI do. When I think about Senator Burns of Montana and all of his years \nas a rancher and auctioneer, he stared more cows in the eye than I will \never be able to.\n  I listened to my friends, Senator Thomas, Senator Craig, and Senator \nDomenici. I can readily see that these are men in the Senate who \nrepresent areas with many more ranchers and many more livestock \noperators with much more personal knowledge on this subject, \nnotwithstanding that I come to the floor not trying to preach to them \nabout ranging practices but trying to ask them to at least respect the \nprocess of trying to protect our public lands.\n  The Senator from Idaho--I have heard this argument every year when I \nintroduced this type of amendment--has basically said: Why are you \nsticking your nose into issues about the West? You live in the Midwest. \nWhen it comes to an issue such as O'Hare Airport, we would expect you \nto stand up and talk about it, being from Illinois. But goodness' sake, \nwhy are you talking about grazing in 13 Western States if you are from \na Midwestern State?\n  I say to the Senator from Idaho that I think we all bear \nresponsibility, no matter where we are from, for the stewardship of \npublic lands. It isn't only Senators who represent Western States. It \nis all of us.\n  Frankly, if those lands are left to future generations, each one of \nus should take an interest in it, whether we live in Florida, or \nIllinois, or Maine. We all have a responsibility for those public \nlands--that Public Treasury, those resources that we count on so much.\n  I also say to my friend from Idaho that when we stand here and debate \ngun safety issues representing large cities where a lot of people are \nvictims of gun violence, he stands up on the floor many times and tells \nus what he thinks gun policy should be in the city of Chicago. He \nthinks that is his opportunity and responsibility as a Senator from \nIdaho. So it works both ways.\n  I think he will concede the fact that, being elected to the Senate, \nwe are not restricted in what we can speak to. We may be restricted in \nour success about what we speak to.\n  But let me also say that I want to get down to a couple of things \nthat were not mentioned at the outset that should be mentioned. For \nthose livestock operators who choose to graze on public lands, this is \nworthy of mention. The grazing fees paid by those ranchers and \nlivestock operators are a bargain. They are an absolute bargain. This \nCongress and a President decided that we will continue to give these \nranchers and livestock operators access to land owned by the people of \nthe United States so they can make a living grazing their cattle for \nfees that are, frankly, a fraction of what they would pay on private \nland.\n  The Federal grazing fee for 1999 was $1.35 per animal unit month \ngrazed. By contrast, the average grazing lease rate for private land is \ncurrently more than $11--almost 9 or 10 times the amount these same \nlivestock operators are paying to graze on the lands owned by the \npeople of the United States. In 1996, the fees charged on State land by \nWestern States ranged from $2.18 to $2.20. There was not a single State \nthat leased its grazing land to local livestock operators at a fee as \nlow as the Federal Government.\n  In addition to the subsidized fees, ranchers with Federal permits \nenjoy subsidized range improvements. As a result, livestock operators \nwith Federal grazing permits actually have lower production costs and \nhigher profits than livestock ranchers without Federal permits.\n  As we talk about hardship that we may be creating for livestock \noperators, let us at least concede at the outset that we are giving \nthese permit holders a bargain to make a living. I have not stood here \nand criticized ranchers and livestock operators, nor would I. In my \nState of Illinois, we have livestock products and a lot of farmers. I \nrespect the men and women involved in my State, as I do in any other \nState. Nor am I bringing this issue before the Senate to try to put any \nranchers out of business.\n\n  There is one fundamental flaw in the argument on the other side. It \nis the suggestion that if you had a 10-year permit that expired, that \nthe Bureau of Land Management would cut you off and not give you the \nright to continue to graze land while they are going through the \nreissuing of the permit process.\n  I don't know of a single case where that has happened. The BLM goes \nout of its way to continue the grazing rights of these livestock \noperators, even while they are debating the terms of the new permit.\n  The suggestion has been just the opposite--that they somehow want to \nget the ranchers off the land. The only time I have read about that is \nin a situation where they have a rancher or a livestock operator using \nFederal land in a way they think is harmful to the environment. I think \nthat is reasonable because BLM has a responsibility to protect those \npublic lands from environmental damage.\n  Let me also address one other thing. The Senator from Montana got up \nand said there are people managing Yosemite and Yellowstone. There is \nbuffalo and wildlife there, and many of them can destroy land just like \nany other livestock. I bet that is true. I don't question that it is \ntrue. He also went on to say that he thought when it came to range \nmanagement that we should basically leave it up to the livestock \noperators to decide what is good for the land. I think that was his \nconclusion. I think this is a fair summary of his conclusion. I guess \nin some instance that would be true.\n  In my home State of Illinois, there are farmers who are responsible \nenvironmentalists. They think twice before they apply chemicals. They \nthink about the right thing to do to avoid the loss of good topsoil, \nand about siltation going into the streams that run into the water \nsupplies of surrounding towns. My hat is off to them. I usually spend \nEarth Day with farmers because I respect a lot of them. They take this\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\nvery seriously. I will tell you that conversely there are some I \nwouldn't put in that category. There are good and bad.\n  But let me tell you what the BLM has to say about the acreage that is \nbeing grazed by livestock now under their control. They estimate that \nonly about a third of a total 160 million acres grazed by livestock are \nin good or excellent ecological condition--one-third. Worse yet, even a \nhigher percentage--almost 70 percent of riparian areas, streams, and \nrivers and their associated fish and wildlife habitat--are in a damaged \ncondition: A third in good condition; 70 percent near streams in bad \ncondition. The General Accounting Office attributes the vast majority \nof these resource deficiencies to abusive and excessive grazing \npractices.\n  When I come before you and show this photo, they say this isn't the \nreal world. But the statistics suggest that overwhelmingly this is the \nreal world. This is a grazing situation where, unfortunately, someone \nput cattle on this land, and they grazed it down until it looked like a \ndesert. For 3 years after bankruptcy, the land had a chance to recover \nin the Santa Maria River area of western Arizona. This is what we have \nto show for it.\n\n  What I am suggesting is that the statistics and the studies do not \nback up the statements on the floor which suggest that this land is \nbeing managed so well. There is a need for the BLM. There is a need for \nthe environmentalists. There is a need for public comment.\n  That is what I think needs to be protected. That is what section 116 \nwould deny us. Frankly, that is what this debate is all about.\n  It has been the suggestion of my friend from New Mexico--not a \nsuggestion but his notation of the rules of the Senate--that when the \ntime comes for a vote that I am required by the rules of the Senate to \nremove this photo from the floor. So my colleagues who have not been \nhere for this debate cannot come in and see exhibit No. 1, in my case, \nfor the passage of my amendment. I can understand it. I know why the \nSenator from New Mexico doesn't want my colleagues to look at this \nphoto. This tells the story as to what section 116 is all about.\n  I made it a point--because I have such high respect for the chairman \nfrom New Mexico--to ask those who are well versed in the rules of the \nSenate. Once again, the chairman from New Mexico is right. I have to \nremove this photo under the Senate rules. I will probably appeal that \nto the Supreme Court at some later time. But, for today, I am going to, \nobviously, follow the rules of the Senate.\n  But it is of interest to me that the Senator from New Mexico doesn't \nwant our colleagues to see this photograph. I hope they are watching it \nas we broadcast this debate on the Senate floor. It tells the story.\n  This is the bottom line. The BLM is going to process these \napplications. They are going to get them done on time. There is no need \nfor this amendment. They are going to take a look. In the rare case \nwhere they find a livestock operator who is misusing Federal lands that \nhe is getting for a bargain price--where he is misusing land, \ndestroying the ecology, endangering species, and destroying riverbeds \nand riparian areas--they are going to make him sign a change. If the \nSenator from New Mexico prevails, they will lose the authority to do \nthat. They will have to renew the permit under the old conditions.\n  That is my objection to it. That is why I think it should be \nstricken.\n  I sincerely hope we have a better outcome on the vote. If my \ncolleagues have followed the debate and have had a chance to see this \nphoto, which concerns my colleague so much, I am hoping they will \nsupport me in my motion to strike section 116.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator be \npermitted to leave his picture up for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I respond to my colleague from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator has been responding for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from New Mexico is a gentleman, a scholar, \nand will receive a reward, I am sure, from the civil liberties group \nfor defending the first amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, let me say the idea of putting posters around \nhas proliferated. I don't think we ought to add more to the confusion \nof a vote by having them around. I had no intention to pass judgment on \nthe validity of your exhibit, which I find very difficult to interpret \nand rather irrelevant, but besides that, I don't have anything to say \nabout it.\n  Let me say, why strike a provision that the Federal Government's \ninaction cries out to be left in this bill, which was signed by the \nPresident last year? I might even tell my friend from Illinois, can you \nbelieve it, I talked to him personally on this issue because he wanted \nto understand what the hoopla was about. I will not paraphrase him, but \nhe signed the bill with this provision in it. It does no one any harm, \nand nothing has happened to say it has hurt the environment in this \npast year. And this issue has nothing in the world to do with how much \nranchers are paying.\n  If we ever get into a debate upon the issue of, are they getting a \ngreat deal from the Government, I will bring from my State name after \nname of ranchers who are just not even making a living on the Federal \ndomain today. Whatever price he suggested, they just can't hardly make \na living under the rules and regulations of the U.S. Government.\n  That has nothing whatever to do with this issue. The assertion is not \ncorrect that the BLM has to leave correctable degradation in place and \nissue a new permit while damage could continue on the property. Read \nthe amendment. Whatever power the Bureau of Land Management has, it \nkeeps. That means if they issue a permit and they had the authority to \nmake a correction to its terms to fix a problem, they still have it. \nNothing is missing.\n  This provision lets the rancher feel a little more comfortable. He is \nnot as denuded and vulnerable by having no permit until they get ready \nto issue it to him after they finish processing, which in the past \nwould have taken a couple of years, maybe 2\\1/2\\ years. Now BLM is \ngetting closer to finishing processing of all the expiring permits. I \nam glad. The amendment is working.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Illinois wanted \na rollcall. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent we lay this amendment aside and \nproceed to an amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3812\n\n   (Purpose: To provide $7,372,000 to the Indian Health Service for \n     diabetes treatment, prevention, and research, with an offset)\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Mr. \n     Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 3812.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec. ____. Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act--\n       (1) $7,372,000 shall be available to the Indian Health \n     Service for diabetes treatment, prevention, and research; and\n       (2) the total amount made available under this Act under \n     the heading ``National Foundation on the Arts and the \n     Humanities'' under the heading ``National Endowment for the \n     Arts'' under the heading ``grants and administration'' shall \n     be $97,628,000.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. After going through that rather lengthy amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois, there should be a little relief that this \namendment should not be controversial. This amendment takes the amount \nof money that was increased--increased--to the National Endowment for \nthe\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\nArts and transfers that to a fund for Indian diabetes. It is the Indian \nHealth Service for Diabetes.\n  Probably the least understood illness in this country is that of \ndiabetes among Indians. It is a chronic disease. It has no cure. There \nare two different types. Type II is what we are addressing, diabetes \namong adults. Among American Indians, 12.2 percent of those over age 19 \nhave diabetes. This is the highest risk of any ethnic group.\n  One Pima tribe in Arizona has the highest rate of diabetes in the \nworld, about 50 percent of the tribe between the ages of 30 and 64. In \nOklahoma, a lot of people are not aware, during the 1990 census, \npreliminary figures show the largest percentage of Indian population \nand the largest number of Indians of any of the 50 States. We spent a \nlot of time talking to our Indian population and looking at the \nproblems that are peculiar to that population.\n  Not long ago, I spent some time at an Indian hospital in Talihina, \nOK, operated by the Choctaws. Case studies include one young male \npatient I talked to, 20 years of age, who already has been partially \nblinded with diabetes. He is already suffering from renal failure. He \nhas a 40-year-old father who has gone blind. They recently had to \namputate his leg, and probably the other one will go next. In one \nfamily, the father and mother both have type II diabetes. The mother is \ngoing to start dialysis next month. The son, who is 20 years old, has \neye and kidney damage. The daughter is 17 years old and suffered a \nstroke, requiring weekly medical care. She has a 3-year life \nexpectancy. The average life expectancy of the American Indian patient \nwith diabetes is only 45 to 50 years.\n  It is very peculiar to the Indian population. It is very clear to see \nour money is better spent there and we can actually try to do something \nthrough research, through medication, through programs, to get the \nIndian population where they can be treated, where they know how to \ndeal with infections they don't know how to deal with now.\n  It is unacceptable that, nationwide, 12.2 percent of the Indian adult \npopulation has type II diabetes. There is no cure. It is not a lot of \nmoney but will go a long way toward saving lives, not just in Oklahoma \nbut in the Indian population all over the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with all respect, it seems to this Senator \nthat this amendment is more about the National Endowment for the Arts \nthan it is about the Indian Health Service.\n  To give a comparison, the amount of money for the Indian Health \nService in this bill is more than $2.5 billion. The amount for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts cultural institutions is $105 million. \nAs a consequence, this amendment would add to the Indian Health Service \nsomething less than one-third of 1 percent of the budget of the Indian \nHealth Service --something less than one-third of 1 percent. It would \nsubtract from the National Endowment for the Arts some 7 percent of the \namount of money appropriated to it.\n  Our bill provides a $143 million increase for the Indian Health \nService for next year over the current year, more than the entire \nappropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts. I find it ironic \nit was less than an hour ago that this Senator was praised by the \nSenator from New Mexico, who is a vocal advocate for the Indian Health \nService, for the generosity with which we were treating that service.\n  Of the amount we are talking about for the Indian Health Service, $56 \nmillion is specifically for improved clinical services, which obviously \ncould include diabetes treatment and prevention efforts. But even more \nsignificant in connection with this amendment is the fact that the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 provides $30 million a year for 5 years \nspecifically to accelerate diabetes efforts for Native Americans. This \nyear is the fourth such year. So there is $30 million for the fourth \nconsecutive year for the specific purpose of this amendment.\n  On the other hand, the National Endowment for the Arts has not had a \nsingle increase in its funding since 1992. In many respects, the $7 \nmillion increase for the National Endowment for the Arts is symbolic; \n$7 million is real, but in a sense it is symbolic--but it is an \nimportant symbol. It is far less than the President's budget has in it. \nIn fact, one of the elements in the long letter from the Executive \ncomplaining about this bill is that we are not generous enough with the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  But when we had our great debates on that subject during the mid-\n1990s, one of the focal points of the debate was that the National \nEndowment for the Arts was not using its money correctly and was \nfunding objectionable artistic efforts, objectionable groups, and \norganizations and individuals. In the intensity of the debate, I \nbelieve in 1995 and 1996, an extensive list of reforms was imposed on \nthe National Endowment for the Arts with respect to the way in which it \nspent its money and made its grants.\n  Now far more of its money goes to grants to the States. More of its \nmoney is spread more broadly around the United States, particularly to \nrelatively small communities rather than a concentration in New York \nand Washington, DC, and Los Angeles and San Francisco. In other words, \nthe very reforms that were demanded by the Congress have been, I think, \ncheerfully and thoroughly carried out by the National Endowment for the \nArts in a manner quite responsive to what Congress asked for. To \ncontinue to punish the Endowment for the sins of its predecessors, or \nthe supposed sins of its predecessors, seems to me to be perverse. I do \nnot believe it appropriate for literally the 10th straight year either \nto reduce or freeze the appropriation for the National Endowment for \nthe Arts.\n\n  I would have to say I think it is doing good work. It is one of those \nfields in which relatively small grants provide sort of a Good \nHousekeeping Seal of Approval to a multitude of arts organizations \naround the country, and provides a tremendous help to them in securing \nprivate contributions for their efforts. Some say the money that we \nprovide through the National Endowment for these organizations comes \nback tenfold, fiftyfold, a hundredfold in private and local \ncontributions.\n  It does seem to me long past time that we recognize the changes in \nthe National Endowment and reward them for a job well done, even though \nthe reward contained in this bill is modest. I said 2 days ago when \nthis debate began that last year we included such a modest increase. \nThe House was adamant about freezing the appropriation for the \nEndowment and we ultimately receded to the House. I said then I don't \nintend that should happen this year. I think it is time for the House \nto recede to us. I think it is time to deal fairly with an important \npart of the culture of the United States, and I think this amendment is \nunnecessary for the purpose for which it is stated because we have far \nmore money in the bill already for the purpose of this amendment than \nis included in the amendment itself.\n  I believe we should leave this modest increase and encourage the \nNational Endowment for the Arts to continue the good work and to \ncontinue to follow the dictates of this Congress about the way in which \nit does that work, rather than to continue to punish it for perceived \npast sins which I am now convinced have long since been cured.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Washington for his comments. I \ndo not agree, obviously. I do think, though, I find two reasons to \ndisagree with his arguments: One, to use percentages, as to what \npercentage this represents that would be decreased from the NEA as \nopposed to increase for diabetes because of the seriousness of this; \nthe second thing is why carry this into a discussion and a debate on \nthe merits of the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  If we were to do that, I would be glad to join in that debate. In \nfact, I voted many times to defund the National Endowment for the Arts. \nHowever, that is not this amendment. Right now they have, from last \nyear, $97 million, the NEA, and they are talking about not keeping it \nlevel but increasing it by $7.3 million. I am saying the $7.3 million \nis going to end up saving lives, particularly lives of Indians with \ndiabetes, as opposed to rewarding and increasing the appropriation to \nthe NEA.\n  I think we need to look at it in that light. As I said, it is just \nincredible for\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\npeople to comprehend the seriousness of this affliction among the \nIndian population. Yes, I am prejudiced. Yes, the State of Oklahoma has \nthe largest number of Indians of all 50 States, and there are a lot of \nStates that do not have that concern. I can tell you right now, we are \ngoing to do everything we can.\n  What the Senator from Washington says is true. We have increased it \nby some $30 million and it is going to be increased again over the next \n4 years. However, every incremental increase is going to have a very \npositive effect on the research and the treatment of the Indians with \ndiabetes. So I am going to ask for the yeas and nays on this for a \nvote.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have no objection to setting it aside and voting when \nwe vote on the rest of the amendments.\n  Mr. GORTON. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent the vote on the amendment be set \naside. I had told Senator Bryan we could go to him next. Does the \nSenator from Alabama----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had an amendment I did want to talk on tonight. I \nwanted to take 2 minutes on one other subject, to thank the \ndistinguished floor leader of the bill. I could do one of those, if \nSenator Bryan is ahead of me. I have been here longer than he has, I \nthink.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nhis understanding and support, accepting an amendment I offered \ninvolving the Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery, AL. Last year, about \nthis time, Senator Abraham and I submitted a bill to give a \nCongressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. That bill was passed in the \nSenate and the House, and the President presented it to her last summer \nin the Rotunda of the Capitol in a most remarkable ceremony.\n  Rosa Parks, as most people know, was a native of Alabama, Tuskegee. \nShe moved to Montgomery. She was a seamstress. She was riding on a bus \none day, the bus was full and she was tired, and simply because of the \ncolor of her skin she was asked to go to the back of the bus and she \nrefused and was arrested. That arrest commenced the Montgomery Alabama \nbus boycott over that rule, leading to a Federal court lawsuit that \nwent to the Supreme Court, in which the Supreme Court held that kind of \nsegregated public transportation was not legal and could not continue.\n  The leader of that boycott turned out to be a young minister at \nDexter Avenue Baptist Church by the name of Martin Luther King, Jr. The \nFederal judge who originally heard the case was Frank M. Johnson, Jr., \none of the great Federal judges in civil rights in American history, as \nfar as I am concerned. Fred Gray was an attorney involved. Mr. Fred \nGray, one of the first black attorneys in Montgomery, told the story in \nhis book ``Bus Ride To Justice.'' How little did they know that the \nevents they started on that day in 1955 would commence a movement that \nhas reverberated, not only in Montgomery, in Alabama, but throughout \nthe United States and, in fact, throughout the world, to a claim for \nrights and freedom and equality--great ideals.\n\n  Troy State University in Montgomery, a 3,000-student university, is \nbuilding a museum and library on the very spot of this arrest. These \nfunds will help create in that building a museum to Rosa Parks with an \ninteractive video friendly to visitors and children about the story of \nwhat happened on that day and the importance of it.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington for supporting us \nin this effort.\n  I see Senator Bryan. Mr. President, I say to him, I had 15 minutes on \nan amendment I called up earlier. Would it be all right for me to go \nahead? I have a time crisis.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I inquire of the Chair, there is a unanimous consent \nagreement that at 6:30 p.m. draconian things happen. I do not want to \nbe precluded from offering my amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GORTON. The majority leader said 6:30 p.m. can come and go. If \nthere is a prospect of finishing this bill tonight, the defense debate \nwill be diverted. I think we can finish, I hope, by 8 o'clock this \nevening. The Senator is protected.\n  Mr. BRYAN. As long as I am protected, I will be happy to yield to my \nfriend from Alabama, and I ask unanimous consent that I be next in line \nfor the purposes of offering an amendment after our distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. GORTON. I put that in the form of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished floor manager.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield 30 seconds \nfor an inquiry. I have an amendment that is pending with reference to a \nwater situation in my State. I ask unanimous consent to follow Senator \nBryan whenever he has finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3790\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I offer amendment No. 3790 to the \nInterior appropriations bill. It will prevent the Secretary of the \nInterior from utilizing regulations that he has issued which would \ngrant him the authority to approve class III casino gambling for Indian \ntribes in States throughout the United States in which class III \ngambling compacts between the State and a tribe have not been entered.\n  This amendment had been adopted in the past several years. An \nidentical amendment was accepted last year by voice vote. The original \ncosponsors already this year are: Senators Graham, Reid, Bayh, Grams, \nEnzi, Lugar, Voinovich, and Inhofe. Others are signing on.\n  Essentially, this amendment will prevent any 2001 funds allocated to \nthe Department of the Interior from being spent on the publication of \ngaming procedures under the regulations found under part 291 of title \n25 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which by now is probably 100,000 \npages of regulations issued by the different Secretaries.\n  The intent of this funding restriction is to render these regulations \ninoperative next year only so the Department can take no action under \nthe regulations until a case brought by the States of Alabama and \nFlorida concerning the legality of these regulations is first resolved. \nIn fact, Secretary Babbitt himself has expressed on numerous occasions \nhis desire for the Alabama-Florida case to be decided first.\n  This amendment simply seeks to place the Secretary's public \ncommitments in law to ensure that a Federal court has the opportunity \nto rule on the validity of these regulations prior to any departmental \naction next year. This is an important and timely amendment. I urge \nanyone who is concerned about local control and freedom and concerned \nabout bureaucracy and the spread of gambling within this country to \njoin me in support of this amendment. I want to take a moment to \nprovide some background.\n  In April of 1999, Secretary Babbitt promulgated final regulations \nwhich empower him to resolve gambling controversies between federally \nrecognized Indian tribes seeking to open a class III gambling \noperation--that is generally casinos--in a State which has not agreed \nwith him to enter into a compact with the tribe or has not agreed to \nwaive its 11th amendment right to exert sovereign immunity from suit.\n  As a result, tribes located within certain States, such as Alabama \nand Florida, would be able to use these regulations to obtain class III \ngambling facilities by negotiating directly with the Secretary of the \nInterior in Washington, DC, even if the people of the State itself \nremained opposed to the spread of such gambling or even if the types of \ngambling sought were illegal under State law.\n  In my opinion--and the Attorneys General Association of the United \nStates has written us in opposition to this Babbitt rule and regulation \nand in support of this amendment--in my\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\nopinion, these regulations turn the statutory system created under \nIGRA, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, on its ear because they \nundercut a State's ability to negotiate with tribes and because it \nplaces the gambling decisions in the hands of an unelected bureaucrat \nwho, as a matter of law, also happens to stand in a trust relationship \nwith the Indian tribes, not an unbiased arbiter.\n  Not only do these regulations offend my notions of federalism, but \nthey also promote an impermissible conflict of interest between the \ntribes who are asking for a class III gambling license and the \nSecretary of the Interior who enjoys a special relationship with them. \nHe is not a neutral arbitrator and was never given this power to \narbitrate these acts by the Congress. I do not believe these \nregulations are a valid extension of his regulatory power.\n\n  It is breathtaking to me, in fact, and it is another example we in \nCongress are seeing of unelected, appointed officials, through the \npower of the Code of Federal Regulations, implanting policies that may \nbe strongly opposed by a majority of citizens. Indeed, none of these \npeople is elected.\n  My concerns about these gambling regulations were shared by the \nattorneys general of Alabama and Florida who filed a suit in Federal \ndistrict court in Florida to challenge the validity. This lawsuit is \ncurrently working its way through a Federal court, and its resolution \nwill provide an important initial reading as to whether these \nregulations are, in fact, legal and constitutional. Allow me to share \nsome of the legal questions raised in the suits.\n  The States point out that the regulations effectively and improperly \namend the Indian Gaming and Regulatory Act because:\n\n       . . . under IGRA, an Indian tribe is entitled to nothing \n     other than an expectation that a State will negotiate in good \n     faith. If an impasse is reached in good faith under the \n     statute, the tribe has no alternative but to go back to the \n     negotiating table and work out a deal. The rules \n     significantly change this----\n\n  That is, the rules by Secretary Babbitt--\n\n     by removing any necessity for a finding that a State has \n     failed to negotiate in good faith.\n\n  Further, the lawsuit points out:\n\n       The rules at issue here arrogate to the Secretary the power \n     to decide factual and legal disputes between States and \n     Indian tribes related to those rights. Pursuant to 25 U.S.C., \n     section 2 and section 9, the Secretary of the Interior stands \n     in a trust relationship to the Indian tribes of this Nation. \n     The rules set up the Secretary, who is the tribes' trustee \n     and therefore has an irreconcilable conflict of interest as \n     the judge of these disputes--\n\n  Between a tribe and a State.\n\n       Therefore the rules, on their face, deny the States their \n     due process and are invalid.\n\n  I think the concerns raised by the States are legitimate, that these \nrules are, in fact, seriously flawed. But do not take my word for it \nalone. In fact, even Secretary Babbitt admits that the test of legality \nshould be passed first.\n  On October 12, 1999, the Secretary contacted Senator Gorton--who is \nmanaging this bill, and doing an excellent job of it in every way--and \nwrote him:\n\n       If (a) I determine that a Tribe is eligible for procedures \n     under those regulations, (b) I approve procedures for that \n     tribe, and (c) a State seeks judicial review of that \n     decision, I will not publish the procedures in the Federal \n     Register (a step that is required to make them effective) \n     until a federal court has ruled on the lawfulness of my \n     action.\n\n  Similarly, on June 14 of this year, the Secretary wrote \nRepresentative Regula, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on \nInterior and Related Agencies, to further clarify his position on these \nregulations. He offered these thoughts:\n\n       I feel it is very important for the court to clarify and \n     settle the Secretary's authority in this area. I anticipate \n     that the court ruling in the Florida case will be favorable \n     of the Secretary's authority to promulgate the regulation.\n\n  I disagree. But he goes on:\n\n       However the Department will defer from publishing the \n     procedures in the Federal Register until a final judgment is \n     issued in the Florida case, whether by the District Court or \n     on appeal.\n\n  I have written the Secretary to ask him to write me a similar letter \nand have not yet heard from him.\n  All the amendment I am offering would do is to back up those public \nstatements with the force of law, by ensuring that the Department could \nnot spend funds to publish these procedures until a Federal appellate \ncourt had finally ruled on them. They would not seek to repeal the \nregulations, nor would they affect any existing compacts with States \nthat wish to negotiate a compact with a tribe.\n  Personally, I would support an outright repeal of the regulations, \nbut for now I am content to make the Secretary's own words binding \nbecause I believe that legal review of these regulations is needed and \nproper, and that he should not be allowed to take action until such \ntime as a court has made a final ruling on the merits of these \nregulations, which are, indeed, breathtaking.\n  Make no mistake about it, it is an important issue in my State. As I \nspeak, there are reports in the local papers that Alabama's lone \nfederally recognized tribe--we have one tribe--is in the process of \nfinalizing a deal with Harrods, which would result in the future \nconstruction of a casino on land operated within the small town of \nWetumpka, AL, not far from Montgomery.\n  No Indians now live on this land. It is land they simply own. It is \nabout 180 miles from the small tribe lands that exist there. Because \nAlabama has not entered into a compact with the tribe, to allow them to \nput a casino there, they have gone to the Secretary of the Interior and \nhad him issue regulations that would give them the power to override \nthe State of Alabama's decision not to have casinos anywhere in the \nState.\n  They have a power to compact. They have a power to say no on certain \nthings. Alabama does have a dog track. The Indians would be entitled to \na dog track. They have bingo and related activities at the Indian \ntribal lands further to the south in the State, but they are not being \nallowed, under the State's negotiating position, to have a casino, a \nposition that I would support.\n\n  Allow me to quote a few of the public comments that were made \nconcerning this effort. The office of the Governor of Alabama, Governor \nSiegelman, has stated:\n\n       The governor is ``adamantly opposed'' to casino gambling in \n     any form within the state and will take whatever steps are \n     necessary to stop it.\n\n  That is a Democratic Governor.\n  Attorney General Pryor, a Republican, has stated that the Attorney \nGeneral:\n\n       . . . will take whatever action necessary to prevent \n     illegal gambling by any Indian tribe in the State of Alabama \n     [because Attorney General Pryor] believes Babbitt has no \n     authority to allow gambling by Indians in states where such \n     gambling is prohibited by law.\n\n  Representatives Everett and Riley oppose any future casino \ndevelopment.\n  Mayor Jo Glenn of Wetumpka--I think everybody in the city council has \nwritten me about it--has expressed her strong opposition to the \npresence of a casino in her town and wrote me:\n\n       Our infrastructure and police and fire departments could \n     not cope with the burdens this type of activity would bring. \n     The demand for greater social services that comes to areas \n     around gambling facilities could not be adequately funded. \n     Please once again convey to the Secretary our City's strong \n     and adamant opposition to the establishment of an Indian \n     Gambling facility here.\n\n  The Secretary does not have to live with the community whose nature \nis changed overnight by a major Harrods gambling facility. He does not \nlive in that community. He is not elected. He is not answerable to \nanybody. Yet he thinks he has the power to tell them what they have to \ndo and dramatically change the nature of that town and the lives of the \npeople who live there. No, sir.\n  The Montgomery Advertiser wrote:\n\n       Direct Federal negotiations with tribes without State \n     involvement would be an unjustifiably heavy handed imposition \n     of authority on Alabama. The decision whether to allow \n     gambling here is too significant a decision economically, \n     politically, socially to be made in the absence of extensive \n     State involvement. A casino in Wetumpka--not to mention the \n     others that would undoubtedly follow in other parts of the \n     State--has implications far too great to allow the critical \n     decisions to be reached in Washington. Alabama has to have a \n     hand in this high stakes game.\n\n  Unelected and unaccountable, the Secretary of the Interior has issued \nregulations that would completely change the nature of beautiful \nWetumpka, a bedroom community to Montgomery, AL, and a historic \ncommunity in its own right, against its will. It is a shocking and \namazing event, in my view.\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\n  Clearly, the unmistakable sentiments of the Alabama public can be \nheard through these diverse voices. Not only would the regulations \nallow the tribe to obtain permission to engage in activity that is \ncurrently illegal under Alabama law, but the actual placement of the \ncasino itself would result in the destruction of an important \narchaeological site that is listed on both the National Register of \nHistoric Places and the Alabama Historical Commission and the Alabama \nPreservation Alliance's list of historic ``Places in Peril.''\n\n  The site that is most frequently mentioned for development is known \nas Hickory Ground, and it is an important historical site that served \nas the capital of the National Council of the Creek Indians, and was \nvisited by Andrew Jackson, and which contains graves and other \nimportant subsurface features.\n  The site is, in fact, revered by other Creek Indian groups within the \nState and the Nation, as represented by the comments of Chief Erma Lois \nDavenport of the Star Clan of Muscogee Creeks in Goshen in Pike County \nwho stated:\n\n       Developers' bulldozers should not be allowed to destroy the \n     archaeological resources at the Creek site.\n\n  What is ironic about the choice of this site by the tribe is that the \nland was acquired by the tribe in 1980 in the name of historic \npreservation in an attempt to prevent the previous landowner from \ndeveloping the site for commercial purposes.\n  In fact, the tribal owners of this site once wrote:\n\n       The property will serve as a valuable resource for the \n     cultural enrichment of the Creek people. The site can serve \n     as a place where classes of Creek culture may be held. The \n     Creek people in Oklahoma have pride in heritage, and ties to \n     original homeland can only be enhanced. There is still an \n     existing Hickory Ground tribal town in Oklahoma. They will be \n     pleased to know their home in Alabama is being preserved.\n\n  As you can see, should the tribe receive the ability to conduct class \nIII gambling and construct a casino, Alabama will run the very real \nrisk of losing an important part of its cultural heritage, as will \nCreek peoples throughout the country.\n  It is for these reasons I am offering this amendment. We should not \nallow these gaming regulations to go into effect until we have had a \nfinal ruling of the court. We should not allow the Secretary of \nInterior to promulgate these regulations when he has an untenable \nconflict of interest. I think it is appropriate to put a 1-year \nmoratorium on it.\n  I am glad to have broad bipartisan support from Senators Graham, \nReid, Bayh, Grams, Inhofe, Voinovich, Lugar, and Enzi.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Mack be added as a cosponsor of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is an important matter, Mr. President. I care \nabout it. I believe it is important from a governmental point of view. \nThe Chair understands, as a former Governor, the importance of \nprotecting the interest of the State to make decisions the people of \nthe State care about and not have them undermined or overruled by \nunelected bureaucrats in Washington.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter to me from \nthe Attorney General of the State of Florida, Robert Butterworth, and a \nletter from the Attorney General of the State of Alabama detailing \neloquently their objections to the Babbitt regulations.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of Florida,\n\n\n                                   Office of Attorney General,\n\n                                                    July 12, 2000.\n     Re Amendment to H.R. 4578\n\n     Hon. Jeff, Sessions,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: This letter is presented in support \n     of the rider that you will be sponsoring on the Interior \n     Appropriations Bill preventing the Secretary of the Interior \n     from issuing procedures which would allow class III gambling \n     on Indian lands in the absence of a Tribal-State compact \n     during the fiscal year ending September 31, 2001. Such a \n     rider would be welcomed by the State of Florida and I \n     strongly support your effort to so restrict the actions of \n     the Secretary.\n       In April of 1999, the Secretary promulgated final rules \n     allowing him to issue procedures which would license class \n     III gambling on Indian lands in a State where there has been \n     no Tribal-State compact negotiated as required by section \n     2710(d) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Florida and \n     Alabama immediately challenged those regulations asserting \n     that they are in excess of the authority delegated to the \n     Secretary by Congress in IGRA and that they are inconsistent \n     with IGRA's statutory scheme. In letters to various members \n     of Congress, the Secretary stated that he would allow the \n     litigation to conclude prior to finalizing any such \n     procedures through publication in the Federal Register. \n     During recent deliberations on a House measure similar to the \n     one you propose, the Secretary indicated that he would \n     forbear publication until after the completion of any \n     appeals.\n       Such a promise by the Secretary is not legally binding on \n     this Secretary or any successor. If the trial court rules in \n     his favor and the States appeal, the State of Florida faces \n     the prospect of the Secretary publishing final procedures for \n     Florida Tribes thereby licensing full scale casino gambling \n     on Indian lands in our state while the appeal is pending. \n     Should the States prevail on appeal and the Secretary's \n     actions are determined to be invalid by either the Court of \n     Appeals or the Supreme Court, Florida will be faced with an \n     intolerable situation. The Tribes will have invested in and \n     opened full scale casinos which will then be deemed illegal \n     under IGRA. In the past, the federal government has been \n     either unable or unwilling to see that the requirements of \n     the law--IGRA--be faithfully enforced. Both the Seminole and \n     Miccosukee Tribes in Florida have for some time operated \n     uncompacted class III gambling operations with no response \n     from the responsible federal officials.\n       I believe that your proposal is in order. The proposal is \n     consistent with the Secretary's position that the court \n     should be given an opportunity to rule on the validity of his \n     regulations prior to the implementation of any gambling \n     purporting to be licensed under them. By preventing the \n     Secretary from acting in the next fiscal year, the proposal \n     protects all concerned from a miscarriage of justice and will \n     inject the certainty necessary for proper relations among the \n     parties to this dispute.\n       Thank you again for your continued attention to this very \n     important matter and I remain at your service to help in any \n     way I can.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Robert A. Butterworth,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Office of the Attorney General,\n\n\n                                             State of Alabama,\n\n                                                    July 11, 2000.\n\n     Re Sessions-Graham Amendment to H.R. 4578\n\n     Senator Jeff Sessions,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: I write in support of the amendment \n     that you and Senator Graham have proposed to H.R. 4578, the \n     FY 2001 appropriations bill for the Department of the \n     Interior, which would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior \n     from using appropriated funds to publish Class III gaming \n     procedures under part 291 of title 25, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n       As you know, substantial questions have been raised \n     regarding the Secretary's authority to promulgate Indian \n     gaming regulations. At the Notice and Comment stage, the \n     Attorneys General of several states, including Alabama, \n     pointed out that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to \n     promulgate procedures that would allow Indian tribes to \n     obtain gaming compacts from Interior rather than by \n     negotiation with the States. The Attorneys General also \n     pointed out that the Secretary had an incurable conflict of \n     interest that would preclude his acting as a mediator in \n     disputes between the tribes and the States because he is a \n     trustee for the tribes and owes them a fiduciary duty. After \n     the Secretary overrode these objections and promulgated \n     Indian gaming regulations, the States of Alabama and Florida \n     filed suit in federal district court to challenge the \n     Secretary's action. That lawsuit remains pending.\n       The proposed rider preserves the status quo and allows the \n     federal courts to resolve the issues raised in the lawsuit \n     filed by Alabama and Florida. More particularly, the rider \n     precludes the Secretary from spending appropriated funds to \n     take the last step necessary to allow a tribe to conduct \n     Class III gaming over State objection. The Secretary should \n     withhold this final step until the Alabama and Florida \n     lawsuit has been resolved and all appeals are precluded.\n       The rider will not only preserve the status quo, it will \n     preclude injury to the States and any tribe that may rely to \n     its detriment on Secretarial action that has not been \n     conclusively held to be statutorily authorized.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                       Bill Pryor,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek to make his amendment \nthe pending amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be made the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today as I have in prior years to \noppose the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Sessions, \nrelated to Indian gaming.\n  I have had the privilege of serving on the Committee on Indian \nAffairs for 20 years now.\n  Over the course of that time, I have learned a little bit about the \nstate of Indian country, and the pervasive poverty which is both the \nremnant and result of too many years of failed Federal policies\n  There was a time in our history when the native people of this land \nthrived.\n  They lived in a state of optimum health.\n  They took from the land and the water only those resources that were \nnecessary to sustain their well-being.\n  They were the first stewards of the environment, and those who later \ncame here, found this continent in pristine condition because of their \nwise stewardship.\n  Even after the advent of European contact, most tribal groups \ncontinued their subsistence way of life.\n  Their culture and religion sustained them.\n  They had sophisticated forms of government.\n  It was so sophisticated and so clearly efficient and effective over \nmany centuries, that our Founding Fathers could find no other better \nform of government upon which to structure the government of our new \nNation.\n  So they adopted the framework of the Iroquois Confederacy--a true \ndemocracy--and it is upon that foundation that we have built this great \nNation.\n  Unfortunately, there came a time in our history when those in power \ndecided that the native people were an obstacle, and obstruction to the \nnew American way of life and later, to the westward expansion of the \nUnited States.\n  So our Nation embarked upon a course of terminating the Indians by \nexterminating them through war and the distribution of blankets \ninfested with smallpox.\n  We very nearly succeeded in wiping them out.\n  Anthropologists and historians estimate that there were anywhere from \n10 to 50 million indigenous people occupying this continent at the time \nof European contact.\n  By 1849, when the United States finally declared and end to the era \nknown as the Indian Wars, we had managed to so effectively decimate the \nIndian population that there were a bare 250,000 native people \nremaining.\n  Having failed in that undertaking, we next proceeded to round up \nthose who survived, forcibly marched them away from their traditional \nlands and across the country.\n  Not surprisingly, these forced marches--and there were many of these \n``trails of tears''--further reduced the Indian population because many \ndied along the way.\n  Later, we found the most inhospitable areas of the country on which \nto relocate the native people, and expected them to scratch out a \nliving there.\n  Of course, we made some promises along the way:\n  That in exchange for the cession by the tribes of millions of acres \nof land to the United States, we would provide them with education and \nhealth care and shelter.\n  We told them, often in solemn treaties, that these new lands would be \ntheirs in perpetuity--that their traditional way of life would be \nprotected from encroachment by non-Indians and that we would recognize \ntheir inherent right as sovereigns to retain all powers of government \nnot relinquished.\n  Their rights to hunt and fish and gather food, to use the waters that \nwere necessary to sustain life on a reservation and the natural \nresources, were also recognized as preserved in perpetuity to their \nuse.\n  But over the years, these promises and others were broken by our \nNational Government, and our vacillations in policies--of which there \nwere many--left most reservation communities in economic ruin.\n  It might interest my colleagues in the Senate to know that the \nGovernment of the United States entered into 800 treaties with Indian \nnations, sovereign nations. Of the 800 treaties, 470 were filed. I \npresume they are still filed in some of our cabinets. Three hundred \nseventy were ratified. Of the 370 treaties ratified by this Senate, we \nfound it necessary to violate provisions in every single one of them.\n  The cumulative effects of our treatment of the native people of this \nland have proven to be nearly fatal to them.\n  Poverty in Indian country is unequaled anywhere else in the United \nStates.\n  The desperation and despair which inevitably accompanies the \npervasive economic devastation that is found in Indian country accounts \nfor the astronomically high rates of suicide and mortality from \ndiseases.\n  Within this context, along comes an opportunity for some tribal \ngovernments to explore the economic potential of gaming.\n  It doesn't prove to be a panacea, but it begins to bring in revenues \nthat tribal communities haven't had before.\n  And then the State of California enters the picture by bringing a \nlegal action against the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians--a case that \nultimately makes it to the Supreme Court.\n  Consistent with 150 years of Federal law and constitutional \nprinciples, the Supreme Court rules that the State of California cannot \nexercise its jurisdiction on Indian lands to regulate gaming \nactivities.\n  This is in May 1987, and in the aftermath of the Court's ruling, \nattention turns to the Congress.\n  Mr. President, it was now in the 100th session of the Congress that I \nfound myself serving as the primary sponsor of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act of 1988.\n  There were many hearings and many drafts leading up to the \nformulation of the bill that was ultimately signed into law.\n  Intially, our inclination was to follow the well-established and \ntime-honored model of Federal Indian law--which was to provide for an \nexclusive Federal presence in the regulation of gaming activities on \nIndian lands.\n  Such a framework would be consistent with constitutional principles, \nwith the majority of our Federal statutes addressing Indian country, \nand would reflect the fact that as a general proposition--it is Federal \nlaw, along with tribal law, that governs most all of what may transpire \nin Indian country.\n  But representatives of several States came to the Congress--demanding \na role in the regulation of Indian gaming--and ultimately, we \nacquiesced to those demands.\n  We selected a mechanism that has become customary in the dealings \namongst sovereign governments.\n  This mechanism--a compact between a State government and a tribal \ngovernment--would be recognized by the Federal Government as the \nagreement between the two sovereigns as to how the conduct of gaming on \nIndian lands would proceed.\n  This Federal recognition of the agreement would be accompanied when \nthe Secretary of the Department of the Interior approved the tribal-\nState compact.\n  In an effort to assure that the parties would come to the table and \nnegotiate a compact in good faith, and in order to provide for the \npossibility that the parties might not reach agreement, we also \nprovided a means by which the parties could seek the involvement of a \nFederal district court, and if ordered by the court, could avail \nthemselves of a mediation process.\n  That judicial remedy and the potential for a mediated solution when \nthe parties find themselves at an impasse has subsequently been \nfrustrated by a ruling of the Supreme Court upholding the 11th \namendment immunity of the several States.\n  Thus, while there are some who have consistently maintained that \nsovereign immunity is an anachronism in contemporary times, in this \narea at least, the States still jealously guard their sovereign \nimmunity to suit in the courts of another sovereign.\n  In so doing, the States have presented us with a clear conflict, \nwhich we have been trying to resolve for several years.\n  Although 24 of the 28 States that have Indian reservations within \ntheir boundaries have now entered into 159 tribal-State compacts with \n148 tribal governments, there are a few States in which tribal-state \ncompacts have not been reached.\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\n  And the conflict we are challenged with resolving is how to \naccommodate the desire of these States to be involved in the regulation \nof Indian gaming and their equally strong desire to avoid any process \nwhich might enable the parties to overcome an impasse in their \nnegotiations.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is to be commended in his efforts to \nachieve what the Congress has been unable to accomplish in the past few \nyears.\n  Following the Supreme Court's 11th amendment ruling, the Secretary \ntook a reasonable course of action.\n  He published a notice of proposed rulemaking, inviting comments on \nhis authority to promulgate regulations for an alternative process to \nthe tribal-State compacting process established in the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act.\n  Thereafter, he followed the next appropriate steps under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, inviting the input of all interested \nparties in the promulgation of regulations.\n  When the Senate acted to prohibit him from proceeding in this time-\nhonored fashion, he brought together representatives of the National \nGovernors Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, \nand the tribal governments, to explore whether a consensus could be \nreached on these and other matters.\n  In the meantime, my colleagues propose an amendment that would \nprohibit the Secretary from proceeding with the regulatory process.\n  Once again, there have been no hearings on this proposal--no public \nconsideration of this formulation--no input from the governments \ninvolved and directly affected by this proposal.\n  Last year, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior made clear \nhis intention to recommend a veto of the Interior appropriations bill \nshould this provision be adopted by the Senate and approved in House-\nSenate conference.\n  I suggest that it is unlikely that the Secretary's position has \nchanged in any material respect--particularly in light of all that he \nhas undertaken to accomplish, including frank discussion amongst the \nState and tribal governments.\n  As one who initiated a similar discussion process several years ago, \nI am more than a little familiar with the issues that require \nresolution.\n  However, in the intervening years, court rulings have clarified and \nput to rest many of the issues that were in contention in that earlier \nprocess.\n  I have continued to talk to Governors and attorneys general and \ntribal government leaders on a weekly, if not daily basis, and I \nbelieve, as the Secretary does, that the potential is there for the \nState and tribal governments to come to some mutually acceptable \nresolution of the matters that remain outstanding between them.\n  I believe the Secretary's process should be allowed to proceed.\n  I also believe that pre-empting that process through an amendment to \nthis bill could well serve as the death knell for what is ultimately \nthe only viable way to accomplish a final resolution.\n  The alternative is to proceed in this piecemeal fashion each year--an \namendment each year to prohibit the Secretary from taking any action \nthat would bridge the gap in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that was \ncreated by the Court's ruling and which will inevitably discourage the \nState and tribal governments from fashioning solutions.\n  This is not the way to do the business of the people.\n  There are those in this body who are opposed to gaming.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I count myself in their numbers. I am \nopposed to gaming.\n  Hawaii and Utah are the only two States in our Union that criminally \nprohibit all forms of gaming, and I support that prohibition in my \nState.\n  But I have walked many miles in Indian country, and I have seen the \npoverty, and the desperation and despair in the eyes of many Indian \nparents and their children.\n  I have looked into the eyes of the elders--eyes that express great \nsadness.\n  I have met young Indian people who are now dead because they saw no \nhope for the future.\n  And I have seen what gaming has enabled tribal governments to do, for \nthe first time--to build hospitals and clinics, to repair and construct \nsafe schools, to provide jobs or the adults and educational \nopportunities for the youth--and perhaps most importantly, to engender \na real optimism that there can be and will be--the prospects for a \nbrighter future.\n  It is for these reasons, and because of their rights as sovereigns to \npursue activities that hold the potential for making their tribal \neconomies become both viable and stable over the long term, that I \nsupport Indian gaming.\n  And it is for these reasons, that I must, again this year, strongly \noppose the efforts of my colleagues to take from Indian country, what \nunfortunately has become the single ray of hope for the future that \nnative people have had for a very long time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just have a minute and then I will \nyield to Senator Campbell.\n  Mr. President, Alabama has one very small tribe of a few hundred \npeople down at the south end of the State, near my home of Mobile. This \nland is around Montgomery, 150 miles further north, and there are no \nIndians living on it, where they want to build this casino.\n  The tribe is a group of the finest people I know. The chief tribal \nadministrator, Eddie Tullis, is a long time friend of mine. I admire \nhim. I admire what they have done. They have a bingo parlor that has \nbeen successful and is doing well. They have a motel and a restaurant \nthat I eat at frequently. I love the people who are there. I care about \nthem. Eddie Tullis recently said in the paper: Jeff is OK. He is just \nletting his morality get in the way of his good judgment.\n  I didn't know whether I should take that as a compliment, or what.\n  But my view is simply this: I don't think IGRA would have passed if \nthe people in the Senate and the House thought that if a State said to \nthe tribe: You can have horse racing, you can have dog racing, you can \nhave bingo, as we have in Alabama, but we are not going to remove \ncasino gambling from the State.\n  That is the question I have.\n  The Secretary of Interior is talking about stepping into this dispute \nand taking the position that he alone can decide what is done.\n  I care about the fine Indian people who are members of the Poarch \nBand in Atmore, AL. I have visited that area many times. I know quite a \nnumber of them personally. This isn't a personal thing. I think they \nunderstand it. It is matter of law. I was former Attorney General of \nthe State of Alabama. I don't believe this is good policy.\n  We ought to pass this amendment.\n  I see Senator Campbell, whom I respect highly. I know he wants to \nspeak on the matter.\n  I yield to Senator Campbell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, certainly there are Members of this Chamber who are \ndownright against gaming. I understand that. As Senator Inouye \nmentioned, even his State has no gaming. But I do not believe that is \nwhat this debate is about. For me, very frankly, it is about whether we \nkeep our word or we do not keep our word.\n  The Senator mentioned that literally for every treaty ever signed by \nthe Federal Government, Indian tribes ended up losing by virtue of the \nGovernment breaking the treaty.\n  No one speaks more eloquently than Senator Inouye about the \ndestructive forces that have been heaped upon American Indians at the \nhands of the U.S. Government. I think he does it very eloquently \nbecause of his own background. He is a man of great bravery, who just \nreceived America's highest award. He is a Medal of Honor recipient. Yet \nhe fought in a war during which his own people were interned in camps \nat the hands of the Federal Government. Certainly, Senator Inouye is \nheld in the highest esteem throughout Indian country, as he is in this \nbody.\n  But I think many of our colleagues ought to study the old treaties, \neven though most of them were broken--not all--by the Federal \nGovernment. Indian people have a very special relationship with the \nFederal Government. It would do us well if we read some of the old \npromises we made and didn't keep.\n  The Senator talked a little about the problems we have on \nreservations. But\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\nI don't think it is really understood by people who spend most of their \ntime, as we say, ``outside the reservation.'' You ought to go to Pine \nRidge, SD, where unemployment is 70 percent, usually. It is rarely less \nthan 50 percent. It is sometimes higher than 70 percent--where every \nthird young lady tries suicide before she is out of her teenage years; \nand young men, too. Too many of them succeed.\n  With fetal alcohol syndrome compared to the national average, 1 out \nof every 50,000 babies born in America suffers from fetal alcohol \nsyndrome. For those who do not know what that is, that is a disease \nthey get when they are inside of their mother because their mother \ndrinks. It is about 1 out of 50,000 nationwide. But in Pine Ridge, SD, \nin some years it is 1 out of 4 babies. It is a disease that is totally \npreventable. Yet it is incurable once they have it. They get it from \ntheir mother drinking too much. They are institutionalized for life, at \na huge cost in terms of human tragedy and the American taxpayer.\n  If you had those numbers in any town in America--whether it is the \nhigh school dropout rate, or the suicide rate, whether it is death by \nviolent actions, whether it is fetal alcohol syndrome, or anything \nelse--if you had anything near that in the outside culture, it would be \nconsidered devastating to that community. Believe me, people would be \nhere on the floor clamoring for the Senate to do something about it.\n  There are very few things that work on Indian reservations that try \nto bring new money to the reservation.\n  In 1988, when Senator Inouye was the leader on the Senate side on the \nIndian Gaming and Regulatory Act, and I was on the House side as one of \nthe people involved originally in the writing of that bill, certainly \nthen none of us knew that it would grow to such proportions. But \nclearly it has done some good. It is not all good. Obviously, there are \nstresses and pressures. When you increase any kind of economic activity \nin a local community, there are more people on the highways. There are \nmore people in the schools and parks. We understand that.\n\n  If you look at the outside of it in terms of what it has done to help \nyoungsters with scholarships, what it has done to help senior citizens \nwho had no other income, and what it has done to provide money for \ntribes that have been able to invest that money into other enterprises, \nit is overwhelmingly positive.\n  I have to tell you that it seems that every year we have to fight \nthis fight. Almost every year, somebody comes down here with a \nmicrophone who wants to take a hit at the little opportunities Indians \nhave in Indian country because of gaming.\n  I point out, my gosh, that I live on the Southern Ute Reservation in \nColorado 150 yards from a tribal casino. I see who works it. I see if \nthere is any increase in crime--or other kinds of wild accusations we \nsometimes hear on the Senate floor. Believe me, they are mostly wrong.\n  First of all, the majority of people who work in the Indian \nreservations are not Indian. At least 50 percent in most of the casinos \nare not Indians. It has helped whole communities. They pay income taxes \njust as anybody else--Indian people and non-Indian. It has put revenue \ninto the coffers of the Federal Government and State governments.\n  Under Federal law, in 1988, as you know, tribes were limited to the \ntypes of gaming allowed under the laws of the States in which they \nreside. Some States simply don't allow gaming at all. Therefore, those \ntribes in those States can't do it. We made sure that the tribes were \nfactored in in 1988. In my own State, tribes are limited to just slot \nmachines and low-stakes table games.\n  The State of our friend from New Mexico has a little higher limit. \nOther States have higher limits. But it is with the approval of the \nStates under a contractual agreement between the States and the tribes.\n  In Utah, there is no gambling whatsoever. Therefore, the tribes \ncannot have any form of gaming.\n  The intent of the Federal Indian Gaming Act was that in States where \ngaming is limited or prohibited, tribes would be similarly limited or \nprohibited. It was an agreement made with the States. They were not \nlocked out. They were completely included in the process and certainly \nin the dialog when we wrote this bill in the first place.\n  There are many tribes and States that sat down and worked out their \nagreements that are binding and effective.\n  We often hear about an isolated case where something is not working \nvery well. But often we don't study all of the overwhelmingly positive \neffects.\n  There are some Governors whom we know who have refused to negotiate \nat all with the tribes in their States, leaving those tribes without \nthe ability to legally conduct gaming activities. That wasn't assumed. \nWe passed the IGRA Act in 1988. We didn't think there would be some \nGovernors who simply wouldn't negotiate and would stonewall and not \ncome to the table. But there have been some.\n  We should remember how we got here.\n  In the wake of the 1987 Cabazon decision by the Supreme Court which \nheld that State gaming laws did not apply to Indian gaming conducted on \nIndian lands, States clamored for a role in the writing of IGRA and \nregulating of the gaming on Indian lands. They got it.\n  Congress responded in 1988 by enacting the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct which provided an unprecedented opportunity for States to \nparticipate in the conduct and regulation of Indian gaming conducted \nentirely on Indian lands.\n  Reverse that a little bit. Do you think Indian tribes are in the loop \nor are able to participate in the conduct of regulation of State \nactivities that are off Indian lands? They don't have the voice that \nStates do within tribal governments.\n  That act was a compromise and for the first time gave the State \ngovernments a role in what gaming would occur on Indian lands. While \nCongress intended State participation, we intended to participate but \nwe never intended that the States' refusal to negotiate would serve as \nan effective veto by any State over a tribe's right to conduct such \ngaming.\n  Today's debate is about whether a Governor or State can limit the \ntype of activity of certain groups simply by refusing to negotiate. \nThat is unfair. I think it is un-American.\n  As my colleagues know, I happen to be from the West. Most westerners \nare strong States rights people. We continually harangue the Federal \nGovernment for eroding States rights. We are always down here over \nbusiness development or use of public lands. If it is good enough for a \ntribe to have to negotiate, then it should also be good enough for the \nState to have to negotiate, as was implied in IGRA.\n  While I believe that each State's public policy should determine the \nscope of gaming in that State, I also believe the current state of the \nlaw gives States what is in reality a veto over tribes. That is \nunacceptable.\n  I should point out to my colleagues that in many cases non-Indian \ngaming is promoted and even operated by State governments, such as \nState lotteries. It is an element of competition that should not be \nlost on this body. No one wants to share the revenue if they think they \ncan make it all. I understand that. That is American business. But I \nbelieve some States have refused to bargain simply in order to preserve \nthat monopoly on gaming.\n  To begin to break the stalemate, the Interior Department proposed a \nprocess based on the IGRA statute. Senator Inouye alluded to that. \nThough the process may need refinement, I don't believe the Secretary \nshould be stopped from developing alternative approaches to this \nimpasse.\n  I believe it is in the interests of all parties that the Federal \ncourts be allowed to render final, binding decisions to clarify the \nauthority of the Secretary. That has not been finished. That is ongoing \nnow. Adoption of this amendment would certainly short circuit that \nprocess.\n  By the way, there has been a similar amendment already rejected by \nthe House of Representatives. I think it will unduly interfere with the \nlitigation that is now at hand and deny the parties the clarification \nthey need.\n  Last year, Secretary Babbitt made a commitment to Chairman Gorton, to \nthe Senate as a whole, to refrain from implementing any further \nregulations until the Federal courts, including the\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\nappellate level, rule on the merits of the legal issues involved. That \nlitigation is now endangered by this amendment, which prohibits the \nSecretary from taking any action to implement those regulations, \nincluding the actions that will allow the matter to ``ripen'' and allow \nit to be pursued to a conclusion.\n  Coming from a Western State, I am as supportive as anyone in this \nbody of States rights, but those who say this process ``overrides the \nGovernors'' are wrong.\n  Under the proposal, if a State objects to a decision made by the \nInterior Secretary, that State can challenge the decision in Federal \ncourt.\n  For those who fear the Department is acting without oversight I point \nout that Congress has the authority to review any proposed regulations \nbefore they take effect.\n  As the proposal comes before the authorizing committees, any new \nregulations will get a careful review and if they are found wanting, \nthey will not pass.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and allow the \nprocess to work.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3790\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe Senator Sessions is willing to \nwithdraw the rollcall on this amendment. It will be accepted by voice \nvote.\n  Also, I have a unanimous consent request with respect to the votes \nthat have already been ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, that is correct. First, we are asking \ntoday in this amendment basically what the Secretary has agreed to. He \nhas agreed, to the House but not to us, that he would hold off until \nafter the appeal, and this 1-year delay would cover the circumstance in \nwhich we are likely to have a new Secretary come January--whether \nPresident Bush or Gore is elected. This may not be binding on the new \none. It will guarantee the status quo until we get a court ruling.\n  In light of that and the discussions I have had, I vitiate my request \nfor the yeas and nays and ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I have no objection to the voice vote. I will be on the \nlosing side, but when we get to conference, I will have a lot more to \nsay about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3790) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding \nthe DOD concept, that the votes occur in the following order, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order prior to the votes, with 2 minutes \nprior to each vote for explanation in relation to the Durbin amendment \non the subject of grazing and the Inhofe amendment on the subject of \nthe National Endowment.\n\n\n                        CHANGE OF VOTE--NO. 169\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, on rollcall vote 169, I was \nrecorded as voting yea and I voted nay. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent the official record be corrected. This will in no way affect \nthe outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Reserving the right to object, on rollcall vote No. 169, I \nwas recorded as voting nay and I voted yea. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the official record be corrected to accurately reflect my \nvote. This will in no way affect the outcome of the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, do I understand that the \nunanimous consent request would bring the Senate back to the previous \norder, immediately after those two votes?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. Basically, we will have two \nrollcall votes now and then go to DOD. I understand the leaders were \nattempting to arrange to finish Interior on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request by the \nSenator from Washington?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenators from Nevada and Rhode Island?\n  Without objection, their requests are so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3810\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I don't believe the Senator from Illinois \nis available.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we waive our 2 minutes? We heard from the \nSenators previously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment No. 3810. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Under the previous order, \nthere are 2 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the Inhofe \namendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers of the Defense \nauthorization bill, after we complete this vote, in an effort for \npeople to understand what is going on, would like to be able to tell \nMembers who have amendments to offer to that legislation what the \nsequence would be. Under the order that is now in effect, Senator Byrd \nwill be first.\n  I think it would be appropriate if Senator Warner and Senator Levin \ncould give us some indication how the next amendments would flow so we \nknow what happens after this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader.\n  We are here to try to convenience the Senate tonight. After this next \nvote, under the order, we go to the defense authorization bill. There \nare only four amendments scheduled in addition to Mr. Byrd's amendment. \nThat would make five.\n  Senator Levin and I will accommodate the Members who are going to be \ndebating tonight. If we can get into some short meeting with them, in \nbetween these votes right now, perhaps at the end we can announce a UC \nrequest sequencing the four amendments. That is my intention.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield, there is just one more vote \nnow scheduled?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then we would go to Senator Byrd, who is in the UC, \ndispose of that amendment. Then the other four that are listed are not \nsequenced yet.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We would attempt to sequence them. If we fail, as far as I \nam concerned, then it's whoever gets recognized first. But we are going \nto make a real effort to sequence those amendments and then vote on \nthem in the morning.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. Mr. President, we will try to reduce the times so \nthat we are not here for a lengthy period.\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\n  Mr. REID. The Senators involved are Senators Feingold, Durbin, \nHarkin, and Kerry of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But there are others involved in those amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3812\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to a vote on the Inhofe amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is a very simple, straightforward, \neasy-to-understand amendment. It merely takes $7.3 million and puts it \ninto the Indian Health Services for diabetes. It does take that out of \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, but all it does is take it out of \nthe increase. Last year they had $97 million. They are increasing it \nthis year to $105 million. All I am asking is to take that $7 million, \ninstead of increasing the National Endowment for the Arts, and to put \nit into the Indian Health Services' diabetes program.\n  I am prejudiced because I come from the State that has in terms of \npercentages, the largest Indian population. However, I can tell you \nthis, that of the national Indian population, 12.2 percent of them have \ndiabetes because of the environment in which they live. It is an \nunhealthy environment. There are cases where they have all kinds of \ninfections that set in where they are unable to keep from having \namputations. So it is a very serious thing.\n  You will hear from the other side an argument that says we are \nhurting the National Endowment for the Arts. I want Senators to \nremember, when you cast your vote, this does not take any money away \nfrom the allocation they had last year; it merely freezes that \nallocation in for the coming year. Even with the increase of $30 \nmillion that is currently in this program, that still is less than 10 \npercent of the amount of money that is spent for research on cancer and \nAIDS.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this bill includes a $143 million increase \nfor the Indian Health Service, an amount much larger than the entire \nappropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts. Due to the work \nof Senator Domenici, there is a $30 million-a-year entitlement for the \nvery subject of diabetes control for Indians that is already a part of \nthe funding of Indian programs in the United States.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts, which has abided by all of the \nrestrictions put on it over the last several years by this body, has \nnot had an increase since 1992. This is a fair and modest increase for \nthe National Endowment for the Arts. It ought to be rewarded for \nfollowing the commands of Congress, itself. The money is not needed for \nthe purposes of the amendment because that function is already very \ngenerously supported both in this bill and through an entitlement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3812. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 27, nays 73, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 176 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--27\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Coverdell\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--73\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 3812) was rejected.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \nremaining first-degree amendments in order to the Interior bill other \nthan the managers' package of amendments be the following and subject \nto relevant second-degree amendments:\n  Boxer on pesticides;\n  Bryan on timber sales;\n  Nickles on monuments language;\n  Torricelli on UPAR;\n  Torricelli on highlands;\n  Reed of Rhode Island on weatherization;\n  Bingaman on forest health;\n  Bingaman on Ramah Navajo;\n  Feingold on Park Service;\n  And Domenici on Rio Grande water.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that on Monday, July 17, the Senate \nresume the Interior bill at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the minority leader, and the amendments \nlisted above be offered and debated during Monday's session, other than \nthe Feingold amendment which will be debated on Tuesday with 15 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Feingold and 15 minutes under the control \nof Senator Bingaman regarding the Navajo amendment; further, with \nconsent granted, to lay aside each amendment where deemed necessary by \nthe two leaders.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that all amendments and debate be \nconcluded during Monday's session and the votes occur at 9:45 a.m. on \nTuesday, with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation, with the \nbill being advanced to third reading and passage to occur after \ndisposition of these amendments, all without any intervening action or \ndebate. Further, I ask unanimous consent that additional relevant \nsecond degrees be in order if necessary to the first degree after \ndisposition of any offered second-degree amendment on Tuesday.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, which will \nbe the entire Interior Subcommittee.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Senator Boxer has instructed \nme to make sure she has an up-or-down vote on her amendment. It is one \nthat is in order. She wants to make sure that if there is a second \ndegree she has a right to reoffer her amendment. She is willing to take \na voice vote. She wants to make sure there is a vote on her amendment, \nand I ask the Chair if that would be permissible under this consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will be \nno further votes this evening. The next vote will occur in a stacked \nsequence beginning at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. The Senate will begin the \ndeath tax repeal at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow, Thursday morning.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the \nSenate's adoption of the Domenici substitute amendment to the Craig \namendment regarding the President's Roadless Initiative. I was unable \nto be on the floor earlier today when the Craig amendment and Domenici \nsubstitute amendment were considered.\n  First, let me say that I was a cosponsor of the underlying Craig \namendment and I continue to share his concern about blatant Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act violations by this administration in the \ndevelopment of their Roadless Initiative. In any case, I don't believe \n``one-size-fits-all'' proposals like the President's Roadless \nInitiative, hatched in the halls of bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., \ncan be any substitute for sound land management policies developed in \ncollaboration with people at the local level. Oregonians, if given a \nchance, have proven\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\ntime and again that they can be better stewards of the land than \nfederal bureaucrats.\n  I understand that Senator Craig agreed to the Domenici substitute in \npart because this matter of FACA violations will be considered by the \ncourts this August. I trust that the Congress will have an opportunity \nto review this matter this session if the courts fail to do so, and I \npraise Senator Craig for his continued leadership on this important \nissue.\n  With that said, I wanted to add my voice to those who spoke earlier \nin favor of the Domenici substitute amendment that seeks to address the \ngrowing threat of catastrophic wildfire in areas of urban-wildland \ninterface. A century of fire suppression followed by years of inactive \nforest management under this administration have left our National \nForest system overstocked with underbrush and unnaturally dense tree \nstands that are now at risk of catastrophic wildfire. The GAO recently \nfound that at least 39 million acres of the National Forest system are \nat high risk for catastrophic fire. According to the Forest Service, \ntwenty-six million acres are at risk from insects and disease \ninfestations as well. The built up fuel loads in these forests create \nabnormally hot wildfires that are extremely difficult to control. To \nprevent catastrophic fire and widespread insect infestation and disease \noutbreaks, these forests need to be treated. The underbrush needs to be \nremoved. The forests must be thinned to allow the remaining trees to \ngrow more rapidly and more naturally. This year's fires in New Mexico \nhave given us a preview of what is to come throughout our National \nForest system if we continue this administration's policy of passive \nforest management.\n  I believe the Domenici amendment will help this reluctant \nadministration to face up to this growing threat to homes, wildlife, \nand watersheds. I commend Senator Domenici and the bipartisan group of \nSenators who worked very hard to craft this compromise.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in strong \nsupport of H.R. 4578, the Interior and related agencies appropriations \nbill for FY 2001.\n  As a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and the full \nAppropriations Committee, I appreciate the difficult task before the \ndistinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking member to balance the \ndiverse priorities funded in this bill--from our public lands, to major \nIndian programs and agencies, energy conservation and research, and the \nSmithsonian and federal arts agencies. They have done a masterful job \nmeeting important program needs within existing spending caps.\n  The pending bill provides $15.6 billion in new budget authority and \n$10.1 billion in new outlays to fund Department of Interior and related \nagencies. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other \ncompleted actions are taken into account the Senate bill totals $15.5 \nbillion in BA and $15.6 billion in outlays for FY 2001. The Senate bill \nis at its Section 302(b) allocation for BA and $2 million under the \nSubcommittee's revised 302(b) allocation in outlays.\n  I would particularly like to thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd \nfor their commitment to Indian programs in this year's Interior and \nRelated Agencies appropriation bill. They have included increases of \n$144 million for Bureau of Indian Affairs construction, $110 million \nfor the Indian Health service and $65 million for the operation of \nIndian programs.\n  I commend the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for bringing \nthis important measure to the floor within the 302(b) allocation. I \nurge the adoption of the bill, and ask for unanimous consent that the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n H.R. 4578, INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS, 2001, SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                              REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2001, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     Purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority...............       15,474           59       15,533\n  Outlays........................       15,509           70       15,579\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...............       15,474           59       15,533\n  Outlays........................       15,511           70       15,581\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority...............       14,769           59       14,828\n  Outlays........................       14,833           83       14,916\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...............       16,286           59       16,345\n  Outlays........................       15,982           70       16,052\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...............       14,723           59       14,782\n  Outlays........................       15,224           70       15,294\n \n SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...............  ...........  ...........  ...........\n  Outlays........................           -2  ...........           -2\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority...............          705  ...........          705\n  Outlays........................          676          -13          663\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...............         -812  ...........         -812\n  Outlays........................         -473  ...........         -473\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...............          751  ...........          751\n  Outlays........................          285  ...........          285\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

The clerk will report the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2549) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2001 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have in mind, and I think other Members \ndo at this juncture, operating under the unanimous consent agreement \nreached last night. I amend that unanimous consent to the extent that \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia very graciously is willing to \nwithhold the presentation of his amendment until such time that the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Alaska \nbring up their amendments, which is sequenced, and they indicate to \nthis manager that it will not take more than 10 or 12 minutes. \nTherefore, I ask that.\n  I further request, following the disposition of the Byrd amendment, \nMr. Feingold be recognized; following the completion of his amendment, \nthe Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand the Senator from Wisconsin is willing to have \n30 minutes equally divided instead of 40 minutes on his amendment. I \nask that the unanimous consent agreement be so modified.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3815\n\n   (Purpose: To provide that the limitation on payment of fines and \npenalties for environmental compliance violations applies only to fines \n               and penalties imposed by Federal agencies)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts had an \namendment pending concerning section 342 of this bill. We have \ndiscussed this. That was an amendment that would change the existing \ntext that came from an amendment I suggested. I will offer an amendment \nto strike the existing section 342 and insert language we agreed upon. \nI do believe the Senator from Massachusetts wants to be heard on this. \nI want a word after his comments.\n  Mr. KERRY. I suggest the Senator from Alaska go first, since he wants \nto frame the change, and I will be happy to respond.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is very gracious. I have become increasingly \nconcerned about the fines that EPA has been assessing against military \nreservations or elements of the Department of Defense, and had \nrequested this provision in the bill to curtail that activity. In fact, \nit would have originally applied to similar fines from State and local \nagencies also.\n  We have now agreed on a version of this section 342 that will limit \nthe fines that can be assessed against military entities by the EPA to \n$1.5 million unless the amount in excess of that is approved by \nCongress. It will be a provision, if accepted, which will be in effect \nfor 3 years. My feeling is that there are many things that go into the \noperation of the Department of Defense that are subject to review by \nEPA, and it is my opinion that they have been excessive in terms of \napplying fines against the military departments. I do believe it \nresults in an alteration of the lands we have for particular \ninstallations and it reduces the amount of money available\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\nto operate those installations when they face these fines.\n  This amendment does not prohibit the fines. It only says they cannot \nassess any and have them paid to the EPA in excess of $1.5 million \nunless that fine is approved by an act of Congress.\n  I thank the Senator for working this out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Alaska for his \nefforts to try to reach an accommodation. I listened carefully to the \narguments of the Senator from Alaska who made it clear that he had a \nvery strong belief that certain facilities in the State of Alaska had \nbeen treated in a way that he believed very deeply was inappropriate \nand resulted in fines that were excessive and, in his judgment, wrought \nwith some bureaucratic issues that he had no recourse to resolve.\n  The initial section in the bill reported by the committee would \nregrettably have prohibited the EPA entirely from being able to \nenforce. A number of Members felt very strongly that was an \noverreaction in how we cure the problem that the Senator from Alaska \nwas bringing to our attention without destroying the ability of the EPA \nto be able to enforce across the country.\n  So we reached an agreement where 98 percent of all those enforcement \nactions in the country which are under $1.5 million, the EPA will \ncontinue to be able to enforce as it currently does. It is appropriate \nfor this 3-year period only to review what the impact may be of some \nlarger level over that period of time.\n  To have proceeded down the road we were going to proceed, in my and \nother people's judgment, would have created a terrible double standard. \nUnder current law, a DOD facility that violates the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act or the \nToxic Substances Control Act or the Clean Air Act is subject to the \nsame kinds of penalties as a private facility. By waiving sovereign \nimmunity and subjecting Federal facilities to fines, we created the \nfinancial hammer to be able to force a sometimes reluctant Government \nand a Government bureaucracy to comply.\n  Congress recognized this principle in 1992 when we passed the law. \nThe bill was sponsored by majority leader Mitchell. He said at the time \nthat a waiver of sovereign immunity would move us from the disorder of \nFederal noncompliance to a forum in which all entities were subject to \nthe same law and to full enforcement action. I am pleased to say it \npassed the Senate by a vote of 94-3, and it passed the House by a vote \nof 403-3. It was signed into law by President Bush, who at the time \nsaid it would bring all Federal facilities into compliance with \napplicable Federal and State hazardous waste laws.\n  I think that very much is our purpose today--to protect our capacity \nto be able to secure that kind of enforcement. I thank the Senator from \nAlaska for his very reasonable approach to this. I think we have been \nable to resolve the most egregious situations about which he has \nexpressed appropriate concern, but at the same time we have been able \nto preserve the principle of Federal compliance and the principle of \nall people being treated equally.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia for his courtesy in allowing us to deal with this issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his courtesy and the Senator from Massachusetts. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment I have at the desk be accepted in lieu of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3815.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 342 is amended by striking the provisions therein \n     and inserting:\n\n     SEC. 342. PAYMENT OF FINES AND PENALTIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL \n                   COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS.\n\n       (a) Payment of Fines and Penalties.--(1) Chapter 160 of \n     title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 2710. Environmental compliance: payment of fines and \n       penalties for violations\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense or the \n     Secretary of a military department may not pay a fine or \n     penalty for an environmental compliance violation that is \n     imposed by a Federal agency against the Department of Defense \n     or such military department, as the case may be, unless the \n     payment of the fine or penalty is specifically authorized by \n     law, if the amount of the fine or penalty (including any \n     supplemental environmental projects carried out as part of \n     such penalty) is $1,500,000 or more.\n       ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term \n     `environmental compliance', in the case of on-going \n     operations, functions, or activities at a Department of \n     Defense facility, means the activities necessary to ensure \n     that such operations, functions, or activities meet \n     requirements under applicable environmental law.\n       ``(B) The term does not include operations, functions, or \n     activities relating to environmental restoration under this \n     chapter that are conducted using funds in an environmental \n     restoration account under section 2703(a) of this title.\n       ``(2) The term `violation', in the case of environmental \n     compliance, means an act or omission resulting in the failure \n     to ensure the compliance.\n       ``(c) Expiration of Prohibition.--This section does not \n     apply to any part of a violation described in subsection (a) \n     that occurs on or after the date that is three years after \n     the date of the enactment of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001.''.\n       (2) The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``2710.

Mr. President, regarding the Fort Wainwright central \nheat and powerplant, on March 5, 1999, the EPA Region 10 issued a \nnotice of violation against the U.S. Army Alaska claiming they had \nviolated the Clean Air Act with their central heat and powerplant.\n  After several meetings between regulators and Army officials, the EPA \nsent them a settlement offer proposing that the Army pay a $16 million \npenalty to resolve the alleged clean air violations.\n  In the offer, the EPA advised the Army that it would file a formal \ncomplaint if the Army failed to make a good-faith counteroffer within \none month. The EPA also indicated that the size of fine sought will \nlikely increase if a complaint was filed.\n  This $16 million penalty is the largest single fine ever sought from \nthe Department of the Army or against any installation within the \nDepartment of Defense. It also exceeds the combined total of all other \nfines previously sought from the Army.\n  While U.S. Army Alaska had been aware for some time that the 50-year \nold central heat and powerplant required numerous upgrades, significant \nprogress had been made toward bringing the plant into compliance.\n  The Army also had been working closely with the Alaska Department of \nEnvironmental Conservation--which had been delegated Clean Air Act \nenforcement authority from the EPA--regarding the timetable for \ncompliance.\n  That same year, in fiscal year 1999, the Army sought and received \nauthorization and appropriations from the Congress to build a $16 \nmillion baghouse to control emissions from the plant.\n  In addition, an additional $22 million had been budgeted for fiscal \nyear 2000 for plant upgrades.\n  The Army and the Department of Defense were surprised by the basis \nfor the proposed penalty.\n  In EPA's settlement letter, EPA stated that it was seeking to recover \nthe ``economic benefit'' the Army received by not constructing the \nbaghouse sooner.\n  Over $15.8 million of the proposed fine, roughly 98 percent, is \ndirectly tied to the ``saved'' cost that U.S. Army Alaska purportedly \nenjoyed.\n\n[[Page S6540]]\n\n  This is also the first time the EPA proposed a fine whose economic \nbenefit components dwarf the assessed penalty based on the seriousness \nof the alleged violations.\n  Regarding the EPA visit to Shemya Air Force Base, the Air Force had a \n50-year problem of waste and drum accumulation at Shemya Island--\ncomplicated by the large quantity generator status at Shemya AFB. This \nstatus required processing of accumulated hazardous wastes from the \nisland within 90 days of generation. To meet the 90-day requirement, \nairlift had to be used as the primary method of disposal of the \naccumulated hazardous wastes. Also, the airlift crews had to have \nspecial qualifications to handle and process hazardous wastes.\n  From 1989 through 1991, 13,781 gallons of hazardous waste were \nshipped off Shemya Island. Following the 1991 Gulf War, airlift outside \nof the Middle East was impossible to get.\n  Complicating matters, Elmendorf AFB in Alaska could not handle the \namounts of hazardous waste being returned from remote Alaskan defense \nsites. Movement of hazardous waste from remote sites came to a \nstandstill due to strained airlift requirements and limited hazardous \nwaste storage and processing capabilities.\n  In January of 1993, the Air Force started airlifting and removing 100 \nwaste drums every week vice 100 per month.\n  Two months later, in March, the EPA gave the Air Force a 10-day \nnotice of inspection. During the inspection, the Air Force had 660 \nbarrels on the Shemya airfield processed awaiting air transportation.\n  During the out-briefing with senior Air Force personnel, the \ninspectors commented that the Air Force was making good progress in \nreducing the backlog of waste drums.\n  A long period of time ensued between the inspection and the publicly \nannounced result and proposed fine by EPA.\n  EPA assessed the Air Force a fine of $483,000--this was the largest \nenvironmental noncompliance fine levied against the Air Force at that \npoint in time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, tonight, Senator Stevens offered an \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2001 to amend Section 342. The amendment reflects a compromise reached \nbetween Senator Stevens, Baucus, Lautenberg and myself. I want to thank \nSenator Stevens for working with us to address grave concerns we had \nwith Section 342 of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about Section 342 \nand discuss why I had such great concerns over the impact it would have \nhad on environmental compliance. Section 342, as it was passed out of \nthe Armed Services Committee, would have weakened a fundamental \nenvironmental principle that protects the environment and public health \nin communities across the nation. It is the principle that national \nenvironmental laws should apply to the federal government in the same \nmanner as they apply to state and local governments and to private \nfacilities, including companies, universities, hospitals, and nonprofit \nentities.\n  Section 342 would have created a double standard by subjecting \ncorporations, state and local facilities to one legal standard and \nDepartment of Defense facilities to a second, weaker standard. More \nimportantly, it had the great potential to undermine compliance with \nnational environmental and public health protections at military \nfacilities across the nation--putting the environment and citizens at \nrisk.\n  Specifically, the provision amended existing law to require \nCongressional authorization before the DOD pays environmental and \npublic health penalties assessed by state and federal authorities in \nexcess of $1.5 million or based on ``economic benefit'' or ``size-of-\nbusiness'' criteria. As a result, it provided DOD a congressional \nreprieve not provided to any other entity.\n  It created a double standard. Under current law, a DOD facility that \nviolates the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Safe Drinking \nWater Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, or the Clean Air Act is \nsubject to the same kind of penalties as a private facility. By waiving \nsovereign immunity--and subjecting federal facilities to fines--we \ncreate the financial hammer that forces sometimes reluctant government \nbureaucracies to comply. And we apply the law equally to all.\n  Congress recognized this principle in 1992 with the enactment of the \nFederal Facilities Compliance Act, which waived sovereign immunity \nunder the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The bill was \nsponsored by Majority Leader George Mitchell, who said in floor debate \nthat, ``A waiver of sovereign immunity moves us from the disorder of \nFederal noncompliance to a forum in which all entities are subject to \nthe same law and to full enforcement action.'' He added that: ``The \nprinciple [of waving sovereign immunity] is important because, without \nit, there is only voluntary compliance. History demonstrates that \nvoluntary compliance does not work.''\n  The Federal Facilities Compliance Act had 33 cosponsors in the \nSenate--myself included. It was a bipartisan effort that passed the \nSenate with a vote of 94-3 and the House by a vote of 403-3. It was \nsigned into law by President George Bush, who said that, ``The \nobjective of the bill is to bring all Federal facilities into \ncompliance with applicable Federal and State hazardous waste laws, to \nwaive Federal Sovereign immunity under those laws, and to allow the \nimposition of fines and penalties.'' He added, ``Four years ago I \npromised the American people that I would make the federal government \nlive up to the same environmental standards that apply to private \ncitizens. By signing this bill, we take another step toward fulfillment \nof that promise.''\n  It was an important step for the states coping with federal agencies \nthat were immune to enforcement and that refused to comply. The \nCalifornia Secretary of Environmental Protection, James M. Strock, said \nthat in passing the Act, Congress took ``an important step in restoring \nthe link between environmental responsibility and remediation of \nenvironmental damage at federal facilities.'' He continued, ``The Act \nprovides an essential tool to states and localities which seek \ncompliance with hazardous waste laws.''\n  The National Association of Attorneys General applauded the passage \nof the Act. Their statement read that, ``The [legislation] has been \namong the Association's highest priorities on Capitol Hill for the past \nfive years. . . . [The] Attorneys General have repeatedly called upon \nCongress to clarify the waiver of federal sovereign immunity, which has \nthus far prevented the states from ensuring compliance at contaminated \nfacilities through assessment of fines and penalties.''\n  I feel that Section 342 would have rolled back the progress we've \nmade with the Federal Facilities Compliance Act and other laws. It \nwould have been a mistake. We should allow our law enforcement agencies \nto do their job. Section 342 of the DOD bill was opposed by the \nNational Governors' Association, the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. In a joint \nletter they write that, ``States report that the federal government is \nthe nation's largest polluter and military installations are a major \ncontributor to that pollution. Section 342 is a step backward from the \nprogress we have made in changing the attitude of military \ninstallations toward compliance with the nation's environmental laws. \nWe urge you to support efforts to strike the provisions.'' This letter \nis signed by Governor Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Attorney General Christine \nGregoire of Washington, and Senator Beverly Gard of Indiana.\n  Section 342 was also opposed by the Environmental Council of the \nStates. It writes that, ``The state environmental commissioners, along \nwith governors, state legislators, attorneys general and other \nofficials of state government have insisted that the federal government \nlive by exactly the same standards and requirements that it imposes on \nall other parties, and we all oppose this provision in S. 2549. \nExempting military installations from one of the basic tools of \nenvironmental enforcement is bad policy, and would seriously erode our \ncapacity to ensure our citizens the protection of federal and state \nlaws.'' The letter is signed by R. Lewis Shaw, Deputy Commissioner, \nSouth Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and \nPresident of the Council.\n\n[[Page S6541]]\n\n  Mr. President, even Governor George W. Bush of Texas recognizes the \nimportant principle of treating federal facilities as we treat state \nand local governments and private facilities. On Governor Bush's \nwebsite--georgebush.com\n--the Governor has posted his environmental platform. The sixth plank \nin that platform reads as follows: ``Direct active federal facilities \nto comply with the environmental protection laws and hold them \naccountable.'' It continues, ``Governor Bush will expect the federal \ngovernment to lead by example. He believes it is time to end the double \nstandard that has federal government acting as enforcer of the nation's \nenvironmental laws, while at the same time causing pollution that \nviolates those laws.''\n  Mr. President, last year, a provision similar to Section 342 was \nincorporated into the FY 2000 DOD appropriations bill. The \nCongressional Budget Office evaluated that provision and concluded \nthat, ``Based on information from DOD and on conversations with \nrepresentatives of state governments, CBO believes that requiring DOD \nto seek specific authorization from the Congress before paying each \nfine . . . will likely delay the payment of some fines. To the extent \nthe Congress fails to authorize fines in the future, it is possible \nthat the section would make it more difficult for states and local \ngovernments to negotiate for compliance with environmental laws.'' The \nletter is signed by Dan. L. Crippen, Director of the CBO.\n  Plain and simple, if we had passed Section 342 we would have rolled \nback environmental and public health protections for thousands of \nAmericans who live near DOD facilities and for generations who will \nface the costs of cleanup. Our state attorneys--the people in the field \nenforcing our laws--our governors and our state environmental \ncommissioners--and even the likely Republican nominee for President are \ntelling us it is a mistake to do so.\n  Mr. President, the principle is not just rhetoric--it is supported by \nthe record. In 1993, compliance by federal facilities with the \nResources Conservation and Restoration Act was 55.4 percent. Almost \nhalf of all federal facilities operated out of compliance. Why? Because \nthe law was unclear as to whether or not environmental fines could be \nassessed against federal facilities. But with the passage of the \nFederal Facilities Compliance Act in 1992--when DOD and other federal \nfacilities faced fines and penalties for the first time--compliance \nstarted to climb. By 1998, compliance at federal facilities had reached \n88.2 percent. And the opposite has also proven true. Federal compliance \nunder the Clean Water Act, which does not have a clear waiver, has \ndropped at federal facilities. In 1993, more than 94 percent of federal \nfacilities were in compliance, and by 1998 that number had dropped to \njust 61.5 percent. According to enforcement officials at EPA and state \ngovernment, that decline coincided with court decisions that \ninterpreted the Clean Water Act as having only a limited waiver of \nsovereign immunity. To reverse that trend, I understand that Senator \nCoverdell has introduced legislation to waive sovereign immunity for \nfederal facilities. That Republican-led initiative now has now been \ncosponsored by Senators Breaux, Chafee, DeWine, Grams, and Voinovich.\n  Some argued that last year's provision wouldn't impact enforcement \nbecause, like Section 342, Congress can authorize the fine. But the \nnumbers don't bear out that prediction. Why? Because investigators and \nattorneys knew full well that DOD was about to get a ``Get Out Of Jail \nFree Card'' from Congress. Even the best legal work can be overturned \nif Congress simply decides not to act on an authorization. As a result, \nenforcement actions have dropped off. As with any law, without strong \nenforcement, compliance will fall.\n  The principle is simple, Mr. President. If you want people, \ncompanies, institutions, and the government to comply with the law you \nmust be tough on crime--including environmental crime. The way to \nensure that all facilities comply with the law is to make sure that \npollution does not pay. If the threat of a large fine is on the \nhorizon--if the laws have teeth--everyone will be far more inclined to \ncomply.\n  Mr. President, I want to focus some on the issue of ``economic \nbenefit'' and ``size-of-business'' criteria and what it means to limit \nthe federal and state authority to impose a fine based on those \ncriteria. There seems to be some confusion as to why a federal or state \nauthority would seek a penalty based on economic benefits at a DOD \nfacility. The Report language accompanying Section 342 notes that the \nDOD, in the Committee's view, has no economic competitors in regard to \nthe Clean Air Act. Therefore, the principle of economic benefit or \nsize-of-business should not apply. Mr. President, I believe that is an \nincorrect reading of the Clean Air Act and other relevant statutes.\n  Foremost, an economic benefit provision prevents a facility, whether \nit's private or federal, from benefitting financially from \nnoncompliance. Federal and state authorities need the power to make \nnoncompliance economically unviable. We cannot have a system that \nrewards people for breaking the law. The Report language accompanying \nSection 342 argues that economic benefit is tied to ``competition'' \namong businesses and intended to prevent economic advantage through \nnoncompliance. That is a narrow, misreading of the Clean Air Act. For \nexample, all across the country, electric utilities--including \nmunicipal facilities--operate without ``competitors'' as the report \ndefines the term. Utilities are guaranteed a market in return for \nproviding a set amount of power. This is changing with competition, but \nmany did and some still do operate as sanctioned monopolies. But they \nare not exempt from fines and penalties in the Clean Air Act. Further, \nEPA and the states assess ``economic benefit'' fines against hospitals, \nuniversities, and local and state governments. For example, in a Clean \nWater Act challenge, the United States versus City of San Diego in \n1991, a federal court found that the ``plaintiffs' analysis of economic \nbenefit is valid as to municipalities. While it is difficult to \nquantify precisely the savings realized by the City as a result of its \nintransigence, plaintiffs have demonstrated by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the city has saved in excess of $300 million over \napproximately the last thirty years by failing to invest in capital \nimprovements.'' The case shows that economic benefits apply to \nnonbusiness entities--the City of San Diego and that economic benefit \nis based on ``savings'' from noncompliance.\n  Mr. President, ``economic benefit'' and ``size-of-business'' criteria \nare as applicable to DOD as they are to private companies, non-profits, \nstates, and other federal agencies. We should not rollback protections \nand create a situation in which a manager within the DOD could \nrationalize noncompliance because it saves money--we must demand \ncompliance from federal facilities.\n\n  Further, Mr. President, the use of these criteria to enforce the law \nhas been endorsed by the states. The Attorneys Generals, the Governors \nand the Conference of Legislatures specifically addressed this issue in \ntheir letter opposing Section 342. They write that, ``The economic \nbenefit analysis, in particular, is important to states because it \nprevents DOD from considering a fine merely as a cost of doing business \n. . .'' The Environmental Council of the States, which represents our \nstate environmental commissioners, writes, ``Section 342 would have \nseverely restricted the ability of states to ensure that facilities do \nnot realize financial gain through noncompliance. Typically, states \ninclude in their penalties an amount that offsets these financial \nbenefits. In this way, they significantly reduce economic incentives to \navoid environmental and public health requirements.'' A cursory review \nof state policy conducted by the Governors, Attorneys General and the \nState Commissioners at my request, found that most states use economic \nbenefits, including Texas, Montana, South Carolina, Minnesota, \nColorado, Indiana, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Alaska, Connecticut, \nand California.\n  The Armed Services Committee Report with S. 2549 states that ``[i]t \nis the committee's view that the application of the economic benefit or \nsize of business penalty assessment criteria to the DOD is inconsistent \nwith the statutory language and the legislative history under the \n[Clean Air Act.]'' Again, I\n\n[[Page S6542]]\n\ndisagree and suggest that is narrow and incorrect reading of the Act. I \nbelieve a plain reading of the Clean Air Act makes it clear that all \nfines and sanctions apply to DOD. Section 118(a) of the Act reads as \nfollows: ``Each department, agency, and instrumentality of executive, \nlegislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government . . . \nshall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, \nand local requirements, administrative authority, and process and \nsanctions respecting the control and abatement of air pollution in the \nsame manner, and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity. The \npreceding sentence shall apply (A) to any requirement whether \nsubstantive or procedural (including any record keeping or reporting \nrequirement, any requirement respecting permits and any other \nrequirement whatsoever), (B) to any requirement to pay a fee or charge \nimposed by any State or local agency to defray the costs of its air \npollution regulatory program, (C) to the exercise of any Federal, \nState, or local administrative authority, and (D) to any process and \nsanction, whether enforced in Federal, State, or local courts, or in \nany other manner.'' In addition, the managers report for the 1990 \namendments regarding Section 118(a) reads that, ``the new language is \nintended to refute the argument [DOD is not subject to fee \nrequirements] and to affirm the obligation of federal agencies to \ncomply with all requirements, including such fees or charges.'' I add \nthat Section 118(b) of the Clean Air Act is titled ``Exemptions'' and \nit specifically delineates under what circumstances the DOD can be \nexempted from enforcement action--and it makes no reference to the size \nof a fine or the criteria set forth in the penalty section. The Clean \nAir Act is very clear on this point.\n  Mr. President, Section 342 reached beyond the Clean Air Act. It also \napplies to the Resources Conservation and Restoration Act, Toxic \nSubstances Control Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. I believe that \na plain reading of RCRA and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act makes \nclear that DOD should be treated the same as private facilities. There \nis no ambiguity in the law or the legislative history. In the floor \ndebate Senator Mitchell said, ``A waiver of sovereign immunity moves us \nfrom the disorder of Federal noncompliance to a forum in which all \nentities are subject to the same law and to full enforcement action.'' \nAt the bill signing Bush said, ``The objective of the bill is to bring \nall Federal facilities into compliance with applicable Federal and \nState hazardous waste laws, to waive Federal Sovereign immunity under \nthose laws, and to allow the imposition of fines and penalties.'' \nSection 102 of RCRA reads, ``The Federal, State, interstate, and local \nsubstantive and procedural requirements referred to in this subsection \ninclude, but are not limited to, all administrative orders and all \ncivil and administrative penalties and fines, regardless of whether \nsuch penalties or fines are punitive or coercive in nature or are \nimposed for isolated, intermittent, or continuing violations.'' In \nregard to EPA actions against DOD, the Act reads that, ``The \nAdministrator may commence an administrative enforcement action against \nany department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, \nlegislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government pursuant to \nthe enforcement authorities contained in this Act. The Administrator \nshall initiate an administrative enforcement action against such a \ndepartment, agency, or instrumentality in the same manner and under the \nsame circumstances as an action would be initiated against another \nperson.'' Mr. President, I believe the law is clear. The Report \nlanguage with S. 2549 offers us an inaccurate reading of the Clean Air \nAct and fails to address other environmental law statutes it impacts.\n  Some have suggested that Section 342 would have almost no impact on \nenforcement because few cases exceed $1.5 million. As a result, we will \nrarely--if ever--need a congressional authorization to impose a fine. \nThat's simply wrong. Section 342 reads that congressional authorization \nis needed if the fine exceeds $1.5 million or if it is based on \n``economic benefit'' or ``size of business'' criteria. In theory, Mr. \nPresident, all fines originating with the Environmental Protection \nAgency would have been caught by Section 342, regardless of their size. \nIt is EPA's policy and that of many states that all fines should \nincorporate the economic benefit gained from noncompliance. It is \ndifficult to know how many fines will need to pass through the new \nprocess created by Section 342 and how many will not be authorized or \nauthorized at a lower amount. But, we do know that it could be a fine \nof any size, no matter how small.\n  Moreover, the threat of a large fine will be gone if Section 342 \npassed. This alone will deter compliance. The Congressional Budget \nOffice specifically noted in its letter from last year that, ``the \nStates, local governments, and federal agencies often use the threat of \ntheses fines as part of the negotiation with facilities to achieve \ncompliance with environmental laws.'' The Attorneys General--the people \nin the field doing the work--write of Section 342 that, ``The threat of \na significant fine or penalty is one of the more effective ways state \nofficials have for encouraging violators, including military \ninstallations, to take responsibility for the environmental \nconsequences of their operations.'' Any prosecutor, whether they are \ninvolved in a criminal action, or civil environmental compliance, will \ntell you that the threat of long jail term or a large fine is critical \nto enforcing the law. Finally and most importantly, Mr. President, by \ngiving the largest violators, those fined over $1.5 million, a chance \nfor congressional reprieve, Section 342 created a perverse system where \nonly the most egregious violators get a special legal loophole \nunavailable to less egregious violators. It is a bad precedent.\n  Mr. President, the compromise we have reached does not resolve all of \nmy concerns, but it addresses many of them. Under the agreement reached \ntonight, offered by Senator Stevens and passed, all fines of $1.5 \nmillion or more, assessed against DOD by a federal agency for \nenvironmental noncompliance, over the next three years, must be \napproved by Congress. State enforcement actions are not impacted by \nthis agreement and our state Attorneys General can continue to enforce \nthe law as they now do. The concepts of economic benefits and size of \nbusiness remain in place in our environmental enforcement at the state \nand federal level. Only fines equal to or in excess of $1.5 million \nwill require a congressional authorization and that result in only a \nsmall percentage of fines needing authorization. And it expires in \nthree years. I do have some concerns with the agreement. By requiring a \ncongressional authorization on fines of $1.5 million or more, we \nprovide the most egregious violators a congressional reprieve and, \ntherefore, it will limit our ability to deter noncompliance because the \nthreat of a large fine will be reduced. However, I want to note and \nrecognize the concerns Senator Stevens has raised. Enforcement power, \nwhether it sits with the EPA or the states, can be abused. The \nagreement expires in three years. In that time, Congress will have a \nclose look at EPA's actions in assessing large fines.\n  Again, I want to thank Senators Stevens, Baucus and Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nKerry's effort to make sure the Federal government plays by the same \nenvironmental rules that the private sector lives by. The Defense \nDepartment, in carrying out its military mission operates a vast, \nsprawling industrial complex with a potentially huge impact on the \nenvironment.\n  I think I'm only stating the obvious when I say it's absolutely \ncrucial to make sure that the Defense Department and all federal \nagencies are held to the same environmental standards that apply to the \nprivate sector.\n  Under most current environmental laws, that's already the case. \nFederal facilities, including military installations, are subject to \ncivil penalties for violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct, certain provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. Congress specifically \nrecognized the importance of these penalties when it passed the Federal \nFacility Compliance Act of 1992.\n  During the past several months I've received letters on this issue \nfrom environmental and state organizations, as\n\n[[Page S6543]]\n\nwell as the Statement of the Administration's strong opposition to this \nprovision. I ask unanimous consent that copies of these letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 6, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of millions of our members \n     nationwide, we urge you to support the Kerry amendment to \n     strip an extremely damaging legislative provision included in \n     the National Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2001 \n     (sec. 342 of S. 2549). This provision would make a permanent \n     change in the law that could delay and even block DOD from \n     having to pay civil penalties for environmental violations \n     occurring at DOD facilities. We strongly urge you to support \n     this effort to remove it from the authorization bill this \n     year.\n       Section 342 of the authorization bill would require \n     specific congressional authorization for the payment of \n     environmental fines and penalties that exceed $1.5 million, \n     or those that are based on the application of economic \n     benefit or size-of-business criteria. This provision also \n     would block the use of funds to implement supplemental \n     environmental projects that may be required as part of, or in \n     lieu of, a proposed civil penalty. Section 342 would negate \n     the current law that requires that the DOD pay fines and \n     penalties assessed by state and federal regulatory agencies \n     for violations of environmental laws just like every other \n     federal agency or private party that violates the law. This \n     provision has far-reaching ramifications and yet has not had \n     the benefit of any public hearings to allow the Congress to \n     examine the full impacts of the action.\n       This provision was added specifically in response to a \n     large environmental fine proposed by the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. At Fort \n     Wainwright, the Army operates the largest coal burning power \n     plant owned by the U.S. military. According to EPA documents, \n     violations at this facility appear to be more extensive than \n     any found to date in private coal-fired power plants. The \n     Fort Wainwright facility clearly should pay state and federal \n     penalties for at least 11 years of continual and serious \n     violations of clean air standards (which may have even given \n     rise to at least one criminal investigation by the Army). The \n     Kerry amendment would also require a General Accounting \n     Office report to Congress on the circumstances surrounding \n     the Fort Wainwright facility.\n       Section 342 would undermine years of progress at federal, \n     state and local levels towards improved environmental \n     compliance by federal agencies. Congress has repeatedly \n     declared that both state and federal environmental regulators \n     should have the clear authority to enforce most environmental \n     laws at federal facilities, including Defense Department \n     installations. For example, in 1992 Congress enacted the \n     Federal Facilities Compliance Act, clarifying regulatory \n     agencies' authority to enforce laws governing the treatment, \n     storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous wastes. In \n     signing that law, President Bush noted that it represented a \n     step towards fulfilling his promise to the American people \n     that ``the Federal Government live up to the same \n     environmental standards that apply to private citizens.'' \n     Implementation of Section 342 could severely undermine this \n     trend towards better compliance and likely will result in \n     increased violations.\n       This provision could create a perverse incentive for the \n     military to incur large fines so that it can seek respite \n     from Congress. Additionally, without the threat of economic \n     benefit fines, DOD would have less incentive to comply with \n     state and federal environmental laws and be more likely to \n     divert resources that should be spent on environmental \n     compliance to other military projects. Military facilities \n     will be above the law--eroding public confidence in \n     government. Dan L. Crippen, the Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO), found that since 1994 \n     the DOD has paid over $14 million in fines--most of which \n     have been paid to state and local governments. The CBO \n     also found that this program ``will likely delay payment \n     of some fines'' and could ``make it more difficult for \n     state and local governments to negotiate for compliance \n     with environmental laws.''\n       This provisions impairs a valuable tool that states have \n     used to improve environmental protection and derails the \n     current trend toward federal facility accountability. \n     Creating a special exemption for DOD from penalties for \n     environmental violations sends the message that this federal \n     agency can ignore and discount the laws by which everyone \n     else must abide. Because of the serious ramifications for \n     federal accountability and protection of the environment and \n     public health, we strongly urge you to oppose Section 342 of \n     the FY 2001 National Defense Authorization bill and support \n     the Kerry amendment to strike it.\n           Sincerely,\n         Robert Dewey, Vice President of Government Relations and \n           External Affairs, Defenders of Wildlife; Courtney Cuff, \n           Legislative Director, Friends of the Earth; Faith \n           Weiss, Legislative Counsel, Natural Resources Defense \n           Council; James K.

Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Byrd: We, the undersigned, \n     are writing in opposition to a proposal we understand might \n     be offered for inclusion in the FY 2001 Defense \n     Appropriations bill and which would require Congressional \n     approval for payment of large environmental penalties issued \n     against the Department of Defense. This proposal would be \n     similar to the language in the FY 2001 defense authorization \n     bill. Section 342 of Subtitle E. This provision would, if \n     enacted, limit the waiver of sovereign immunity enacted by \n     Congress in the 1992 Federal Facilities Compliance Act and \n     the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments, among other laws \n     and continues an unfortunate policy created in last year's \n     Appropriations law.\n       The language proposed would prohibit payment of large fines \n     or penalties for violations of environmental laws at military \n     installations from funds appropriated in the bill unless \n     authorized by Congress. Such a proposal has the unfortunate \n     effect of interjecting the legislature into what should be an \n     independent system of law enforcement operated by the states \n     and other environmental regulators. This approach to \n     environmental regulation undermines the ability of states to \n     use the threat of penalties as a means of forcing federal \n     facilities to take responsibility for the environmental \n     consequences of their operations.\n       The fact that this language applies only to large penalties \n     is of little comfort. The federal government is the nation's \n     largest polluter and military installations are a major \n     contributor to that pollution. The threat of significant \n     penalties can only be an effective deterrent to environmental \n     violations where the penalty may be potentially proportional \n     to the cost of compliance. A requirement for Congressional \n     approval of penalties of a certain size unduly limits the \n     ability of states to use this threat to effectively regulate \n     the Department of Defense.\n       Congress recognized the importance of penalties in 1992 \n     when it enacted the Federal Facilities Compliance Act \n     clarifying the waiver of sovereign immunity in the Resource \n     Conservation and Recovery Act. With the aid of the Federal \n     Facilities Compliance Act and vigilance by states and other \n     environmental regulators, we are finally making progress \n     toward changing the attitude toward environmental compliance \n     at federal facilities. We urge you to oppose any proposal \n     that weakens the ability of states to continue to assess \n     fines and penalties in whatever levels are determined by the \n     states as necessary to ensure compliance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christine Gregorie,\n       Attorney General of Washington, President, NAAG.\n     Ken Salazar,\n       Attorney General of Colorado, Co-Chair, NAAG Environmental \n     Committee.\n     Governor Kenny C. Guinn,\n       State of Nevada, NGA Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n     Senator Beverly Gard,\n       Indiana State Senate, Chair, NCSL Environment Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2000.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n    S. 2549--National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001\n\n       The Administration supports prompt congressional action on \n     the national defense authorization bill for FY 2001 and \n     appreciates\n\n[[Page S6544]]\n\n     the Armed Services Committee's support for many of the \n     President's national defense priorities. S. 2549, however, \n     raises serious budget, policy, and constitutional concerns as \n     outlined below in the SAP and in the attachment.\n\n\n                        Environmental Provisions\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes section 342, which \n     would require DOD to obtain specific authorization to comply \n     with environmental fines and penalties assessed against the \n     Department. The Administration is opposed to any limitation \n     on the ability of DOD to pay fines or penalties it is liable \n     for under law. This provision could erode public confidence \n     in the commitment of DOD to comply with environmental laws. \n     The Administration also believes that all Federal agencies \n     should be held fully accountable for environmental violations \n     and should be held to the same standards as the private \n     sector.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, these letters are opposed to \nauthorization or appropriation language that limits the importance of \npenalties in deterring environmental violations.\n  In fact, the letter signed by twenty-one environmental groups states \n``Creating a special exemption for DoD from penalties for environmental \nviolations sends the message that this federal agency can ignore and \ndiscount the laws by which everyone else must abide.''\n  My final point is that every time the Senate Environmental and Public \nWorks Committee has raised this topic in hearings, the Committee has \nleaned toward expanding the role of fines and penalties in enforcing \nenvironmental laws at federal facilities. They did that so federal, \nstate, and local governments would have all the tools they need to make \nsure all federal facilities comply with health and environmental laws.\n  Finally, as the Administration pointed out, ``all federal agencies \nshould be held fully accountable for environmental violations and \nshould be held to the same standards as the private sector.''\n  That is precisely what the Kerry amendment would do and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3815) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3794\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the China trade measure which passed the \nHouse eliminates the annual congressional renewal of most-favored-\nnation treatment of China, and gives China permanent normal trade \nrelations with the United States. This legislation has not yet been \nscheduled for action on the Senate floor, yet there is already a \nconcerted effort to defeat any amendments by Senators which might \ndeviate from the provisions of the bill as passed by the House. The \nfear is that a different Senate version would require a conference \ncommittee, and another House vote, both of which may make it more \nuncertain that the legislation will be enacted this session.\n  Given this situation, which is an obvious egregious deviation from \nthe traditional role of the Senate in foreign affairs, those of us who \nbelieve that the House bill can be improved must find a way to pass \nseparate legislation which still addresses matters of importance in the \nburgeoning U.S.-Chinese trade relationship. There is one particular \narea, in which I believe the House bill and the amendments passed to \nit, are silent, and cry out for some adequate treatment, and that is in \nthe area of national security. The administration argued in getting \nenough votes for its China trade bill in the House, that it is in the \nnational security interest of the United States to pass the bill. I do \nnot believe that for one moment. That is quite an assertion given the \nbrutal Communist dictatorship in China, which systematically violates \nthe agreements it has signed with us, and which routinely pressures \nU.S. firms to hand over key technologies as the price for doing \nbusiness in China. This is the same Chinese dictatorship which talks \nabout financial war with the United States, and which periodically \nintimidates Taiwan with threats of invasion. This is the same Chinese \ndictatorship which hunts down dissenters, hunts down free expression, \nand religious organizations with a club.\n  Despite this assertion, there is no mechanism to thoroughly and \nregularly assess the national security impacts on, and implications of, \nthe developing trading relationship with China. The huge trade and \ndollar surpluses that are amassed by the Chinese Government and the \ntensions between the United States and China on trade and national \nsecurity issues, as well as on human and labor rights, need informed \nand periodic review. There are those who argue that our annual debate \nover renewal of most-favored-nation treatment of China did not amount \nto much because we never failed to renew MFN. However, annual MFN \nreview was of great importance to the Chinese Government, since it \ncertainly provided a regular open window to expose questionable Chinese \ntrading, human rights, military, and other policies to a wide audience.\n  Such monitoring and regular reporting to Congress from a reliable \nsource is particularly important in an era where massive and unbalanced \ntrade flows are certain to continue, and where, because of China's \nmembership in the WTO, U.S. bilateral leverage and congressional \nauthority under the commerce clause have been severely reduced. I would \ncontend that the U.S.-Chinese relationship is likely to be of enduring \nconcern to this body. Surely, the national security implications of \nthat relationship, the impacts of massive trade deficits which now \napproach some $70 billion a year, the voracious appetite of the Chinese \nGovernment for military technologies, and the pressures it brings on \nour Asian allies are important to us. The implications of systematic \nunfair trade practices by the Chinese Government, of dumping into our \nmarkets, of not enforcing and not complying with agreements they have \nsigned with us, and of pressuring Western companies to hand over \nimportant technologies as a price for doing business in China and as a \nquid pro quo for being able to relocate and invest in China, should be \nof concern to the elected representatives of the American people.\n\n  The chief Chinese imports from the United States are primarily \nsophisticated manufactured products, like aircraft, telecommunications \nequipment, and semiconductors. Many of these technologies have multiple \nuses, both civilian and military. China's development effort is heavily \ndependent on Western companies as sources of capital and technology. \nThere are some who contend that the large surpluses, as well as the \ncapital, and many technologies are being funneled to a concerted effort \nto fuel a military buildup which the Chinese could not otherwise \nmuster. There are those who contend that we are unwittingly giving the \nChinese the tools to intimidate Taiwan, our democratic friend, and our \nother Asian allies, such as Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and the \nPhilippines.\n  Chinese military officers have recently written about the need to \npractice financial war, cyber war, and other economic and \ntechnologically sophisticated means of affecting the security \nrelationship with the United States. Given the technological prowess of \nthe United States in prosecuting the Gulf War and the Kosovo conflict, \nthe Chinese have been reportedly alarmed regarding the obsolescence of \ntheir military machine and their military practices. The standing \narmies, upon which they have traditionally relied, cannot perform \neffectively against the new weaponry demonstrated by the United States \nin those conflicts. There are those in China who believe that their \nlong-term interests lie in competition and possibly confrontation with \nthe United States, and thus in order to compete they must rapidly \nacquire a range of technologies and expertise that is only available \nfrom Western firms. Are we unwittingly supplying those factions in \nChina with the means to confront us? Certainly our own self-interest \nwould dictate that we need to monitor these trends systematically and \nperiodically and that is the purpose of the Byrd-Warner amendment.\n  I think that it is only prudent that we provide for an annual \nsystematic review and a report to the Congress on the full range of \nnational security implications engendered by the increased\n\n[[Page S6545]]\n\ntrade and investment relationship with China. The House has a \ncommission in its China trade bill, an executive-legislative commission \nto monitor a staggering range of human rights and democracy-building \nreforms in China. It has a full plate of responsibilities. While this \nsort of monitoring is certainly important, no less important should be \nthe existence of a congressional commission to focus on the national \nsecurity relationship between our two nations. The President has argued \nthat it is in our national security interest to further open and widen \nour trading relations with China. That proposition should be regularly \ntested by an independent commission, which has the narrow mandate of \nmonitoring our growing bilateral relationship with an eye toward United \nStates security concerns.\n  The Congress last year created a 12-person commission, equally \ndivided between Republicans and Democrats, to examine our growing \nnegative trade balance. The Trade Deficit Review Commission will likely \nfinish its work in a few months, with a report to the Congress and the \nPresident, on the implications of our global deficits, recommending new \npractices, institutions and policies. It has already conducted hearings \nand studies on the Chinese relationship. Mr. Warner and I suggest that \nthis same commission is an appropriate tool, extended and refocused, to \nconduct an annual Chinese assessment and review. Such a refocused \ncommission would serve as a good companion to the one proposed by the \nHouse bill on human rights and democratic reforms in China. Its \nexistence and assessments would certainly help to repair the dangerous \nerosion of congressional involvement in, and leverage over, foreign \ncommerce envisioned as essential to our national well being by the \nframers. It would help to replace congressional monitoring of China \nresulting from her accession to the World Trade Organization, in an \narea critical to the deeply rooted constitutional responsibilities of \nthis body.\n\n  That is the purpose of the amendment which Senator Warner and I and \nother Senators have offered. In summary, the commission would review \nthe national security implications of our trade and investment \nrelations with China, including the following elements:\n  One, the portion of trade in goods and services dedicated by the \nChinese Government to military systems;\n  Two, an analysis of the statements and writings of Chinese officials \nbearing on the intentions of the Chinese Government regarding military \ncompetition with and leverage over the United States and its Asian \nallies;\n  Three, the military actions taken by the Chinese Government over the \npreceding years bearing on the national security of the United States \nand its Asian allies;\n  Four, the acquisition by the Chinese Government of advanced military \ntechnologies and systems through U.S. trade and Chinese procurement \npolicies;\n  Five, the use of financial transactions, capital flows, and currency \nmanipulations to affect the national security of the United States;\n  Six, actions taken by the Chinese Government in the context of the \nWTO which are adverse to U.S. national security interests;\n  Seven, an overall assessment of the state of any security challenges \nto the U.S. by the Chinese Government and whether the trend from \nprevious years is increasing or declining; and finally, the commission \nwould also provide recommendations for action, including any use of the \nnational defense waiver provision that already exists in the GATT \nTreaty, and applies to the WTO. This article, article 21 of the GATT, \nhas never been used by any nation state, but remains available to be \ntriggered if the Congress finds some aspect of our growing relationship \nwith China on the trade account which adversely affects our national \nsecurity and needs to be stopped or somehow moderated.\n  In addition to these matters, there is also growing concern over the \nactivities of China in transferring missile technologies to other \nnations, affecting the security of the United States and, also, our \nAsian allies. The proliferation of such technologies to Pakistan is the \nsubject of ongoing discussions between the United States and the \nGovernment of China. Unfortunately, the Chinese have given no sign that \nthey intend to halt their highly dangerous trade in missile \ntechnologies and components.\n  Many Senators have expressed their concern over this practice, \nincluding the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, and \nthe distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli. It is my \nintention, and my expectation, and it is the intention of my very close \nand dear colleague, Senator Warner--it is our intention and expectation \nthat the U.S.-China Security Review Commission will investigate, report \nand make recommendations on Chinese trade in missile components, which \naffects our long-term security and that of our Asian allies. In this \namendment by Mr. Warner and myself, both paragraphs (E), dealing with \nmilitary actions taken by the Chinese Government, and (J), requiring an \noverall assessment of the state of the security challenges presented by \nChina to the United States provide ample mandate to the commission to \nconduct such investigations on a regular basis.\n  I will be happy to yield the floor to my colleague, Mr. Warner.\n  I cannot yield the floor to another Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am, indeed, very honored to be a \nprincipal cosponsor with my friend and fellow member of the Armed \nServices Committee on this piece of legislation. This is a very \nimportant step. China should not perceive this as a threat. China \nshould not perceive this in any other way than a positive step by the \nCongress to establish or keep in place this ongoing commission for the \npurpose of advising the Congress from time to time.\n  We do not have as individual Members--of course, our committees \nperform oversight, but we do not have an opportunity, on a daily or \nweekly basis, to monitor the various criteria as set forth in the Byrd-\nWarner legislation. This commission will, again, be established by the \nCongress with six Members appointed by the Senate and six Members \nappointed by the House in a bipartisan manner, and it will be the \nwatchdog to inform us from time to time.\n  China in this millennium will compete with the United States, the \nworld's only superpower, on a broad range of fronts--not just foreign \naffairs, not just national security, not just trade and economics, but \nin areas which we cannot even envision tonight, as this new millennium \nunfolds and this cyberspace in which we are all involved engulfs us day \nafter day. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia pointed out \nsome representations by certain individuals in China about their desire \nto get more involved in cyberspace for national security reasons. That \nis one of the important functions of this commission.\n  I am very pleased to join with him because China will be the \ncompetitor. The Senate and the House--the Congress collectively--needs \nits own resource, and I underline that. I commend my distinguished \ncolleague and friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Otherwise, the Congress is at the mercy of an \nadministration--the administration--for information.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. In this case, this commission will report to the Congress, \nso we do not have to depend upon information from the Executive; we \nhave our own.\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course, Mr. President, from time to time, committees \nof this body--indeed, the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee \non Armed Services, the Governmental Affairs Committee--take active \nroles, but they do not do it every single day as this commission will \nmonitor, together with the chairman and members and the staff.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. I \ndo so because the commission created by this legislation is, in my \nview, flawed. That is why I tried to work with my good friend from West \nVirginia to address the concerns that I am raising. Unfortunately, we \nwere unable to come to an\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\nagreement. For the following reasons, I must oppose this amendment and \nI urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  First, let me say that if my colleague's intent is to establish a \ncommission to provide sound advice to Congress regarding our broader \nrelationship with China and its effect on our national security, then \nthere are ways to create a meaningful mechanism for doing just that. \nOne, for example, would have been to build the Senator's concerns into \nthe quadrennial defense review required under previous versions of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. By giving the responsibility to a \nstanding body like the National Defense Panel that already conducts the \nquadrennial defense review, we would have saved the taxpayers' money, \nwhile getting the benefit of the unchallenged expertise of many of the \nforemost authorities on our national security and on military matters. \nAnd, we would have put the report in Congress' hands by next spring.\n  Instead, my colleague has adopted an approach I have not seen in my \nyears in the Senate. He wants to take the commissioners, staff and \nclerical personnel of a commission constructed for very different \npurposes and employ it to look at our security relationship with China. \nThat commission--the Trade Deficit Review Commission--is staffed with \ncommissioners and staff appointed due to their expertise in economic \npolicy. Frankly, this is simply the wrong group to undertake a serious \nreview of the impact on our national security of our relationship with \nChina. And, there is absolutely no benefit in terms of accelerating the \nprogress toward a final report when compared to giving the \nresponsibility to the National Defense Panel.\n  I must say that I do not understand my friend's interest in \nperpetuating the life of the Trade Deficit Review Commission for this \ntask. The Trade Deficit Review Commission is already overdue in \nproviding us its report on the trade deficit. My expectation when we \ncreated that commission was that we would have had its work product by \nnow. Instead, my colleague recently supported a three-month extension \nso the Trade Deficit Review Commission could complete its now amply-\ndelayed report. In my view, we should let the Trade Deficit Commission \ncomplete its existing work, rather than burdening it with new \nresponsibilities, even if only administrative in nature, before it has \ncompleted its primary task.\n  Second, I am concerned that the way the issues as stated in my \nfriend's bill could be read to imply that the United States already \nconsiders China an enemy and a threat to our national security. China \nclearly is an emerging force in the international arena. In many ways, \nChina's emergence could be beneficial to the United States. There are, \nnonetheless, concerns, which I share, regarding the PRC's behavior on \nsecurity-related matters. Those issues bear careful scrutiny.\n  Having said that, it should also be clear that the shape and \ndirection of the relationship between our countries is evolving and \nremains to be shaped. What that suggests is the need for a thoughtful, \ncomprehensive and, most importantly, balanced review of the security \nimplications of our bilateral relationship with China. That is, in \nfact, what I suggested to my colleague we should do.\n  Third, I offered my friend my thoughts on the technical changes \nneeded to make the commission's job clear. I worry, however, that, as \nit stands now, the commission's duties will be extremely difficult for \nany commissioner to decipher. For example, the proposed commission is \nsupposed to examine the ``portion of trade in goods and services that \nthe People's Republic of China dedicates to military systems or systems \nof a dual nature that could be used for military purposes.'' The \nproblem is no country dedicates its trade to military systems. That is \nsimply not a meaningful concept. I am not even sure what a ``system of \na dual nature'' is? It is, furthermore, literally impossible for a \ncountry to dedicate a portion of a trade surplus to its military budget \nbecause a trade surplus is not cash in hand, as the proposal implies.\n  Similarly, the proposal simply misunderstands the nature of the World \nTrade Organization and particularly Article XXI if it asks for \nrecommendations as to how China's participation there would harm us or \nwhether Article XXI should be more frequently invoked. What the WTO \nprovides is a forum in which to negotiate the reduction of tariffs and \nother trade barriers. What do we have to fear from China lowering its \ntrade barriers in national security terms? As to Article XXI, that \nprovision is invoked when we do something to China in trade terms, not \nwhen China does something to us.\n  That leads me to my final point. What the statement of the proposed \ncommission's duties makes clear, and what I object to most strongly to, \nis its premise. There are many issues that I could conceive of \naddressing in a serious, comprehensive and balanced review of our \nsecurity relationship with China. Issues related to regional stability \nand weapons proliferation to name just two. But, what this amendment \nsuggests is that our commercial engagement with China somehow threatens \nour national security interests--that in some way, the fact that we buy \ntoys and appliances from the Chinese, and the fact that they buy \nagricultural products and heavy equipment from us endangers the \nAmerican people. That is simply not the case.\n  Nor is there anything about China's upcoming accession to the World \nTrade Organization that makes such a review any more relevant. After \nall, China has committed to open its market to our goods and services \nto gain entry to the WTO. China's accession to the WTO does nothing to \nreduce our security. If anything, it reduces a point of friction in our \nrelationship with China in a way that is only positive.\n  Under the circumstances, I cannot support the creation of a permanent \ncommission with an uncertain mission that would not reach many of the \nfundamental issues that should be addressed in our relationship with \nChina. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment as well.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3759 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S6547]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3759.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 31, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 126. D5 SUBMARINE-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Reduction of Amount for Program.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, the total amount authorized to \n     be appropriated by this Act is reduced by $462,733,000.\n       (b) Prohibition.--None of the remaining funds authorized to \n     be appropriated by this Act after the reduction made by \n     subsection (a) may be used for the procurement of D5 \n     submarine-launched ballistic missiles or components for D5 \n     missiles.\n       (c) Termination of Program.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     terminate production of D5 submarine ballistic missiles under \n     the D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile program after \n     fiscal year 2001.\n       (d) Payment of Termination Costs.--Funds available on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act for obligation \n     for the D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile program may \n     be obligated for production under that program only for \n     payment of the costs associated with the termination of \n     production under this Act.\n       (e) Inapplicability to Missiles in Production.--Subsections \n     (c) and (d) do not apply to missiles in production on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, quite simply, this amendment will \nterminate the future production of the Navy's Trident II missile. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, and the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  I have made it a priority to seek to eliminate unnecessary Government \nspending. To the occasional consternation of some in this Chamber and \nelsewhere, I have come to the floor time and time again to try to scale \nback or terminate costly Federal programs, many of which have outlived \ntheir usefulness.\n  In my view, the Trident II program is just the kind of cold war relic \nthat we can and should eliminate.\n  The Trident II, also called the D-5, is the Navy's submarine-launched \nballistic missile. It was designed specifically to be a first-strike \nstrategic missile that would attack targets inside the Soviet Union \nfrom waters off the continental United States.\n  By halting further production of the Trident II missile, we would \nsave American taxpayers more than $460 million in fiscal year 2001 \nalone, and according to the CBO, we would save $2.6 billion over the \nnext 10 years, from 2001 to 2010.\n  The Navy now has in its arsenal 372 Trident II missiles, and has \nrequested funding this year for an additional 12. The legislation \ncurrently before this body includes more than $430 million for those \nadditional 12 missiles.\n  It also authorizes an additional $28.8 million for advanced \nprocurement for still more Trident II missiles that the Navy hopes to \npurchase in future years.\n  Let me be clear. My amendment would halt production of additional \nTrident II missiles. It does not in any way prevent the Navy from \noperating or maintaining its current arsenal of 372 Trident II \nmissiles.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about the Trident II, its \npredecessor, the Trident I, and the reasons why I believe this Trident \nII program should be terminated.\n  The Trident II is deployed aboard the Navy's fleet of 18 Ohio-class \nsubmarines. Ten of these subs are equipped with Trident II missiles. \nThe oldest eight subs in the fleet are equipped with the older Trident \nI, or C-4, missile.\n  The Navy is already moving toward downsizing its Trident fleet from \n18 to 14 in order to comply with the provisions of the START II treaty. \nSome observers suggest simply retiring the four oldest Ohio-class \nsubmarines in order to achieve that goal. Others support converting \nthose subs, which carry the older Trident I missle, to carry \nconventional missiles. The CBO estimates that this conversion alone \nwould cost about $3.3 billion over 10 years.\n  That leaves four other submarines that are equipped with the older \nTrident I missiles. The Navy wants to backfit those four subs to carry \nnewer Trident II missiles.\n  The Navy's current goal is to have 14 submarines with 24 Trident II \nmissiles each, for a total of 336 missiles, with a number of additional \nmissiles for testing purposes. The CBO estimates that a total of 425 \nmissiles would be required to fully arm 14 submarines and have \nsufficient missiles also for testing. That would mean the purchase of \nat least 53 more missiles.\n  We already have 372 Trident II missiles--more than enough to fully \narm the 10 existing Trident II submarines and to maintain an inventory \nfor testing. So why do we need 12 more?\n  Why do we need to spend the taxpayers' money on advanced procurement \nto buy even more missiles in future years?\n  And why do we need to backfit the aging remains of the Trident I \nfleet at all? Ten fully-equipped Trident II submarines are more than \ncapable of being an effective deterrent against the moth-balled Russian \nsubmarine fleet and against the ballistic missile aspirations of rogue \nstates, including China and North Korea.\n  And the aging Trident I subs won't outlast the Trident I missiles \nthey currently carry, let alone the additional Trident II missiles the \nNavy wants to build for them to the tune of about $40 million per \nmissile.\n  The CBO has recommended terminating the further production of the \nTrident II missile, which would save $2.6 billion over the next 10 \nyears, and retiring all eight of the Trident I submarines, which would \nsave an additional $2.3 billion over the next 10 years, for a total \nsavings of $4.9 billion.\n  I do recognize that there is still a potential threat from rogue \nstates and from independent operators who seek to acquire ballistic \nmissiles and other weapons of mass destruction. I also recognize that \nour submarine fleet and our arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons still \nhave an important role to pay in warding off these threats. Their role, \nhowever, has diminished dramatically from what it was at the time of \nthe cold war. Our missile procurement decisions should really reflect \nthat change and it should reflect the realities of the post-cold-war \nworld.\n  Our existing inventory of 372 Trident II missiles is far superior to \nany other country on the globe. And each of these missiles contains \neight independently targetable nuclear warheads, for a total of 192 \nwarheads per submarine. The 372 missiles currently in the Navy's \ninventory contain 2,976 warheads. Each warhead packs between 300 to 450 \nkilotons of explosive power.\n  For a comparison--which is really quite striking--the first atomic \nbomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima generated 15 kilotons \nof force. Let's do the math for just one fully-equipped Trident II \nsubmarine.\n  Each warhead can generate up to 450 kilotons of force. Each missile \nhas eight warheads, and each submarine has 24 missiles. That equals \n86.4 megatons of force per submarine. That is the equivalent of 5,760 \nHiroshimas. Let me say that again: the power of 5,760 Hiroshimas on \njust one submarine.\n  The Navy currently has 10 such submarines, and they want to backfit \nanother four with these devastating weapons. It is hard to imagine why \nwe need to procure more of these weapons when those we already have \ncould destroy the Earth many times over.\n  And it is especially hard to comprehend why we need more Trident II \nmissiles when we take into account the fact that the Trident II is only \none of the several types of ballistic missiles the Department of \nDefense has in its arsenal.\n  The world is changing. Earlier this year, the Russian Duma ratified \nthe START II treaty, a move that seemed highly unlikely just 1 year \nago. And Russia has also ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty, something that this body regrettably failed to do last fall.\n  I cannot understand the need for more Trident II missiles at a time \nwhen the Governments of the United States and Russia are in \nnegotiations to implement START II and are also discussing a framework \nfor START III. These agreements call for reductions in our nuclear \narsenal, not increases. To spend scarce resources on building\n\n[[Page S6548]]\n\nmore missiles now is short sighted and could seriously undermine our \nefforts to negotiate further arms reductions with Russia.\n  The debate on the underlying legislation is one about priorities. We \nshould stop spending taxpayer dollars on defense programs that have \nunfortunately survived the cold war and should instead concentrate on \nmilitary readiness and better pay and benefits for our men and women in \nuniform.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this sensible amendment, which has \nbeen endorsed by Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Center for Defense \nInformation, the Peace Action Education Fund, the Union of Concerned \nScientists, the Council for a Liveable World, Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, and the 20/20 Vision Education Fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Feingold \namendment. I happen to believe we need a strong national defense. I \nthink an important ingredient in having a strong national defense is \nthat we have a defense system that is technologically advanced over any \nopposition we may face in the world; that we have a versatile defense \nsystem; and that we have some mobility so we can avoid duplication.\n  A key ingredient of a strong national defense is our submarine \nprogram, which includes the submarine-launched ballistic missile. An \nimportant part of a submarine-launched ballistic missile is the D-5.\n  The Feingold amendment would cut $462.7 million in funds to procure \nthe Trident D-5 missiles and, in effect, would terminate the D-5 \nproduction program. For that reason, I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  The Department of Defense also happens to oppose this amendment. That \nwas not an easy decision. There was a lot of consideration on what \nshould be the proper level of defense and how submarine defenses should \nbe a part of that. The Navy, after a considerable amount of thought, \ndecided they needed to outfit a total of 14 Trident submarines with the \nD-5 missile. This will require a total inventory of 425 Trident \nmissiles. With the fiscal year 2000 budget, the Navy will have 53 \nmissiles left to procure to meet this inventory objective. We have gone \nthrough most of the program. We are not going to have much left, as far \nas funding missiles, after this fiscal year.\n  In 1994, there was a nuclear posture review. This review was done by \nthe Department of Defense and it has been persistently evaluated. The \nconclusion is that the U.S. needs 14 Trident submarines at a minimum to \nbe able to maintain a two-ocean SLBM force that is stabilizing, \noperationally effective, and which enhances deterrence.\n\n  The Department of Defense is planning on maintaining 14 Trident \nsubmarines for the foreseeable future regardless of arms control \ndevelopments. Current plans are to maintain 14 boats under START II as \nwell as under START III. Terminating the D-5 program, after fiscal year \n2000, would mean the Navy would only have enough missiles to outfit 11 \nboats. Over time, as operational flight testing uses up an already \ninadequate missile inventory, you begin to reduce the number of \nsubmarines you would be able to maintain on operational status even \nfurther. We would decidedly have a lack of missiles to meet the goal \nfor a two-ocean SLBM force.\n  The Feingold amendment cuts the entire fiscal year 2001 budget \nrequest for D-5 production. However, even if the Congress wanted to \nterminate the D-5 program following the fiscal year 2001 procurement, \nthe Navy would still need to spend over $330 million in procurement \nfunds to terminate the production program. Hence, the Feingold \namendment would not only prematurely stop production, but it would also \npreclude orderly termination of the program.\n  Way back in January of this year, in a report to Congress, the \nSecretary of Defense stated that the impact of procuring less than 425 \nof the D-5 missiles would be very severe. Specifically, the Secretary \nof Defense indicated that such a decision would have adverse impacts on \nthe effectiveness of the U.S. strategic deterrent, severely weaken \nreliability, accuracy, and safety assessments associated with the D-5 \noperational flight test program, and would undermine the strategic \nmissile industrial and production base of the United States at a time \nwhen the D-5 missile is the only strategic missile still in production.\n  The Secretary's report also indicated that termination of the D-5 \nmissile before the planned completion of 425 missiles would result in a \nunilateral reduction of deployed U.S. strategic warheads in both the \nSTART I and the START II regimes and is not consistent with U.S. START \nIII plans.\n  The Navy also looked at retaining older C-4 missiles to fill in the \nlack of the D-5 missiles. It concluded that this would be even more \ncostly and inefficient than simply completing the D-5 production run.\n  With only 53 missiles to procure, termination at this point will \nproduce only marginal savings and will have a severe operational impact \non our ability to maintain a stable deterrent force.\n  It is based on these factors that I strongly urge my colleagues to \noppose the amendment by the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to debate \nthis with the Senator from Colorado. I will clear up a couple of \nfactual points before I make a few general statements.\n  First, as I understand it, the question of termination costs will not \nbe a problem that will be absorbed because of this amendment, because \nany unexpended funds can be used for purposes of the termination costs. \nI don't think that is a major objection.\n  Secondly, I believe the Senator suggested this would have some impact \non missiles already in production. That is not the case. That is not \nthe way our amendment is drafted. That is not what it will do.\n  The most important point is that the Senator from Colorado indicates \nthat these missiles are a key ingredient in our national defense. Let's \nassume that is the case. The fact is, we already have 372 of these \nmissiles. I believe the burden is on those asking for this additional \nfunding to show that that is not enough.\n  Assuming it is a key ingredient, do we really need more than 372? Do \nwe really need these additional 53 missiles? As I indicated earlier, we \nhave 2,976 warheads based on our current 372 missiles, and that is the \nequivalent of 25,760 Hiroshimas per submarine. I think the burden is on \nthose wanting to spend this additional money to show that we need a \nstronger deterrent than that.\n  The Senator from Colorado suggested adverse impacts on deterrence if \nwe don't do these additional 12. After 25,760 Hiroshimas per submarine, \nwe need additional deterrence? I didn't hear a single statement from \nthe Senator from Colorado suggesting exactly what the real adverse \nimpacts are of just not doing these additional missiles.\n  I suggest the money is desperately needed not only in general but, \neven within the defense budget, for the people who serve our country, \ntheir pay, their conditions, their housing, readiness, including that \nof the National Guard, for example. In my State, the people in the \nNational Guard desperately need these resources, for example, for \ninventory, for training. They are very strapped. They are now taking a \ngreat deal of responsibility for our standing Army. To me, the \npriorities are wrong. We have more than adequate deterrence with these \n372 missiles.\n  I suggest the case has not been made, as it must be, by those who \nwant to make the expenditure for these additional missiles.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will respond, if I may.\n  The amendment cuts funds which would require termination of the \nprogram, plain and simple. DOD has repeatedly reviewed that very \nquestion.\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\nEach time they have concluded we need 53 additional missiles.\n  Keep in mind, the goal originally was set up that we needed to \nmaintain a submarine force in the Pacific Ocean as well as the Atlantic \nOcean. It was determined that, at a minimum, we had to have 14 \nsubmarines, and we needed to have them adequately armed in order to \nprovide the defenses we need.\n  The Trident submarine is the core of the U.S. strategic deterrent \nforce, and the Trident force is the most survivable leg of our \nstrategic triad.\n  I think it is important we go ahead and complete this program, \nrecognizing that we are towards the end of manufacturing of the \nmissiles.\n  I think it only makes sense that we complete it and maintain a strong \ndefense. I believe a strong defense does serve as a deterrent, and it \nhelps assure world peace. For that reason, I strongly oppose the \namendment of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 3 minutes 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I don't know how much more I will debate \nthis. I want to respond to the point about the study and analysis that \nthe Senator from Colorado appears to rely on most exclusively. That \nanalysis was done prior to the time the Russian Duma approved START II. \nThis is an example. It is not looking at the present relationship we \nhave and our goals with regard to Russia and the future negotiations, \nnot only with regard to what is going on now, but with START III.\n  The whole point is that we have to look at current realities, look at \nwhat we have--372 missiles--and their capacity, and our goals as to \nwhat message we want to send to Russia as we negotiate what is hoped to \nbe a reduction in the nuclear arsenals. I think it is simply not only \nan unwise expenditure, but also an attitude that does not reflect what \nwe are trying to accomplish with regard to our negotiations with \nRussia.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe I need to respond again. We have \nhad a report as late as January of this year, and it is that we should \nmaintain 14 Trident submarines not only through START I and II, but \nalso START III. So I think this is forward looking. I think it helps us \nassure our goals of a strong defense. It maintains a versatile force \nand keeps us technologically advanced, with the mobility we need. I \nthink it is an essential aspect of our defense, and I think it would be \nfoolhardy for us to cut the funds necessary to fully develop the 425 D-\n5 missiles for the Trident submarine.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I inquire? I was off the floor. Have \nthe yeas and nays been ordered for tomorrow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is ready to be sequenced tomorrow for the purpose of \nvoting?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senators. We are now ready to hear from our \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois, if he is ready.\n  I will ask our colleague from Illinois two questions. One, on the \nassumption that Mr. Levin will soon return to the floor, I ask if we \ncould interrupt for the purpose of clearing some en bloc amendments, \nwhich will enable the staff who otherwise would be here to return to \ntheir offices and use their time productively. We will ask for that at \nthe appropriate time. Has the Senator indicated the amount of time he \nmight seek for purposes of debate?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are three Members on the floor who \nwill be seeking recognition, and we anticipate a maximum of 60 minutes \non this side. I don't know how much is needed on the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. In looking this over, I am inclined \nto think that we can, in the course of the conference, gain some \nsupport. I hope it remains in a factual manner and that the legislative \nhistory you are about to make in terms of your remarks, together with \nyour colleagues, support what is in this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his forbearance \nin scheduling this debate. I don't think any of us had hoped it would \noccur at 8:30 at night, but that is the situation we are in. This is a \nvery important debate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3732\n\n (Purpose: To provide for operationally realistic testing of National \n Missile Defense systems against countermeasures, and to establish an \n                independent panel to review the testing)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, \n     Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3732.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 53, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 243. OPERATIONALLY-REALISTIC TESTING AGAINST \n                   COUNTERMEASURES FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Testing Requirements.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     direct the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization--\n       (1) to include in the ground and flight testing of the \n     National Missile Defense system that is conducted before the \n     system becomes operational any countermeasures (including \n     decoys) that--\n       (A) are likely, or at least realistically possible, to be \n     used against the system; and\n       (B) are chosen for testing on the basis of what \n     countermeasure capabilities a long-range missile could have \n     and is likely to have, taking into consideration the \n     technology that the country deploying the missile would have \n     or could likely acquire; and\n       (2) to determine the extent to which the exoatmospheric \n     kill vehicle and the National Missile Defense system can \n     reliably discriminate between warheads and such \n     countermeasures.\n       (b) Future Funding Requirements.--The Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Organization shall--\n       (1) determine what additional funding, if any, may be \n     necessary for fulfilling the testing requirements set forth \n     in subsection (a) in fiscal years after fiscal year 2001; and\n       (2) submit the determination to the congressional defense \n     committees at the same time that the President submits the \n     budget for fiscal year 2002 to Congress under section 1105(a) \n     of title 31, United States Code.\n       (c) Report by Secretary of Defense.--(1) The Secretary of \n     Defense shall, except as provided in paragraph (4), submit to \n     Congress an annual report on the Department's efforts to \n     establish a program for operationally realistic testing of \n     the National Missile Defense system against countermeasures. \n     The report shall be in both classified and unclassified \n     forms.\n       (2) The report shall include the Secretary's assessment of \n     the following:\n       (A) The countermeasures available to foreign countries with \n     ballistic missiles that the National Missile Defense system \n     could encounter in a launch of such missiles against the \n     United States.\n       (B) The ability of the National Missile Defense system to \n     defeat such countermeasures, including the ability of the \n     system to discriminate between countermeasures and reentry \n     vehicles.\n       (C) The plans to demonstrate the capability of the National \n     Missile Defense system to defeat such countermeasures and the \n     adequacy of the ground and flight testing to demonstrate that \n     capability.\n       (3) The report shall be submitted not later than January 15 \n     of each year. The first report shall be submitted not later \n     than January 15, 2001.\n       (4) No annual report is required under this section after \n     the National Missile Defense system becomes operational.\n       (d) Independent Review Panel.--(1) The Secretary of Defense \n     shall reconvene the Panel on Reducing Risk in Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Flight Test Programs.\n       (2) The Panel shall assess the following:\n       (A) The countermeasures available for use against the \n     United States National Missile Defense system.\n       (B) The operational effectiveness of that system against \n     those countermeasures.\n       (C) The adequacy of the National Missile Defense flight \n     testing program to demonstrate the capability of the system \n     to defeat the countermeasures.\n       (3) After conducting the assessment required under \n     paragraph (2), the Panel shall evaluate--\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\n       (A) whether sufficient ground and flight testing of the \n     system will have been conducted before the system becomes \n     operational to support the making of a determination, with a \n     justifiably high level of confidence, regarding the \n     operational effectiveness of the system;\n       (B) whether adequate ground and flight testing of the \n     system will have been conducted, before the system becomes \n     operational, against the countermeasures that are likely, or \n     at least realistically possible, to be used against the \n     system and that other countries have or likely could acquire; \n     and\n       (C) whether the exoatmospheric kill vehicle and the rest of \n     the National Missile Defense system can reliably discriminate \n     between warheads and such countermeasures.\n       (4) Not later than March 15, 2001, the Panel shall submit a \n     report on its assessments and evaluations to the Secretary of \n     Defense and to Congress. The report shall include any \n     recommendations for improving the flight testing program for \n     the National Missile Defense system or the operational \n     capability of the system to defeat countermeasures that the \n     Panel determines appropriate.\n       (e) Countermeasure Defined.--In this section, the term \n     ``countermeasure''--\n       (1) means any deliberate action taken by a country with \n     long-range ballistic missiles to defeat or otherwise counter \n     a United States National Missile Defense system; and\n       (2) includes, among other actions--\n       (A) use of a submunition released by a ballistic missile \n     soon after the boost phase of the missile;\n       (B) use of anti-simulation, together with such decoys as \n     Mylar balloons, to disguise the signature of the warhead; and\n       (C) use of a shroud cooled with liquid nitrogen to reduce \n     the infrared signature of the warhead.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what we are going to discuss this evening \nis one of the most expensive, and perhaps one of the most important, \nelements in our Nation's national defense. We are going to discuss the \nnational missile defense system.\n  The reason for its importance, I guess, could be summarized in \nseveral ways. First, it is an extraordinary expenditure of money. It is \nanticipated that if we are going to meet our first goal by 2005, we \nwill spend up to $60 billion. That is an exceptional expenditure, even \nby Federal standards, even by the standards of the Department of \nDefense.\n  Second, those who support this system are telling us that our goal is \nto basically protect America from attack by rogue missiles, by those \nenemies of the United States who might launch a missile at us and \nthreaten our cities and population. So the importance of the system we \nare talking about cannot be overstated.\n  Third, we know that if we go forward with this, we run the risk of \ncomplicating our negotiations with other countries in the world--\nparticularly Russia and China--about the reduction in their nuclear \narsenals. So this is high-stakes poker. We are talking about a \ndecision, in terms of our national defense, which may be one of the \nmost important in history.\n  I have a very straightforward amendment that will require that the \nnational missile defense system test realistic countermeasures before \nbecoming operational, and that an independent review panel--the Welch \npanel--assess the testing program in light of these countermeasure \nproblems. The President is slated to decide soon whether to deploy a \nnational missile defense system. This bill we are debating authorizes \nspending almost $5 billion in the next fiscal year for this program.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the contemplated \nnational missile defense total cost at $60 billion, when all components \nare considered. Whether one thinks that deciding to deploy a national \nmissile defense system at this moment is a good idea or not, I hope we \ncan all agree that once that system becomes operational, it should \nwork. If we are going to spend $60 billion, we ought to have a high \nlevel of confidence that it will in fact protect us from rogue states \nfiring a missile. If the fate of America will truly hang in the \nbalance, we owe this Nation and every family and every mother, father, \nand child our very best effort in building a credible, effective \ndeterrence.\n  Such a high level of confidence is not possible until this system is \ntested against likely responses from emerging missile states, known as \ncountermeasures or decoys. If the missile system cannot discriminate \nbetween warheads and decoys, it is, as a practical matter, useless \nbecause enemies will simply be able to overwhelm it with cheap decoys.\n  At this point, I will yield time to my colleagues who have gathered \nhere to be part of this debate. At the end of their statements, I will \nreclaim my time and conclude.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask at this time if I may clear some \namendments and ask unanimous consent that the time consumed by the two \nmanagers not in any way be counted against the time for the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the \ncondition of the classrooms within our military dependent schools. A \nnumber of our classrooms contain asbestos, roofs leak, classes are \novercrowded, three or four teachers have to share the same desk, \nscience labs are 30 plus years old and potentially unsafe, and some \nschools are not in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act.\n  I am ashamed that military families who live on base are forced to \nsend their kids to school facilities in these conditions. I was even \nmore disturbed when I found out the many other\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\nschool districts that teach large numbers of military dependents have \nsimilar infrastructure problems.\n  Amazingly most kids have done well despite this environment but I \nworry about the impact the deteriorating school facilities has on \ndeclining military retention and recruitment. The condition of these \nschools is clearly a quality of life issue for military families.\n  Mr. President, I offer an amendment today to help alleviate these \nproblems and ensure a safe and comfortable learning environment for \nmore than 80,000 children of members of our armed forces.\n  My amendment establishes a grant program within the Department of \nDefense to assist school districts with repair and renovation costs for \nfacilities used to educate large numbers of military kids. The program \nwould enable qualified school districts to apply for grants up to $5 \nmillion every two years to help meet health and safety, class size, \nADA, asbestos removal, and technology requirements.\n  The program would also assist school districts faced with significant \nenrollment increases due to increases in on-base housing or mission \nchanges. Lastly, school districts could seek assistance for repair and \nrenovation costs of Department of Defense owned schools being \ntransferred to a local school district.\n  For example, at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia a DOD owned \nelementary school is being transferred to the local school district but \n$4 million in repairs is needed to bring the school up to the local \ndistrict's safety and fire standards.\n  Why is Department of Defense assistance needed? Most of the school \ndistricts serving large numbers of military children have limited \nbonding ability or no tax base to raise the necessary capital funding.\n  For example, seven public schools districts that serve military \ndependents are located solely on the military installation and in turn \nhave no tax base or bonding authority. The seven schools rely on impact \naid and state funding and almost all repair or renovation expenditures \ncome at the expense of instructional funding.\n  The Department of Education is authorized to provide construction \nfunding for impacted schools but only $10 million is provided for \nhundreds of impacted schools nationwide. An additional $5 million is \navailable for school facilities owned by the Department of Education \nbut the needs of those schools far exceed the available funding.\n  The Department of Education has essentially abdicated its \nresponsibility to ensure a safe and comfortable learning environment at \nfederally impacted schools. We often hear of the need for more federal \ndollars for school construction but who deserves this more than the \nchildren whose parents serve in our armed forces.\n  Schools that teach large numbers of military dependents receive \nsupplemental impact aid assistance through the Department of Defense, \n$30 million in FY 2000 benefitting about 130 schools. However, the \nfunding is not sufficient to meet major repair and renovation costs.\n  A comprehensive program is needed to address this serious quality of \nlife issue. And, without Department of Defense assistance tens of \nthousands of military children will continue to learn in inadequate and \nunsafe facilities.\n  This amendment would benefit the 30 most heavily impacted school \ndistricts that teach military children.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important quality \nof life issue that will benefit more than 80,000 military children.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3762, as modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment to correct an \nabsurdity in our application of important secrecy policies. This issue \nwould be a laughable example of bureaucratic intransigence except that \nit is harming workers who may have gotten sick from working on our \nnuclear weapons.\n  I'm sure that by now all my colleagues are aware that many of our \ncitizens were exposed to radioactive and other hazardous materials at \nnuclear weapons production plants in the United States. While working \nto protect our national security, workers at places like Paducah, \nKentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were subjected to \nsevere hazards, sometimes without their knowledge or consent. We \nrecently passed an amendment to provide compensation to some of those \nwho became seriously ill because of their dangerous work at nuclear \nweapons plants.\n  The dangers at these plants thrived in the darkness of government \nsecrecy. Public oversight was especially weak at a factory for \nassembling and disassembling nuclear weapons at the Iowa Army \nAmmunition Plant in Middletown, Iowa. I first found out about the \nnuclear weapons work there from a constituent letter from a former \nworker, Robert Anderson. He was concerned that his non-Hodgkins \nlymphoma was caused by exposures at the plant. But when I asked the \nDepartment of Energy about the plant, at first they denied that any \nnuclear weapons work took place there. The constituent's story was only \nconfirmed when my staff saw a promotional video from the contractor at \nthe site that mentioned the nuclear weapons work.\n  The nuclear weapons production plants were run not by the Defense \nDepartment but by the Atomic Energy Commission, which has since been \nmade part of the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy has \nsince acknowledged what happened, and is now actively trying to help \nthe current and former workers in Iowa and elsewhere by reviewing \nrecords, helping them get medical testing and care, and seeking \ncompensation. I was pleased this past January to host Energy Secretary \nRichardson at a meeting with former workers and community members near \nthe plant. The Department specifically acknowledges that the Iowa Army \nAmmunition Plant assembled and disassembled nuclear weapons from 1947-\n1975. And their work has helped uncover potential health concerns at \nthe plant, such as explosions around depleted uranium that created \nclouds of radioactive dust, and workers' exposure to high explosives \nthat literally turned their skin yellow.\n  But at the Iowa nuclear weapons plant the Defense Department was \ninseparably intertwined with the AEC. The AEC operations were located \non the site of an Army ammunition plant. The workers at both sides of \nthe plant actually worked for the same contractor, workers often \nswitched between the plant parts, and workers on both sides of the \nplant were even exposed to many of the same hazardous materials, \nincluding beryllium and depleted uranium. Thus former workers at the \nplant do not always clearly distinguish the Army from the AEC.\n\n  And while the Department of Energy is investigating what happened and \nseeking solutions, the Army is stuck, still mired in a nonsensical \npolicy. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to ``neither \nconfirm nor deny'' the presence of nuclear weapons at any place at any \ntime. They could not admit that nuclear weapons were assembled in Iowa \nwithout admitting that there were nuclear weapons in Iowa. So they \nwrite vaguely about ``AEC activities,'' but don't say what those \nactivities were.\n  There have been no nuclear weapons at the Iowa site since 1975, but \nit's well known that weapons were there before that. The DOE says the \nweapons were there. A promotional video of the Army contractor at the \nsite even says the weapons were there. But the Army can't say it. This \nmakes the Army look ridiculous.\n  But worse, it sends the wrong signal to the former workers. These \nworkers swore oaths never to reveal what they did at the plant. And \nmany of them are still reluctant to talk. They are worried that their \ncancers or other health problems were caused by their work at the \nplant. But they feel that they can't even tell their doctors or site \ncleanup crews about the materials they worked with or the tasks they \ndid. They don't want to violate the oaths of secrecy they took. One \nworker at the Iowa plant said recently, ``There's still stuff buried \nout there that we don't know where it is. And we know people who do \nknow, but they will not say anything yet because they are still afraid \nof repercussions.'' Instead of helping those workers speak out, the \nArmy is forced to share their silence.\n  And Mr. President, to make the position even more indefensible for my \nworkers in Iowa, the Pentagon is not even consistently applying the \n``neither confirm nor deny,'' or ``NCND,''\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\npolicy. A document recently released by the Pentagon stated that the \nU.S. had nuclear weapons in Alaska, Cuba, Guam, Hawaii, the Johnston \nIslands, Midway, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, and West Germany. \nAfter the document was released, a Department spokesman said on \ntelevision that the U.S. never had nuclear weapons in Iceland. Why can \nthe Pentagon talk about nuclear weapons in Iceland but not in Iowa?\n  Mr. President, for the health of our workers, it's time for the \nPentagon to come clean. No one is more concerned with keeping real \nnuclear secrets than I am. But the Pentagon must not hide behind \ninconsistent policies when workers' lives may be at risk.\n  This amendment is narrowly targeted to require the Defense Department \nand Energy Department to review their classification and secrecy \npolicies and change them if they prevent or discourage workers at \nnuclear weapons facilities from discussing possible exposures with \ntheir health care providers. The amendment specifically recognizes that \nthis must be done within national security constraints. It also directs \nthe Departments to contact people who may have been exposed to \nradioactive or hazardous substances at former nuclear weapons \nfacilities, including the Iowa plant. The Department is to notify them \nof any exposures and of how they can discuss the exposures with their \nhealth care providers and other appropriate officials without violating \nsecrecy oaths or policies.\n  I hope all my colleagues will support this common-sense change for \ngovernment consistency and worker health.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3816 and 3817\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the time allotted in debate in support \nof the amendment, I would like to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone.\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I am very proud to have \nworked with Senator Durbin to be a cosponsor and have Senator Kerry \nhere on the floor as well.\n  I think this important amendment requiring more realistic testing of \nthe national missile system is an extremely important step for us to \ntake. First of all, it requires more realistic testing. Second, it \ncalls for the reconvening of the Welch commission to independently \nevaluate the testing program. Third, it requires a report to the \nCongress on the adequacy of the program.\n  This is the fourth time since the late fifties that we have talked \nabout a missile defense program. Each time there is a tremendous amount \nof enthusiasm. Then scientists and independent observers do a careful \nanalysis. After that, the enthusiasm wanes. I do not believe this time \nwill be any different.\n  I am sure every Senator read on Sunday morning that this past \nSaturday's test was an utter failure. What you may not know is that an \nearlier test was unsuccessful as well. But regardless of the actual \nsuccesses and failures of the tests, the fact is, the current testing \nprogram does not test the feasibility of the system in the real world. \nCurrent testing determines whether or not the system works against \ncooperative targets on a test range. This methodology is insufficient \nto determine the technological feasibility of the system against likely \nthreats. At present, even if the tests had been hailed as total \nsuccesses, they would have proved nothing more than the system is \nunproven against real threats. At present, we know that this system \nmight work if the other side is not making it hard to detect its \nweapons. This hardly seems a reason to move forward to deployment.\n  Some might argue that this amendment demands too much. Some might \nargue that today's testing program is a first step in a long process \ntowards full deployment. But demanding an adequate testing program, \nwhich is what this amendment calls for, certainly does not put the bar \ntoo far. It sets it where any reasonable person or scientist would put \nit. We must stick to development and work within the confines of a \nrealistic test before even considering moving to deployment.\n  The aim of the national missile defense is to defend the United \nStates from limited attacks by intercontinental-range ballistic \nmissiles armed with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. However, \nbiological or chemical weapons can be divided into many small warheads \ncalled submunitions. These submunitions could overwhelm the planned \ndefense, and more importantly, because some munitions allow for more \neffective dispersal of biological and chemical agents, an attacker \nwould have a strong incentive to use them even in the absence of \nmissile defenses. When it comes to biological warfare and these \nbiological and chemical agents, the greater likelihood is that they \nwill be carried by suitcase into this country. I pray that doesn't \nhappen.\n  Current testing does not take countermeasures into account. An attack \ncould overwhelm the system by using something as simple as ballooned \ndecoys, for example, by deploying nuclear weapons inside balloons and \nreleasing numerous empty balloons along with them. Or an attacker could \ncover its nuclear warheads with cooled shrouds which would prevent the \ninterceptor from detecting it. We are talking about testing which takes \ninto account these countermeasures. That is what we would have to deal \nwith.\n\n  Current testing does not take these countermeasures into account. The \nPentagon assessment will consider only whether the first phase of the \nsystem would be effective against a threat with no credible \ncountermeasures. It will not consider whether the full system would be \neffective against a threat with realistic countermeasures. Any decision \non whether or not the United States should deploy a national missile \ndefense should take into account how effective that system is likely to \nbe in the real world, not just whether or not it works against \ncooperative targets on a test range.\n  Unfortunately, the technological feasibility of the proposed national \ndefense system, which will be determined in the Pentagon's upcoming \ndeployment readiness review, will be assessed precisely on the basis of \nsuch test results. Even worse, it will be based upon only a few tests.\n  The administration requested that the Pentagon provide an estimate of \nwhether a national missile defense can be deployed in 5 year's time. \nGeneral Kadish, the head of the Pentagon's ballistic missile defense \nprogram, has described the 2005 timetable as ``high risk.'' He has made \nit clear that the timetable is much faster than military planners would \nlike. The recommendation of the Pentagon's own Office of the \nOperational and Test Evaluation Program stated clearly that the \ndeployment readiness review ``is a strongly `schedule driven' \napproach'' rather than one based upon results.\n  Is it too much to ask that we be certain that this system works \nbefore we move ahead with deployment?\n  That is what this amendment is about.\n  If the proposed national missile defense system is to have any \npossibility of enhancing U.S. security, it must work, and it must work \nwell. At present, the evidence isn't there to prove that it does, and \nthe tests underway to establish that proof are simplified and \nunrealistic. We must demand that any deployment decision on national \nmissile defense be postponed until the system has been tested \nsuccessfully against real-world realistic threats.\n  Last year, I voted against a resolution urging the administration to \nmake a decision to deploy a national missile defense system. I believed \nthen, as I do now, that a decision to deploy before a decision is made \nthere needs to be a careful evaluation of the effectiveness of the \nsystem.\n  I also believe that we need to look at this in the context of overall \nU.S. security needs. The goal should be to increase U.S. security--not \nto undermine it. Deploying a system now, I fear, does the opposite. It \nthreatens to disrupt the current arms control regimen and undermine the \ncredibility of our commitment to nonproliferation.\n  Deployment of a national missile defense system would be a violation \nof the ABM Treaty. Are we prepared to discard this arms control \nregimen? I worry--and I think every Senator, Democrat and Republican \nalike, worries--about proliferation of these weapons of mass \ndestruction. If this regimen of arms control breaks down with Russia--\nand, perhaps even more importantly, breaks down with China, then there \nis India, then there is Pakistan, then there is South Korea, then there \nis Japan--I fear the direction in which we are moving.\n\n  Colleagues, for 40 years the United States of America has led \ninternational efforts to reduce and contain the danger from nuclear \nweapons. We must not now renounce the responsibilities of that \nleadership with a hasty and shortsighted decision that will have \nlasting consequences. We must answer a number of questions before we \nproceed:\n  Does it make sense to unilaterally deploy a system now if the result \nmight be to put the American people at even greater risk?\n  Should we take the time to work with allies and others to find a \nmutually acceptable nonthreatening way of proceeding?\n  Have the threats to which we are responding been exaggerated and more \ndriven by politics than accurate threat assessments and hard science?\n  Is the technology there to deploy a system that would actually work \nin the real world?\n  This amendment speaks directly to that last question.\n  I urge my colleagues to demand to know more about the complexities of \na national missile defense system prior to deploying that system. I \ndon't think that is an unreasonable request.\n  The failure of Saturday's test is only a fraction of the real story. \nEven a successful test would prove nothing given the current testing \nconditions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment requiring a more \nrealistic testing of the national missile defense system, reconvening \nthe Welch panel to independently evaluate a testing program, and \nrequiring a report to the Congress on the adequacy of the program.\n  We should not commit ourselves blindly to a program that can cost \nbillions of dollars and could very well decrease our overall security \nrather than\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\nto enhance it. Our future and our children's children's future could \ndepend on the decision we make on this amendment. Let's do the right \nthing. I hope we can have a strong vote on this amendment.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask my colleague a question and the time \nallocated to the Senator from Virginia be charged for the portion of \nthe colloquy I use.\n  The Senator makes a fairly strong statement indirectly at our former \ncolleague, Senator Cohen, now Secretary of Defense, that he would \nproceed blindly on this program which is so vital to the security of \nthe United States, assuming, as you say, under the full criteria that \nthe President addressed goes forward--that he would go blindly. Is that \na purposeful choice of words directed at this distinguished former \ncolleague who, in my judgment, having been on the Armed Services \nCommittee 22 years and having served 18 or 19 of those years with him, \nI cannot imagine undertaking the responsibility to oversee a program of \nthis importance and proceeding, as the Senator said, ``blindly.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague I can't imagine \nthe Secretary of Defense doing that, either. My plea was to Senators. I \nsaid we must not proceed blindly and I urge all Members to understand \nthe complexity of this testing and to at least call for a thorough \nevaluation to make sure that this system will really work. My comments \nwere not directed to Secretary Cohen.\n  I also say to my colleague, I don't believe the Secretary of Defense \nhas made a final recommendation to the President.\n  Mr. WARNER. I certainly agree.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In light of the failure of this past week, I don't \nknow what the Secretary's decision will be.\n  I think all Members are just making the reasonable request that \nbefore we go forward with deployment, let's have the kind of \noperational testing that will prove that this system will work in the \nreal world against credible threats, and let's have an independent \nevaluation by the Welch commission and have at least a report to the \nCongress.\n  That is what I am referring to, I say to my colleague from Virginia. \nI am glad he asked the question. In no way would I direct these \ncomments toward the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to say with all due respect to our three \ncolleagues, opponents on this amendment, indirectly this amendment is \nsuggesting that the Department is not proceeding in a prudent way \ntowards their responsibilities on this program. I have to state that.\n  I do not find any specific fault with some of the requests made but \nmomentarily when I take the floor in my own right, I will have \ndocumentation to show that the Welch panel is doing the very things for \nwhich the Senator asked. I will point to the fact that the Secretary of \nDefense has said in previous testimony what he is doing on this \nprogram. In fact, I say to the Presiding Officer, being a member of the \nArmed Services Committee and indeed the chairman of the strategic \nsubcommittee, I asked the Secretary of Defense to come up at his \nearliest opportunity and report to the Committee on Armed Services. He \nhas agreed to do so shortly after his return from his trip currently in \nAsia. I thought he addressed the test program, which did, regrettably, \nend in a failure, I thought in a very courageous and forthright way he \naddressed that failure to the American public and, indeed, the world.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I probably need not respond. I appreciate my \ncolleague's comments.\n\n  One final comment in response to his comments. One of the things I \nhave liked best about preparing for this amendment for me as a Senator \nhas been the way I imagined Senate work to be. I tried to immerse \nmyself on this issue and get the best security briefings from the \nPentagon, get other briefings from other people in the Pentagon, and \ntalked to a whole range of experts. The Welch Commission report is a \nvery interesting report.\n  This amendment certainly says we need to make absolutely sure that we \nare involved in the kind of testing that will show this system will \nwork before we move forward. That is true. That is certainly the \npremise of this amendment. I think this is a reasonable premise. \nSenators ought to raise these kinds of questions. That is why we are \nhere. That is why I think this amendment is important.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Welch panel was before the Armed Services Committee \njust last week and testified.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding, and I ask the Senator from \nVirginia, that the testing that has been laid out in the protocols that \nI have seen contemplates testing almost exclusively from off the coast \nof California and Kwajalein Island, which by their own admission, the \nmilitary has said are less than ideal in representing the multiple \ndifferent sources from which a legitimate attack could come.\n  There is nothing in any protocol that I have seen to date suggesting \nthat the testing that will take place meets the kind of testing that \nthe Senator from Illinois is looking for.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will look into that. I recognize the \nmilitary had indicated that this perhaps doesn't give them the \ndiversity of tests they desire.\n  Certainly, I am interested in the comment that this Nation is faced \nwith a multiple of sources, and that confirms my concern about the \noverall threat posed to this Nation by the rogue or accidental firing \nof a missile. That is why we need this national missile defense \nprogram.\n  Mr. KERRY. If the Senator will yield further for a question, when we \ntalk about multiple sources, it is possible for a so-called rogue \nstate--and the term itself is one that is perhaps questionable today, \nbut the so-called rogue state could take a rusty tanker, fit it out \nwith the capacity to shoot, drive it out of a harbor to almost any \nlocation in an ocean in the world, and decide to shoot from there. Is \nthat accurate?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. If we are strictly testing between one location, one \ndirection, and our radar system is specifically positioned to \nanticipate an attack from a certain location, if that were to be the \ncase, we would face a completely different situation, would we not?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. There is a diversity of scenarios \nwe have to protect this Nation against. This test program was designed \nin large measure to prioritize those sources from whence an attack \nmight emanate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Finally, I ask the Senator, the entire program is \ncurrently driven by a date essentially arrived at by the national \nintelligence estimate, that suggested that 2005 is the first date there \nmight be a possibility of a missile being fired; is that correct?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct, as a result of the national intelligence \nestimate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. We are on the time of the Senator from Virginia or I \nwouldn't be doing this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's make it clear. I think in my request I said the \ntime that I consumed would be chargeable to my side.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thought it was the entire colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). That was the exchange with the \nSenator from Minnesota. The Senator has been yielding for questions on \nhis time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's make it clear for purposes of future colloquies. \nThe time consumed by Mr. Levin and myself will be charged to our side, \nand the time for response will be charged to the other side.\n  Mr. KERRY. With that understanding, I am afraid I have to refrain \nfrom this colloquy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I say to my good friend from Massachusetts, I happen to \nagree with his thoughts on this subject. We are very close in terms of \nour views. However, there is a complete misunderstanding about the year \n2005. That is not the year when the intelligence estimates say North \nKorea will be able to pose a threat to us.\n  Mr. KERRY. Correct; they can do it today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. They can do it today. But 2005 is the year which the \nSecretary of Defense thought at the time he was making an assessment \nsome time ago would be the earliest time that we would be able to field \nthe national missile defense.\n  So everybody--in the media, on this floor and just about everywhere--\nhas\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\nnow taken the common wisdom that the 2005 date is when the national \nintelligence estimate says the threat will arrive.\n  That is not what the national intelligence estimate is. The threat is \nany time when a three-stage Taepo Dong II could deliver a several-\nhundred-kilogram payload anywhere in the United States. And that day is \nwhen they next test it.\n  With the general point my good friend from Massachusetts is making, I \nhappen to agree with what he is saying. I certainly support the good \nSenator from Illinois on his amendment, but I think we ought to try to \nchange the wisdom which has evolved around that date or the assumption \nor the press coverage of that date.\n  Everybody uses that date for the wrong reason. Whether it is possible \nto reverse it, correct it, I don't know. But I think it would help the \ndebate a great deal if we were able to look at that date for what it \nis, which is the first date that the Secretary of Defense thought, at \nthe time he made the assessment some months ago, that a national \nmissile defense could possibly be deployed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for a clarification now of the time that has been \nallocated to each side and how much is remaining. I have requests from \nseveral of my colleagues, and I want to give them all a chance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 51 minutes, 41 \nseconds. The Senator from Illinois has 44 minutes, 43 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for his leadership, and I thank also the Senator from \nMinnesota for his common sense, leadership, and eloquence on it.\n  This is really a matter of--I guess the best word to summarize it--\ncommon sense. My prayer is that we in the Senate are not going to \nbecome prisoners of politics on an issue that is as critical to the \nnational security interests of our country--indeed, of the world. This \nis the most important arms decision we will make in years. I am not \ngoing to get into the comparisons of when the last one was, but \ncertainly in the last 10 or 15 years. I think what the Senator from \nIllinois is asking for ought to fit into the political philosophy of \nevery single member of the Republican Party. I would have hoped the \nSenator, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nwould say we should accept this amendment. How is it that we could be \ntalking about deploying a weapons system?\n  Mr. WARNER. What did the Senator say?\n  Mr. KERRY. I said to the distinguished chairman of the committee, I \ndon't understand why he would not want to accept this, because, as a \nmatter of common sense, every Member of the Senate ought to be \ninterested in knowing that if we are going to spend $10 billion, $20 \nbillion, $40 billion, $60 billion, $100 billion to create a weapons \nsystem, a defensive or offensive system, we ought to know that it \nworks. We ought to know it can accomplish its goal.\n\n  Some of the best scientists in the United States of America are not \npoliticians. They do not come at this as Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives and liberals. They are scientists. They win Nobel Prizes \nfor their science. They go to MIT, Stanford, New York University, all \nover this country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. KERRY. We have a limited time.\n  Mr. WARNER. You asked me a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. If we can do it on the Senator's time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course. You asked if I would accept it, as chairman of \nthe committee, one of the managers. The answer is yes. I think our \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois knows that. We have said to him \nthree times: We accept the amendment. Am I not correct? Let the Record \nindicate he is nodding assent to the question. The Senator from \nMichigan has urged him we would accept it.\n  So rally on, dear colleague. We will listen to you. I don't mean to \ndeflate your argument as to why we would not do it, because we have \noffered to do it.\n  Mr. KERRY. This is the most welcome acceptance of the power of my \nargument I have ever had on the floor of the Senate. I thank the \ndistinguished chairman. But I am confident what the Senator from \nIllinois wanted to do--and I share this belief--was to have the Senate \ntalk about this. I think we ought to talk about this. So I do not think \ntaking 1 hour to discuss something which hopefully will pass \noverwhelmingly, or that we then accept, is inappropriate. I think we \nneed to think about this.\n  Mr. WARNER. No one is suggesting that.\n  Mr. KERRY. We face a situation where we are talking about putting \ntogether a system that the best scientists in the world tell us could \nliterally be rendered absolutely inoperative, if it is simply deployed; \nall you have to do is put the system out there, and you have the \nability to create decoys with fairly unsophisticated technology. In \nfact, General Welch himself has said in his report, and he said it \nbefore the Armed Services Committee the other day, that they anticipate \nthe C-1 deployment, which is the deployment currently contemplated, \nwith countermeasures by year 2005, is a deployment in which they \nanticipate current technology, current state-of-the-art technology, has \nthe ability to deploy countermeasures.\n  They say you could have bomblets. After the stage separates in outer \nspace and it is in that midstage, you could have bomblets, up to 100 of \nthem, released from 1 single warhead. Strictly speaking, that is not a \ncountermeasure because it is not directed at the entire system. But it \nis a countermeasure in that it voids the effectiveness of the system or \nthe capacity of the system to work effectively.\n  I ask my colleagues to look around the wall of this Chamber. I \ncounted earlier, in the great amount of time we had to wait for this \ndebate, 88 lights up there on the outer section. That is fewer than 100 \nof these bomblets. I ask you to just look at those. We are supposed to \ntalk about a system that would be effective enough to destroy bombs \ncoming at us from outer space, at a spacing far greater than any of \nthose lights, at tens of hundreds of miles an hour, with the capacity \nto distinguish and break through every single one of them to prevent a \nchemical weapon or biological weapon, that could be completely lethal \nto the entire city of New York, Los Angeles, to a whole State, from \nhitting this country.\n\n  Does anybody here really believe we are going to be able to go down \nthat kind of sophisticated, discriminative capacity? Some say maybe we \nmight get there in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years; that we might have \nthat ability if everything worked correctly. Maybe we can develop that \nkind of system ultimately. But at what cost? Then the question is, What \nis the next tier of countermeasure that defeats whatever it is we did \nto defeat their countermeasure?\n  People sit here and say: Don't worry about that, Senator; we are just \ngoing to have a technological superiority.\n  All you have to do is go back to the cold war, 50 years of point-\ncounterpoint; step-counterstep. We do the atom bomb; they do the atom \nbomb. We do the hydrogen bomb; they do the hydrogen bomb. We put them \non long-range aircraft; they put them on long-range aircraft. We MIRV; \nthey MIRV. They do Sputnik; we do Sputnik.\n  Out of all of the measures through the entire cold war, the United \nStates of America was the first to do them almost every single time. I \nthink the record is all but once and maybe twice. Every single time we \ndid it, it may have taken them 5 years, it may have taken them 7 years, \nbut they did it. And finally we decided that we were safer by passing \nthe ABM Treaty and beginning to move in the opposite direction, first \nwith SALT and then with START.\n  Now all we are asking in this amendment is let's be certain, before \nwe spend these billions of dollars. I happen to support this. I want to \nbe very clear about this. I support the notion of developing a limited, \ncapable, mutually deployed system for national defense that could, \nindeed, strike down a potential rogue missile or accidental firing. No \nleader of the United States could responsibly suggest we are going\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\nto write off an entire city or State, or half our country. Of course we \nhave an obligation to go down that road, but we have an equal \nobligation to do it in a way that does not wind up upsetting the entire \nbalance of the arms race, or our current process of diminishing arms, \nthat does not tell all our allies the United States is going to break \nout, at some point, of their regime at our own will; that we have not \nestablished a sufficient level of scrutiny, of transparency, of \nmutuality, that brings people along with us so they understand where we \nare going.\n  I say to my friend, I am all for continuing as rapidly as we can the \ntechnological development, the research, the capacity to do this, but \ndon't we want to do it in a way that guarantees we have a system that \ncan do what it sets out to do without inviting a set of unintended \nconsequences that actually wind up making the world not as safe as we \nwere when we began the process? That is all we are asking.\n  I can envision a world where the Russians and the Chinese and others \ndecide we are all safer if we have a capacity to prevent a terrorist \nfrom firing some kind of missile from anywhere, but we are only safer \nif other countries move along with us and perceive that they are \nsharing in that safety and that, somehow, it is not a new measure \ndirected by the United States against their current level of perceived \nsecurity or threat level.\n  All of this is an ongoing process of perceptions: How they perceive \nus; how we perceive them. It is important to be sensitive to those \nperceptions.\n  I believe what the amendment of the Senator from Illinois will do \nwill actually build on General Welch's recommendations. It will \nexplicitly set out what the BMDO should do. It will require ground and \nflight testing that will make the system safer and better. It will \nultimately guarantee us that we will get the kind of system we want.\n  General Welch says he intends for the independent review team to \naddress these countermeasure issues. It seems to me what the Senator \nfrom Illinois is doing is guaranteeing that the Congress is going on \nrecord, just as we did in saying we think we ought to pursue this, just \nas we did in suggesting that there are certain threshold levels that we \nought to respond to with respect to our intelligence.\n  My final comment is, picking up where the Senator from Michigan \nclosed, the 2005 deadline is exactly what the Senator from Michigan \ndefined it as. It is, in effect, an out-of-the-sky, artificially \narrived at deadline. Yet it has been driving this debate and driving \nthe Congress' actions. We have time to pursue this thoughtfully and \nefficiently. That is what this amendment sets out to do. I congratulate \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may address my colleague on my time \nand his reply can be charged to his time, I wish to associate myself \nwith the response of my distinguished colleague from Michigan with \nregard to 2005. He is absolutely correct. The threat exists today. The \nwarhead content is a different subject for a different time, but it is \na part of this equation in calculation of time.\n  I am pleased the Senator from Massachusetts said on the floor tonight \nthat he supports going forward with the concept of what we call the \nCochran bill which was signed by the President of the United States. \nThat is my understanding of what he said. He did vote for it. But he \nsaid collectively, we, and he opened his arms. The record also shows \nthat the other two colleagues on this amendment did not vote for the \nCochran bill and were two of the three who voted against it. The ``we'' \nI think we want to make a little clearer.\n  Here is my problem with this amendment, and I find myself in somewhat \nof an awkward position. I am defending Bill Cohen, my good friend, the \nSecretary of Defense of the administration with which my colleagues \npride themselves with a long-time association. Fine.\n  Here is what it says on page 4 of the amendment:\n\n       Independent Review Panel.-- (1) The Secretary of Defense \n     shall reconvene the Panel on Reducing Risk in Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Flight Test Program.\n\n  There it is, ``shall reconvene.''\n  Here is the panel to which he was speaking which reported to the \nNation on June 13 of this year, and on page 3, General Welch and his \ncolleagues said the following:\n\n       The IRT believes that design discrimination capabilities \n     are adequate to meet the defined C-1 threat. However, more \n     advanced decoy suites are likely to escalate the \n     discrimination challenge. The mid-course phase BMD concept \n     used in the current NMD program has important architectural \n     advantages. At the same time, that concept requires critical \n     attention to potential countermeasure challenges.\n\n  Precisely what my colleague from Massachusetts is saying. Let me \nfinish:\n\n       There is extensive potential in the system design to grow \n     discrimination capabilities. The program to more fully \n     understand needs and to exploit and expand this growth \n     potential to meet future threats needs to be well defined, \n     clearly assigned, and funded now.\n\n  The concluding sentence:\n\n       A panel of the IRT is continuing work in this area.\n\n  When you direct the Secretary of Defense to do something the panel is \nalready doing, I say to my good friends and colleagues, what is this \nabout? That is why we will not accept the amendment. It has some \nconstructive parts to it, but you are directing the Secretary of \nDefense to do something he is already doing. That is my concern.\n  Mr. KERRY. If I can answer the distinguished Senator, and I know the \nSenator from Illinois will talk about it more, the truth is, if you \nread the Senator's amendment in full, the Senator is very precise about \nthose kinds of tests that he thinks the Congress ought to guarantee \ntake place.\n  The Secretary of Defense is a friend of mine, too. I went to meet \nwith him 3 weeks ago on this very subject to spend some time talking it \nthrough with him, but I find nothing inappropriate, nor do I think he \nwould as a former Member of this Chamber, in this Chamber expressing \nits will in requiring a certain set of tests with respect to a system.\n\n  This is not the first time we will have required the Secretary of \nDefense to do something. In point of fact, when we pass the DOD \nauthorization bill, we have literally hundreds of directives for the \nSecretary of Defense with respect to housing, treatment of deployments, \nrecruitments--there are countless numbers of ways we direct him to do \nthings. It is entirely appropriate we direct him----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree, but the amendment says clearly \nyou shall do something he is already doing.\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my friend from Virginia, I read that report very \ncarefully. There is nothing in it that guarantees to me--there is \nterminology about further investigation, further evaluation, but that \ncould be on paper; that could be a computer model; that could be in any \nnumber of ways that they decide satisfy a fairly strong compulsion, \nshall we say, within the institution to build.\n  What we want to guarantee is that compulsion is appropriately \nmeasured against a clear empirical standard that we are establishing. I \nfind absolutely nothing inconsistent in that.\n  Moreover, with respect to the date that is compelling us--I know the \nchairman of the committee will agree with me on this --the fact is that \nsignificant changes have been made in the intelligence estimating \nprocess which has also made many people nervous about how people want \nto push this process a little bit.\n  The Senator from Michigan talked about the possibility of a missile \nbeing fired by North Korea. Until, I think, a year ago or 2 years ago--\nI will finish very quickly. I am not going to go on long. I want to \nmake this point because it is important.\n  We used to measure in an intelligence estimate more than mere \npossibility. We measure intention, and it was only in response to the \n1995 Rumsfeld process that suddenly we changed the way we evaluate \nthis. We now no longer contemplate intention; we merely look at \npossibility. I say to my friend, it may be a possibility that North \nKorea has one missile that they could fire, but they would have to be \nbeyond insane to do it because they would not last on the face of this \nplanet more than 30 minutes because of our response.\n\n  So do they have an intention to do it, particularly when you measure \nit against the Perry mission, when you\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\nmeasure it against Kim Dae-jung's recent visit and the entire \nrapprochement that is currently taking place? Are we to believe this is \na legitimate threat we should be responding to with such speed that \nwill not guarantee the kind of testing the Senator from Illinois is \nasking for?\n  That is our point. I think this is one where there are suspicions \nsufficient to raise questions about the guarantees that the testing \nwill be there that we need.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  It is important we do have colloquies on this issue. You have hit on \na very important point, and that is ``contentious.'' Throughout our \nlong history, through the cold war with the former Soviet Union--\nindeed, today with Russia--there was always the underlying predicate \nthat the Soviet Union--and now Russia--would handle decisionmaking as \nit relates to strategic intercontinental ballistic missiles in a \nresponsible way.\n  Up until recently, we knew very little about North Korea, we knew \nvery little about the intentions of the deceased leader, and now the \nnew leader. Some ground has been broken. I happen to be on the cautious \nside.\n  So let us watch, not just for a month, not just for 2 months, but for \nover a period of time. It may well be that we can get a different \nperspective and understanding about the new leadership. But as yet, we \ncannot, and we have to rely on much in the past.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his indulgence \nbecause he has allowed us to go ahead longer than he gave me. I thank \nhim.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is the status of the time allocation \nfor both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 32 minutes 42 \nseconds; and the Senator from Virginia has 42 minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself no more than 3 minutes to make one \npoint.\n  Let me say, first to the chairman of the committee, who has been kind \nenough to stay here this evening for this important debate, that I \nthink the level of exchange and dialog here this evening is an \nindication of the knowledge on the subject of the Members who have \nstayed and the level of their interest. I hope it adds to the national \ndebate.\n  I also say to the chairman of the committee, I believe all of us in \nthis Chamber share mutual respect for our current Secretary of Defense. \nI think he is doing an excellent job. Nothing that any of us have said \nor will say should bring into question our admiration and respect for \nhis ability and his service to our country.\n  I also tell my colleagues, I had the good fortune, in preparing for \nthe debate, to go through a classified briefing and also to meet with \nDirector Philip Coyle, who is in charge of Operational Test and \nEvaluation at the Department of Defense under the leadership of \nSecretary Cohen.\n  I asked him to put in common terms, that I can take back to a town \nmeeting in Illinois, what we are talking about when we use the words \n``technologically feasible.''\n\n  He said: Well, consider it this way. Is it technologically feasible \nto hit a hole in one in golf? Yes. Is it technologically feasible to \nhit a hole in one if the hole you are shooting at is moving? Yes, but \nit is getting a little more difficult. Is it technologically feasible \nto hit a hole in one if the hole you are shooting at is moving, as is \nthe flag in that hole, and five or six other flags are moving as well, \nand you are not sure which one is actually the hole you are shooting \nat? Yes, I suppose that is technologically feasible, but now it is \ngetting to be very difficult.\n  But it raises the very question of this debate about countermeasures.\n  I would like to quote and make part of this Record a letter that was \nsent to me on July 11 by Philip Coyle, director of the Office of \nOperational Test and Evaluation, in which he said:\n\n       This letter is to support your effort to reinforce the need \n     for realistic testing of the National Missile Defense (NMD) \n     system. It is still very early in the developmental testing \n     of NMD. As we move forward, test realism will need to grow \n     with system capability, and it will become more and more \n     important to achieve realistic operational conditions in NMD \n     system tests. This will include realistic countermeasures and \n     engagement conditions.\n       The very nature of missile defense means that it will not \n     be possible to demonstrate all possible engagements in open \n     air flight intercept tests. Accordingly, it will be necessary \n     to develop realistic ground test simulations including \n     realistic hardware-in-the-loop and scene generation \n     facilities. I especially appreciate your commitment to both \n     ground based and open air flight tests.\n       If I can provide additional information, please don't \n     hesitate to call me.\n\n  I say to the chairman of the committee, it is true that we are giving \na directive to the Department of Defense and it is also true that the \ngentleman in charge of the testing under this program has said to us he \nbelieves it is an honest effort to make certain the system works.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the distinguished Senator provide us with a copy of \nthat letter?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Perhaps it would be important to put it in the Record.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Office of the Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2000.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: This letter is to support your effort \n     to reinforce the need for realistic testing of the National \n     Missile Defense (NMD) system. It is still very early in the \n     developmental testing of NMD. As we move forward, test \n     realism will need to grow with system capability, and it will \n     become more and more important to achieve realistic \n     operational conditions in NMD system tests. This will include \n     realistic countermeasures and engagement conditions.\n       The very nature of missile defense means that it will not \n     be possible to demonstrate all possible engagements in open \n     air flight intercept tests. Accordingly, it will be necessary \n     to develop realistic ground test simulations, including \n     realistic hardware-in-the-loop and scene generation \n     facilities. I especially appreciate your commitment to both \n     ground based and open air flight tests.\n       If I can provide additional information, please don't \n     hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Philip E. Coyle,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Democratic leader \non our Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin of Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend the Senator from Illinois \nfor this amendment. It is a very important amendment. It really shows \ncongressional interest in an area which is going to require a great \ndeal of attention. That is the statement of General Welch himself, \nwhich my good friend from Virginia just read.\n  I want to reread one of the lines in the Welch report, which is that: \n``more advanced decoy suites are likely to escalate the discrimination \nchallenge. The mid-course phase BMD concept used in the current \nnational missile defense program has important architectural \nadvantages. At the same time, that concept requires critical attention \nto potential countermeasure challenges.''\n  The countermeasures issue requires critical attention.\n  What the Senator from Illinois is saying is that the Congress should \npay some attention to this, not just the executive branch. I have no \ndoubt, and my good friend from Virginia has no doubt, Secretary Cohen \nwill pay attention to this. We do not know if the next Secretary of \nDefense will be as interested in this issue--we hope he will be--as \nthis Secretary.\n  But the fact that the executive branch is doing something has never \nprevented the Congress from putting something into law. We have had \nPresidents who have had Executive orders that we agree with, that we \nrepeat in law. Why would we hesitate to simply express our own view, \nshow congressional interest, and reinforce something which hopefully \nthe Defense Department will continue to do? So it is not unusual for us \nto direct something. I think we ought to adopt this amendment \noverwhelmingly.\n  This is a very complicated system. The Senator from Virginia pointed \nout that a few of our colleagues voted against the Cochran bill. Almost \nall of us voted in favor of it. One part of the\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\nCochran bill said it should be our national policy--it is our national \npolicy--to deploy a system when ``technologically feasible'' or words \nto that effect.\n  But there is another provision in the Cochran bill which was added by \namendment, by the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, which I \ncosponsored, which said that it is also the policy of the United States \nto seek to continue to reduce, by negotiations, the number of nuclear \nweapons in this world. That is also the policy of the United States.\n  We have two policies--a policy to deploy a limited missile defense \nand a policy to reduce the number of nuclear weapons. What happens when \nthose two policies clash is unresolved in the Cochran bill.\n  We must continue on both those courses. If there is a conflict \nbetween deploying a limited defense, after it is technologically \nproven--assuming it is--and reducing the number of nuclear weapons \nthrough continuing negotiations, if there is a conflict--as there \napparently is at the moment, since Russia says she will not reduce \nfurther nuclear weapons if we are going to unilaterally deploy a \nnational missile defense--if and when there is such a conflict, that \nconflict will have to be resolved under the circumstances at that time.\n  So I think the Senator from Massachusetts was very proper in using \nthe term ``we'' because many of us supported the Missile Defense Act \nbecause of the presence of a number of policies, both to deploy a \nsystem when technologically feasible, subject to appropriation, as well \nas to reduce, through negotiations, the number of nuclear weapons in \nthis world.\n  This amendment is a commonsense, fly-before-you-buy amendment. It is \nconsistent with the Senate's traditions. And it is something we have \nalmost always required.\n  The few times we have deviated from the fly-before-you-buy approach, \nwe have paid heavily for it, at least in a number of those instances. \nWe should test against countermeasures. We are testing against \ncountermeasures. This amendment simply says that it wants the Welch \npanel to be reauthorized, to continue in existence, to report to the \nCongress on defenses against countermeasures.\n  Finally, I will reread the one line which I think is so important \nfrom the Welch panel: The national missile defense program requires \ncritical attention to potential countermeasures challenges.\n  That says it all to me. The current system does not address future \ncountermeasure threats. It only addresses the so-called C-1 threat, as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts pointed out. There are going to be in \nthe future much more sophisticated countermeasures which this system \nhas to be able to address or else it won't make sense to deploy. That \nis what we would be going on record as saying we believe is important. \nWe would be doing what the Welch panel says is important: paying \ncritical attention to potential countermeasures challenges, saying that \nthe Congress cares about this issue, that it makes sense to us that as \npart of any decision of operational effectiveness, that there be \ntesting against reasonably likely countermeasures that could be faced \nby a national missile defense.\n  I am glad my good friend from Virginia believes this is kind of a \ncommonsense amendment, that it reinforces what the Secretary is already \ndoing. I think it is very appropriate for Congress to do exactly that, \nto show our support when we do support something that is done by the \nexecutive branch and to state our opinion on the subject, and to put it \nin law so the next Secretary of Defense realizes it is in law and that \nthere is congressional interest in the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 6 minutes have expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have no better friend than my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan. What troubles me is he used the \nterm ``reauthorize.'' Congress never authorized the Welch panel. It was \nconvened by the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I said the Secretary, not Congress.\n  Mr. WARNER. My friend used the term this amendment ``reauthorizes.'' \nI say to my good friend, Congress had nothing to do with it. This is a \npanel of the Secretary of Defense. The amendment language says ``to \nreconvene.'' It is not necessary to reconvene something which is \nongoing. I want accuracy in this debate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my friend will yield, if I said Congress reauthorized \ninstead of urging the Secretary to reconvene and to keep reconvened, I \nstand corrected and am happy to stand corrected.\n  I think the intent was clear, however, of what the Senator from \nMichigan said.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Virginia is not seeking time, I will \ncontinue allocating.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator may go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Durbin amendment. I \ncommend him for raising this very important issue this evening.\n  This debate has already illustrated the knowledge of the participants \nand also the commitment of both sides in this debate to try to reach a \nvery important and principled decision with respect to national missile \ndefense. The obvious fact is that this is the most expensive military \nprogram we have contemplated, perhaps, in the history of this country, \nand there is a great deal riding on it.\n  It is not only financial, it is also strategic in terms of our \nincreased security in the world and in terms of the reaction of our \nallies, reaction of potential adversaries, all of which makes this \ndebate critical.\n  At the heart of this debate--one of the reasons the Senator from \nIllinois is contributing mightily to the debate--is the issue of \ncountermeasures. The importance of countermeasures should be obvious to \nall of us. My colleague from Massachusetts talked about this. In the \nhistory of conflict, for every development, there is an attempt to \ncircumvent or to neutralize that development. So it should be no \nwonder, as we contemplate deploying a national missile defense, our \nadversaries are at this time thinking of ways they could, in fact, \ndefeat such a national missile defense.\n  There are two general ways to do that. One is to build more launchers \nwith more warheads so you essentially overwhelm whatever missile \ndefense we have in place. Or--this is probably the most likely \nresponse--you develop countermeasures on your missiles to confuse our \ndefense and allow your missiles to penetrate despite our national \nmissile defense.\n  At the heart of what we should be doing in contemplating the \ndeployment and funding of this system is ensuring that in the testing \nwe pay particular attention to the issue of countermeasures, because \nthat is the most likely response of an adversary to defeat the system \nwe are proposing. That is common sense in many respects. Anyone with a \ncursory knowledge of history would immediately arrive at that \nconclusion.\n  This is not a merely theoretical discussion. Sophisticated \ncountermeasures already exist. They are the penetrating aids which are \non most of the Russian missiles. There is the possibility, of course, \nthat these penetrating aids will either be copied by rogue nations or, \nin fact, be traded or exchanged to these rogue nations.\n  I found very interesting a report by the intelligence community which \nwas unclassified and issued last September. In their words:\n\n       We assess that countries developing ballistic missiles \n     would also develop various responses to U.S. theater and \n     national defenses. Russia and China each have developed \n     numerous countermeasures and probably are willing to sell the \n     requisite technologies.\n       Many countries, such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq, \n     probably would rely initially on readily available \n     technology--including separating RVs, spin-stabilized RVs, RV \n     reorientation, radar absorbing material, booster \n     fragmentation, low-power jammers, chaff, and simple balloon \n     decoys--to develop penetration aids and countermeasures.\n       These countries could develop countermeasures based on \n     these technologies by the time they flight test their \n     missiles.\n\n  Frankly, what we are testing against today is a very small fraction \nof these possible countermeasures penetrating aids. We have selected a \nvery discrete set of the most primitive countermeasures, and we have \nused that as our benchmark to determine whether or\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\nnot the proposed national missile defense system will work well enough \nto fund development and ultimate deployment, when, in fact, our own \nintelligence community is telling us today there are numerous \nsophisticated penetrating aids that are readily available.\n\n  They are also telling us that as we build up this national missile \ndefense, our potential adversaries, while they build their missiles, \nare not just waiting around. They are also developing their \ncountermeasures. So countermeasures takes on a very important role in \nour deliberations.\n  Senator Durbin has identified this critical issue and has focused the \nattention of the Senate on how we will respond to this particular \nissue. His response is not only principled but is entirely logical.\n  What he is saying is, let's ensure that in the testing process, we \ndon't test the just rudimentary countermeasures, we test for robust \ncountermeasures. If we can defeat those countermeasures, then we have a \nsystem that not only we can deploy, but that system will be much more \nstable, much more effective over time; in effect, increasing the \nlongevity of the system. When we are going to spend upwards of $60 \nbillion--I think that was one figure quoted; frankly, I believe \nwhatever figure we have now, it will be much more when we finish paying \nthe price--if we are spending that much money, we don't want to buy \nsomething that has a half-life of 1 year, 2 years, 3 years or 4 years. \nWe want something that will justify the expense and defend the country \nagainst likely threats for many years.\n  Senator Durbin used the analogy of golf. The other analogy that is \nvery popular to try to bring into popular parlance what is going on \nhere is essentially what we are trying to do is hit a bullet with \nanother bullet, small objects flying through space at relatively large \nspeeds. Think about how difficult that is right now.\n  We have made progress in terms of supercomputers, in terms of large-\nscale computer capacity. So the problem of identifying a speeding \nbullet and then calculating instantaneously through billions of \ncalculations its trajectory and then sending that message to another \nbullet is a daunting physical problem, but we have made progress.\n  However, the countermeasures takes that daunting task and infinitely \nincreases its complexity because to our system and our kinetic kill \nvehicle that is hurling through space, it won't be only one target; it \ncould be multiple targets. To differentiate those targets, identify the \nreal targets, and strike it in a matter of seconds is an incredibly \ncomplex technological task.\n\n  So I believe, once again, that the Senator has identified something \nthat is critical to our responsibilities--not the responsibility of the \nSecretary of Defense, not the President's responsibility, but our \nresponsibility as the Senate of the United States to supervise, to \ncarefully review, and, ultimately, through appropriations and \nauthorization, to give the final say about this system. That is our \nresponsibility, and we would be rejecting that responsibility if we \ndidn't look hard and insist that the executive look hard at this whole \nissue of countermeasures.\n  The other issue that has been discussed tonight is, why should we \ntell the Department of Defense to do something such as this when they \nare already doing it? Well, the simple answer is: We do it all the \ntime.\n  Here are a few examples recently: Last December, the F-22, a very \nsophisticated fighter aircraft, was supposed to start its low-rate \ninitial production; but this decision was delayed because there was \ndissatisfaction with its progress, with whether or not it was living up \nto its capabilities. We mandated tests because we were unsatisfied with \nthe deployment schedule and its ability to be brought to the forces in \nthe field. That was done much further along the line than the place we \nare in developing the national missile defense. In many respects, we \nare doing the same thing with the Joint Strike Fighter this year.\n  So it is not unusual to tell the Department of Defense, or to look \nover the Secretary's shoulder and say, even though you might be doing \nit, we want to make sure you are doing it, we want to make sure that \nthey are looking specifically at the countermeasures. We want to know \nmore specifically, when he talks about the capacity of this system to \ngrow, will it grow up to all the countermeasures listed by the \nIntelligence Committee? Will it go from C-1 to C-2? We are not sure \nwhether it will reach that ultimate test of countermeasures. This is a \nvaluable role we must play.\n  There is another aspect to this whole debate, which I think should be \nnoted. It is a very difficult thing and, in some respects, an \nintellectual challenge. For years and years, decades and decades, we \nhave relied upon deterrence policy----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes of the Senator have expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield an additional 1 minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. I will wrap up quickly.\n  We have relied upon deterrence policy. At the heart of deterrence \npolicy is the notion that the other side is rational, and they will \ncalculate the damage you can do them just as you can calculate the \ndamage that is done by them.\n  What has changed now? I would say that intellectually why we are even \nhaving this debate is we have abandoned this concept of rationality. We \ndon't think North Korea is rational. Again, that is an assumption that \nwe have to look at closely as we look at some of these other things. In \nsome respects, if they are totally irrational, then maybe there is a \nlittle hope of deterring them from doing anything, even with the \nnational missile defense. But that is the difference. That is why my \ncolleague from Massachusetts said we used to think about intentions, \nand now we don't. We made an intellectual decision we weren't going to \nlook at that because we concluded they were irrational. I suggest that \nas we pursue this debate, we should look seriously at whether or not \nthat assumption is valid.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. How \nmuch time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and a half minutes remain.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Unless the Senator from Virginia wants to seek time, I \nwill conclude at this point, as briefly as possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. I welcome that. We have had a good debate. Having said \nthat, let's wrap it up and pay our respects to the Presiding Officer \nand the staff who have all indulged us for this period of time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, why do we test? We test so we can justify \nthe taxpayers of America the expenditure of their hard-earned money in \nthe defense of our country, to make certain that the expenditure is \nmade in a way that we can stand and be proud of it.\n  Secondly, we test to make sure that whatever we are building in the \ndefense of this country will work. That is all this amendment is about. \nIt is to make certain if the national missile defense is to go forward \nand to provide assurance to American families not only now but for \nyears to come, it is because we have a missile defense system that will \nwork.\n  We have heard from a variety of different experts that the question \nof countermeasures is a critically important question. In the language \nof this amendment, we are asking the Secretary of Defense to come \nforward and give us guidance as to what the state of countermeasures \nmight be in the world and to judge whether or not our missile defense \nsystem can deal with those countermeasures and whether we are testing \nto make certain that that happens. That is the bottom line.\n  The response from the Senator from Virginia, and virtually every \nSenator who has spoken, is the understanding that what we are asking \nfor in this amendment is reasonably calculated to ensure that any \nmissile defense system, in fact, gives us a real sense of security and \nnot a false sense of security.\n  This amendment is not intended to derail the national missile defense \nsystem. It is intended to make certain that the system, if America \ncomes to rely on it for national defense, actually works.\n  In years gone by, when we hurried along the testing process, we have \nhad some sorry results. The B-1 bomber went into production in the late \n1970s and wasn't fully integrated into flying units for 24 years. There \nwere major problems with avionics, the engines,\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\nand the defensive stealth configuration that costs literally hundreds \nof millions of dollars. Adequate testing did not take place before \nmoney was spent on a system that was not capable of meeting the need of \nour national defense. Let us not allow that to happen when it comes to \nsomething as critical as our national missile defense system.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his patience this evening. I \nhope he believes, as I do, that this valuable debate will not only help \nthe Senate but the country on this very important issue in a much more \ncomplete fashion. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I daresay the final conference \nreport in the Armed Services bill will draw on this amendment for \ncertain portions of the law that we will write.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also thank the chairman for making \nthis a very important substantive debate. I thank the ranking minority \nmember.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if my colleagues might consider reviewing their \nposition on the Cochran bill, while there may be other opportunities to \nexpress affirmation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia. We will.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe the regular order would provide \nthat we have concluded the matters in the unanimous consent agreement \nas it relates to this bill. We can wrap up for the night on this bill. \nI will yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might, I don't believe I asked for \nthe yeas and nays on the amendment. I do so now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I believe the proposed amendment on \ntesting of our National Missile defense system is overly broad, \nunnecessary, and counterproductive.\n  The amendment asks that we direct the Defense Department to conduct \ntesting of our National Missile Defense system against--and I quote--\n``any countermeasures (including decoys) that . . . are likely, or at \nleast realistically possible, to be used against the system.'' And it \ndefines a countermeasure as ``any deliberate action taken by a country \nwith long-range ballistic missiles to defeat or otherwise counter a \nUnited States National Missile Defense system.'' With language as broad \nas this, there is virtually no bound to what we would be directing the \nBallistic Missile Defense Organization, as a matter of law, to go off \nand test against. I don't believe it is useful to legislate such broad \nand open-ended requirements.\n  Nor is it necessary. There is already a process in place to ensure \nthat the National Missile Defense system--like every other weapon \nsystem we have--is properly tested against the likely threats if faces, \nincluding potential countermeasures. Our acquisition system has a \nmethodical process by which requirements for any new weapon system are \nstudied and approved, and National Missile Defense is no different. \nMoreover, there is an independent operational test and evaluation \norganization in the Defense Department as a second layer of oversight \nto make sure new systems are adequately tested. With those processes in \nplace, there is no need for a third layer of requirements, levied in an \noverly broad statute, to deal with some vague technical notions that \nsomeone somewhere has imagined.\n  There are possible countermeasures to every weapon and those are \nconsidered as a matter of course in the design and testing of every \nsystem. We don't have legislation directing realistic operational \ntesting against any possible countermeasures for the F-22, for example, \nand I see no reason to single out this particular weapon system for \nsuch treatment.\n  Most of the recent talk about countermeasures to the NMD system has \nbeen generated by wild accusations from some college professors who \nhave long opposed missile defenses of any sort. They would have us \nbelieve that countermeasures can become reality for \neven technologically unsophisticated nations simply because they can be \nimagined. But in the real world, in which ideas have to be translated \nto design, and design to hardware, and the hardware tested, the reality \nis far different.\n\n  Those who are building our missile defense system understand this and \nthat is why they have built in to that system the capability to deal \nwith countermeasures as they evolve. The pending amendment would direct \na reconvening of the Welsh Commission to examine this issue, but the \nfact is that General Welsh and his team have already looked at this \nissue. This is what he told the Senate just a couple weeks ago:\n\n       There is very significant potential designed into the C-1 \n     [initial NMD] system to grow to beyond the capability to deal \n     with those countermeasures. The problem with estimates as to \n     what people can give was that--the Chinese will share it, the \n     Russians will share it--it's one thing to share technology, \n     it's something else to incorporate it into your system. And, \n     so unless they share an all-out system ready to launch, there \n     is still a very significant technical challenge to \n     integrating somebody else's countermeasure technology into \n     your offensive weapons system.\n\n  Those who believe it will be easy for rogue states to incorporate \ncountermeasures into their long-range ballistic missiles should \nconsider what happened last Friday night in the test of the National \nMissile Defense system. A Minuteman target missile was launched from \nVandenberg Air force Base carrying a dummy warhead and a balloon decoy. \nNo nation except perhaps Russia has more experience than the United \nStates with technically sophisticated countermeasures, and those who \nsay such measures will be easy for rogue states to deploy derided this \nballoon decoy as laughably simple. Well, the decoy didn't deploy \nproperly. As Undersecretary of Defense Jacques Gansler noted following \nthe test, ``Others have said how easy it is to put up decoys, by the \nway. This is the proof that one decoy we were trying to put up didn't \ngo up.''\n  Mr. President, countermeasures will eventually challenge the National \nMissile Defense system, just as they have challenged every other \nweapons system that has ever been deployed. But they aren't anywhere \nnear as easy to perfect as opponents of missile defense would have us \nbelieve, and we already have adequate measures in place to ensure the \nNational Missile Defense system is adequately designed and tested to \naccount for potential countermeasures. This legislation is vague, \noverly broad, and unnecessary. I urge Senators to vote against it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment being \noffered by my colleague, Senator Durbin, calling for effective testing \nof the National Missile Defense (NMD) program now under development by \nthe Department of Defense.\n  When the President signed H.R. 4, the National Missile Defense Act of \n1999, into law a year ago, he made the statement that ``any NMD system \nwe deploy must be operationally effective, cost-effective, and enhance \nour security.'' The key word in the President's statement, Mr. \nPresident, is ``effective.'' In other words, before we decide to move \nahead with the NMD program, among other important considerations, we \nmust be confident that the system will be an ``effective'' one.\n  Last year, when we debated this matter in the Senate, I spoke with my \ncolleague, Senator Cochran, who agreed with me that we shouldn't buy \nthe system until we know that it will work. It's common sense, of \ncourse, to hold back on a decision to purchase something until we know \nthat it will work as advertised. We know that as private consumers. The \nsame is true for the government as a consumer.\n  Indeed, that is the policy of the Department of Defense (DoD) with \nrespect to its purchase of ALL major weapon systems. DoD's policy \ninstruction governing acquisition of all major weapon systems, DoD \nDirective 5000.1, contains a number of provisions intended to ensure \nthat the customer, DoD as well as the nation as a whole, will get what \nwe pay for.\n  The bottom line for the Department of Defense regarding \n``effectiveness'' is whether a weapon system is tested successfully in \nrealistic operating situations. The DoD instruction states that \n``before purchasing a weapon system from the production line, the \nDirector of Operational Test and Evaluation must report to the \nSecretary of Defense that the system is operationally effective and \nsuitable for use in combat.'' That should be true for missile\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\ninterceptors as well as for conventional guns, tanks, and airplanes.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has on many occasions expressed its \ncommitment to the taxpayer that the billions spent on weapons will \nprovide the nation with the real military capability we may need. The \nprovision of DoD Instruction 5000.1 that I have cited is one such \nexample. Another was legislation enacted during the 1980's requiring \nwarranties on all major weapon systems and their components.\n  We also, know, Mr. President, that when we fail to require that a \nsystem meet operational standards, we pay a heavy price. In the early \n1980's, the Congress appropriated over $20 billion dollars to purchase \n100 B-1B bombers. The problem was that we had never tested them. The B-\n1B looked like the B-1A, but in fact was a far different weapon. It \nneeded to be tested. We didn't do it and went ahead with the purchase. \nMr. President, we now know the unfortunate history of that purchase. It \nwasn't until recently that the DoD used the B-1B in combat, and even \nthen under very special operational circumstances. In the intervening \ndecade and a half, the Air Force chose other ways to get the job done. \nI'm convinced that, in part, it was because the Air Force knew that the \nB-1B would not have been capable of getting the job done. There are \nother expensive examples I could use to illustrate the price we've paid \nfor inadequate testing. Design flaws in the C-5 and F-18 have ended up \ncosting the taxpayer a bundle. I'm sure you've recently read the news \nreports about flaws in the protective suits for our troops to use in a \nchemical or biological warfare environment. They weren't adequately \ntested either.\n  The amendment Senator Durbin is sponsoring today seeks simply to \naffirm Congressional commitment to the taxpayer, to the men and women \nin uniform who must operate our weapons, and to the nation that must \ndepend on it for our defense. I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment \nthat would require that the NMD system be tested against possible \ncountermeasures that are likely, or at least realistically possible, to \nbe used to accompany attacking warheads that potential enemies could \nlaunch against us. The amendment calls for the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Organization (BMDO) to plan ground and flight tests to address \nthose threats, to seek funds to support what's needed to meet them, and \nto report annually on the status and progress of the NMD program \nregarding countermeasures. In short, Mr. President, the amendment \nproposes concrete actions to ensure that we know the exact nature of \nthe threat, that we plan appropriate technical responses, and that we \ntest adequately to make sure that those responses work.\n\n  We are all aware of the recent outcome of the latest NMD flight test, \nIFT-5. In that test, a developmental test, the kill vehicle failed to \nseparate from its booster to engage the incoming target warhead. Mr. \nPresident, this was a test designed and conducted under very \ncontrolled, hardly realistic, conditions. It was a test in which all \nthe pieces of the complex NMD system were given special capabilities to \ncarry out their job in a controlled, experimental environment.\n  I think we can all agree that it's appropriate to walk before we run. \nIn ``walking'' through this test, IFT-5, we have discovered once again \nhow difficult it is to ``hit a bullet with a bullet'' even though we \nthink we know how each piece of the system will function. I'd like to \nemphasize, Mr. President, that this was not an operational test under \nrealistic conditions that DoD requires for every other major weapon \nsystem before it decides to go ahead and buy it. This was a controlled, \nlaboratory test in which one of the pieces we thought we know most \nabout failed.\n  I believe that although the NMD test program to date indicates that \nwe are developing some amazing capabilities, we are a very long way \nfrom being confident that the NMD system as a whole will work. Indeed, \nin order for an NMD test to be truly realistic, there are a whole host \nof variables that must differ significantly from the conditions that \nwere present during the IFT-5 test. In order to be more realistic, for \nexample, future tests should reorient the basic geographic direction of \nthe test from West to East rather than East to West. The flight test \nenvelope would have to be greatly enlarged. Various types of \ncountermeasures, the subject of the amendment, should be used. Actual \nmilitary personnel who would operate the system should be at the \ncontrols. Information from the warning system should reflect likely \nwarning times. We are a very long way from realistic testing the NMD \nsystem in those regards and a number of others. This amendment \naddresses only one of those variables, albeit a very important one. \nAdopting this amendment will provide us with critical information about \nthe feasibility of the NMD system to get the job done. Committing \nourselves to procuring and deploying the NMD system until we know the \nanswers to questions regarding key operational capabilities would be \npremature and ill-advised.\n  There are other critical factors that will play important and \nnecessary roles in determining whether the President will commit the \nnation to deploying NMD. Surely the nature of the threat must be \nassessed and reassessed to make sure that this program is warranted. \nSurely the possible responses of our allies and potential adversaries \nwill play an important part in the President's calculation. At the end \nof the day, the President will have determined whether the nation is \nmore or less secure as a result of deciding to deploy the NMD system.\n  In the meantime, as responsible stewards for public expenditures, it \nbehooves us to take all measures necessary to ensure that the billions \nwe are spending for NMD are giving the taxpayer real dividends. This \namendment is an important means to make that happen. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support realistic testing before committing the nation to \nprocurement and deployment of NMD. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this discussion of a national missile \ndefense system comes at a timely moment. As we struggle to complete \naction on our thirteen appropriations bills that fund the Federal \nGovernment, we are confronted with many unmet needs and the desire to \nreduce the amount the Federal Government takes from the American \ntaxpayers' hard earned income. The budget agreement locks in spending \nlimits and requires a balanced budget, thereby preventing us from \nincreasing spending on missile defense without cutting other programs. \nThe debate over how much to spend in research on a national missile \ndefense (NMD) system and whether it is time to make a decision on \ndeployment strongly effects both the government's ability to meet the \nneeds of Americans and the likelihood that we will be able to return \nmoney to the taxpayers of this country. The costs of such a system and \nthe choices it would force us to make must be carefully weighed against \nthe benefit of an NMD system, the chances that it would work, and the \neffect that deployment would have on the arms control agenda of the \nUnited States.\n  The decision on how much to spend on an NMD research program cannot \nbe made without considering these questions. We must ask how much we \ncan afford to spend on defense. I argue that national security also has \na social component: affordable health care for all Americans, better \njob opportunities, a strong education system and economic security for \nAmerica's seniors are all facets of a strong America. Without these \nthings, military technology cannot protect America from the real \nthreats against us.\n  I have long supported a reasonable program of research and testing of \nanti-ballistic missile technologies, while opposing efforts to throw \nhuge increases at the program. I hope that thoughtful research will \nlead to some technological breakthroughs on ways to counter ballistic \nmissiles. Their proliferation, especially in the hands of irresponsible \nleaders such as North Korea's Kim Jong Il, requires that we actively \ninvestigate possible defenses. We cannot ignore the emergence of new \nnuclear threats to the United States.\n  A premature decision to deploy an inadequately tested national \nmissile defense system would also be a risk to national security. We \ncannot afford to spend huge amounts of money on a system we are not \ncertain would work, or on a system that might provoke the very reaction \nfrom rogue states that we are ultimately trying to prevent. I\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\nam a strong believer in strengthening international non-proliferation \nregimes such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty, which I am very disappointed the Senate has failed to \nratify. Successful non-proliferation efforts are worth every penny! The \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty has also served us well for many years, \nand we must be careful to not throw out a valuable asset in our rush to \njump on the newest technology.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Durbin's amendment to add \nsome important requirements to any national missile defense testing \nregime. This amendment would require realistic testing of an NMD system \nagainst the countermeasures that might be deployed against it. Senator \nDurbin's amendment would help ensure that if we move to consider \ndeployment of an NMD system, we would have a realistic assessment of \nthat system's expected performance. Any evaluation of the effectiveness \nof an NMD system must consider not only the capabilities of the system \nitself, but its ability to survive what we expect might be thrown up to \ndefeat it. Without this information, it would be hard to judge the true \nutility of such a system, and easy to overestimate its performance.\n  This past Friday's failed test of a space intercept brings into \nsharper focus the issue of claims and performance of an NMD system. \nWithout realistic tests proving the expectations of researchers, we can \nnever be sure that laboratory results can be duplicated in practice. It \nmight be tempting to rush to deploy a system that appeared to provide \nsignificant protection for the American people. Passage of this \namendment would help ensure that any system have a reasonable chance of \nworking before it is considered for deployment.\n  I continue to believe that our greatest vulnerability to nuclear \nattack is not from a nuclear bomb delivered by an intercontinental \nballistic missile, but rather from a nuclear devise slipped into the \ncountry in some much less visible way, like hidden in some cargo coming \ninto a major U.S. seaport. Committing many billions of dollars to \ndeploy the proposed defense systems would do nothing to protect us \nagainst this very real threat. At this time, it would be much more \nproductive to invest these funds in stopping the spread of nuclear \ntechnologies and in using other means to counter terrorist \norganizations and other rogue elements.\n  Personally, I believe that the politics of missile defense have \ngotten way out ahead of the science of missile defense. This amendment \nwould help restore the proper order of these concepts. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Durbin amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Durbin amendment to the fiscal year \n2001 Defense authorization bill is a common sense proposal that will \nensure that a National Missile Defense system is properly tested before \nit becomes operational.\n  President Clinton is expected to make a decision in the next few \nmonths on whether or not to begin the deployment of a National Missile \nDefense system. He has said that the decision will be based on four \ncriteria: the readiness of the technology, the impact on arms control \nand our relations with Russia, the cost of the system, and the threat. \nBased on these criteria, I do not believe that a decision to deploy \nshould be made at this time.\n  This amendment deals with just one of these criteria, the readiness \nof the technology. It says that the National Missile Defense system \nshould be tested against realistic decoys and other counter-measures \nbefore it becomes operational. Initial operating capability is now \nscheduled for 2005.\n  Let me be clear, this amendment would not prevent a deployment \ndecision this year, nor would it delay the deployment of the system.\n  Mr. President, this is no different from school. if you cannot pass \nthe exams, you cannot graduate. In this case, if NMD cannot pass a test \nagainst realistic counter-measures, it will not be made operational. \nThere will be no social promotion of missile defense. The strategic \nimplications of this system are too great. We do not want to make a \nsystem operational that we are not sure will work against an incoming \nwarhead.\n  Now the opponents of this legislation might say: Senator Boxer, this \namendment is unnecessary. The U.S. would never make a missile defense \nsystem operational that wouldn't work.\n  Well, in 1969 the U.S. made a decision to deploy the Safeguard \nmissile defense system to defend U.S. missile against incoming Soviet \nmissiles. This system would have used Spartan missiles armed with small \nnuclear warheads to intercept incoming ICBMs.\n  On October 1, 1975, after spending $6 billion (over $20 billion in \ntoday's dollars), the first ABM site became operational at Nekoma, \nNorth Dakota. Five months later the project was terminated.\n  Why was the project terminated? Because it didn't work. There were at \nleast two major problems with the Safeguard system. First, its radars \nwere vulnerable to destruction by Soviet missiles. Destruction of these \nradar systems would blind the defensive system. Second it was found \nthat when the nuclear warheads on defending Spartan missiles were \ndetonated, these explosions themselves would also blind the radar \nsystems. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to know that it is \nimportant for the system to work before it is made operational.\n  So why is the Senator from Illinois concerned about countermeasures? \nA September 1999 National Intelligence Estimate warned that emerging \nmissile states would use counter-measures.\n  Let me quote from the unclassified version of the report:\n\n       Many countries, such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq would \n     rely initially on readily available technology--including \n     separating warheads, spin-stabilized warheads, warhead \n     reorientation, radar absorbing material, booster \n     fragmentation, low power jammers, chaff, and simple balloon \n     decoys.\n\n  It goes on to say that ``Russia and China each have developed \nnumerous counter-measures and probably are willing to sell the \nrequisite technology.''\n  Many of our best scientists have said that the planned NMD system \nwould be defeated by counter-measures. An April 2000 report released \njointly by the Union of Concerned Scientists and MIT Security Studies \nProgram found that ``the current testing program is not capable of \nassessing the system's effectiveness against a realistic attack.''\n  So Mr. President, this is an important amendment. It would ensure \nthat our NMD system is tested against realistic counter-measures and \nrequire detailed reports from the Secretary of Defense and the \nIndependent Review Panel which is headed by retired Air Force General \nLarry Welch.\n  I congratulate my friend, Senator Durbin, for offering this important \namendment and I urge the Senate to adopt it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to extend my personal gratitude to \nthe Armed Services Committee Chairman and the Ranking Member, as well \nas to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Readiness \nfor their consideration of my recommended language at Sec. 361 of this \nbill. This provision requires the Secretary of Defense to report on the \nconsequences of high OPTEMPO on military aviation and ground equipment. \nLet me explain why I applaud this provision. My particular interest is \nsomewhat more focused on aviation assets.\n  Quite simply, we need to know the adverse effects that the worldwide \ncontingency operations engaged in by our military high-performance \naircraft are having on the integrity of the aircraft's frame, engines \nand other components.\n  I raise this issue, Mr. President, because my state proudly hosts the \nOgden Air Logistics Center at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. Just recently, \na team of depot technicians at Hill discovered that the mechanical \nassembly designed to brake or halt the rise and fall of the stabilizer \non the Air Force KC-135 tanker had been prematurely wearing out because \nof a surge of KC-135 flight activity, much of it related to the frantic \ndeployment schedules that these aircrews are tied to.\n  The shortage of replacement parts for the stabilizer braking system \nforced the Air Force to come up with a methodology to refurbish the old \npart. There had never been a refurbishment of the braking assembly \nbefore this time.\n  This is an important fact because the engineering design missed a \ncritical step in the refurbishment process designed to heat out \nhydrogen that\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\nrisked getting into microscopic fissures in the brake ratchet. This \nwould have eventually embrittled the system, causing the stabilizer to \nfail. It would have meant with near certainty that we would have lost \naircraft in midair flight as well as some aircrew lives.\n  The Secretary of the Air Force, Whitten Peters, has commended the \ndepot technicians for their astute recommendations to the Air Force \nMateriel Command to ground the KC-135 fleet; this was done, and I am \nconvinced that lives were saved.\n  But I am no less convinced that we need better visibility over the \nrapidly aging aircraft airframes and other parts are suffering from the \nnear-frenetic flying schedules and deployments that they and their \ncrews are committed to. Put more directly: we cannot and must not push \nthese brave aircrews into harm's way in aircraft that are even remotely \nvulnerable to critical component failures.\n  Mr. President, my concern extends to all tactical and strategic, as \nwell as support and service support aviation assets used in these \ncontingency and peacekeeping operations by the Navy, Marine Corps, and \nthe Air Force. The provision asks for a study of the effects of these \ndeployments on all such assets. Wisely, the Committee has added Army \naviation since its predominately rotary wing--or helicopter--operations \nwarrant inclusion in the scope of this assessment.\n  If one looks at the Air Force commitments, which have carried the \nbulk of many of the contingency operations, the statistics are as \nstaggering as they are telling: 18,400 sorties over Iraq; 73 percent of \nthe air assets patrolling the Northern watch no-fly zone which produced \n75 percent of the total number of sorties in that region. In the \nSouthern Watch no-fly zone, the Air Force also provided 35 percent of \nthe total air assets and produced 68 percent of the sorties. But I \ndon't want to ignore the Navy with its carrier-based aircraft that \nundergo take-off and, especially, landing procedures that create \nunimaginably harsh stresses on aircraft. Many members of this body have \nwitnessed carrier operations and know precisely what I am talking \nabout. Some of our colleagues, like my good friends John McCain and Tom \nHarkin, are even former Navy carrier pilots.\n  The Secretary of Defense has tried to deal with this issue. And we \nhave tried to help him in the past year. Secretary Bill Cohen cited in \nhis report to Congress this February that aging systems, spot spare \nparts shortages, and high OPTEMPO [high operating tempo] are placing \nincreased pressure on materiel readiness.'' The Secretary has testified \nto his ``particular concern'' for ``negative readiness trends in \nmission capable rates for aircraft.'' Last year, Congress provided DOD \nwith $1.8 billion in Kosovo emergency supplemental funding to meet the \nmost urgent demands.\n  Yet, our equipment is aging. The average age of Air Force aircraft is \nnow 20 years old. Our state of art air-to-ground mission aircraft, the \nF-16, has a technology base older than most of its pilots, some of whom \nare flying F-16 aircraft that have been in service longer than they \nhave been alive! The problems of corrosion, fatigue and even parts \nobsolescence are rampant. I spend much time at Hill Air Force Base in \nmy state of Utah. There are certain critical components that are still \ntied to vacuum tube technology. Imagine that! How many of us still \nlisten to vacuum tube radios; some of our younger staff members may not \neven know what they are! Some of our top-of-the-line tactical fighter \naircraft use gyroscopes--which are absolutely critical to positional \naccuracy--that are several generations old. It bothers me greatly to \nhear people complain about ``gold-plated'' military aircraft. I would \ninvite any of them to join me in a tour of the Ogden, Utah, depot. When \nthey see the condition of components from our best tactical fighters \nbeing serviced, I suspect they would better understand the real meaning \nof courage.\n  But let me conclude with a word about the most important resource in \nthis equation: people. We have reduced our forces by 30 percent and \nincreased deployments by nearly 400 percent. The effect is exactly what \nyou would expect. Recently, the Marine Corps' Commandant and the Army \nChief of Staff announced that deployments of their aviation and ground \nequipment are now 16 times the rate during the Cold War. Unprecedented \npilot losses, reaching a 33 percent level in the Navy, 15 percent in \nthe Air Force and 21 percent in the Marine Corps. But the most critical \nlosses are found among the highly specialized aircraft service \ntechnicians. Specialists in electronic components, air traffic control, \narmaments and munitions, and other technical specialties, at all levels \nof service, short-term, mid-term and long-term, are leaving in \nunprecedented numbers. Even the Air Force's valiant Expeditionary Air \nForce concept, which organizes a highly mobile slice of the Air Force \ninto 10 task forces, called ``Air Expeditionary Forces,'' faces \ntechnical enlisted skill shortages which still burden the fewer and \nfewer technicians who remain on active duty, according to a General \nAccounting Office study on military personnel released in early March \n2000.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for listening to this \nlong presentation regarding my concerns for the state of our military \naircraft and the people who fly and service them. I know that most will \njoin with me and the committee in calling for a full review of the \nconsequences of the unprecedented peacetime demands being made on our \npeople and their equipment.\n\n\n                    National Guard ChalleNGe Program\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am seriously concerned about Section 910 \nof S. 2549, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2001.\n  Section 910 would effect the transfer of responsibility for the \nNational Guard Youth ChalleNGe program from the Chief of the National \nGuard Bureau to the Secretary of Defense and would amend the limitation \non federal funding for the National Guard Challenge program to limit \nonly Department of Defense funding. This language removes the National \nGuard Bureau from the ``chain of command'' and from its statutory role \nas the channel of communication between the federal government and the \nstates (10 U.S.C. Sec. 10501).\n  Youth ChalleNGe exists in 25 states and is a federal/state \npartnership program. While there is partial federal funding (which is \ncapped by law at $62.5 million per year), the ChalleNGe staff members \nare state employees who meet state teacher and counselor certification \nrequirements. All legally binding cooperative agreements currently in \nplace are between the Governors and the Chief, National Guard Bureau.\n  ChalleNGe is a highly successful program that takes at-risk youths \nand gives them the opportunity to turn their lives around and become \nproductive members of their communities. Since the program was \nestablished, with my assistance in 1991, more than 4,500 young \nAmericans have graduated. Of this number, more than 66% have earned \ntheir GED or high school diploma; more than 12% entered the military, \nand more than 16% enrolled in college.\n  ChalleNGe is a program in demand by the states. If it were not for \nthe cap on spending, more states would have a ChalleNGe program. \nTransferring authority from the National Guard to the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs could only have a \nnegative impact and upset a program that is operating extremely well \nunder the auspices of the National Guard Bureau. It would add another \nlayer of bureaucracy and require the State National Guard programs to \nrelate through an altogether new ``chain of command'' for the Youth \nChalleNGe program, while maintaining the existing ``chain of command'' \nfor all other National Guard activities.\n  On June 16th of this year, I participated in the graduation ceremony \nof the cadets of the Mountaineer ChalleNGe program at Camp Dawson, West \nVirginia. In all my years of delivering commencement speeches and high \nschool diplomas, I can say without reservation that this was the most \nimpressive group of students that I have ever encountered. The \ngraduates sat at full attention throughout the event, with obvious \npride in their hard-earned achievements and serious commitment to a \nfuture on the right path. Such transformation can not be achieved by \nmere bootcamp exercises alone. It takes a tough-love approach with \ncaring and compassionate instructors who want to see the lives of these \ntroubled youth turned around forever. The National Guard offers these \nyoung people\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\nthe very virtues--leadership, followership, community service, job \nskills, health and nutrition, and physical education--that are in \nkeeping with the Guard's tradition of adding value to America and it \ncertainly showed in West Virginia.\n  Let us not punish this fine organization which is doing an \nexceptional job in helping youth in-need.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is my understanding that the committee report language \nmay not fully and adequately explain the intent of the Committee. The \nCommittee's intent is to reaffirm the role of the Secretary of Defense \nto establish policy for and oversee the operation of DOD programs. I \nintend to see that the conference report language adequately expresses \nthe view that the National Guard is to continue to administer the Youth \nChalleNGe program under the oversight and direction of the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Chairman has a workable solution. It is not \nthe intent of the Committee that the National Guard should lose its \nability to administer this highly successful program. Rather, the \nintent is that there be adequate policy direction and oversight of the \nYouth ChalleNGe program by the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. BYRD. I had intended to offer an amendment to clarify this issue. \nHowever, I believe that the comments of the distinguished Chairman and \nRanking Minority Member of the Armed Services Committee have helped \nclear up this matter. I hope the conference report will further clarify \nthe matter.\n\n\n                conveyance authority for utility systems\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am very concerned about a provision \ncontained in H.R. 4205, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2001, regarding the conveyance authority for utility \nsystems at U.S. military installations. The House proposes to change \nexisting law in a manner that jeopardizes the ability of a municipal \nutility in Washington, Tacoma Power, to participate in the competitive \nselection process and acquire Fort Lewis' electric utility system. Fort \nLewis is Washington's major Army base. I oppose changes to DOD's \ncurrent conveyance authority, when that change impedes competition.\n  The Department of Defense is privatizing utility systems at military \nbases throughout the county. Military bases are considered Federal \nenclaves, and therefore are subject to Federal, rather than State, law. \nThe language contained in H.R. 4205 dramatically weakens existing \nFederal law by subjecting military bases to State laws, regulations, \nrulings and orders in the competitive bid process of their utility \nsystems. This would have a negative impact on DOD utility privatization \nefforts in my state of Washington. The reason for this is that utility \nservice territories in Washington are established by service area \nagreements--contracts--rather than by State decree. Eliminating the \nFederal law that applies on military bases would create a host of legal \nquestions, the effect of which is to foster litigation and undercut the \nDOD privatization process in Washington.\n  Because I am not a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and \nwould therefore not be privy to Conference Committee negotiations, I \nrespectfully request your assistance in assuring that whatever utility \nlanguage is included in the FY01 Defense Authorization bill properly \ntakes into account the unique circumstances of Washington.\n  Mr. WARNER. I share the Senator's concerns regarding the impact the \nHouse language might have on competition, and will work with you to \nensure that Washington state's issues are addressed during the \nconference. Any suggestions you may have on this matter would be most \nwelcome.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator in advance for your commitment to \nthis effort. I look forward the working with you in the coming weeks to \nsee that this issue is resolved in a favorable manner.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this past year, the men and women of the \nArmed Forces proved, once again, the value of a strong and ready \nmilitary. Since the end of the Cold War, our Armed Forces have been \nbusier, and have conducted a greater variety of missions around the \nworld, than at any other time during our nation's history, short of \nwar.\n  Our forces ended Serb aggression in Kosovo, brought peace to East \nTimor, and aided earthquake victims in Turkey. At this moment, American \nservice men and women are monitoring the demilitarized zone in Korea, \nenforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq, patrolling the Arabian Gulf for \noil smugglers, and assisting in the battle against drugs in Central and \nSouth America. These activities are in addition to the daily operations \nthey conduct at home and with our allies overseas to maintain the \nreadiness of our forces.\n  Our National Guard and Reserve members continue as equal partners in \ncarrying out our national security and national military strategies. \nLast May, in the span of only one week, C-5 transport aircraft from the \n439th Airlift Wing at Westover Air Reserve Base in Massachusetts \ncarried helicopters and equipment to Trinidad-Tobago to aid in the war \nagainst drugs, flew the Navy's new mini-submarine to Hawaii, an \nunprecedented accomplishment and a tribute to their ingenuity and \nresourcefulness, airlifted Marines to Greece, carried supplies to \nEurope, and continued their very important training at home.\n  Last week, over a hundred citizen-soldiers from Bravo Company of the \n368th Engineer Combat Battalion left their homes in Attleboro, \nMassachusetts for duty in Kosovo.\n  These are just a few examples of what Guard and Reserve members from \nevery state, do for us each day around the world.\n  We ask the men and women of our Armed Forces to prepare for and \nrespond to every contingency, from supporting humanitarian relief \nefforts, peacekeeping, and enforcing United Nations sanctions, to \nfighting a full-scale Major Theater War. A quarter million of our \nservice members are deployed around the world to deter aggression, keep \nthe peace, promote democracy, and foster goodwill and cooperation with \nour allies, and even with our potential adversaries.\n  All of our men and women in uniform put our nation's interests above \ntheir own. When called upon, they risk their lives for our freedom. As \na nation, we often take this sacrifice for granted, until we are \nreminded of it again by tragic events such as the April training \naccident in Arizona, where 19 Marines lost their lives in the line of \nduty. These Marines paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and \nit was fitting for the Senate to honor them with a resolution. I \ncommend my colleague Senator Snowe for her leadership on that \nresolution.\n  More recently, this week, two Arizona Army Guardsmen lost their lives \nwhen their Apache helicopter crashed in a night training exercise. Two \nNavy pilots were killed in a training accident in Maryland. The cost of \ntraining in the name of peace and security is high.\n  One of Congress' most important duties is to make sure that our Armed \nForces are able to meet the many challenges of an increasingly unstable \ninternational environment. Both the Director of Central Intelligence \nand the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency testified before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee that, more than at any other time \nin the nation's history, we are at risk of ``substantial surprise'' by \nadversaries. Their views are supported by the worldwide expansion of \ninformation technology, the proliferation of dual-use technology, and \nthe fact that the expertise to develop weapons of mass destruction is \navailable and for hire on the open market.\n  The growing resentment by potential adversaries of our status as the \nlast superpower makes us susceptible to hostile acts ranging from \ncomputer attacks to chemical or biological terrorism. Our military must \nbe equipped to deter this aggression and, if necessary, counter it. The \nFY 2001 National Defense Authorization Bill takes a positive step \ntoward doing so.\n\n  The many activities which our forces have undertaken and maintained \nin the past decade, in spite of reduced resources, has taken a toll on \nour people, their equipment, and readiness. This bill continues the \nincreases in defense spending needed to reverse this trend that the \nPresident and Congress began last year. At $310 billion, this bill \nrepresents real growth, and a necessary investment in the future of the \nnation's security. At the heart of our armed forces are the soldiers, \nsailors,\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\nairmen and Marines who took the oath of office to support and defend \nthe Constitution against all of our enemies, foreign and domestic. \nClearly, without them, we could not preserve our freedom. Attracting \nyoung men and women to serve, and retaining them in an all-volunteer \nforce, is more challenging than ever. Last year, Congress authorized \nthe largest pay raise in nearly two decades, reformed the pay table, \nand restored the 50% retirement benefit. This year, we continue these \nefforts to support our service members and their families, by granting \na 3.7 percent pay raise, which is one-half percent above inflation. We \nalso provide for the gradual reduction to zero--over five years --of \nout-of-pocket housing expenses for service members living off base, and \nwe provide better military health care for family members. The bill \nalso directs the implementation of the Thrift Savings Plan that \nCongress authorized last year. The welfare of the men and women of our \narmed forces is rightly at the center of this year's Defense \nAuthorization Bill.\n  The bill also takes a bold and necessary step to honoring the promise \nof lifetime health care for military retirees. The Armed Services \nCommittee heeded the needs of our military retirees, and addressed \ntheir number one priority--the cost of prescription drugs. The Defense \nAuthorization Bill expands the Base Realignment and Closure pharmacy \nbenefit--already available to 450,000 retirees--to the entire 1.4 \nmillion Medicare-eligible military retiree community. This benefit lets \nall men and women in uniform know that we care about their service, and \nthat a career in the military is honorable and worth pursuing. It also \nlets all military retirees know that Congress is listening, cares, and \nis willing to act on their behalf.\n  The bill also continues and expands health care demonstration \nprograms to evaluate how we can best address the health care needs of \nthese retirees. We must complete the evaluation of these programs and \nmove to answer their needs. I am hopeful that soon, we will be able to \ndo more.\n  The bill also enhances efforts to prepare for and respond to other \nthreats. It authorizes five additional Civil Support Teams to a total \nof 32 by the end of FY 2001. The teams will be specially trained and \nequipped to respond to the suspected use of weapons of mass destruction \non American soil. While we hope they will never be needed, we must be \nprepared for any emergency.\n  The bill adds $74 million for programs to protect against chemical \nand biological agents, and it funds the research and development for a \nsecond generation, single-shot anthrax vaccine. The men and women of \nour Armed Forces need this support now.\n  Each service has taken steps to protect the environment, but too \nlittle has been done to detect and deal with the effects of unexploded \nordnance. On the Massachusetts Military Reservation, unexploded \nordnance may be contaminating the soil and groundwater in the area. \nThis situation is unacceptable. If it is not addressed now, it could \ncause irreparable harm to the environment and the people who live \nthere.\n  Unexploded ordnance is a problem in every active and formerly-used \nlive-fire training facility. The bill includes $10 million to develop \nand test new technologies to detect unexploded ordnance and analyze and \nmap the presence of their contaminants, so that they can be more easily \ncleaned up. For too many years, this issue has been ignored. The time \nhas come for the Department of Defense to take on the task of removing \nUXO. This step is essential to ensure the continued operation of \ntraining ranges, which are vital to the continued readiness of our \nforces and the safe reuse of facilities that have been closed.\n\n  Last May, the country felt the effect of a simple computer virus that \ndisabled e-mail systems throughout the world, and cost industry \nbillions of dollars. The ``Love Bug'' virus also reportedly infected \nclassified e-mail systems within the Department of Defense. Last year, \nmore than 22,000 cyber-attacks took place on DOD computer systems--a \n300 percent increase over the previous year. The cyber threat to \nnational security will become more complex and more disruptive in the \nfuture. Our armed forces must be better prepared to deal with this \nthreat and to protect these information systems. The bill adds $77 \nmillion to address this serious and growing threat.\n  In the Seapower Subcommittee, under the leadership of our \ndistinguished chair, Senator Snowe, we heard testimony and continued \nconcern about the Navy's force structure, the shipbuilding rate, and \nthe overall readiness of the fleet. I support the Secretary of the \nNavy's decision to increase R spending for the new land-attack \ndestroyer, DD-21, but I am concerned about the delay in the program, \nthe effect of this delay on fire support requirements of the Marine \nCorps, and its effect on our shipbuilding industrial base.\n  The bill includes $550 million for DD-21 research and development. It \nalso asks the Navy to report to Congress on the feasibility of starting \nDD-21 construction in FY 2004, as originally scheduled, for delivery by \n2009, and the effects of the current delay on the destroyer \nshipbuilding industrial base.\n  To ease the strain on the shipbuilding industrial base, the bill \nauthorizes the extension of the DDG-51 multi-year procurement, approved \nby Congress in 1997, to include procurements through fiscal year 2005. \nThis increase will bring greater near-term health to our destroyer \nshipyards. It could raise the Navy's overall shipbuilding rate to an \nacceptable level of 9 ships for each of those years, and it could save \nalmost $600 million for these ships by avoiding the additional unit \ncost of building them at a smaller rate. This increase benefits the \nNavy, the shipyards, and the shipyard workers, and it is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  I am particularly concerned about one section of the bill that closes \nthe School of the Americas and then reopens it as the Defense Institute \nfor Hemispheric Security Cooperation.\n  Despite the additional human rights curriculum, I am concerned that \nwell-known abuses by the School's graduates have caused irreparable \nharm to its credibility. The School accounts for less than 10 percent \nof the joint education and training programs conducted by the U.S. \nmilitary for Latin American forces, but it has graduated some of the \nmost notorious human rights abusers in our hemisphere.\n  A report of the UN Truth Commission on the School implicated former \ntrainees, including death squad organizer Robert D'Abuisson, in \natrocities committed in El Salvador. During the investigation of the \n1989 murder of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador, it turned out that 19 \nof the 26 people implicated in this case were graduates of the School. \nOther graduates include Leopoldo Galtieri, the former head of the \nArgentine junta, Manuel Noriega, the former dictator of Panama, and \nAugusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile. In September 1996, \nafter years of accusations that the School teaches soldiers how to \ntorture and commit other human rights violations, the Department of \nDefense acknowledged that instructors at the School had taught such \ntechniques.\n  I welcome the Army's recognition that human rights and civil-military \nrelations must be a top priority in our programs with Latin America. \nThe provision in this bill, will close the School and immediately \nreopen it with a new name at the same location, with the same students \nand with much of the same curriculum. But this step will not solve the \nproblems that have plagued this institution.\n  I commend my colleague, Representative Moakley, for his leadership on \nthis issue and his proposal to create a Task Force to assess the type \nof education and training appropriate for the Department of Defense to \nprovide to military personnel of Latin American nations. These issues \ndemand our attention, and we must address them more effectively.\n  In summary, I commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee \nfor their leadership in dealing with the many challenges facing our \nnation on national defense. This bill keeps the faith with the 2.2 \nmillion men and women who make up our active duty, guard, and reserve \nforces.

Mr. President, Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. of \nAllentown, Pennsylvania and an industrial team are developing a unique \noxygen-producing technology based on high-temperature, ion transport \nmembranes (ITM). The technology, known as ITM Oxygen, would be combined \nwith an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) system to produce \noxygen and electric power for the iron/steel; glass, pulp and paper; \nand chemicals and refining industries. The ITM Oxygen project is a \ncornerstone project in the Department of Energy's (DOE) Vision 21 \nprogram and has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of so-\ncalled ``tonnage oxygen'' plants for IGCC systems.\n  Working in partnership with DOE's National Energy Technology \nLaboratory, the first of three phases of this $24.8 million, 50 percent \ncost-shared research program will be completed in September 2001. \nResearch and development conducted as part of phase 1 of the ITM Oxygen \nprogram has addressed the high-risk materials, fabrication and \nengineering issues needed to develop the ITM Oxygen technology to the \nproof-of-concept point. In phase 2, a full-scale ITM Oxygen module will \nbe tested and will be followed by further scale-up to test the \nproduction and integration of multiple full-scale ITM modules. In the \nfinal phase, a pre-commercial demonstration unit will be designed, \nconstructed, integrated with a gas turbine and tested at a suitable \nfield site. At the end of phase 3, it is expected that sufficient \naspects of the technology will have been demonstrated to enable \nindustrial commercialization.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for adding $3.2 million to \nDepartment of Energy's IGCC. I also understand that the House of \nRepresentatives added $3.2 million to the FY01 budget request for IGCC \nwithout designating any one project to receive the increased funding. \nAs part of its FY01 budget, DOE requested $2.2 million as part of its \n$32 million IGCC budget to complete phase 1 of ITM Oxygen.\n  Now I would urge the Department of Energy and the National Energy \nTechnology Laboratory to provide $2 million of the $3.2 million as an \nincrease to the FY01 budget request for IGCC to allow the programs \nsecond phase to begin in FY01. This additional funding would allow the \nITM Oxygen team to have a smooth transition to the program's second \nphase and to level over future years the DOE cost share needed to \nmaintain the program's schedule. This additional funding would also \nallow the ITM Oxygen team to make an early commitment to accelerate \nconstruction of the test facility and the full-scale ITM Oxygen module. \nAccelerating this program makes sound business sense. Now I am \nconfident that DOE and the National Energy laboratory will have the \nfunding to do this. I urge them to work with the ITM Oxygen team and \nmake it happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/12/senate-section/article/S6567-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6567-S6568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS IN THE 106TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am concerned at the continuing lack of \nany real, strong effort to confirm Federal judges this year compared to \nthe situation in the last year of President Bush's term in office with \na Democratic controlled Senate. We confirmed 66 judges--actually \nconfirmed judges and had hearings right through September. Now we have \nvery, very few hearings.\n  While I am glad to see the Judiciary Committee moving forward with a \nfew of the many qualified judicial nominees to fill the scores of \nvacancies that continue to plague our Federal courts, I am disappointed \nthat there were no nominees to the Court of Appeals included at this \nhearing. I have said since the beginning of this year that the American \npeople should measure our progress by our treatment of the many \nqualified nominees, including outstanding women and minorities, to the \nCourt of Appeals around the country. The committee and the Senate are \nfalling well short of the mark.\n  With 21 vacancies on the Federal appellate courts across the country, \nand nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the \nFederal courts system in our appellate courts, our courts of appeals \nare being denied the resources that they need. Their ability to \nadminister justice for the American people is being hurt. There \ncontinue to be multiple vacancies on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, \nTenth and District of Columbia Circuits. The vacancy rate for our \ncourts of appeals is more than 11 percent nationwide--and that does not \nbegin to take into account the additional judgeships requested by the\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\nJudicial Conference to handle their increased workloads. If we added \nthe 11 additional appellate judges being requested, the vacancy rate \nwould be 16 percent. Still, not a single qualified candidate for one of \nthese vacancies on our Federal appellate courts is being heard today.\n  At our first executive business meeting of the year, I noted the \nopportunity we had to make bipartisan strides toward easing the vacancy \ncrisis in our nation's Federal courts. I believed that a confirmation \ntotal of 65 by the end of the year was achievable if we made the \neffort, exhibited the commitment, and did the work that was needed to \nbe done. I urged that we proceed promptly with confirmations of a \nnumber of outstanding nominations to the court of appeals, including \nqualified minority and women candidates. Unfortunately, that is not \nwhat has happened.\n  Just as there was no appellate court nominee included in the April \nconfirmation hearing, there is no appellate court nominee included \ntoday. Indeed, this committee has not reported a nomination to a court \nof appeals vacancy since April 12, and it has reported only two all \nyear. The committee has yet to report the nomination of Allen Snyder to \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, although his hearing was 8 weeks ago; \nthe nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, although her \nhearing was 6 weeks ago; or the nomination of Judge Johnnie Rawlinson, \nalthough her hearing was 4 weeks ago. Left waiting for a hearing are a \nnumber of outstanding nominees, including Judge Helene White for a \njudicial emergency vacancy in the Sixth Circuit; Judge James Wynn, Jr., \nfor a judicial emergency vacancy in the Fourth Circuit; Kathleen McCree \nLewis, another outstanding nominee to the multiple vacancies on the \nSixth Circuit; Enrique Moreno, for a judicial emergency vacancy in the \nFifth Circuit; Elena Kagan, to one of the multiple vacancies on the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit; and Roger L. Gregory, an outstanding \nnominee to another judicial emergency vacancy in the Fourth Circuit.\n  I deeply regret that the Senate adjourned last November and left the \nFifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the Federal administration of \njustice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi without the resources that \nit desperately needs. It is a situation that I wished we had confronted \nby expediting consideration of nominations to that court last year. I \nstill hope that the Senate will consider them this year to help that \ncircuit.\n  I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all \nnominees, including women and minorities. That all of these highly \nqualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. \nThe Senate should join with the President to confirm these well-\nqualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the \nFederal courts around the country.\n  During the committee's business meeting on June 27, Chairman Hatch \nnoted that the Senate has confirmed seven nominees to the courts of \nappeals this year--as if we had done our job and need do no more. What \nhe failed to note is that all seven were holdovers who had been \nnominated in prior years. Five of the seven were reported to the Senate \nfor action before this year, and two had to be reported twice before \nthe Senate would vote on them. The Senate took more than 49 months to \nconfirm Judge Richard Paez, who was nominated back in January 1996, and \nmore than 26 months to confirm Marsha Berzon, who was nominated in \nJanuary 1998. Tim Dyk, who was nominated in April 1998, was confirmed \nafter more than two years. This is hardly a record of prompt action of \nwhich anyone can be proud.\n  Chairman Hatch then compared this year's total against totals from \nother presidential election years. The only year to which this can be \nfavorably compared was 1996 when the Republican majority in the Senate \nrefused to confirm even a single appellate court judge to the Federal \nbench. Again, that is hardly a comparison in which to take pride. Let \nus compare to the year 1992, in which a Democratic majority in the \nSenate confirmed 11 Court of Appeals nominees during a Republican \nPresident's last year in office among the 66 judicial confirmations for \nthe year. That year, the committee held three hearings in July, two in \nAugust, and a final hearing for judicial nominees in September. The \nseven judicial nominees included in the September 24 hearing were all \nconfirmed before adjournment that year--including a court of appeals \nnominee. We have a long way to go before we can think about resting on \nany laurels.\n  Having begun so slowly in the first half of this year, we have much \nmore to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial \nnominees this year. We should be considering 20 to 30 more judges this \nyear, including at least another half dozen for the court of appeals. \nWe cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond Rule'' and stop acting on \nthese nominees now in anticipation of the presidential election in \nNovember. We must use all the time until adjournment to remedy the \nvacancies that have been perpetuated on the courts to the detriment of \nthe American people and the administration of justice. That should be a \ntop priority for the Senate for the rest of this year. In the last \nthree months in session in 1992, between July 12 and October 8, 1992, \nthe Senate confirmed 32 judicial nominations. I will work with Chairman \nHatch to match that record.\n  One of our most important constitutional responsibilities as United \nStates Senators is to advise and consent on the scores of judicial \nnominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal courts \naround the country. I look forward to our next confirmation hearing and \nto the inclusion of qualified candidates for some of the many vacancies \non our Federal Court of Appeals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/12/senate-section/article/S6568-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6568-S6570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DRUNK DRIVING PER SE STANDARD\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, now that we have passed the Transportation \nAppropriations bill and it heads to the conference committee, I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support in conference a provision in the \nbill that would encourage states to adopt a .08 Blood-Alcohol \nConcentration (BAC) level as the per se standard for drunk driving.\n  This issue is not new to the Senate. In 1998, as the Senate \nconsidered the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA \n21, 62 Senators agreed to an almost identical provision--an amendment \nthat Senator Lautenberg and I offered to make .08 the law of the land. \nSixty-two Senators, Mr. President, agreed that we needed this law \nbecause it would save lives.\n  We made it clear during the debate in 1998 that .08, by itself, would \nnot solve the problem of drunk driving. However, .08, along with a \nnumber of other steps taken over the years to combat drunk driving, \nwould save between 500 and 600 lives annually. Let me repeat that, Mr. \nPresident--if we add .08 to all the other things we are doing to combat \ndrunk driving--we would save between 500 and 600 more lives every year.\n  On March 4, 1998--when the Senate voted 62 to 32 in favor of a .08 \nlaw--the United States Senate spoke loud and clear. This body said that \n.08 should be the uniform standard on all highways in this country. The \nUnited States Senate said that we believe .08 will save lives. The \nUnited States Senate said that it makes sense to have uniform laws, so \nthat when a family drives from one state to another, the same \nstandards--the same tough laws--will apply.\n  But sadly, Mr. President, despite the overwhelming vote in the \nSenate--despite the United States Senate's very strong belief that .08 \nlaws will save lives--this provision was dropped in conference. The \nconferees replaced it with an enhanced incentive grant program that has \nproven to be ineffective. Since this grant program has been in place, \nonly one state--Texas--has taken advantage of the incentives and put a \n.08 law into effect.\n  So, here we are again--back at square one, making the same arguments \nwe made two years ago--the same arguments that compelled 62 United \nStates Senators to vote in favor of .08 legislation. Let's not make the \nsame mistake this time, Mr. President. The Senate kept the .08 \nprovision in the Transportation Appropriations bill we passed last \nweek--this time, we need to do the right thing and keep the provision \nin the conference report and make it law once and for all.\n  The case for a .08 law in every state is as compelling today as it \nwas two years ago when we voted on this. The fact is that a person with \na .08 Blood-\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\nAlcohol Concentration level is seriously impaired. When a person \nreaches .08, his/her vision, balance, reaction time, hearing, \njudgement, and self-control are severely impaired. Moreover, critical \ndriving tasks, such as concentrated attention, speed control, braking, \nsteering, gear-changing and lane-tracking, are negatively impacted at \n.08.\n  But, beyond these facts, there are other scientifically sound reasons \nto enact a national .08 standard. First, the risk of being in a crash \nincreases gradually with each blood-alcohol level, but then rises \nrapidly after a driver reaches or exceeds .08 compared to drivers with \nno alcohol in their systems. The National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA) reports that in single vehicle crashes, the \nrelative fatality risk for drivers with BAC's between .05 and .09 is \nover eleven times greater than for drivers with BAC's of zero.\n  Second, .08 BAC laws have proven results in reducing crashes and \nfatalities. Back in 1998, when Senator Lautenberg and I, argued in \nsupport of a national .08 law, we cited a study that compared states \nwith .08 BAC laws and neighboring states with .10 BAC laws. That study \nfound that .08 laws reduced the overall incidence of alcohol fatalities \nby 16% and also reduced fatalities at higher BAC levels. During our \ndebate two years ago, the accuracy of this report was called into \nquestion by opponents of our amendment. Since then, a number of \ndifferent studies have verified the findings of the original Boston \nUniversity study. I will talk about these new studies shortly.\n  Third and finally, according to NHTSA, crash statistics show that \neven heavy drinkers, who account for a large percentage of drunk \ndriving arrests, are less likely to drink and drive because of the \ngeneral deterrent effect of .08.\n\n  Right now, Mr. President, we have a patchwork pattern of state drunk \ndriving laws. Forty-eight states have a per se BAC law in effect. \nThirty-one of these states have a .10 per se standard. Seventeen have \nenacted a .08 level. With all due respect, Mr. President, this doesn't \nmake sense. The opponents of the .08 level cannot convince me that \nsimply crossing a state border will make a drunk sober. For instance, \njust crossing the Wilson Bridge from Virginia into Maryland would not \nmake a drunk driver sober.\n  This states' rights debate reminds me of what Ronald Reagan said when \nhe signed the minimum drinking age bill: ``The problem is bigger than \nthe individual states . . . . It's a grave national problem, and it \ntouches all our lives. With the problem so clear-cut and the proven \nsolution at hand, we have no misgiving about this judicious use of \nfederal power.''\n  The Administration has set a very laudable goal of reducing alcohol-\nrelated motor vehicle fatalities to no more than 11,000 by the year \n2005. Mr. President, this goal is going to be very difficult to \nachieve. But, I believe that recent history provides a road map for how \nto achieve this goal. Beginning in the late 1970's, a national movement \nbegan to change our country's attitudes toward drinking and driving. \nThis movement has helped spur state legislatures to enact stronger \ndrunk driving laws; it led to tougher enforcement; and it caused people \nto think twice before drinking and driving. In fact, it was this \nnational movement that helped me get a tough DUI law passed in my home \nstate of Ohio back in 1982. In short, these efforts have helped reverse \nattitudes in this country about drinking and driving--it is now no \nlonger ``cool'' to drink and drive.\n  The reduction in alcohol-related fatalities since that time is not \nattributable to one single thing. Rather, it was the result of a whole \nseries of actions taken by state and federal government and the \ntireless efforts of many organizations, such as Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving, Students Against Drunk Driving, Advocates for Highway and Auto \nSafety, and many others.\n  Despite all of our past efforts, alcohol involvement is still the \nsingle greatest factor in motor vehicle deaths and injuries. We must \ncontinue to take small, but effective and proven steps forward in the \nbattle against drunk driving. Passage of a national .08 blood alcohol \nstandard is one of these small, effective steps.\n  Mr. President, how do we know that .08 is an effective measure in \ncombating drunk driving? Earlier I cited a Boston University study \nwhich showed that, if all 50 states set .08 as a standard, between 500 \nand 600 lives would be saved annually. A number of my colleagues \nquestioned that study during the Senate debate back in 1998. But, we \ndon't need to rely on that one single study.\n  Since we last debated .08, at least three studies have been published \non this issue. The most comprehensive of these, conducted by the \nPacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, concluded the following: \n``With regard to .08 BAC laws, the results suggested that these laws \nwere associated with 8% reductions in the involvement of both high BAC \nand lower BAC drivers in fatal crashes. Combining the results for the \nhigh and low BAC drivers, it is estimated that 275 lives were saved by \n.08 BAC laws in 1997. If all 50 states (rather than 15 states) had such \nlaws in place in 1997, an additional 590 lives could have been saved.'' \nLet me repeat that. ``If all 50 states . . . had such laws in place in \n1997, an additional 590 lives could have been saved.''\n  A second study, Mr. President, conducted by NHTSA, looked at eleven \nstates with ``sufficient experience with .08 BAC laws to conduct a \nmeaningful analysis.'' This study found that ``. . . the rate of \nalcohol involvement in fatal crashes declined in eight of the states \nstudied after the effective date of a .08 BAC law. Further, .08 BAC \nlaws were associated with significant reductions in alcohol-related \nfatalities, alone or in conjunction with administrative license \nrevocation laws, in seven of eleven states. In five of these seven \nstates, implementation of the .08 BAC law, itself, was followed by \nsignificantly lower rates of alcohol involvement among fatalities.''\n  Finally, the third most recent study, conducted by the Highway Safety \nResearch Center at the University of North Carolina, evaluated the \neffects of North Carolina's .08 BAC law. Opponents of this amendment \nuse this study as supposed proof that .08 does not work. But, here is \nwhat the study concluded: ``It appears that lowering the BAC limit to \n.08% in North Carolina did not have any clear effect on alcohol-related \ncrashes. The existing downward trend in alcohol-involvement among all \ncrashes and among more serious crashes continued . . .'' In other \nwords, .08 when enacted by a state that is progressive and aggressive \nin its efforts to deal with drinking drivers helps to continue existing \ndownward trends in alcohol involvement in fatal crashes.\n\n  Mr. President, some skeptics still might not be convinced of the \npositive effects of a national .08 BAC standard. The General Accounting \nOffice (GAO) conducted a critical review of these studies. GAO \nconcluded that there are ``strong indications that .08 BAC laws, in \ncombination with other drunk driving laws (particularly license \nrevocation laws), sustained public education and information efforts, \nand vigorous and consistent enforcement can save lives.'' The U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT), in its response to the GAO report, \nconcluded that ``significant reductions have been found in most \nstates;'' that ``consistent evidence exists that .08 BAC laws, at a \nminimum, add to the effectiveness of laws and activities already in \nplace;'' and that ``a persuasive body of evidence is now available to \nsupport the Department's position on .08 BAC laws.'' The GAO responded \nto DOT, stating: ``Overall, we believe that DOT's assessment of the \neffectiveness of .08 BAC laws is fairly consistent with our own.''\n  The fact is that since we last debated this issue, all of these \npublished studies have reached the same conclusion: .08 laws will save \nlives. I urge my colleagues not to be fooled by the opponents' rhetoric \nduring conference negotiations and keep the provision in tact. The \nopponents attempt to demean .08 laws by saying they will not ``solve \nthe problem of drunk driving.'' These opponents--in the way they use \nthe word ``solve''--are correct: .08 is not a silver bullet. By itself, \nit will not end drunk driving. However, it is exactly what proponents \nhave always said it was--another proven effective step that we can take \nto reduce drunk driving injuries and fatalities. Make no mistake--.08 \nBAC laws will save lives.\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\n  I want to conclude by thanking my friend from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, for his continued dedication to this issue. His hard work \nand perseverance have helped bring us to the point today where the \nSenate once again has passed legislation to strongly encourage states \nto enact this life-saving measure. I would also like to thank Senator \nRichard Shelby, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, for his support of \nthe .08 measure as the Transportation Appropriations bill was being \ncrafting; and Senator John Warner for his continued dedication to \nreducing drunk driving.\n  Mr. President, .08 is definitely a legislative effort worth fighting \nfor, and I hope we will succeed this time in retaining the provision in \nthe conference report. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/12/senate-section/article/S6570-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PROJECT EXILE: THE SAFE STREETS AND NEIGHBORHOODS ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

But, we have to remember that in the heat of \nthis debate, we must not lose sight of the real issue at hand--and \nthat's gun violence. There is nothing controversial about protecting \nour children, our families, our communities by keeping guns out of the \nwrong hands--keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and violent \noffenders--not law-abiding citizens, Mr. President, but criminals.\n  These criminals with guns are killing our children. They're killing \nour young adults. They're killing our friends and our neighbors. I am \nhere on the floor today because I am very troubled by this, Mr. \nPresident, and I am troubled by the current Administration's handling \nof crimes committed with guns. Let me explain.\n  Right now, current law makes it a federal crime for a convicted felon \nto ever possess a firearm. So, once a person is convicted of a felony, \nthat person can never again own a gun. It is against federal law to use \na gun to commit any crime, regardless of if that crime is otherwise a \nstate crime. And, under federal law, the sentences for these kinds of \ncrimes are mandatory--no second chance, no parole.\n  In the late 1980's, President Bush made enforcement of these gun laws \na priority. His Justice Department told local sheriffs, chiefs of \npolice, and prosecutors that if they caught a felon with a gun--or if \nthey caught someone committing a crime in which a gun was used--the \nfederal government would take the case, and put that criminal behind \nbars for at least five years--no exceptions. During the last 18 months \nof the Bush Administration, more than 2,000 criminals with guns were \nput behind bars.\n  Consistent, effective enforcement ended once the current \nAdministration took office. Between 1992 and 1998, for example, the \nnumber of gun cases filed for prosecution dropped from 7,048 to about \n3,807--that's a 46 percent decrease. As a result, the number of federal \ncriminal convictions for firearms offenses has fallen dramatically.\n  For six years, the Justice Department refused to prosecute those \ncriminals who use a gun to commit state crimes--even though the use of \na gun to commit those crimes could be charged as a federal crime. The \nonly cases they would prosecute were those in which a federal crime was \nalready being committed and a gun was used in the commission of that \ncrime.\n  Even worse, to this very day, some federal gun laws are almost never \nenforced by this Administration. While Brady law background checks have \nstopped nearly 300,000 prohibited purchasers of firearms from buying \nguns, less than .1 percent have actually been prosecuted.\n  I have repeatedly questioned Attorney General Reno and her deputies \nabout the decline in prosecutions, and their standard response is that \nthe Department of Justice is focusing on so-called ``high-level'' \noffenders, instead of ``low-level'' offenders, who commit one crime \nwith a gun. They say that they want to prosecute the few sharks at the \ntop rather than the numerous guppies at the bottom of the criminal \nenterprise. With all due respect, that's nonsense.\n  Attorney General Reno recently said that she would aggressively \nprosecute armed criminals, but only if they commit a violent crime. \nAgain, that type of law enforcement policy just doesn't make sense. \nCurrent law prohibits violent felons from possessing guns, and so we \nshould aggressively prosecute these cases to take guns away from \nviolent criminals--before they use those guns to injure and kill \npeople. It's that simple.\n  Mr. President, we have often heard that six percent of the criminals \ncommit 70 percent of the crimes--six percent of the criminals commit 70 \npercent of the crimes. Well, if you have a violent criminal who \nillegally possesses a gun, I can bet you that he is part of that six \npercent! He's one of the bad guys--and we should put him away before he \nhas a chance to use that gun again.\n  Mr. President, we need to take all of these armed criminals off the \nstreets. That is how we can reduce crime and save lives. Why wait for \narmed criminals to commit more and more heinous crimes before we \nprosecute them to the full extent of the law? Why wait, when we can do \nsomething before another Ohioan--or any American--becomes a victim of \ngun violence?\n\n  We shouldn't wait, Mr. President. That's why the House of \nRepresentatives recently passed legislation that would increase gun \nprosecutions. And that's why, along with a number of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Abraham, Santorum, Warner, Sessions, Helms, \nAshcroft, and Hutchinson from Arkansas, we have introduced the \ncompanion to the House-passed bill--a bill that offers the kind of \npractical solution we need to thwart gun crimes.\n  Our bill--called ``Project Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighbors Act \nof 2000''--would provide $100 million in grants over five years to \nthose states that agree to enact their own mandatory minimum five-year \njail sentences for armed criminals who use or possess an illegal gun. \nAs an alternative, a state can also qualify for the grants by turning \narmed criminals over for federal prosecution under existing firearms \nlaws. Therefore, a state has the option of prosecuting armed felons in \nstate or federal courts. Qualifying states can use their grants for any \nvariety of purposes that would strengthen their criminal or juvenile \njustice systems' ability to deal with violent criminals.\n  This approach works, Mr. President. In Virginia, for example, the \nstate instituted a program in 1997, also called ``Project Exile.'' \nTheir program is based on one simple principle: Any criminal caught \nwith a gun will serve a minimum mandatory sentence of five years in \nprison. Period. End of story. As a result, gun-toting criminals are \nbeing prosecuted six times faster, and serving sentences up to four \ntimes longer than they otherwise would under state law. Moreover, the \nhomicide rate in Richmond already has dropped 40 percent!\n  Every state should have the opportunity to implement Project Exile in \ntheir high-crime communities. The bill that we have introduced will \nmake this proven, commonsense approach to reducing gun violence \navailable to every state. It will take guns out of the hands of violent \ncriminals. It will make our neighborhoods safer. It will save lives.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support and pass \nthis legislation. It's time to protect our children, our families, and \nour country from armed and dangerous criminals. It's time to get guns \nout of the wrong hands. It's time we take back our neighborhoods and \nour communities from the criminals and take action to stop gun-toting \ncriminals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/12/senate-section/article/S6570-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6570-S6571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Jackson is the only New Hampshire \ntown celebrating its Bicentennial in the Year 2000.\n  Founded by settlers as New Madbury circa 1775 and incorporated on \nDecember 4, 1800, Jackson proudly traces its roots deep into the \nhistory of our state and nation. Originally named Adams, in honor of \nthen President John Adams, Jackson selected its current name on July 4, \n1829 to honor President Andrew Jackson. It is here, settled gently into \nthe awe inspiring beauty of New Hampshire's Presidential Mountain \nRange, at the foot of Mount Washington, where Jackson, a quiet farming \ncommunity with an abundance of open space and spectacular scenic views, \nevolved into a popular American resort destination for artists and \nsummer vacationers.\n  The centuries have been bridged by generations of old and new Jackson \nfamilies. Today, visitors come year round, joining local residents, to \nenjoy its pastoral vistas, timeless ridge lines, wild and scenic \nrivers, covered bridge, water falls, white steepled church, mountains, \nrolling farmland and outdoor recreation amidst the magnificence and \nsplendor of New Hampshire's world famous White Mountain National \nForest.\n  On the occasion of its 200th Birthday in the Year 2000 please join me \nto proudly salute and celebrate Jackson, New Hampshire, a classic \nAmerican community with a unique character, spirit and old world charm \nwhich has enriched the State of New Hampshire and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/12/senate-section/article/S6571-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:22 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 894: An act to encourage States to incarcerate \n     individuals convicted of murder, rape, or child molestation.\n       H.R. 3909: An act to designate the facility of the United \n     States Postal Service located at 4691 South Cottage Grove \n     Avenue in Chicago, Illinois, as the ``Henry W.

A bill to reduce illegal drug-related crimes in our Nation's \ncommunities by providing additional Federal funds to develop and \nimplement community policing and prosecutorial initiatives that address \nproblems associated with the production, manufacture, distribution, \nimportation, and use of illegal drugs; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n       the community oriented policing services against drugs act\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have visited the Carver Neighborhood of \nRichmond in my state. This neighborhood is a low-income community that \nthanks to collaborative efforts among the community, city, and federal \ngovernment, has seen a tremendous decrease in crime, helping to spur a \nmajor community revitalization.\n  We've seen this trend more and more in cities and communities across \nAmerica. Much has been accomplished in our efforts to revitalize our \ncommunities--but more needs to be done. We should build on our past \nsuccesses and focus our resources on keeping our children safe and our \nneighborhoods free of fear. We should take what we know works and apply \nit in our fight against illegal drugs.\n  It is in this spirit, Mr. President, that I rise to introduce the \nCommunity Oriented Policing Services Against Drugs Act. As part of our \ncontinuing battle against the proliferation of drugs in our nation's \ncommunities, my bill seeks to provide $500 million over five years in \nfederal funds from the COPS Program to state and local law enforcement \nauthorities across the country to eliminate or reduce drug crime in \nAmerica. We know the COPS Program works, and I'm proud to have expanded \nit to provide our schools with more than 2,600 police officers to \ncombat school violence.\n  Specifically, this new program will provide federal funds to hire \n1,950 more police officers to enhance existing community policing \ninitiatives throughout approximately 65 cities across the country. \nNewly hired police officers will be charged with developing and \nimplementing community policing initiatives to combat the production, \nmanufacture, distribution, importation, or use of illegal drugs in our \ncommunities.\n  There are dozens of cities across the country, such as Richmond, \nNorfolk, and Williamsburg in my state, that are committed to providing \na safe environment for citizens to live, work and raise a family but \nneed additional resources to help eliminate drug trafficking and drug-\nrelated crime, including violent crime. This legislation will build \nupon the successful COPS Program and focus an aspect of its community \npolicing initiatives against the scourge of illegal drugs in our \nneighborhoods.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2850\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ndistributions to be made from certain pension plans before the \nparticipant is severed from employment; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 phased retirement programs facilitated\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code. My bill will facilitate phased \nretirement programs. In April I held a hearing in the Special Committee \non Aging. The subject of the hearing was employment of older workers. \nSeveral experts told us what could be done to encourage older \nindividuals to remain in the labor market. In today's tight labor \nmarkets, older workers are in great demand. Employers have numerous \nstrategies to attract and retain them--one of those is phased \nretirement.\n  At our hearing, several witnesses testified that statutory changes to \npermit phased retirement programs would be helpful. One of those \nwitnesses was Ms. September Dau from the Iowa Lakes Rural Electric \nCooperative in Estherville, Iowa. Ms. Dau noted that the average age of \nthe workforce at her Rural Electric Cooperative is high. Skilled \nworkers are hard to come by and Iowa Lakes has implemented a phased \nretirement program in order to retain older workers. But they would \nlike the comfort of knowing that their program is sanctioned.\n  Phased retirement allows a worker to wind down his or her career, by \nworking part-time and retiring part-time. It helps many people maintain \ntheir income level rather than quitting work all at once. Financially, \nit can allow an individual to postpone the time when he or she has to \ndraw down retirement savings. A study performed by Watson Wyatt \nWorldwide concluded that 16 percent of larger companies already offer \nphased retirement in some form and another 28 percent show a moderate \nto high level of interest in offering it in the next two years. But \nplan sponsors have worries about running afoul of the ``in-service \ndistribution'' rules. Tax rules bar employees from receiving pension \ndistributions before they reach a pension's normal retirement age, \nwhich is usually pegged to Social Security. That rule makes it \ndifficult for those who wish to retire gradually and use reduced \npension payments to augment reduced pay. It also helps circumvent the \n``do-it-yourself'' phased retirement that some workers are forced into \nwhere they retire one day from their long-term employer and go to work \nthe next day for someone else. This bill is designed to overcome those \nproblems. At the same time, this provision is completely voluntary and \nso will not burden plan sponsors.\n  As I said, we heard from witnesses who supported phased retirement \nprograms. I mentioned September Dau from the Iowa Lakes Rural Electric \nCooperative. But another one was our friend and colleague, Congressman \nEarl Pomeroy of North Dakota. Congressman Pomeroy told the Committee \nthat phased retirement programs should be allowed as a way of \nincreasing the attractiveness of defined benefit pension plans. Phased \nretirement programs could also make defined benefit plans more \nadaptable to the human resource needs of plan sponsors. This is \nimportant to Congressman Pomeroy because he is introducing a phased \nretirement bill that is identical to mine.\n  Defined benefit plans provide a stream of payments to retirees. They \ncan go a long way to supplementing Social Security. But defined benefit \nplans are on the decline, especially among small businesses, whose \nemployees are the least likely group to be covered by any form of \nretirement plan. We know that life expectancy is increasing. We also \nknow that Americans are not saving enough to maintain their standard of \nliving in retirement. By making defined benefit plans more attractive \nto employers and workers--such as by facilitating phased retirement--we \nare helping to improve the lives of everyday American people.\n  I hope that this bill is one step in that direction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN PENSION DISTRIBUTIONS ALLOWED BEFORE \n                   SEVERANCE FROM EMPLOYMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to qualified pension, profit-sharing, \n     and stock bonus plans) is amended by inserting after \n     paragraph (34) the following new paragraph:\n       ``(35) Distribution prior to severance from employment.--A \n     trust forming part of a defined benefit plan (or a defined \n     contribution plan which is subject to the funding standards \n     of section 412) shall not constitute a qualified trust under \n     this section if the plan provides a distribution to a \n     participant who has not been severed from employment and the \n     distribution is made before the earliest of the following \n     with respect to the participant:\n       ``(A) Normal retirement age (as defined in section \n     411(a)(8)).\n       ``(B) Attainment of age 59\\1/2\\.\n       ``(C) The date the participant completes 30 years of \n     service.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to years beginning after December 31, \n     2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2857. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to exclude \npersonally identifiable information from the assets of a debtor in \nbankruptcy; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              privacy policy enforcement in bankruptcy act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, with my \nfriend from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, to protect the personal \nprivacy of consumers whose information is held by firms filing for \nbankruptcy protection.\n  The Privacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act would prohibit the \nsale of personally identifiable information held by a failed business \nif the sale or disclosure of the personal information would violate the \nprivacy policy of the debtor in effect when the personal information \nwas collected. Personally identifiable information, under our \nlegislation, includes name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, \nSocial Security number, credit card number, date of birth and any other \nidentifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific \nindividual.\n  This legislation is needed because the customer databases of failed \nInternet firms now can be sold during bankruptcy, even in violation of \nthe firm's stated privacy policy. That is wrong.\n  Toysmart.com, for example, an online toy store, recently filed for \nbankruptcy and its databases and customer lists were put up for sale as \npart of the liquidation of the firm's assets. This personal customer \ninformation was put on the auction block even though Toysmart.com \npromised otherwise on its web page.\n  Toysmart.com's web site states that ``personal information \nvoluntarily submitted by visitors to our site, such as name, address, \nbilling information and shopping preferences, is never shared with a \nthird party.'' Toysmart.com's privacy statement continues: ``When you \nregister with toysmart.com, you can rest assured that your information \nwill never be shared with a third party.''\n  But on June 8, 2000, one day before filing for bankruptcy, \nToysmart.com advertised in the Wall Street Journal\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\nto sell its customer lists and databases. That was a clear violation of \nToysmart.com's web site privacy policy. The Federal Trade Commission \nhas filed suit against Toysmart.com for this violation and I commend \nthe FTC for its action.\n  Yesterday, the Walt Disney Company, the parent company of \nToysmart.com, announced that it would try to purchase Toysmart.com's \ncustomer information from the bankruptcy court. I applaud Disney for \ntaking this step. There is no guarantee, however, that Disney will be \nthe top bidder for this information and other corporate parents may not \nbe as responsible if one of their subsidiaries fails. Indeed, two other \nfailed web businesses, Boo.com and Craftshop.com, have reportedly \nsought buyers for its personal customer data.\n  That is why this Congress should pass the Privacy Policy Enforcement \nin Bankruptcy Act this year. Consumers deserve this privacy protection.\n  Mr. President, it is wrong to use our nation's bankruptcy laws as an \nexcuse to violate a customer's personal privacy. Customers have a right \nto expect an online firm to adhere to its privacy policies whether it \nis making a profit or has filed for bankruptcy.\n  I commend Senator Torricelli for joining with me to introduce the \nPrivacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act. Our legislation will \nclose this loophole in the Bankruptcy Code and ensure that online and \noffline firms keep their promises to protect the personal privacy of \ntheir customers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this basic privacy protection \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/12/senate-section/article/S6576-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6576-S6578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 682\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mrs. Lincoln) was added as a cosponsor of S. 682, a bill to implement \nthe Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in \nRespect of Intercounty Adoption, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 954\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, the name of the Senator \nfrom Idaho (Mr. Crapo) was added as a cosponsor of S. 954, a bill to \namend title 18, United States Code, to protect citizens' rights under \nthe Second Amendment to obtain firearms for legal use, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1333\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wyden, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Warner) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1333, a bill to expand \nhomeownership in the United States.\n\n\n                                S. 1473\n\n  At the request of Mr. Robb, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mrs. Lincoln) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1473, a bill to amend \nsection 2007 of the Social Security Act to provide grant funding for \nadditional Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Strategic \nPlanning Communities, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1732\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the names of the Senator from Minnesota \n(Mr. Grams) and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1732, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to prohibit certain allocations of S corporation stock held by an \nemployee stock ownership plan.\n\n\n                                S. 1755\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brownback, the name of the Senator from Texas \n(Mrs. Hutchison) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1755, a bill to amend \nthe Communications Act of 1934 to regulate interstate commerce in the \nuse of mobile telephones.\n\n\n                                S. 1806\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bingaman, the name of the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1806, a bill to authorize \nthe payment of a gratuity to certain members of the Armed Forces who \nserved at Bataan and Corregidor during World War II, or the surviving \nspouses of such members, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1991\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thompson, the name of the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Graham) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1991, a bill to amend the \nFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to enhance criminal penalties for \nelection law violations, to clarify current provisions of law regarding \ndonations from foreign nationals, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2018\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2018, a bill to \namend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to revise the update \nfactor used in making payments to PPS hospitals under the medicare \nprogram.\n\n\n                                S. 2217\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, the names of the Senator from \nMichigan (Mr. Abraham), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the \nSenator from Rhode Island (Mr. L.
