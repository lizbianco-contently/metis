Mr. President, I thank the leader for allowing me the \nopportunity this morning to talk about Medicare and about \npharmaceutical benefits.\n  I will talk about these issues, recognizing two things: One, that \nMedicare is second only to Social Security as the most important \ngovernment program in operation today; and two, recognizing that in \n1965, when Medicare came into existence and it was focused primarily on \nhospital care, physician care, and surgery, that reflected the practice \nof modern medicine in 1965. Today, Medicare is still focused on 1965 \nmedicine. However, pharmaceuticals have taken the place, in many cases, \nof hospital stays and surgery, and yet Medicare does not pay for \npharmaceuticals.\n  What I will address is the cold reality of where we are, what we want \nto do, but the dangers we face if we do it wrong. I view this as a \nstatement on the problems we face in trying to provide pharmaceuticals \nin Medicare.\n  I hope to do this with a series of charts. I begin with the good \nnews. The good news--the glorious news--is that 68.8 percent of all \nMedicare recipients already have some form of prescription drug \ncoverage--68.8 percent. That level of coverage is a level of coverage \nvirtually unmatched in terms of the structure of private health \ninsurance. What it means is that almost 69 percent of people in America \nalready have some form of pharmaceutical coverage when they are under \nMedicare.\n  Obviously, what this says is, whatever we do, we don't want to do \nanything that imperils the 69 percent of people who already have \npharmaceutical coverage in our effort to try to provide it to the 31 \npercent of people who don't.\n  Where does this coverage come from? If we look at this chart, we can \nsee that 44.6 percent of the people who have pharmaceutical coverage in \nMedicare are getting it through their employer. This is part of the \nbenefit for which they worked a lifetime. They are getting it through \nan employer-sponsored program. Obviously, we don't want to do anything \nto induce employers to drop that coverage, nor do we want to do \nanything to substitute taxpayer money for the private money that is \ncurrently going into private health insurance to cover our seniors for \npharmaceutical coverage.\n  There are 15.2 percent of those who have pharmaceutical coverage who \nget it from Medicaid; 11.9 percent get it from HMOs as part of \nMedicare; 10.6\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\npercent who switched coverage during the last year and went from one \nform of coverage to another, so they are not counted as being in one \ncategory for the year that they had it. Then finally, 15.2 percent get \npharmaceutical coverage through Medigap policies. That is the way my \nmomma, for example, gets her pharmaceutical coverage--through a Medigap \npolicy.\n  What is the point of all this? What does this mean? Why should \nanybody care about this?\n  The point is, 69 percent of Americans already have something we want \nto provide to 31 percent of Americans. We want to be very sure--we \nmight even have a bipartisan agreement on this at some point--we want \nto be very sure we don't do anything, in trying to help the 31 percent, \nthat could endanger, destroy, eliminate, or replace the coverage that \n69 percent of those on Medicare already have.\n  What is it going to cost for the various plans that have been \nproposed? My colleagues will remember--I am sure the Presiding Officer \nremembers--that when Lyndon Johnson sold the Senate on passing \nMedicare, it was going to cost less than $1 billion a year. Medicare \nhas now become the second largest program in America. It is on its way \nto becoming the most expensive program in the history of America or the \nhistory of the world. The point being, we don't always have the ability \nto predict what costs are going to be.\n  Nothing shows this more clearly than the official estimates that have \nbeen made of the Clinton-Gore drug plan. When they first introduced \ntheir plan, the Office of Management and Budget estimated that the plan \nwould cost $118.8 billion over the first 10 years.\n  By April of that year, the official estimate from CBO was $149.3 \nbillion. By May, the estimate by the Congressional Budget Office had \nrisen to $160 billion. By July, the estimate from CBO had risen to \n$337.7 billion.\n  The point is, what happened to the program between the first estimate \nmade when it was proposed and July? Well, the program was never \nimplemented. What happened is--the President made some changes in it, \nbut what really happened is people started looking deeper and deeper \ninto the program.\n  The plain truth is, we don't know what the actual cost is going to \nbe. But we know if you are going to have the federal government take \nover and basically federalize pharmaceuticals so that you are going to \nhave the taxpayer paying for benefits, when currently 44.6 percent of \nthe people who have pharmaceutical coverage are getting it from their \nformer employer--when you have the government take it over and pay for \nnot just the 31 percent who don't have it but for the 69 percent who \ndo, obviously it is going to cost a lot of money.\n  Secondly, remember that the level of usage clearly is affected by who \npays. There are many different figures you can use, but let me just use \none figure. For those on Medicare who do not have third party coverage \nfor pharmaceuticals--that is, they don't have somebody else paying \ntheir pharmaceutical bills in total or in part--they are spending, on \naverage, less than $400 a year. But for Medicaid beneficiaries where \nthe federal government is paying for all of their pharmaceutical bills, \nthey are spending over $700 a year.\n  Now some people would say, you either need pharmaceuticals or you \ndon't. The point is, as is true in anything, it makes a difference \nwhether there are copayments, whether there are deductibles, and who is \npaying. The point this chart makes very clearly is that we have already \nseen, in one year, the estimated cost of the Clinton-Gore drug plan \nrise from $118.8 billion to $337.7 billion, and it is not implemented. \nThe point is, we really don't have any idea about how much it is going \nto cost. As costs go up, what happens? As costs go up, first premiums \ngo up, and then there is political resistance to premiums.\n  What happened in England with a program similar to the Clinton-Gore \nplan? What happened in Canada? What happened in Germany? As costs rise, \nwith political pressure to keep premiums down, what happens? In every \ncountry in the world that has adopted a one-size-fits-all government \nprogram, one thing has happened--and it is not as if it were different \nin Germany from in Britain, or different in Britain from in Canada. One \nthing has always happened: When you have a one-size-fits-all government \nprogram and costs explode, they ration health care.\n  Great Britain is a good example. They delay the implementation of new \ndrugs until the cost of those drugs comes down. That may make sense in \ncontrolling government costs, but if your mama is sick or your baby is \ndying, that is rationing health care. And every country in the world, \nto try to deal with this exact problem of exploding costs, when they \nhave the government take over with a one-size-fits-all program, they \nend up rationing pharmaceuticals.\n  So we have people in the Senate who stand up and say that in Great \nBritain you can get X drug cheaper. What they don't explain is that it \nwasn't introduced for 2 years because of the cost, because it was \nrationed by the government. That is something we have to be concerned \nabout because nobody in America wants to be in a situation where, when \ntheir mama is sick, they end up talking to some bureaucrat about cost \ninstead of to a doctor about health care.\n  This is the greatest dilemma we face in doing something about \npharmaceuticals. This is not a problem of anything other than \narithmetic. Today, half of the people who receive Medicare spend less \nthan $500 annually on prescription drugs. That is a fact. When people \nhear on television that we are debating having the government set up a \nprogram to pay for their pharmaceuticals, they think we are talking \nabout the government paying for their pharmaceuticals. But the plain \ntruth is--as anybody who has actually looked at the plan that has been \nproposed by Clinton and Gore knows--the first thing they discover is \nthat when it is fully implemented, you are going to have to pay $662.40 \nin annual premiums for a plan that pays for half of your \npharmaceuticals up to, ultimately, $5,000.\n\n  Here is the point. Half of all of the seniors are in the position \ntoday where their pharmaceutical bills are $500 or less. If we \nimplement a program that has the government take over prescription \ndrugs so that we don't have 68.8 percent of people covered by other \nhealth insurance, as we have today, but we have everybody in a \ngovernment-run program, the premium cost of this is very high. And \nremember, this is based on a cost estimate which, if we know anything \nabout these programs, is a gross underestimation. The annual premium \ncost is $662.40, and for that the government pays half of your \npharmaceutical costs.\n  So here is the point. If the government is paying half of a Medicare \nbeneficiaries prescription drug costs, most Medicare beneficiaries are \ngoing to get out of this program less than $250 of benefits, but they \nare going to pay $662.40 in premiums just to be in the program.\n  Now how many seniors understand that half of them are going to get \n$250 or less worth of benefits, but are going to end up paying $662.40 \na year in premiums? What kind of bargain is it to pay $662.40 to get a \nbenefit worth $250 or less? It is a very bad bargain, which explains \nwhy it is mandatory--why either you have to take it the first day you \nare eligible or you can never get into the program. They have to find \nways of forcing people into this bad deal because they are not content \nto try to help the 31 percent of the people who don't have the \ninsurance. They are trying to force everybody into one program run by \nthe government, of course; and in doing so, for every one person to \nwhom you provide new coverage, you in essence take away coverage that \ntwo people already have, which is not funded by the government.\n  That is why these cost estimates on a one-size-fits-all government-\nrun program are so cataclysmic and why, if you ask people, Do you want \ngovernment to provide pharmaceutical coverage in Medicare? the vast \nmajority of people say yes. But when you explain to them that half of \nthe people on Medicare today spend less than $500 on prescription drugs \nand, when the program is fully implemented, the annual premium is going \nto be $662.40 that will pay for only half of your pharmaceuticals up to \nthe point you spend $5,000, people will look and see that half the \npeople are getting $250 in benefits, and they are spending $662.40 \ninitially when the program is fully implemented and see it isn't a good \ndeal. But\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\ndoes anybody doubt the program will be at least twice that when it is \nultimately in place? I don't think so.\n\n  In this political environment we are in, people are always talking \nabout risky schemes. We have all heard it. It is amazing to me that \npeople will talk about spending trillions of dollars, but if you want \nto give half that amount in tax cuts, it is a risky scheme--spending it \nis not risky, but giving it back to working families is risky.\n  Let me talk about how risky this government takeover of the \npharmaceutical benefits in America for seniors is. The Clinton-Gore \nplan is back-end loaded. What do I mean by that? I mean that the first \nyear it is very cheap because it doesn't even go into effect for 2 \nyears from now. Then it becomes very expensive. The first year of the \nprogram advertises that it will cost only $13.5 billion. When the \nprogram is fully implemented, it costs $59.7 billion, or almost $60 \nbillion a year. When we run this out over a 10-year period and we look \nat the estimates that are being made when fully implemented, whereas \nthe initial estimate by the Office of Management and Budget was the \nprogram would cost $118.8 billion, when we take its cost at full \nimplementation and what we already know, its actual cost is $597 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  How are we going to make up this difference? Britain has a \ngovernment-run benefit on pharmaceuticals. Germany has one. Canada has \none. How did they make it up? They made it up by raising the premiums \ninitially, and when political resistance occurred, they start rationing \nhealth care. That is what we would be buying into here.\n  There is one other difference, and this is from the Congressional \nBudget Office ``Analysis of the Health Insurance Initiatives in the \nMid-Session Review'' that they published on July 18. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at it. They analyzed the Clinton-Gore drug plan. \nMost people are obviously focused on, what is it going to cost? The \nCongressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan budgeting arm of Congress, \nfinds that not only is it going to cost a tremendous amount more than \nwhat is being claimed, but equally disturbing to me is this quote:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that after 10 \n     years, the average price of drugs consumed by the Medicare \n     beneficiaries would be 8 percent higher if the President's \n     proposal was enacted.\n\n  In other words, not only will taking over pharmaceutical coverage for \nall Medicare beneficiaries, when only 31 percent don't have it, cost a \ntremendous amount of money, but it will drive up the cost of \npharmaceuticals to everyone. This is not just to seniors, this is to \neveryone.\n  What is the alternative? Interestingly enough, the best alternative \nis a bipartisan proposal from a bipartisan commission that was led by \nSenator Breaux, a Democrat, from Louisiana.\n  I have a very revealing chart. I will give Michael Solon on my staff \ncredit for this. I think this is one chart that tells a very important \nstory. Here is what it is based on. The question it asks is the \nfollowing: If you left everything exactly as it is, and you held the \ngrowth of government discretionary programs to the budget, how long \ncould the government pay Medicare and Social Security benefits as they \nare currently promised? In other words, when would the government run \nout of money to pay for Medicare and Social Security benefits under the \nbest of circumstances?\n  He finds, under the current system, the federal government would run \nout of money in the year 2027. If we don't spend the money or use it \nfor anything else, we keep spending in real terms where it is, and we \nuse all the money in the budget to fund just Social Security and \nMedicare, the federal governments runs out of money in 2027. That means \neverybody 40 and over would, for all practical purposes, be covered, \nbut everybody under 40 would be vulnerable to the federal government's \ninability to pay Medicare and Social Security benefits.\n\n  If you adopted the Clinton-Gore plan, what you would do is, by \ndriving up costs, move this doomsday or day of reckoning--whatever you \nwant to call it--from 2027 to 2022, which means that only people 44 and \nabove would have their Medicare and Social Security benefits secured. \nStated another way, 17 million people who are between 40 and 44--those \n17 million middle-aged people in that 4-year bracket--would have their \nMedicare benefit and their Social Security benefit imperiled by the \nadoption of the Clinton-Gore plan.\n  What is the alternative? The alternative is a bipartisan proposal. \nThe estimates that were done of the bipartisan commission--and I remind \nmy colleagues, people were appointed by the Speaker and the minority \nleader, by the majority leader and by the minority leader, and by the \nPresident--they put together a proposal that a majority supported. But \nbecause all of President Clinton's appointees voted against the final \npackage, it did not get the supermajority needed to make a formal \nrecommendation.\n  However, the majority supported the Breaux proposal. The Breaux \nproposal basically reformed Medicare and provided pharmaceutical \nbenefits to the 31 percent of the people, or most of them, who don't \nhave Medicare, don't have coverage for pharmaceutical benefits. The \nimportant thing was that the reform of Medicare contained in the Breaux \ncommission report--by reforming Medicare, extended its lifetime from \n2027 to 2059, which would mean anybody over 8 years old would have \ntheir benefits guaranteed if we adopted the bipartisan Breaux \ncommission report.\n  What is the point of this speech? The whole point of this is the \nfollowing, and I think these points were very important and I want to \njust run through them real quickly. Point one, you have 69 percent of \nall seniors who have some pharmaceutical coverage already. Why would \nyou want to have the government come in and pay for that, especially \nwhen 44 percent of them are having it paid for by their former \nemployers? That doesn't make any sense.\n  The only case in which you would want to do that is if you had some \npolitical agenda that said we ought to have a government-run health \ncare system. I submit, based on the record of this administration, when \nthey tried in 1993 and 1994 to have the government take over and run \nthe health care system, that is exactly what their agenda is. But, \nnotice--and this is easy to explain--if you have a problem with 31 \npercent of the people but you have 69 percent who already have a \nbenefit, don't tear up what they have trying to help the people who \nneed it. That is the first point.\n  The second point is that when you try to have a program that covers \neverybody, and you start substituting government dollars, tax dollars \nfor other health insurance that 69 percent of the people already have, \nyou are forced into a system where most seniors will not benefit.\n  As I explained earlier, today over half of all Medicare beneficiaries \nspend less than $500 a year on prescription drugs. Yet under this one-\nsize-fits-all, government-runs-it, government-controls-it plan that has \nbeen proposed by the President and endorsed by the Vice President, when \nthat plan is phased in, in order to get coverage where the government \nwill pay half of your prescription costs up to you spending $5,000, it \ncosts you $662.40 a year in premiums. But half of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries would only get benefits of $250 or less. Needless to say, \nwhen you say to seniors, ``We have a great deal for you, we are going \nto give you a benefit for $662 a year that half of you will find to be \nworth less than $250 in any given year,'' they are not excited about \nit. So how do you deal with that?\n  You deal with that by trying to mislead people about what it is going \nto cost. You don't phase in the whole program. You don't even start the \nprogram for 2 years, so, boy, it is cheap for the first 2 years because \nyou don't have a program. Then you phase it in.\n  The point is, when you do that, you start out cheap--$13.5 billion. \nBut when you get it fully phased in, even based on the estimates of the \nCongressional Budget Office--and we know the real costs will be \nhigher--you are already up to about $60 billion a year when you get it \nfully implemented.\n  Obviously, anybody who is trying to be critical of what is being \nproposed has the obligation to propose an alternative. Fortunately, as \na member of the Medicare Commission with Senator Breaux and Senator \nKerrey--the two Democrat members who worked on the majority position--\nthere was a proposal made. That proposal was a comprehensive reform of \nthe system.\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\n  That comprehensive reform, which provided pharmaceuticals for \nmoderate-income people but let the 69 percent of the people who already \nhad pharmaceutical coverage keep it, didn't substitute tax dollars for \nGeneral Motors' money on retirement health care. What happened was, \nwhereas the Clinton-Gore plan would actually endanger the Medicare and \nSocial Security benefits of people between the ages of 40 and 44 by \ndriving up costs and by forcing those systems into insolvency or into \nfee increases or into tax increases sooner, the bipartisan proposal of \nthe Breaux commission would have actually expanded the life of Medicare \nto 2059. That would mean everybody 8 years old and older would be \nprotected. It would give us an opportunity to further refine the \nsystem.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me this opportunity. These are \nimportant issues. They deserve prayerful consideration. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at them before we change Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \ninsight and leadership and expertise and courage and ability to \nexplain, in common language, some of our most complex financial issues \nfacing this country. It is an extraordinarily valuable asset to our \ncountry, to have Senator Gramm in this body as a trained economist. I \nnever cease to be amazed and appreciative of what he contributes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8776-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8776-S8778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING ALABAMA HOSPITALS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I want to talk about the situation \ninvolving hospitals in America. We passed the Balanced Budget Act in \n1997. It was an agreement, not only of this Congress, but of the \nPresident. It was to be administered by the executive branch agency \ncalled HCFA. We projected a number of reductions and savings that would \noccur as a result of our efforts to balance the budget, to curtail \ndouble-digit increases in health care, and to make hospitals really \nforce some cost containment in the escalating cost of health care in \nAmerica.\n  I believe in that, and I support that. I think that, in part, it has \nbeen successful. Experts projected savings over this period of time \nwould have been $115 billion. We now see that savings to Medicare will \nbe closer to $250 billion. In other words, the savings that have come \nout of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals that are \ntaking care of indigent patients whether they get paid or not have had \nan impact far in excess of what we anticipated when we passed the BBA.\n  I have traveled to about eight different hospitals in the last \nseveral months in my State. I met with groups of administrators from \nthese hospitals. I talked to nurses, administrators, practitioners and \naccountants in the hospitals, and I believe that they are not crying \nwolf, but that their concerns are real. I believe there is a problem \nthere.\n  I would like to share with the Members of this body some of my \nconcerns about it and say we are going to need to improve and find some \nadditional funding that will help those hospitals.\n  In Alabama, when we passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Alabama's \nhospitals' bottom line already was significantly less than that of \nother hospitals in the country. That year, Alabama had an average \noperating margin of 2 percent, whereas the average operating margin for \n1997 was 16 percent. Aside from lower operating margins, the State also \nhas special health needs. When compared with other States, Alabama's \nhealth care market had a higher than average percentage of Medicare and \nMedicaid and uninsured residents. In 1998, the State's Medicare \nenrollees made up 15.4 percent of the population and Medicaid residents \nmade up 15.3 percent, both above the national average of 14.1 percent. \nSo when those reimbursements were reduced, Alabama felt it more \nseverely than most States.\n  One significant part of the BBA that has been especially damaging to \nour Nation's hospitals is the lack of a market basket update. The \nmarket basket is Medicare's measure of inflation. It is an inflation \nindex. It is essentially a cost-of-living adjustment for hospitals. \nWithout an accurate inflationary update, or market basket update, \nMedicare payments for a hospital's inpatient perspective payment \nsystem--the way we pay them--are inadequate and do not reflect \ninflation or the increased demands of regulations, new technologies, \nand a growing Medicare population.\n  As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which was passed to \naddress the double-digit growth in Medicare spending, updates in the \nmarket basket were frozen. But by freezing the updates, mathematically \nthis effectively created negative update factors.\n  For example, in 1998, the market basket update was 0.1 percent; for \n1999, it was a minus 1.9 percent; for fiscal year 2000, it was minus \n1.8 percent; for 2001, it is scheduled to be minus 1.1 percent; for \n2002, minus 1.1 percent. So, in effect, we not only have frozen the \ninflation increase over all these years, we have created mathematically \na reduction in the funding.\n  From 1998 to 2000, hospital inflation rates rose 8.2 percent, while \nMedicare payments for inpatient care rose 1.6 percent. You can do that \nfor a while. We can create some savings, but at some point you begin to \ncut access to essential health care, making health care in hospitals \nmore difficult less personnel and decreased resources.\n  Overall, the BBA will result in a reduction of Medicare payments for \nhospital inpatient care by an estimated $46.3 billion over 10 years. \nThis decrease in payments has been compounded by other increased costs \nsuch as the rapid increase in the cost of prescription drugs. We all \nknow the rising costs of health care, particularly drug costs. \nHospitals feel this crunch as well.\n  Cherokee Baptist Medical Center and Bessemer Northside Community \nClinic in Alabama are two facilities that have been hurt. For example, \nCherokee Baptist Medical Center has estimated that the 5-year impact of \nBBA implementation for years 1998 through 2002 will create a loss of \n$3.7 million for this small rural hospital. That is real money in a \nreal community--$3.7 million. The hospital's operating margin fell from \n4.5 percent in 1997 to 2.2 percent in 1999.\n  While Medicare inpatient admissions remain the same, the revenue they \nhave received from them has dropped from $3.5 million to $2.9 million. \nThat is a loss of over $600,000 for the hospital alone.\n  Bessemer Northside Community Clinic opened in 1997 in an attempt to \ndeal with a specific community need. The community needed convenient \ncare for its elder and uninsured. Bessemer opened to fill that need. \nBut due to reductions in Medicare reimbursements, they lost \napproximately $3 million in 1999, and were projected to lose $4 million \nin 2000.\n  This clinic served about 2,000 low-income and elderly patients in its \nfirst year, and was expected to serve 200,000 as part of a regional \nhealth network. Now it has closed its doors.\n  What we need to do: Last year we passed the Balanced Budget \nRefinement Act. The truth is, it will really come into effect this \nyear. The hospitals will begin to feel its impact in 2001. Some may \nthink we did not do anything last year. We did, but it was phased in, \nand the real impact is just now beginning to be felt. It is a good \nstart. But it is not enough. Now we need to deal with the market basket \nupdate reduction projection of 1.1 percent, again, for 2001 and 2002. \nWe need to restore the full inflationary update. The Alabama Hospital \nAssociation as well as the American Hospital Association have \nidentified this as one of their top priorities.\n\n  The American Hospital Preservation Act, which was introduced by \nSenator Hutchison and cosponsored by myself and 58 other Senators, \nshould be included in this year's Medicare provider give-back \nlegislation that is now being considered in this Congress.\n  Now I will talk about the wage index and how that affects a hospital \nin Stringfellow, AL. This is a chart that gives a clear indication of \nwhat this hospital receives compared to the national average.\n  For the national hospital average, this chart shows a per patient/\ndiagnosis reimbursement rate for labor of $2,760; $1,128 for nonlabor \nreimbursements. That is what our national hospital average \nreimbursement rate\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\nlooks like for per patient diagnoses for inpatient care, totaling \n$3,888.\n  But Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements for Stringfellow Memorial \nHospital in Anniston, Alabama--because of lower labor costs and a \nhigher percentage of non-labor costs are calculated by HCFA with a \ncomplicated formula that does it--is only reimbursed $2,042 for labor. \nThis means that this rural Alabama hospital is being reimbursed $718 \nless per patient diagnosis. That is money not going to Stringfellow \nHospital. That is money not going to that hospital. And the nonlabor \ncosts are the same. So they are feeling a loss of $718 out of the \n$3,888 average cost for care compared to the national average.\n  Make no mistake, there are other hospitals well above the national \naverage. Where rural Alabama hospitals lose $718 per patient, these \nhospitals may make $1,500 per patient diagnosis.\n  The nonlabor-labor split also assumes that hospitals purchase outside \nservices from within their region, when in fact, most rural hospitals \nmust purchase services from urban areas--which have must higher wages. \nIn rural Alabama, much of a hospital's services often have to come from \nBirmingham, the University of Alabama Medical Center, and all the \nfirst-rate quality care there. It may have to be transported out to the \nlocal hospitals at greater cost than it would be in Birmingham or any \nother regional medical center.\n  According to a recent study by Deloitte Consulting, approximately 70 \npercent of Alabama's hospitals will be operating in the red in 2000 and \nas many as 14 are likely to close--unless something is done.\n  The reductions which have resulted from HCFA's implementation of the \nBBA, have affected Alabama hospitals in many ways. The reductions have \nhurt hospitals, both big and small, urban and rural. They have been \nforced to limit access, cut off services, downsize, and in some \ninstances, close their doors.\n  Shelby Baptist Medical Center in Alabaster, Alabama was forced to \nclose its inmate/juvenile detention medical clinic, close their \noccupational medicine clinic, close a pediatric clinic, downsize \npsychiatric services, close physician services to new patients, and \ndecrease the number of health screenings for early detection of \ndisease. They have had to place a hold on all capital projects \nincluding a women's services clinic, an additional lab, and the \nexpansion of diagnostic services to the surrounding communities. They \nhave also had to end the development of an ``Open Access Clinic'' to \nhelp deal with the area's numerous uninsured and under-insured \npatients.\n  Likewise, the net income of Coffee Health Group in Lauderdale, \nColbert and Franklin Counties in Alabama dropped from $38.3 million in \n1997 to a projected negative $13.6 million in 2000. The hospitals' \noperating margin--the pre-tax profits which are the major source of a \nhospital's cash flow--dropped from $19.6 million in 1997 to a projected \nnegative $21.5 million in 2000.\n  Market basket update: One significant part of the BBA that has been \nespecially detrimental to our nation's hospitals is the lack of a \nMarket Basket Update. The Market Basket is Medicare's measure of \ninflation. It is essentially a cost of living adjustment for hospitals. \nWithout an accurate inflationary update, or Market Basket Update, \nMedicare payments for a hospital's inpatient perspective payment system \nare inadequate and do not reflect the increased demands of regulations, \nnew technologies, and a growing Medicare population.\n  As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which was passed to \naddress a looming health care crisis: double-digit growth in Medicare \nspending, updates in the Market Basket were frozen. By freezing the \nupdates, the BBA effectively created negative update factors: For \nfiscal year 1998, the market basket update was -0.1 percent, for fiscal \nyear 1999, the update was -1.9 percent, for fiscal year 2000, the \nupdate was -1.8 percent, for fiscal year 2001, the update is scheduled \nto be -1.1 percent, and for fiscal year 2002, the update is scheduled \nto be -1.1 percent.\n  Between 1998 and 2000 hospital inflation rates rose 8.2 percent while \nMedicare payments for hospital inpatient care rose 1.6 percent. \nOverall, the BBA will result in a reduction of Medicare payments for \nhospital inpatient care by an estimated $46.3 billion over 10 years. \nThis decrease in payments has been compounded by a rapid increase in \nthe cost of prescription drugs and the price of blood and blood \nproducts. We all know of the rising costs of health care--most \nespecially in drug costs. Hospitals feel this crunch as well. While the \naverage costs of ``existing drugs'' or those that came to the market \nbefore 1992, is $30.47, the average price of new prescription drugs is \n$71.49--more than twice that of existing drugs.\n\n  Cherokee Baptist Medical Center and Bessemer Northside Community \nClinic in Alabama are 2 facilities that have been affected by the BBA \nand provide disheartening real-life examples.\n  Cherokee Baptist Medical Center has estimated that the five-year \nimpact of BBA implementation for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 will \ncreate a loss of $3.7 million. The hospital's operating margin fell \nfrom 4.5 percent in 1997 to 2.2 percent in 1999. And while Medicare \ninpatient admissions remained the same, the revenue dropped from \n$3,512,910 to $2,909,666. That's a loss of over $600,000 for this \nhospital alone.\n  Bessemer Northside Community Clinic opened in October of 1997 (about \nthe same time the BBA was passed) in coordination with the community \nand in response to a specific need. The community needed convenient \ncare for its elderly and uninsured. Bessemer opened to fill that need, \nbut due to reductions in Medicare reimbursement that came as a result \nof the implementation of the BBA, Bessemer lost approximately $3 \nmillion in 1999 and was projected to lose about $4 million in 2000. \nThis clinic served about 2,000 low income and elderly patients its \nfirst year and was expected to serve over 200,000 as part of a regional \nhealth network. It provided more than $4 million in free medical care \nto Northside residents since the clinic opened. Now, due to the drastic \nreductions in reimbursement, Bessemer has closed its doors, leaving the \ncommunity's elderly to travel long distances for care, or in many cases \nto go without.\n  Last year Congress passed the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) \nin 1999 to address some of the concerns we had about the affects of the \nimplementation of the BBA. One provision in this legislation allows \nSole Community Hospitals--those hospitals that are the only access to \nhealth care in an area--to receive a full Market Basket Update in \nfiscal year 2001. That's a good start, but it's not enough. Now we need \nto strike the BBA-mandated Market Basket reduction of 1.1 percent for \nfiscal year 2001 and 2002 and restore a full inflationary update. The \nAlabama Hospital Association as well as the American Hospital \nAssociation have identified this as one of their top priorities, and it \nis what the American Hospital Preservation Act of 1999 does. This bill \nwhich was introduced by my colleague Senator Hutchison and cosponsored \nby myself and 58 other Senators, should be included in this year's \nMedicare provider give-back legislation to address the continuing needs \nof our Medicare providers.\n  Wage index: Mr. President, another Medicare reimbursement issue which \nneeds to be addressed in any upcoming Medicare provider give-back \nlegislation is a needed adjustment to the Wage Index.\n  Medicare reimbursement for hospital inpatient care is based on a \nPerspective Payment System (PPS) which was created in the early 1990's \nto cut Medicare spending. A formula within the PPS is used to adjust \nMedicare payments to a hospital based on a Wage Index--or the average \nwage for a particular area. The formula is based on 2 components: \nlabor-related and non labor-related costs. While non labor-related \ncosts are the same nationwide--these are costs for supplies, \npharmaceuticals, equipment, etc--labor-related costs differ from region \nto region and there are large discrepancies between the labor costs in \nurban and rural areas. The cost of living is lower in rural areas, so \nthey pay, on average, lower wages. The adjustment made for these \nregional differences is made according to the Wage Index.\n  The national wage index is 1, but most rural hospitals have a wage \nindex of 0.74 and most hospitals in Alabama have a wage index between \n0.74 and 0.89, which is 0.11 to 0.26 below the national average. This \nindex which is used to calculate the base rate for\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\nMedicare reimbursement, has several inequities:\n\n  For example:\n  Adding additional lower paid employees lowers your wage index.\n  Hiring 2 lower paid employees to do the job of one higher paid \nemployee lowers your wage index.\n  Increasing wages has no impact on the wage index for 3 years.\n  Having no corporate overhead from a large proprietary entity lowers \nyour wage index.\n  When developing the Wage Index mechanism, HCFA decided that 71 \npercent of a hospital's costs were labor related. This rate also \nincludes a predominant shift to labor-related costs due to purchases of \noutside services which incorrectly assumes that hospitals purchase \nservices only from within their region and thus pay similar wages for \nthese outside services. In reality, rural hospitals usually purchase \nservices from urban areas and must pay urban wages for these services. \nHowever, the purchase of outside services from urban areas which may \nhave a greater labor cost is not reconciled with the prevailing wage \nrate within the rural area. Hence, rural hospitals are paying urban \nrates for those services but are not being reimbursed at their urban \nwage rate. The average percentage of hospital expenditures in Alabama \nthat are labor related is 51 percent--far from the 71 percent used by \nHCFA. And the annual impact of these formula problems result in a \nreduction of Alabama hospital payments by HCFA by between 5.5 and 6.5 \npercent or close to $46 million a year.\n  To illustrate the unfairness of the Wage Index formula, you must see \nthe differences in the calculation of the base rate for reimbursement \nusing the Wage Index for both the national average and for a typical \nAlabama hospital.\n  National Average:\n  Take the initial national base rate for a per patient diagnosis of \n$3,888.\n  Multiply it by the national average for percentage of wages to all \nother costs (71 percent) = $2760.\n  Remaining $1128 is non-labor costs.\n  Apply National Average Wage Index (1) to wage cost of $2760 = $2760.\n  Add $2760 to the non-labor portion, $1128, to get a total payment of \n$3888. This is the base rate for Medicare reimbursement per Medicare \npatient diagnosis.\n  Compare that to: Stringfellow Memorial Hospital in Anniston, AL:\n  Take the initial national base rate for a per patient diagnosis of \n$3,888.\n  Multiply it by the national average for percentage of wages to all \nother costs (71 percent) = $2760.\n  Remaining $1128 is non-labor costs.\n  Now here's the problem. Instead of applying the national average wage \nindex of 1, for this Alabama hospital, we would use the Montgomery wage \nindex of 0.74.\n  So, apply the local wage index of (0.74) to wage cost of $2760 = \n$2042.\n  Add $2042 to the non-labor portion, $1128, to get a total payment of \n$3170.\n  Therefore the base rate for per patient diagnosis at Stringfellow \nMemorial Hospital is $718 less than the national average. That's nearly \n20 percent below the national average.\n  HCFA has recognized the problem and has addressed it in other areas. \nIn developing the formula for the new Outpatient Perspective Payment \nSystem (PPS), which was required by the BBA of 1997, HCFA set the labor \ncomponent of hospital costs at 60 percent (as compared to the 71 \npercent in the Inpatient PPS). According to HCFA, in the development of \nthis new Outpatient formula, 60 percent represents the average split of \nlabor and non labor-related costs.\n\n  Why then has HCFA not changed the Inpatient PPS formula? Why do we \nhave to do it legislatively?\n  Senator Grassley has proposed legislation that would correct the \nfaulty wage index formula. His plan would mandate that HCFA apply the \nwage index adjustment only to each hospital's actual labor costs. This \nproposal, though it has not been scored, would cost approximately $230 \nmillion the first year.\n  While I support this proposal, I am also sympathetic to my colleagues \nwhose states are not detrimentally affected by the wage index. For that \nreason, I would also support other possible solutions to the Wage Index \nissue.\n  There are 2 possible options:\n  (1) We can develop a Wage Index ``Floor,'' possibly set at 0.85 or \n0.9. Thus there would be no effect (positive or negative) on hospitals \nwith Wage Indeces above that level.\n  (2) We can establish a hold-harmless provision and apply the Wage \nIndex adjustment to the share of hospital costs that are actually wage \nrelated (51 percent for Alabama), but only for hospitals with a Wage \nIndex below 1.\n  The bottom line is that something must be done before the reductions \nin the BBA threaten the access to and quality of health care for our \nnation's seniors and uninsured. This government must not create a \nsituation in which many of these needed hospitals have to close. We \nmust act quickly or closures will occur.\n  I would like to thank the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nChairman Roth, for his efforts to address these concerns, and I look \nforward to working with him and the members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee as well as the Senate Leadership to get this done.\n  It is time for this Congress to deal with the unfair wage index and \nimprove it and take a step in the right direction. It is hurting our \nhospitals in rural America. It is really hurting them in Alabama where \n70 percent are operating in the red and as many as 14 might close.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8778-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

From the Mercury-Redstone vehicle \nthat placed America's first astronaut, Alan Shepard, into suborbital \nspace in 1961, to the mammoth Saturn V rocket that launched humans to \nthe moon in 1969, Marshall and its industry partners have successfully \nengineered history making projects that gave, and continue to give, \nAmerica the world's premier space program.\n\n  We are fortunate to have these dedicated men and women in Huntsville. \nI will be offering some remarks and hope to speak on the floor again \nlater today.

Mr. President, I see the Senator from Alaska is here. I \nwill just say this: Senator Murkowski understands the failure of this \nadministration's energy policy. He understands their desperate attempt \nto blame it on everyone but themselves.\n  The plain fact is, for almost 8 years, this administration has, \nthrough a myriad of ways--the chairman of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources well knows--reduced American production of energy, \nleaving us more and more dependent on foreign oil. Now they have gotten \ntogether, created their cartel strength again and driven up the price \nof a barrel of oil in a matter of months from $13 a barrel to over $30, \nmaybe $35. We are feeling it in every aspect of the American \nGovernment. It was done not on the basis of a free market supply and \ndemand but because of the political acts of the OPEC nations. This \nadministration needs to do something about it.\n  I am glad to see Chairman Murkowski here this morning. I know he will \nbe speaking about this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, may I ask how much time I am allotted \nunder the standing order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may have 13 minutes of the time \nremaining of the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from \nAlabama.\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\n  He indicated that the price of oil had risen. The price of oil \nyesterday rose to an all-time 10-year high, $37 a barrel. This is a \nvery serious matter that is not receiving enough attention by this \nbody, nor this administration. To give my colleagues an idea, from the \nWashington Post yesterday there was a quote that the price of crude oil \ncontracts on the futures market on the New York Mercantile Exchange \nrose above $37 a barrel for the first time.\n  Here is the more significant point. Analysts predicted that the price \njumps, 2.7 percent yesterday and a total of 44 percent for this year, \ncould continue indefinitely. I repeat--could continue indefinitely, \nespecially with the uncertainty connected with Iraq's Saddam Hussein \nand his accusations that Kuwait was drilling near the Iraqi-Kuwaiti \nborder and stealing Iraq's oil.\n  Doesn't this sound a little like what happened in 1991 prior to the \nPersian Gulf war where we had the muscle demonstration by Saddam \nHussein and later the implications of that war?\n  This is serious business. If you don't believe it is serious, ask \nTony Blair because the stability of the British Government is very \nshaky right now as a consequence of the price of energy, a 10-year \nhigh, expectations for the price of oil go as high as $40 per barrel \nand beyond in the near future.\n  Why are we in this mess and why should American consumers care? I \nwill discuss one segment of this today because Saddam Hussein has the \nworld over a barrel. It is over a barrel of oil.\n  Why should American consumers care? Well, Iraq is now in a position \nto set the market price of oil--and therefore, what you pay at the \npump, what you pay to heat your homes, what you pay at the grocery \nstore, and what the Northeast Corridor residents are going to be paying \nin this country this winter for fuel. God help us if we have a cold \nwinter. Iraq is using its profits illegally for weapons of mass \ndestruction. They are threatening the peace and stability of the entire \nMideast region. They represent a threat to the security of Israel \nwithout question.\n  Let us look at a little history on how this administration has \nbasically failed to address this threat. Just before the Clinton-Gore \nadministration came in, we carried out a very successful mission in \nDesert Storm. That mission was not without American casualties. We lost \n147 Americans; 467 were wounded; 23 were taken prisoner.\n  Since that time, we have continued to enforce a no-fly zone. We have \nflown over 200,000 sorties since the end of Desert Storm, at a cost to \nthe American taxpayer of about $50 million per month. Yet here we are \ntoday more reliant on Iraqi oil. We are addicted to the imported oil. \nWe are addicted to oil. In any event, as a consequence of our decline \nin domestic production, which has been 17 percent since the Clinton \nAdministration took office, and a 14-percent increase in domestic \ndemand during the same period, we are now 58-percent dependent on \nimported oil.\n  During the Arab oil embargo--some remember this period of time, \n1973--we had gas lines around the block at filling stations. The public \nwas outraged. They were blaming everybody, including Government. That \nwas 1973 when we were 36 percent dependent on imported oil; now we are \nat 58 percent.\n  Today Iraq is the fastest growing source of U.S. foreign oil, 750,000 \nbarrels a day, nearly 30 percent of all Iraqi exports. We fought a war \nover there in 1991. Here we are dependent on Iraq. It makes us \npowerless to respond. Weapons inspections are unable to proceed. We are \nconcerned about it, but we don't do anything. Illegal oil trading is \nunderway with other Arab nations. We know it, we enforce a blockade in \nthe air, we don't enforce any kind of a blockade for the illegal oil \nshipments that are going out of Iraq. Profits go to development of \nweapons of mass destruction, training of the Republican Guards to keep \nSaddam Hussein alive.\n\n  The international community is becoming increasingly critical of \nsanctions towards Iraq. But consider this: Saddam Hussein puts Iraqi \ncivilians in harm's way when we go over and bomb his targets. Saddam \nhas used chemical weapons against his own people in his own territory. \nSaddam could have ended sanctions at any time. All he had to do is turn \nover his weapons of mass destruction; that is basically all. Yet he \nrebuilds his capacity to produce more. He cares more about these \nweapons, obviously, than he cares about his own people.\n  That he is able to dictate our energy future is an absolute tragedy \nof great proportion. Still, the administration refuses to act. What \nhappened?\n  Saddam is getting more aggressive. His rhetoric in every speech at \nthe conclusion is ``death to Israel.'' That is what he says. What is \nthe threat to Israel's security? It is Iraq. He has announced a $14,000 \nbounty on any American plane shot down, for the anti-aircraft crew that \nis responsible. Now he is accusing Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil. Here \nwe go again.\n  That is the same thing that was done in 1990 shortly before he \ninvaded Kuwait. Saddam is willing to use oil to gain further \nconcessions. This is rather interesting, to show you the leverage he \nhas because of his oil production. The U.N. was set to approve a $15 \nbillion compensation measure for Kuwait as a result of damages from the \nGulf war. That vote was set to take place next week. Iraq has \nretaliated and said: No, we are not going to pay that compensation. If \nyou make us pay, we will reduce our output of oil. Now reports are that \nthe U.N. has postponed that vote.\n  That is their leverage. There is likely not enough spare capacity in \nOPEC to make up the difference if Iraq pulls back it's production. Here \nis the Wall Street Journal headline: ``Iraqi Pumps Critical Oil and \nKnows It.'' That is the leverage of Saddam Hussein today, and his \nleverage is growing each and every hour.\n  This article says:\n\n       European oil executives familiar with Iraq say the U.N. \n     sanctions against trading with Iraq are breaking down in the \n     region. Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, Dubai, and Oman are still \n     openly trading with Iraq. Sanctions aren't working. Now he is \n     strong arming the U.N.\n\n  They have put off enforcing him to make compensation to Kuwait for \nthe loss of damages associated with his invasion of that country. And \nhis leverage is, hey, I will cut my oil production. The world can't \nafford to have that happen. Even if we took military action, we would \nneed Saddam Hussein's oil to fuel our planes and bomb him.\n  I would ask that the full text of the Wall Street Journal article \nfrom September 19, 2000 be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 19, 2000]\n\n                 Iraq Pumps Critical Oil, and Knows It\n\n                 (By Bhushan Bahree and Neil King Jr.)\n\n       Paris.--An international pariah for the past decade, Iraqi \n     leader Saddam Hussein now has the world over a barrel.\n       Iraq exports about 2.3 million barrels a day of crude oil \n     into a world market so thirsty for oil that prices have \n     soared recently spurring an international wave of consumer \n     backlash. The Iraqi exports are significantly more than the \n     combined spare production capacity of all other producers at \n     this time. So the world now depends on Iraqi oil, right?\n       ``You're damned right,'' snapped Amer Rasheed, Iraq's oil \n     minister, during an interview after a ministerial meeting of \n     the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna \n     last week.\n       Mr. Rasheed wouldn't answer whether Iraq is likely to use \n     its oil weapon--threatening to halt oil exports--to seek an \n     end, for instance, to United Nations sanctions imposed a \n     decade ago.\n       Saddam has played this game before. Late last year, Iraq \n     shut its oil taps in a dispute over the sanctions, and oil \n     prices surged.\n       No sooner had Mr. Rasheed returned to Iraq last week than \n     he accused Kuwait of stealing oil from Iraq's southern oil \n     fields through wells drilled horizontally across the border. \n     The accusation seemed ominous since it was the same charge \n     Iraq leveled against its neighbor before invading Kuwait in \n     1990. Mr. Rasheed said Iraq would take unspecified action to \n     protect its oil riches.\n       Yesterday, the Iraqi press reported that Saddam told a \n     cabinet meeting Sunday that even Saudi Arabia, the world's \n     largest oil exporter, didn't have enough spare capacity to \n     relieve the world of worries about an impending oil shortage.\n       ``This is one of those serious times when the threat of a \n     suspension of Iraqi [oil] exports needs to be taken \n     seriously,'' said Raad Alkadiri, country analyst at Petroleum \n     Finance Corp. in Washington.\n       Nobody knows just what the Iraqi leader may decide to do \n     with his oil power. Some diplomats and industry officials \n     figure Saddam may seek some gains by using the\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\n     threat of a halt in oil exports, while others say he may \n     reckon that things are going his way anyway, with support for \n     the longstanding U.N. sanctions growing increasingly weak.\n       There is little doubt that Iraq is getting more assertive. \n     An Iraqi fighter jet two weeks ago flew over part of Saudi \n     Arabia for the first time in a decade, leading U.S. officials \n     to warn that Washington would strike back if Baghdad provoked \n     neighboring Kuwait or Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have also \n     warned against thinking they are too distracted by \n     presidential politics to react.\n       Yet diplomats at the U.N. acknowledge that any concerted \n     effort to get arms inspectors back into Iraq won't advance \n     until after the U.S. presidential election. Hans Blix, head \n     of the new inspection team, made the same point to reporters \n     yesterday, saying ``nothing serious will happen'' until U.S. \n     voters go to the polls Nov. 7.\n       No one at the U.N. suggests that the Clinton administration \n     has put a hold on Iraqi diplomacy. But a spike in tensions \n     with Iraq, especially if it led to steeper gas prices, could \n     easily ripple through the presidential campaign.\n       European oil executives familiar with Iraq, meanwhile, say \n     the U.N. sanctions against trading with Iraq are breaking \n     down in the region. Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, Dubai and Oman are \n     all openly trading with Iraq, says one senior European oil \n     executive. ``There is a feeling that except for bombing \n     [against radar sites], the U.S. is turning a blind eye'' to \n     these transgressions, he says.\n       Western diplomats and industry officials say one potential \n     flash point is a Sept. 26 meeting in Geneva of the U.N. \n     Compensation Commission, which was set up after the Gulf War \n     to decide on claims on losses resulting from Iraq's invasion \n     of Kuwait. The body's governing board is scheduled to \n     consider a claim of some $16 billion by state-owned Kuwait \n     Petroleum Co., a claim that irks Iraq and may have provoked \n     the counterclaim that Kuwait has been stealing Iraqi oil.\n       The commission has already paid out more than $8 billion to \n     claimants. The U.N. supervises Iraqi exports of oil and \n     directs 30% of the receipts from such sales to fund the \n     commission and finance the awards. Depending on oil prices \n     and Iraqi export levels, the commission is getting some $400 \n     million every month from the Iraqi oil sales. Claims on Iraq \n     total more than $320 billion. Though the commission's awards \n     are expected to be significantly below that, Iraq has long \n     argued that it wouldn't pay damages for decades to come.\n       If there is a political flare-up now that results in Iraq \n     halting exports, the consequences could be serious at a time \n     when supplies are tight, oil prices already are at 10-year \n     highs of more than $36 a barrel (see article on page C1), and \n     consumers have been protesting across Europe. ``It would be \n     devastating * * * the price of a barrel would double,'' the \n     European oil executive said.\n       Most OPEC countries are producing flat out to meet strong \n     world demand for oil. Kuwait, for instance, has made clear \n     that it can't even meet the latest quota increase it was \n     allocated as part of last week's OPEC agreement to raise the \n     group's output by 800,000 barrels a day. The increase was \n     aimed at helping to cover world demand, which is running at \n     some 76 million barrels a day.\n       Iran's output actually declined in August, perhaps because \n     of production difficulties at its fields. Exporters that \n     aren't members of OPEC also are producing as much as oil as \n     they can. Norway and Mexico, for instance, have both said \n     they are producing to capacity.\n       That's not to say that the rest of the world would be \n     helpless. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates could \n     produce some extra oil to offset at least part of any \n     shortfall from Iraq. Saudi Arabia's exact surge capacity--the \n     ability to produce extra volumes for a short period of time--\n     isn't precisely known. But given its huge capacity base of \n     more than 10 million barrels a day, the kingdom could produce \n     at a much higher rate for a short period. It also could try \n     to increase its capacity, which would take at least some \n     months.\n       Meanwhile, the U.S. and other industrial countries that \n     have strategic reserves of petroleum could release them. The \n     U.S. alone has some 570 million barrels of oil stored at salt \n     caverns, and U.S. officials say they are prepared to tap the \n     reserves immediately should Iraq cut off its oil exports.\n       ``We could cover all Iraqi production for a year if we had \n     to,'' one senior U.S. official said.\n       Altogether, industrial-country members of the Paris-based \n     International Energy Agency have some 112 days of net import \n     coverage through stocks that can be released in case of a 7% \n     decrease in supplies from the average levels of the previous \n     year.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Think about the simple equation of Saddam's influence \nover the world right now. You don't have to be a mental giant to reach \nany other conclusion, but we buy Saddam Hussein's oil. We send him the \nmoney. He pays his Republican guards and builds up his biological and \nchemical weapons capability. We take that oil, put it in our airplanes \nand fly over and bomb him. And the process starts all over again. What \nkind of a foreign policy is that?\n  How do we get back on course? Well, there is a solution. We have to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. We need to go through some \navenues to do this. We need to increase our efficiency and maximize our \nutilization of alternative fuels and renewables. But we also have to \nincrease domestic oil and gas production in this country. We have vast \nresources in areas like the overthrust belt in Wyoming, Colorado, and \nother States where we produce oil. We can produce more. But 64 percent \nof the public land has been withdrawn from exploration. Increased \ndomestic supply is needed to lower prices, reduce volatility, and \nensure safe and secure energy supply.\n  My State of Alaska has been producing about 20 to 25 percent of all \nthe total crude oil produced in this country in the last 20-some years. \nWe can produce more. We have the technology and we can do it safely. \nGive us an opportunity. Let us show the American can-do spirit. Let us \nmeet the environmental concerns with technology, not rhetoric.\n  We must increase our domestic energy supply of oil to lower prices, \nreduce volatility, and ensure safe and secure energy supply. We have \nlegislation to do it. Senator Lott and I and others introduced the \nEnergy Security Act of 2000, S. 2557. If enacted, It would guide us \ntoward rolling back our dependence on foreign oil to below 50 percent. \nThat is a goal, an objective of the bill.\n  To meet that goal, our bill would, among other things, increase \ndomestic energy supplies of oil by allowing frontier royalty relief; \nimproving Federal oil lease management; providing tax incentives for \nproduction, and assuring price certainty for small producers; allow new \nexploration in America's Arctic, in the Rocky Mountain States, and \nalong the OCS areas for those States that want it; protect consumers \nagainst seasonal price spikes, especially with regard to Northeast \nheating oil users; foster increased energy efficiency, and provide new \ntax incentives for renewable energy to replace foreign oil.\n  The bottom line is, the Clinton-Gore energy policy and our increased \ndependence on Saddam Hussein is a travesty on the American people, the \nAmerican mentality, and the American memory. We fought a war in Iraq, \nand now we are dependent on their resources and unable, or unwilling to \ndo anything about it. Saddam is leveraging the issue by his dictate to \nthe U.N. that he is not going to give them compensation. If they make \nhim, he will simply cut his production, and the world can't afford to \nhave that happen.\n  Finally, more U.S. dependence on foreign oil gives more leverage to \nSaddam Hussein to threaten regional stability. The administration seems \npowerless to respond for fear of cutting back on Iraqi exports. We are \nin a period almost as if it was during the last year of the Carter \nadministration. Remember that time? We were being held hostage, if you \nwill. We had hostages in our embassy in Iran. This time we have a \ncountry, a nation held hostage by Saddam Hussein.\n  What will the effect be? It is going to be at the gas pump and in \nyour heating oil bill. I haven't even talked about natural gas, and I \nwill not do that today. I want to remind my colleagues that we have \nbeen talking about oil today. Tomorrow we are going to talk about \nnatural gas. Natural gas, a year ago, was $2.16. Today it is $5.40 for \ndeliveries in October. The GOP energy plan would defuse Saddam \nHussein's threat. The Clinton-Gore plan wants to stand by until the \nelection is over. They hope they get away with it.\n  That concludes the amount of time allotted to me. Tomorrow I will \ntalk about the price of natural gas and the effect it will have on the \neconomy, your heating bills, and your electric bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague for giving me these 5\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\nminutes. I listened to Senator Gramm's attack on the Clinton-Gore \nprescription drug plan, the Democratic plan. I will tell you, it was \nvery interesting because I just read an article in one of the \nnewspapers. I think it was in The Hill. It is an article by \nRepresentative Sherrod Brown. Representative Brown points to a \nconfidential document--I will quote him--prepared for House \nRepublicans. It found its way into the public realm. It wasn't news at \nthe time, he says, but when you read it, it suggests that the \nRepublicans go after the Democratic plan by calling it a one-size-fits-\nall plan, ``a big government plan, especially a one-size-fits-all big \ngovernment plan.''\n  As I listened to Senator Gramm, he uses those terms over and over \nagain. Now it sort of makes sense as to why they have put out this \nstrategy on how to attack this plan. I had to smile when I was \nlistening to Senator Gramm because I thought, Is he attacking the \nMedicare program? The Medicare program is a program that covers 99 \npercent of our seniors. I suppose he thinks that the one-size-fits-all \nbig government plan--and I assume he feels that way because Governor \nBush, in 4 years, wants to do away with the Medicare plan. So this is \nwhat is happening here.\n  I want to share a couple of charts that show the differences between \nthe two plans. This is amazing. Also, they say it is a forced plan when \nit is voluntary. Vice President Gore has been very clear that the plan \nis a voluntary plan. Seniors can take it if they want. So here you have \nthe Democratic plan, which is affordable for all seniors. It is part of \nMedicare and it is voluntary. It has a defined benefit, and it gives \nbargaining power to seniors so that the cost of the drugs would go \ndown.\n  The House Republican bill has no assistance to seniors with incomes \nover $12,500. So that leaves out most seniors. It is private insurance, \nnot Medicare. Insurers say they won't offer it. We have proof of that \nand we have quotes. An insurer can modify or drop benefits year to \nyear. Seniors may lose access to local pharmacies or drugs. There is no \nguarantee of better prices. Let's see the comments about the Bush-\nRepublican plan--the GOP prescription drug plan by health insurers.\n\n       We continue to believe the concept of the so-called drug-\n     only private insurance simply would not work in practice.\n\n  That is Charles Kahn, President of the Health Insurance Association \nof America.\n  Let's look at other comments of health insurers on the GOP plan \nendorsed by Senator Gramm and Governor Bush.\n\n       Private drug insurance policies are doomed from the start. \n     The idea sounds good, but it cannot succeed in the real \n     world. I don't know of an insurance company that would offer \n     a drug-only policy like that or even consider it.\n\n  Charles Kahn, President of the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica.\n  Health insurers tell us that the Bush Republican plan is doomed \nbecause no insurance companies are going to do it.\n  Here is Cecil Bykerk, Executive Vice President of the Mutual of Omaha \ncompanies, who says:\n\n       I am convinced that stand-alone drug policies won't work.\n\n  You have a real plan by Al Gore for voluntary benefits under \nMedicare--a program that is revered by seniors. The fact is that the \nRepublican plan, by the very companies that are making life miserable \nfor seniors--HMOs, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies--\nis a complete sham.\n  Things are getting hot around here. It is ``happy season.'' It is \npolitical season. I think we have to get back to reality.\n  Let's realize that the words used by my friend, Senator Gramm from \nTexas, come straight out of the Republican campaign strategy book--call \nit big government, call it one size fits all; if you don't like the \nMedicare program, then you ought to support Governor Bush's plan \nbecause in 4 years he does away with Medicare.\n  Let's take a look at this one more time.\n  The Senate Democratic bill, which is essentially the Gore plan, is \naffordable for all seniors. It is voluntary. It will work.\n  The House Republican plan and the one that is discussed by Phil Gramm \nis a sham. The insurance companies say they can't do it.\n  Thank you very much. I thank my colleague from Florida for allowing \nme to go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the past 3 days I have been discussing \nthe need to reform Medicare and the fundamental reform of shifting \nMedicare from being a program that focuses on sickness and dealing with \ndisease and the consequences of accidents after they happen, to a \nhealth care system that focuses on wellness and maintaining the highest \npossible quality of life. I pointed out that an essential ingredient of \nany wellness strategy is prescription drugs. Prescription drugs are a \nmodality in virtually every form of therapy which is designed to \nreverse disease conditions or to manage those conditions.\n  Yesterday, I talked about the fact that the prescription drug benefit \nfor senior Americans should be provided through the Medicare program. \nIt is the program which the seniors themselves have indicated over and \nover that they believe in, they trust, they have confidence in, and \nthat they would like it to be the program through which this additional \nbenefit would be added to all the other benefits that are available \nthrough Medicare. They would also like prescription drugs to be \navailable through Medicare.\n  In the context of the discussion of our colleague from California, I \nmust point out that while the seniors are saying they want to have a \nprescription drug benefit administered through Medicare, the Governors \nof the States are saying they do not want to have the responsibility \nfor administering a prescription drug benefit; it is not our job nor \nshould it be our financial responsibility to be involved in \nprescription drugs for a group of Americans who have since 1965 been \ncovered by a national program and not a State-by-State program.\n  I would like to talk about the issue of cost and which alternative \nbefore us has the best opportunity to serve not only the interests of \nthe 39 million seniors but all Americans in terms of injecting some \ncontrol over an out-of-control, spiraling increase in the cost of \npharmaceutical drugs.\n  Let me use as an illustration what has happened to a constituent of \nmine, Mrs. Elaine Kett. Mrs. Kett is a 77-year-old widow from Vero \nBeach, FL. She lives on a fixed income of approximately $20,000 a year, \nwhich means that her income is above the level that would provide \nbenefits for her under the kind of plan that my Teutonic cousin from \nTexas has indicated he would support.\n  Like many of my constituents, Mrs. Kett sent me a list of all the \nprescription drugs that her physician has indicated are medically \nnecessary for her wellness and quality of life. These are the lists of \nMrs. Elaine Kett's drugs. As you will see when you add up all the costs \nof the drugs which she used in 1999, the total cost was $10,053.36. \nMrs. Kett has already said her income is $20,000 a year. Fifty cents \nout of every dollar of Mrs. Kett's income was consumed in paying for \nthe prescription drugs necessary for her life, wellness, and quality.\n  In her letter, Mrs. Kett writes:\n\n       This is killing me because my income is just a bit more \n     than double the cost of these drugs.\n\n  Then she adds a postscript.\n\n       P.S.--Someone said these are the golden years, only the \n     gold is going into someone else's pocket.\n\n  There are millions of Americans just like Mrs. Kett. Passing a real \nprescription drug benefit to cover Mrs. Kett and all Medicare \nbeneficiaries should be a priority for this session of the Congress.\n\n  Today, we will examine one of the key reasons why so many seniors are \nunable to purchase the medications which their physicians have said are \nmedically necessary. The reason is cost.\n  Prescription drug prices are growing so quickly that seniors and, I \nwould argue, most Americans cannot keep up. In July, Families USA \nreleased a report that concluded:\n\n       The growing reliance on prescription drugs by the elderly \n     and the mounting costs of those drugs is a crisis for \n     America's senior citizens.\n\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\n\n  The elderly already pay a significant portion of prescription drugs \nexpenditures out of their pockets. Today, many seniors are without any \nprescription drug coverage.\n  The traditional ways in which seniors have been covered for \nprescription drugs--which have included employers who provided those \nbenefits to their retirees through the Medicaid program if they were \nmedically indigent or through Medigap policies if they could afford the \noften exorbitant costs, and through HMOs which provided prescription \ndrugs as a benefit--are constricting in terms of who they will cover \nand what they will cover.\n  So every week, more seniors are placed in the position of either \nhaving to cover their entire prescription drug costs or a larger \nproportion of that cost.\n  Today, almost one out of three seniors lacks any prescription drug \ncoverage. Over 50 percent of Medicare beneficiaries lack coverage at \nsome point during any given year. For those fortunate enough to have \nprescription drug coverage, the coverage is diminishing.\n  Thus, unless seniors are assured of prescription drug coverage \nthrough Medicare, many will find that needed medications are \nunavailable.\n  If it is true that the lack of prescription drug coverage has reached \na crisis level for seniors, then why have we not yet enacted a real, \naffordable, and comprehensive prescription drug benefit under Medicare?\n  The answer, I suspect, includes the fact that the pharmaceutical \ncompanies may have erected an effective blockade to the enactment of a \nprescription drug benefit through Medicare.\n  In fact, the watchdog group, ``Public Citizen,'' reports that drug \ncompanies spent $83.6 million in lobbying costs this year alone.\n  I would suspect from looking at the television ads run by the \nindustry that much of those moneys have been spent on lobbying efforts \nagainst the passage of a universal, affordable Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  Why do the pharmaceutical companies cringe at a Medicare prescription \ndrug proposal? It is because they know the power of the marketplace. As \nlong as 39 million senior Americans have to deal, one by one, and as \nlong as almost one-third of those have to deal without any assistance \nfrom any other source in the purchase of their prescription drugs, the \nmarket will not function. There is no effective purchaser-seller \nrelationship.\n  What we do know is that when there is an effective market, prices can \nbe restrained. We know it through the Veterans' Administration, which \nis able to purchase the exact same prescription drugs Mrs. Kett has \nbeen purchasing, but at substantially lower prices because they are \nusing the power of a large purchaser for the benefit of American \nveterans. State Medicaid programs know this because they are using the \npower of their large purchases for the benefit of the million medically \nindigent within their States. HMOs know the power of the marketplace \nbecause they purchase their prescription drugs on a wholesale basis and \nthen share those benefits with HMO beneficiaries.\n  With or without the support of the pharmaceutical companies, we must \nseek relief for seniors who are the victims of this crisis. The cost of \nprescription drugs is skyrocketing. We owe it to our seniors to examine \nthe reasons and then to act.\n  In 1999, the prices of the 50 prescription drugs most used by older \nAmericans increased 2 to 3 times the rate of overall inflation. In 1 \nyear, the 50 most used prescription drugs by American seniors increased \nby 2 to 3 times the rate of overall inflation.\n  The numbers speak for themselves: Lorazepam, used to treat conditions \nincluding anxiety, convulsions, and Parkinson's disease, rose by 409 \npercent, 27 times the rate of inflation, from January 1994 through \nJanuary 2000. Imdur, a drug used to treat angina, rose eight times the \nrate of inflation. And Lanoxin, used to treat congestive heart failure, \nrose at six times the rate of inflation.\n  Not only are the prices of drugs escalating at a rapid pace in the \nUnited States, but prices charged to Americans are also flat out \nincomprehensible.\n  We have all heard that prices of prescription drugs in other \ncountries--including our neighbors, Canada and Mexico--are generally \nsubstantially lower than prices in the United States. The heartburn \nmedicine Prilosec, the world's best seller, the largest selling \nprescription drug, costs $3.30 per pill in the United States. What is \nthe price in Canada? One dollar and forty-seven cents. The allergy drug \nClaritin costs almost $2 a pill in the United States. What does it cost \nelsewhere? Forty-one cents in Great Britain and 48 cents in Australia. \nWe are talking about exactly the same drug produced by the same \nmanufacturer.\n  A constituent from Springhill, FL, called my office yesterday \ndemanding to know why drug prices are so much lower in Mexico and \nCanada than they are in his hometown. I can't answer that question. \nFrankly, I don't think anyone can answer that question. Pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers have been the top-ranked U.S. industry for profits as a \npercentage of revenue throughout the past decade. After-tax profits for \nthe pharmaceutical industry average 17 percent of sales. By way of \ncomparison, the average for all industries was 5 percent. The effective \ntax rate for the pharmaceutical industry is 16 percent. The effective \ntax rate for all manufacturing companies is 23 percent; 31 percent for \nwholesale and retail trade, financial services, and insurance and real \nestate, and an average of 27 percent for all industry.\n\n  While millions of seniors are sacrificing their last dollar, as is \nMrs. Kett, to pay for medication, the pharmaceutical manufacturers are \ntaking in higher profits than any other industry in the United States \nof America.\n  Money does not take precedence over health. Profits cannot be the top \npriority when public health is compromised. We have that responsibility \nas the representative of those Americans to take action.\n  One of the things we ought to do in addition to adding prescription \ndrugs as a part of Medicaid is to assure public access to true drug \nprices as opposed to the mythic average wholesale price. This would be \none step to encourage accountability among drug manufacturers. Rapidly \nescalating prices and inequitable prices across borders warrant an \ninvestigation and consideration of prescription drug costs containment.\n  I submit that by having Medicare as a new force in the marketplace, \nnot through regulation or cost control but by using the principles of \nAdam Smith in a capitalist society, that with an effective purchaser of \ndrugs for our 39 million seniors, we can see a substantial reduction in \nthe price of pharmaceuticals for them, and all Americans will \nindirectly benefit. As public servants, we have a fundamental \nresponsibility to protect all of our citizens.\n  We all recognize that millions of seniors in America are struggling \nto pay for prescription drugs, so it seems clear our goal in the Senate \nshould be to assure that our prescription drug benefit for seniors and \npeople with disabilities is included in Medicare.\n  Our proposal is that Medicare would utilize an intermediary referred \nto as a ``pharmacy benefit manager.'' There would be two or more of \nthese managers in each region of the country. They would be the ones \nresponsible for negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies and then \npassing on those benefits to the ultimate senior user. We cannot \nachieve these kinds of benefits through the fractured plan that relies \nupon private insurance. We cannot assure these benefits by a plan which \nis fractured through 50 States. We can only assure to our seniors the \nbenefits of effective control by the marketplace if we place this plan \nwithin the Medicare program.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks and look forward \nto a further discussion of prescription drug prices that we face in \nthis Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson).

Mr. President, I want to talk today about the issue of \nprescription drugs. Some of my colleagues have already talked about \nthis issue at some length. Let me add to that.\n  In January of this year, on a cold, snowy day, a group of North \nDakota\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\nsenior citizens and I drove from North Dakota to Canada. It was not \nmuch of a drive, as a matter of fact, from Pembina, ND, to Emerson, \nCanada. We went to Canada to allow these senior citizens to purchase \nprescription drugs in Emerson, because the same drug that is marketed \nin Canada--in the same bottle, made by the same company--is sold in \nmost cases for a fraction of the price for which it is sold in the \nUnited States.\n  I want to illustrate that, if I may. I ask unanimous consent to use, \non the floor of the Senate, two pill bottles. These bottles are for a \nmedicine called Zocor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The bottles are slightly different, one is bigger than \nthe other, but Zocor is sold both in Canada and the United States. \nZocor is one of a number of cholesterol-lowering drugs. In fact, Dan \nReeves, coach of the Atlanta Falcons, has an advertisement saying he \ntakes a similar drug to lower his cholesterol following some heart \nproblems he had.\n  In any event, Zocor is an FDA-approved drug produced by the same \ncompany, often in the same FDA-approved plant. Yet, this bottle of \nZocor is sold in Winnipeg, Canada, for $1.82 per caplet. But if you are \nan American who is using Zocor to lower your cholesterol, you pay $3.82 \nper tablet. Again, if you buy it in Canada, it is $1.82 per tablet. But \nin the United States, the same tablet, by the same company, is not \n$1.82, but $3.82.\n  The Senate just finished yesterday a debate about normal trade \nrelations. This used to be called most-favored-nation status. Do you \nknow what the situation is with respect to prescription drug prices? We \nhave least-favored-customer status for the American consumer. Why do I \nsay this? Because prescription drug prices here are higher than \nanywhere else in the world. Why should the American consumer pay prices \nthat are 10 times, or 5 times, or triple or double the price paid by \neveryone else in the world for the same prescription drugs made in the \nsame plants by the same companies?\n  The answer is that U.S. consumers should not be least favored \nconsumers as they are forced to be by the pharmaceutical drug industry. \nWe can change that. How can we change it? We can change it by allowing \nour pharmacists and our distributors to be able to access the same FDA-\napproved prescription drug in Canada or in other countries--sold by the \nsame company and produced in an FDA-inspected plant--at a lower price \nand pass the savings along to their customers. If we did that, the \npharmaceutical industry would be required to reprice their prescription \ndrugs in this country and reduce their prices.\n  I want to talk about Sylvia Miller. Sylvia Miller is one of the \nsenior citizens who went to Canada with me. She is from Fargo, ND. A \ncolumnist in Fargo wrote a piece about Sylvia Miller. Let me just \nacquaint you with Sylvia Miller by reading from this piece:\n\n       Sylvia Miller isn't one to complain, but few people would \n     blame her if she chose to complain just a little bit. . . . \n     Sylvia knows that life isn't always easy, that people \n     struggle with the lows and look forward to the highs. . . . \n     She's had her share of dark days in her 70 years of life on \n     this earth.\n       The 1980s were a pretty rough decade for her. She beat \n     breast cancer in 1981, then lung cancer eight years later. \n     She's a tough lady.\n\n  This article says she and her husband lived most of their lives in \nDurbin and then moved to Fargo in 1987, after ``we were flooded out by \nwater coming cross country--the basement filled up nearly to the \nceiling.''\n\n  Sylvia went with me to Emerson, Canada, 5 miles across the border, \nbecause she wanted to buy her prescription drugs at a better price. \nThis article says Sylvia is a pleasant person. I know that because I \nknow Sylvia. It also says she leads a disciplined life. She has to. She \nhas diabetes. She also has asthma, and she has a heart that could be \nstronger. She tests her blood sugar level several times a day, eats \nwisely and at the right times, and the article goes on to say she gives \nherself shots four times a day, mixing three different insulins, uses \ntwo different inhalers for lungs which function below normal capacity, \nand she requires seven different prescription drugs every month. Last \nyear, she received $4,700 from Social Security, and her prescription \ndrug bill was more than $4,900. She says: Things don't quite add up, do \nthey?\n  On our trip to Canada, I stood with Sylvia and the others in this \nlittle one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada. The exact same \nprescription drugs you can buy in this tiny drugstore are sold 5 miles \nsouth, in Pembina, ND, or 120 miles south in Fargo, ND. The difference \nis not in the pill--it is the same pill, same color, same shape, made \nin the same plant, marketed by the same company. The difference? Price. \nAmericans are the least favored consumers. They pay the highest prices.\n  So a group of senior citizens who pay too much for prescription \ndrugs--such as Sylvia, who gets $4,700 on Social Security and has a \n$4,900 prescription drug bill--are trying to get a better price for the \ndrugs they need to lead a good life by traveling to Canada.\n  These senior citizens should not have to load up in a van on a cold \nwinter morning and drive to Canada. The Customs Service will allow \nindividuals to bring back from Canada a small amount of prescription \ndrugs for their personal use. But there is a Federal law that says a \npharmacist from Grand Forks, ND, or Montana or Vermont, can't go to \nCanada and access that same drug and come back and pass the savings \nalong to their customers. Federal law says you can't do that. We aim to \nchange that Federal law.\n  The Senate has already passed our proposal. Senator Jeffords, Senator \nGorton, Senator Wellstone and I, and a range of others have worked to \npass this plan in the Senate. Our proposal says: Let's allow U.S. \npharmacists and distributors to go to other countries and access the \nidentical prescription drugs, approved by the FDA, at a lower price, \nbring them back, and pass the savings along to the American \nconsumer. Of course, if we get this plan signed into law, what will \nhappen is that the pharmaceutical industry will be required to reprice \nthese drugs in this country.\n\n  Now, guess what. The pharmaceutical industry is spending a fortune to \ntry to defeat this proposal. It is in a conference committee. I am one \nof the conferees. The conference isn't even meeting. Why isn't it \nmeeting? Because people have heartburn over this proposal, and they \nwant to kill it.\n  The pharmaceutical industry said the 11 former Food and Drug \nAdministration Commissioners have come out in opposition to the \nproposal. Well, yesterday, I showed a letter that we received from \nDavid Kessler, the former Commissioner of the Food and Drug \nAdministration under Presidents Bush and Clinton. I want to tell my \ncolleagues what he says:\n\n       The Senate bill which allows only the importation of FDA \n     approved drugs, manufactured in approved FDA facilities, and \n     for which the chain of custody has been maintained, addresses \n     my fundamental concerns.\n\n  He is not opposing what we are trying to do. This is a former FDA \nCommissioner.\n  Dr. Kessler says further:\n\n       I believe the importation of these products could be done \n     without causing a greater health risk to the American \n     consumers than currently exists.\n\n  We need to give the FDA some additional resources to make sure we do \nnot have counterfeit drugs imported. The pharmaceutical industry says \nthis is an issue of safety. It is not. Here is an FDA Commissioner who \nsays this can be done safely as long as you have safeguards. The \npharmaceutical industry says this debate is about safety. They know \nbetter than that. It is about profits. Whose profits? Their profits.\n  Donna Shalala, who is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has \nalso written us a letter. She has indicated she believes that the \nSenate approach is an approach that can work. Secretary Shalala has \nsaid: ``With respect to the three amendments now in conference''--one \nof which is the Jeffords-Dorgan amendment I am talking about that was \npassed by the Senate--``we believe the Jeffords amendment represents a \npromising approach'' that can be effective if Congress provides new and \nefficient resources--which we intend to do--to the FDA.\n  So the head of the Department of Health and Human Services says this \ncan be done safely as well, as long as we provide additional resources \nto the FDA.\n  But, again, today, for those who are trying to kill this proposal, I \nwould like to offer another challenge. Of\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\ncourse, no one has ever accepted the challenge, but I am interested in \nfinding just one Member of Congress--one man or woman serving in the \nSenate or in the House out of 535 of us--to stand up on the floor of \nthe Senate or House and say: I believe the American consumer should be \ntreated as the least favored consumer by the pharmaceutical industry. I \nsupport that. I believe it, and I think we ought to leave it the way it \nis.\n  I want one Member of Congress to stand up and say that. I want one \nMember of Congress to stand up and say: With respect to Zocor, a \nprescription drug to lower cholesterol, I believe that Americans ought \nto have to pay $3.82 per tablet for the same medicine for which the \npharmaceutical industry will charge the Canadians only $1.82 per \ntablet. A similar discount is provided to the Italians, the Germans, \nand the English, and the Swedes, and the rest of the countries, because \nthe big drug companies are charging Americans the highest prices in the \nworld.\n  I am not asking for the Moon here. I am only asking for one Member of \nCongress to stand up and support the pharmaceutical industry's pricing \npolicies. And no one will. Because they want to kill this under the \ncover of darkness. They want to kill this by not having a conference, \nand by dropping it during some closed meeting in some crevice of this \nCapitol Building.\n\n  This is not an issue without names and faces and consequences. Sylvia \nMiller went to Canada with me to purchase prescription drugs at a much \nlower price, as did other senior citizens. But it ought not have to be \nthat way. There is no reason anybody ought to have to go anywhere else \nin order to access the same prescription drug for half the price they \npay in the United States.\n  That is unfair to the U.S. consumer. We can change it. And we can \nchange it without compromising safety. We can change it, and should, \nand will.\n  Let me mention a word about the prescription drug industry. I happen \nto think we benefit mightily from much of what they do. When they \ndevelop a new prescription drug, good for them. But much of the new \nwork in prescription drug development is coming from public investment \nthrough the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere. We are making \nsubstantial taxpayer-funded investments in research. Much of that \nresearch is then taken by the pharmaceutical industry and used to \nproduce new medicines, for which they charge higher prices to the \nAmerican consumer than anyone else in the world. That is not fair.\n  I want the pharmaceutical industry to be profitable, but profiting in \nways that are unfair to the U.S. consumer should not be allowed.\n  The pharmaceutical industry has said--and incidentally, they have \nsent people all around North Dakota to newspapers and TV stations with \nthis message--that if what Senator Dorgan wants to do gets done, there \nwill be less research done on new medicines.\n  Interesting point. The pharmaceutical industry spends more money for \nresearch in Europe than it does in the United States, by just a bit. In \nother words, more research is done by that industry in Europe than in \nthe United States. They say: If we charge less in the United States, \nsomehow we will do less research. Yet they charge less in Europe and do \nmore research there. And they charge more for prescription drugs in \nthis country than in any country in Europe and do slightly less \nresearch. If their argument had any validity at all why is that the \ncase?\n  To those in the pharmaceutical industry, I understand that you have a \nresponsibility to your stockholders. I understand that. You have the \nresponsibility to earn a decent profit. I understand that. Yet the Wall \nStreet Journal says that the pharmaceutical industry has profits that \nare ``the envy of the corporate world.''\n  We am not talking about price controls with the Senate proposal. We \nare simply saying if the global economy is good for the pharmaceutical \nindustry--and every other industry in this world--then why is the \nglobal economy not able to work for Sylvia Miller? Why can't Sylvia \nMiller's pharmacist go to Winnipeg, Canada, and purchase Zocor, and \nbring it back and sell it at a price that is much less than is now \ncharged in this country?\n  The pharmaceutical industry will say: Gee, some of these countries \nhave price controls. That is true. Some of these countries--many of \nthem--say: All you can charge for prescription drugs is your cost plus \na profit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the inconveniences of the global \neconomy is that you have advantages and disadvantages, and you have to \nlive with both. When you move products around in a global economy--and \nthe pharmaceutical industry certainly does--you get the advantages of \nimporting lower-priced compounds and chemicals with which to make \nprescription drugs. So the big drug companies benefit from the global \neconomy. But one of the inconveniences of the global economy is that \nthe conditions that exist in the country you are purchasing from comes \nwith that product.\n\n  Today, if I were to go up to my colleagues--and I will not--and turn \nover their necktie, I would find some of them are wearing a necktie \nmade in China. So I say to them: If you are wearing a necktie made in \nChina, governed by a Communist government, no doubt, when you purchased \nthe necktie, you were contributing to the salary of the Communist \nleader of China. Do you feel comfortable with that necktie?\n  But, of course, no one set out to give comfort to any government \nanywhere. They simply bought a necktie. That is why, when the \npharmaceutical industry says, ``if you are able to access the lower \npriced drug in Canada, you are importing some sort of price controls,'' \nI say nonsense. All you are doing is taking advantage of the global \neconomy, the buying and selling of goods back and forth across borders.\n  Yes, it is inconvenient that some countries--in fact, many \ncountries--do have price controls. But if pharmacists were able to \naccess products in other countries at a lower price, why should they be \nprevented from moving them into this country? The Senate plan would \nallow this with complete safeguards, only for medicines that are \napproved by the FDA, only those medicines that are manufactured in an \nFDA-approved plant. Additional resources to the FDA would allow you to \nmake certain you are not moving counterfeit products in and out of this \ncountry. With safeguards such as these in place, former FDA \nCommissioner David Kessler, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna \nShalala, and others say it is perfectly appropriate and perfectly \nacceptable to give consumers, such as Sylvia Miller, the opportunity to \nhave lower priced drugs in this country.\n\n  I will finish by asking this: Is there any Member of the House or \nSenate who believes the U.S. consumer should be the least favored \nconsumer in international trade on prescription drugs? Does anybody \nstand up in support of this? I fail to see one, in all my time \ndiscussing this over the last year and a half, who will stand up and \nsay: Let me be the first to say I support the highest prices for \nAmerican consumers on prescription drugs. No one will do that because \nthey don't dare do it publicly. They understand how unfair this pricing \nscheme is.\n  That is what Senator Jeffords and I, and Senators Gorton and \nWellstone and many others, are intending to change. The Senate has \npassed our proposal by a wide margin. It is now in conference. Those \nwho have the strings to pull want to dump it and kill it by not having \na conference convened. I happen to be a conferee. I intend to be at a \nconference at some point and fight for this proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from Illinois is recognized to speak for up \nto 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I salute my colleague, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. He has been a leader on the issue of prescription drugs \nand has challenged all of us to focus on an issue which most American \nfamilies understand completely.\n  They know what it costs to go to the pharmacy, if you are not lucky \nenough to have good insurance. They know what it means when you go into \nyour local pharmacy and they tell you how much a drug costs and you \nalmost faint.\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\n  They say: Wait a minute; don't you have some insurance coverage?\n  Well, yes, I think I do.\n  This happened to me recently in Springfield, IL. It ended up costing \nme a fraction of what it would have cost. It was a prescription where I \nhad to think twice about whether I wanted to spend that kind of money \non it, if the insurance didn't cover it. But that was an option for me; \nI am in pretty healthy shape. Imagine a person who is really struggling \nto just survive, to stay healthy and strong, and the choices they have \nto make when they have limited income.\n  What I am talking about is not an outrageous situation or an \noutlandish idea. It happens every single day. It happens across \nAmerica. People, families across America, keep looking to Washington \nand saying: Do you get it? Do you understand this? Do you care?\n  I have a quote one of my staff came up with that I thought was \napropos. It is very old. It goes back to 1913. President Woodrow Wilson \nwrote it to a friend. He was venting his frustration because several \nDemocrats on the Senate Finance Committee were blocking something he \nconsidered to be a high priority. He wrote:\n\n       Why should public men, Senators of the United States, have \n     to be led and stimulated to what all the country knows to be \n     their duty? Why should they see less clearly, apparently, \n     than anyone else, what the straight path to service is? To \n     whom are they listening? Certainly not to the voice of the \n     people when they quibble and twist and hesitate.\n\n  That is what this debate gets down to. Are the men and women elected \nto the Senate and the House of Representatives really listening to the \npeople back home? If we were, would we be wasting a minute and not \ndealing with the prescription drug benefits people need to survive?\n  Yet when we take a look at what has been proposed, they are \ndramatically different, the two major proposals coming from the two \nmajor candidates for President. The one that comes from Al Gore and Joe \nLieberman on the Democratic side suggests to treat the prescription \ndrug benefit as a Medicare benefit; to say, yes, it is available to \nevery American. It is universal. It is an option which every American \ncan take, and we will protect you under Medicare. You will know that \nthere is a limit to your out-of-pocket expenses. It is simple. It is \nstraightforward. It is consistent with the Medicare program that has \nbeen around for over 40 years.\n  Frankly, there are some people who don't care for it. The drug \ncompanies don't care for it. They are making very generous profits \nevery single year, and they know if all of the people under Medicare \ncame together and bargained with them on drug prices and drug costs, \ntheir profits may go down. That is why they resist it. That is why this \nspecial interest group has been so good at stopping this Congress from \ndoing what the American people want done. Their profits come \nfirst, unfortunately, in the Senate--not the people in this country, \nnot the families struggling to pay the bills.\n\n  On the other side, they make a proposal which sounds good but just \nwill not work. Under Governor Bush's proposal on prescription drugs, he \nasserts, for 4 years we will let the States handle it. There are fewer \nthan 20 States that have any drug benefits. Illinois is one of them, I \nmight add. His home State of Texas has none. But he says: Let the \nStates handle it for 4 years; let them work it out.\n  In my home State of Illinois, I am glad we have it. But it certainly \nisn't a system that one would recommend for the country. Our system of \nhelping to pay for prescription drugs for seniors applies to certain \nillnesses and certain drugs. If you happen to be an unfortunate person \nwithout that kind of coverage and protection, you are on your own. That \nis hardly a system for America.\n  It is far better to take the approach which has been suggested by Mr. \nGore and Mr. Lieberman, to have a universal plan that applies to \neveryone. Let's not say that a person's health and survival depends on \nthe luck of the zip code, where you happen to live, whether your State \nis generous or not. I don't think that makes sense in America. I think \nwe are better than that.\n  We proved it with Medicare. We didn't say under Medicare: We will let \nevery single State come up with a health insurance plan for seniors. We \nsaid: We will have an American plan, a national plan, and every single \nAmerican--Hawaii, Alaska, and the lower 48--everyone who can benefit \nfrom it gets the same shot at quality health care. And it worked. The \ncritics said, in the 1960s; that is big government; that is socialism, \nMedicare will be the end of health care as we know it in America. \n``Socialized medicine,'' they called it.\n  Wrong, completely wrong. Ask the people in the hospitals and the \ndoctors today what Medicare has meant. It has meant they are able to \ngive the elderly in America quality health care. Just take a look at \nthe raw statistics. Seniors are living longer today than they did in \nthe 1960s. They are healthier. A lot of good things have come from \nMedicare.\n  We believe the same standard should be applied when it comes to \nprescription drugs. Let us base this on the Medicare system. If you \ndoubt for a moment that this is a serious problem, I wish you would go \nto your local pharmacy and ask your pharmacist. When I held hearings \nacross Illinois, I brought in doctors and pharmacists and seniors to \ntalk about this issue. The people who were the most adamant about the \nneed for reform were the pharmacists, the men and women in the white \ncoats behind the counter who get the prescriptions from the doctor and \ntry to fill them for the patient and have to face the reality of the \ncost. Those are the men and women who know every single day that there \nare seniors who are not filling prescriptions, taking half of what they \nare supposed to, ignoring the request and, frankly, the best advice of \ntheir doctors because they cannot afford otherwise.\n  Here we stand in the Senate, 7 weeks away from a national election, \nan election where the American people say a prescription drug benefit \nis the highest health care priority, and we are not prepared to do \nanything. Is it any wonder that people looking at the Congress of the \nUnited States wonder whether we are paying attention to the reality of \nlife for families across this country? When people can go across the \nborder into Canada and buy the same exact drug sold in the United \nStates, made in the same laboratory, subject to the same FDA \ninspection, for a fraction of the cost, how in the world can we stand \nhere and say there is nothing we can do about it? There is something we \ncan do about it. There is something we must do about it.\n  This election is a referendum on whether this Congress has the will \nto respond to families in need. A lady in Chicago, IL, received a \ndouble lung transplant. What a miracle.\n  Years ago, that was unthinkable. Now it is possible. It works. She \nstood before me and looked good several years after it occurred. But \nshe said:\n\n       Senator, it cost me $2,500 a month for the \n     immunosuppressive drugs to stay alive. I cannot afford it. So \n     what I have done, frankly, is to give up everything I have on \n     earth and move into my son's home, where I live in the \n     basement. I asked for Medicaid at the Department of Public \n     Aid in Illinois and for the money to pay for my prescription \n     drugs each month. I fill out the forms every month to try to \n     make sure I qualify for the drugs.\n\n  She said:\n\n       Senator, one month I missed it. I didn't get the paperwork \n     back in time. For one month, I didn't take the drugs and I \n     was worried sick. I went back to the doctor after that month \n     and he said, ``Don't ever let that happen again. You had \n     irreversible lung damage that occurred during that one-month \n     period of time.''\n\n  Think about the burden on that poor lady's shoulders. How many of us \ndream of being dependent on our children in our elderly and late years? \nNone of us wants that. Many times my mother has said to me, ``I don't \nwant to be a burden.''\n  That woman is living in the basement of her kid's home. She has no \nplace to turn and is wondering if she can get the paperwork in on time \nto qualify for Medicaid. Missing that opportunity, she could lose the \nchance for the miracle of two new lungs that gave her new life, losing \nthe chance for that miracle to continue.\n  That is the reality of what is happening. Hers is the most extreme \ncase, and I remember it because of that. But as I went across my State, \npeople said: Senator, I get $800 a month from Social Security and it \ncosts me $400 a month for prescription drugs. I don't have any \ninsurance to cover that.\n  A third of the seniors in this country have no insurance protection \nwhatsoever; a third have poor protection, and\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\na third are lucky because they worked in the right place and had the \nright retirement. They are covered and protected. When you hear stories \nand you come back to Washington, you think: Why are we here? The men \nand women here are supposed to be here to respond to the real needs of \nAmerica's families. Yet in this case, and in so many others, this \nCongress has come up empty. Missed opportunity after missed \nopportunity.\n  Let me suggest another thing to you. One thing I have noticed as I \nvisited families in my State of Illinois is that they talk about their \nchildren. They will brag about how good they are at playing soccer or \nplaying the piano or getting good grades. But then there will be a \npause, a hesitation, and they say: I wonder how we are ever going to \npay for that college education. I hear that over and over. New parents \nwith a little baby might say: He looks like his dad and he is sleeping \nall night, but how in the world are we going to pay for this kid's \ncollege?\n  That is a real concern. The people know the cost of a college \neducation has gone up dramatically. We did a survey in Illinois of \ncommunity colleges, private colleges, and public universities. Over a \n20-year period of time, when a child might consider being in college 20 \nyears later, what happened to the cost of tuition and fees at \nuniversities and colleges in my home State of Illinois? They have gone \nup over 250 percent and, in some cases, over 400 percent. So even if \nyou think you are putting enough money away today to cover what is \nalready a high cost of education, quadruple that cost and you are \ndealing with the reality of what that could cost in years to come.\n\n  So families say to me as a Senator and to those of us serving in \nCongress: Do you hear us? Do you understand it? You tell us that \neducation is good for our kids and for our country. What are you doing \nin Washington to help us out, to give us a helping hand?\n  The honest answer is: Absolutely nothing. There is something we can \ndo. Senator Chuck Schumer, my deskmate here from the State of New York, \nand Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, have been pushing for a plan that I \nthink makes a lot of sense. It is a plan the Democrats are proposing as \npart of this Presidential campaign. It is very simple and \nstraightforward. It says that you can take the cost of college tuition \nand fees and deduct them from your income. What it means is that up to \n$12,000 of tuition and fees can be deducted. For a family, that means \nthey are going to have a helping hand of around $3,000 each year to pay \nfor it. I wish it were more, but it is certainly a helping hand.\n  When I went to Rockford College in Rockford, IL, I said: What did the \naverage student graduate with in terms of debt? They said it was about \n$20,000. That is a lot of money when you are first out of college. Yet \nif the deductibility of college expenses were part of the law in \nAmerica, that student would be walking out with a debt of $5,000 or \n$6,000 instead of $20,000.\n  Wouldn't that be good for this country and for that family? Doesn't \nit give that young man or woman the right opportunity to make a choice \nof a job or a graduate education? I can't tell you how many young \npeople I ran into who said: Because of my college debts, I had to take \nthe best-paying job. I really want to be a teacher, but they don't pay \nenough. I got a chance to go with a dot-com and make a zillion, so I \nhad to do that.\n  We lost something there. We lost a potential teacher, someone who \nwanted to put his or her life into teaching others, but decided, \nbecause of the finances, to postpone it or never do it. That is \nreality.\n  If we look at that reality, the question is, What does Congress do to \nrespond? Instead of coming up with tax relief for middle-income \nfamilies to pay for college education expenses, the only tax relief \nbills we have come up with is for the wealthiest people--the so-called \nelimination of the death tax and the elimination of the marriage \npenalty tax. When you lift the lid and look inside, it ends up giving \nover 40 percent of the benefits to people making over $300,000 a year. \nExcuse me, but if I am making $25,000 a month in income, how much of a \ntax break do I need? My life is pretty good, thank you. And thank you, \nAmerica, for giving me the opportunity to have it. I don't need a tax \nbreak from this Congress.\n  But the families struggling to pay for college education expenses \ndeserve a tax break. If we really believe that the 21st century should \nbe the American century, we need to invest not only in helping families \nput their kids through college, but in helping workers who realize that \nadditional skills give them greater earning potential, the chance to \nget that training and education. Sometimes that costs money. If it is \ngoing to cost money and tuition and fees, they, too, should be able to \ndeduct it. Lifetime learning, lifelong learning is a reality today if \nyou want to be successful. You can't step back.\n  When I went into my Senate office representing Illinois 4 years ago \nand put the computer on my desk, believe me, I am not of an age where I \nam a computer wizard, but I am learning. I realize I have to learn to \nkeep up with this technology because it makes me more effective and \nefficient. Everybody is learning that lesson, whether you are in a \nclassroom or a workplace, and the people who want to prosper from that \nexperience and want to make their lives better sometimes need \nadditional training. So when we talk about the deductibility of these \nexpenses for lifelong learning and for college education, we are \ntalking about people setting out to improve themselves. It is not a \nhandout. These people are asking for an opportunity to be educated and \ntrained and skilled.\n\n  One of the bills we are going to debate this week is the H-1B visa. \nYou may not know what the term means, but basically it is a question as \nto how many people we will allow to immigrate into the U.S. to take \nhighly paid, unfilled jobs--jobs that require skills America's \nemployers say they can't find in the American workforce. Well, it is a \nreal problem. I think we need to have an expansion of the H-1B visa to \nallow people to come in from overseas to fill these jobs so American \ncompanies will stay in America, so that they will continue to prosper, \npay their taxes, profit by their ventures, and I think we can help \nthem.\n  But what a commentary on our workforce and our education system that \nwe continue to have to look overseas not for what used to be the brute \nforce of labor coming to build railroads and towns, but now they are \nthe most skilled people in the world. So if we say we are going to \nallow more people to come into this country to fill the highly skilled \njobs, don't we have a similar responsibility to the people and families \nof this country to explain how, the next time around, there will be \nAmericans skilled to fill these jobs? I think that is part of the \ndebate. Yet you won't hear much about it on the floor of this Senate. \nWe don't talk about education much here.\n  Some of my colleagues want to dismiss it as a State and local issue, \nthat the Federal Government has little or nothing to do with that. I \ndisagree. We should be giving tax relief to families to pay for higher \neducation and even more. When you look at the schools in America, there \nare genuine needs. I think everybody who has raised a family, as my \nwife and I have, appreciates that the more kids you have in the room, \nthe tougher it is to manage it. A teacher with 30 kids in a classroom \nhas her hands full. We have to talk about lower class sizes, smaller \nclasses with more individual attention.\n  On the Democratic side, we have proposed 100,000 new teachers who \nwill go into classrooms. Schools are growing and the population is \ngetting larger, and 100,000 teachers will cut back on the number of \nkids in a classroom and give a teacher a better chance to teach.\n  A teacher came up to me at O'Hare Airport in Chicago and said: I \nteach on the south side of Chicago. We qualified for the Federal \nprogram to have smaller classrooms. Thank you, Senator. It is working. \nThose kids are getting a better education.\n  I don't deserve the credit. It wasn't my idea. But I happen to \nsupport it. We should support more of it. We are not even discussing \neducation on the floor of the Senate. We are talking about H-1B visas \nto bring in more skilled employees from overseas. And we are not \ntalking about educating and training our kids in the next generation to \nfill those jobs. We have lost it in this debate. Somehow we are \nconsumed with things that other people think are much more important. I \ncan't think of\n\n[[Page S8787]]\n\nanything more important than education. Health care for prescription \ndrugs and education so kids have a better chance for their future makes \nall the sense in the world.\n  While we are talking about a better future, let me also address the \n10 million Americans who got up to go to work and went to work this \nmorning, and who go to work every single morning, not looking for a \ngovernment check but for a paycheck at the end of the week where they \nare paid $5.15 an hour. That is the minimum wage in this country, and \nit has been stuck there for over 2 years. Why? Because this Congress \nrefuses to give some of the hardest working people in America an \nincrease in the minimum wage. These are people who get up and go to \nwork every day, who are waiting on tables in the restaurants, and who \nmake the beds in the hotels. They are the day-care workers to whom we \nentrust our children, they are people working in nursing homes watching \nour parents and grandparents, and we refuse to give them an increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  For decades in this Capitol, this was not a partisan issue. From the \ntime Franklin Roosevelt created the minimum wage until the election of \nRonald Reagan, it was a bipartisan undertaking. We raise this wage \nperiodically so people can keep up with the cost of living in this \ncountry. But, sadly, it has become a partisan issue.\n  While we fight on the Democratic side to give 10 million Americans an \nincrease in the minimum wage, we are resisted on the other side of the \naisle. They don't want to see these increases. Sadly, it means that \npeople who are struggling to get by with $10,000 or $11,000 a year--\nand, frankly, have to turn to the Government for food stamps and look \nto other sources and more jobs--many of those people are single parents \nraising their kids, working at jobs with limited pay and limited \nrequirements for skills, trying to do their level best. We have refused \ntime and time again to increase the minimum wage in this country. That \nis a sad commentary on this Congress.\n  I also want to comment on the reality that we will be increasing \ncongressional pay this year, as we have with some frequency, to reflect \nthe cost-of-living adjustment. I think that is fair. But doesn't \nfairness require that we give the same consideration to people who are \nworking for $5.15 an hour? I hope my colleagues, Senate Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, will share my belief that this is something that \nabsolutely needs to be done.\n  Whether we are talking about health care or prescription drugs and \nfairness in paying people for what they work for, there is an agenda \nthat has gone unfilled in this Congress. It is an agenda which has been \nignored and about which the American people have a right to ask us to \ndo something.\n  I can tell you that as we talk about the future of this country and \nits economy, we are all applauding the fact that we have had the \nlongest period of economic expansion in our history. We have had 22 \nmillion new jobs created during the Clinton-Gore administration. There \nis more home ownership than anytime in our history. There are more \nsmall businesses being created, particularly women-owned small \nbusinesses, across America. We have seen our welfare rolls going down. \nThe incidence of violent crime is going down. We have seen an expansion \nof opportunity in this country that has been unparalleled. But if we \nsit back and want to rest on our accomplishments and our laurels, the \nAmerican people have a right to throw all of us out of office. Our \nresponsibility is to look ahead and say we can do better to improve \nthis country and make it better for our children and grandchildren.\n  This Congress has refused to look ahead. It has refused to say how we \ncan expand health care so that over 40 million Americans without any \nhealth insurance will have a chance to get the basic quality health \ncare on which all of us insist for ourselves and our family.\n  This Congress has refused to address the prescription drug needs of \nfamilies across America at a time of unparalleled prosperity in these \nUnited States.\n  This Congress has refused to look to the need of education when we \nknow full well that the benefits of our economy can only accrue to \nthose who are prepared to use them and who are prepared to compete in a \nglobal economy.\n  Yesterday, by an overwhelming vote, we voted for permanent normal \ntrade relations with China. I voted for that. It was 83-15. It was a \nsubstantially bipartisan rollcall. We said that country, which \nrepresents one-fifth of the world's population, is a market we need. I \nhope when the President signs the bill we will begin to see an opening \nof that market for our farmers and our businesses. But we will only be \nas good in the global economy as we are in terms of the skill and \neducation of America's workers.\n  We know full well that there will always be some country in the \nworld--if not China, some other country--that will pay a worker 5 cents \nan hour and they will take it. We also know that those workers have \nlimited education and limited skills, perhaps doing a manual labor job. \nAnd those jobs are always going to be cheaper overseas; that is a fact \nof life.\n  But if we are going to prosper in America from a global economy, we \nhave to bring our workforce beyond manual labor, beyond basic skills, \nand that means investing in our people. It is important to have the \nvery best technology, but it is even more important to have the very \nbest skilled people working in the workplace. We happen to think if we \nare going to keep this economy moving forward, we need to make certain \nwe don't do anything that is going to derail the economy.\n  We have seen some suggestions--for example, Governor Bush and some of \nhis Republican friends in the Senate who have suggested over a $1 \ntrillion tax cut that they want to see over the next 10 years. They \nhave suggested we change the Social Security system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, the legislation we will vote on after \nlunch contains a provision that will name a Federal courthouse in Grand \nForks, ND. A Federal building in Grand Forks, ND, will be named the \nJudge Ronald N. Davies Federal Building. I want to describe to my \ncolleagues something about Judge Ronald Davies.\n  Some of my colleagues may have had the opportunity to visit the \nNorman Rockwell exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in downtown \nWashington, DC. Among the many examples of Americana in the Gallery is \na famous painting of a little African American girl, hair in pigtails, \nhead held high, being escorted into a school by U.S. marshals. It was \nthe result of a ruling by an unassuming Federal judge, a son of North \nDakota, that allowed this Nation to take one large step forward in \nexpanding America's dream for all Americans.\n  Forty-three years ago this month, on September 7, 1957, a Federal \njudge from North Dakota was asked to go to Arkansas to sit as a Federal \njudge and render a decision on a case involving civil rights. \nSurrounded by security guards because of threats on his life, Judge \nRonald Davies carefully weighed the facts and the law and then issued \nan order that the New York Times\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\nlater said was a landmark decision in civil rights, ordering the \nintegration of the Little Rock public schools.\n  Most people will not know the name of Ron Davies, but Judge Davies is \none of North Dakota's proudest sons. He was made a Federal judge by the \nappointment of President Eisenhower in 1955. While on temporary \nassignment in Arkansas, he issued the decision that would become one of \nthe landmark decisions on the issue of civil rights. He required the \nintegration of the schools in Little Rock.\n\n  Judge Davies was not a tall man. In fact, he was just over 5 feet--\nabout 5 foot 1, 5 foot 2--but he will certainly be remembered as a \ngiant in the history of civil rights and integration. Despite threats \non his life and National Guardsmen guarding the doors, this man sat in \na courthouse and rendered the pivotal decision that will echo \nthroughout this Nation's history. He replied, ``I was only doing my \njob,'' when asked about that decision. He was unassuming and unwilling \nto be in the national spotlight. In fact one news program called him an \n``obscure judge.'' He agreed. He said, ``We judges are obscure and \nshould be.''\n  Back then, he was also called ``the stranger in Little Rock.'' But he \nwas no stranger to justice and no stranger to decency and no stranger \nto common sense. Men such as Judge Davies should be remembered. I think \nit is appropriate that we recognize this Federal judge with the fiery \nspirit, a man with an unerring sense of duty who went to Little Rock in \na very difficult circumstance and did his job.\n  When schoolchildren and citizens and visitors pass through the door \nof the Federal building in Grand Forks, ND, they will be reminded of \nthe courage Judge Davies showed America as he sat and did his job in \nthose difficult times in Little Rock. It was a turning point in our \nNation's history.\n  I can think of no better way to celebrate the life of Judge Davies, \nand also the important achievements his decision 43 years ago this \nmonth have rendered this country, than to put his name on the Federal \nbuilding in Grand Forks, ND. So when this legislation becomes law later \nthis year, that Federal building will be named the ``Ronald N. Davies \nFederal Building and United States Courthouse.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8788-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           prescription drugs\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the course of the last hour and a half, \nI have been both in committee and in my office. While in my office, I \nwatched a good deal of the discussion going on here on the floor by \nsome of my colleagues on the other side--Senator Graham from Florida, \nSenator Boxer from California, Senator Durbin from Illinois, and \nSenator Dorgan from North Dakota--talking about the issue of \nprescription drugs.\n  There isn't a Senator here who does not recognize the importance of \nthis issue primarily with the senior community in America today--\nprimarily with the poorer of that community who cannot afford some of \nthe new drugs that are on the market that are clearly improving their \nlifestyle, extending their health, and allowing many of our citizens to \nlive better and longer.\n  That is why some of us, if not all of us, for the last couple of \nyears have recognized the need to respond to the prescription drug \nissue within Medicare as a primary health provider in this country for \nour seniors. When that belief first came about, it came about in the \ncontext of the reform of Medicare. I think it is important to give a \nlittle history.\n  With a health care program in this country that is 30 years old, we \nbegan to recognize that it was in trouble; that it was continuing to \npay for health care needs that were sometimes no longer needed and \ncosts continued to go up. We were constantly working to adjust it.\n  In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we made adjustments. Some of \nthose were right; some of those were wrong. Some of those were \ninterpreted by the Federal health care administrators in a way that \nCongress didn't intend, and we are going to make some of those \ncorrections this year for nursing homes and hospitals. The fundamental \nquestion is and should be, Was Medicare providing the necessary health \ncare needs of our seniors?\n\n  Out of that grew the prescription drug issue. No question about it, \nas the President knows, these new designer drugs that are out on the \nmarket that are a result of our science, our technology, are doing \nwonderful things. They are not included. They are not a part of the old \nMedicare model that we created 30-plus years ago. That is why in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 this Congress and this Senate said: Let's \ncreate the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. \nLet's reform it to fit the 21st century and the needs of the seniors of \nAmerica in the 21st century, and let's do that in the context of \nshaping it differently, making sure prescription drugs are a piece of \nit. That will be the new health care paradigm.\n  The President appointed people. We appointed people. We worked. They \nstudied. We brought in the best health care experts in the country and \nthey brought about a report. Something happened along the way. We were \ngetting closer and closer to an election cycle, and it appeared \ntragically enough that the other side saw this much more as a political \nissue than a need for substantive reform. As a result, that commission \nreported it lacked the one vote necessary for a majority to report back \nto Congress its findings and its proposal for the Congress to act.\n  Interestingly enough, the two Democrats from the Senate, Senator \nBreaux and Senator Kerrey, who served on that committee, voted for the \nreport. They saw it as a major step in the right direction and, of \ncourse, the President's appointees were advised to vote against the \nreport, or so we understand. They voted against it. Eleven votes were \nneeded to approve the commission's recommendation; 10 of the 17 \ncommissioners voted yes. We needed one more and we simply did not get \nit.\n  Before the vote ever took place, President Clinton announced the \ncommission had failed and that his own advisers would draft a plan to \nserve the Medicare program. I think what he was saying was that his own \nadvisors would draft a political plan to serve the next Presidential \nelection.\n  The politics of Mediscare and prescription drugs moves now into the \npolitical arena. That announcement occurred in March of 1999. It \nliterally was the sounding of a trumpet, the sounding of the fact that \nprescription drugs and Medicare without reform would become a part of \nthe political mantra of the day; every Senator, Democrat and \nRepublican, recognizing that we had to deal with prescription drugs. In \nfact, it was interesting to me that Senator Breaux said: We are not \ngoing to fix Medicare; we are going to be looking for issues to beat \neach other over the head with once again.\n  That is what he said in the Congressional Record of March of 1999--a \nDemocrat, referring to the commission and a failure of the commission \nand a failure of this President to stand up and be counted for at a \ntime when we had a chance, a window of opportunity to make major \nnational reform in\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\nMedicare and to include prescription drugs in it. We would not be here \ntoday voting or debating this issue had that report come forward, been \ncrafted into law, in bill form, and been debated. We would have debated \nit. With that kind of bipartisan support it could have and it would \nhave happened. But it didn't happen. And tragically enough, it is not \ngoing to happen this year.\n  We are engaged in a national debate over which side can provide the \nbest form of prescription drug program for the seniors of America. The \ndebate in the field today between candidate George W. Bush and \ncandidate Vice President Al Gore has now moved to the floor of the \nSenate. Prior to that debate, the Congress, in its budget resolution, \nsaid: Let's put $200 million in there to deal with prescription drugs \nthis year so that seniors who are in true need, the truly neediest of \nthe senior community who are making those choices between food and \nprescription drugs could be cared for. I hope we can still get them.\n\n  While we have the national debate ongoing today between Governor Bush \nand Vice President Gore--and it is an appropriate debate to have--the \nVice President, I don't believe, deserves another bite at the apple. He \nhas had 8 years and he had a chance to go to this President and say: \nLet's do Medicare reform. Let's do it now in a bipartisan way. Let's \ntake this issue off the table.\n  That isn't what happened. It is just too ripe for politics. It is \njust too tasty an issue to engage in a national debate about it. That \nis what we are about today. It is now on the floor of the Senate. Vice \nPresident Gore has his prescription drug plan out; George W. Bush has \nproposed his; we will attempt to deal with ours.\n  I have the privilege of now serving on the Finance Committee. The \nFinance chairman has brought about a bill and we hope to have it on the \nfloor and we hope it will comply with the amount of money necessary in \nthe budget to fund this in the short term to deal with the problem in \nthe immediate sense. Governor Bush says: Let's deal with it now and \nlet's give truly needy seniors the solution to the problem now.\n  And Al Gore says: No, no, no; let's work on this--18 months, 2 years; \nWe will have a better plan; we will have an all-inclusive plan.\n  There are very real differences in what is proposed. Our Vice \nPresident says an all-Government plan, Government control, Government \nmanaged, universal for everyone. We are saying, no, no, we like the one \nin the model that the Governor from Texas has put up, with greater \nflexibility, more choice for seniors. It is very similar to what I \nhave, and very similar to what the Presiding Officer has, under \ninsurance, allowed to be provided for Federal employees by private \nproviders. There is flexibility to make choices.\n  I don't think I want a Federal warehouse in Boise, ID, distributing \ndrugs to seniors 500 miles away at the other end of the State. I want \nthe local pharmacy allowing the local senior to make the choice with \nhis or her doctor as to what their true needs are and for those needs \nto be covered in Medicare. That is what the seniors of America want. \nThey don't want the Government saying yes or the Government saying no.\n  There are very real and fundamental debates. I suspect we are going \nto hear Senators such as the Senator from Florida now on the floor--and \nthis is an important issue in a State with so many seniors, as has the \nState of Florida, and I don't dispute that. But it is important that we \nengage in this debate and that the American public stop and say, gee, \nis there a free lunch and are there free drugs? The answer is no. It \nwill cost someone, and it will cost $200 or $300 or $400 or $500 \nmillion, or $12 billion a year to do a universal program, or a lot more \nthan that. We know it will be very costly. Therefore, it is right and \nproper to decide who can afford to pay and who can't afford to pay.\n  How about those seniors who have their own health care program now \nthat pays? Why would Al Gore want to wipe out those insurance programs \nand go to a Government program? I don't think any seniors who study the \nprogram and understand that are going to like that idea. They are going \nto want their own health care program that they paid for and that maybe \nis a condition of their retirement coming down from the company they \nhad worked for all their lives. And they ought to have it. That is the \nkind of flexibility and the dynamics we ought to have in the \nmarketplace.\n  This Congress, in a bipartisan way, will ultimately solve this \nproblem. We can do it this year a little bit of the way to help the \ntruly needy. That is what we ought to do. I hope we can resolve that in \na bipartisan fashion. Then we will allow the national debate to go on. \nWe will ask every senior to compare the score charts, the Governor Bush \nplan versus the Al Gore plan--a Government plan versus a plan of \nchoice, versus a plan of individualism; a relationship between a doctor \nand his or her patient versus a relationship with a Government \nprovider.\n  That choice is going to be very simple for Americans when they are \ngiven it in a clear, understandable way. That is why I am on the floor \ntoday. Let's back away from the clutter and the finger pointing. Let's \ncompare the plans--they are both out there now--on a point-by-point \nbasis, and let us do what we can do here this year.\n  We have $200 million built into the budget. We did it in advance, \nknowing we ought to deal with this issue. We ought to deal with it now \nfor the truly needy seniors of America, those who make the horrible \nchoice of food versus prescription, heat versus prescription. Not in \nAmerica. Never in America should that be allowed to happen.\n  I hope the politician will step back for a moment from the \nrestrictions or complications of that issue and solve that problem now \nfor our truly needy seniors while we allow the national debate to go on \nas to what America and American citizens wish to choose as a part of \ntheir overall health care needs.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \ntime of Senator Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        The 90 Percent Solution\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of the primary reasons I came to \nthe Senate, was the fact that I believed we had spent money over the \nyears on many things that, while important, we were unwilling to pay \nfor, or, in the alternative, do without. We had a policy of ``let the \nnext guy worry about it'' or more precisely, ``let the next generation \nworry about it.'' I have said this before and I will keep on saying it \nuntil everyone realizes that we have a national debt that is costing us \n$224 billion in interest payments a year, and that translates into $600 \nmillion per day just to pay the interest.\n  Out of every Federal dollar that is spent this year, 13 cents will go \nto pay the interest on the national debt. In comparison, 16 cents will \ngo for national defense; 18 cents will go for non-defense discretionary \nspending; and 53 cents will go for entitlement spending. Right now, we \nspend more Federal tax dollars on debt interest than we do on the \nentire Medicare program.\n  It still amazes me to think that 38 years ago, when my wife Janet and \nI got married, only 6 cents out of every dollar was going to pay \ninterest on the debt. It is high time for our nation to make some \nheadway into bringing down our national debt and lowering those \ninterest costs.\n  As my colleagues know, our nation currently enjoys the greatest \neconomic expansion in our history. We have a robust economy, and across \nthe nation, states are reporting record low unemployment rates. \nCongress should take advantage of this incredible opportunity to create \na lasting legacy for the young people of our country, and pay down our \nnational debt and get this burden off the backs of our children and off \nthe backs of our grandchildren.\n  All the experts say that paying down the debt is the best thing we \ncould do with our budget surpluses.\n  Indeed, CBO Director Dan Crippen said earlier this year:\n\n       . . . most economists agree that saving the surpluses, \n     paying down the debt held by the public, is probably the best \n     thing that we can do relative to the economy.\n\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan also said:\n\n       My first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus \n     to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From \n     an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best \n     means of employing it.\n\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\n\n  Lowering the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and to Main \nStreet. It encourages more savings and investment which, in turn, fuels \nproductivity and continued economic growth. It also lowers interest \nrates, which in my view, is a real tax reduction for the American \npeople.\n  Furthermore, devoting on-budget surpluses to debt reduction is the \nonly way we can ensure that our nation will not return to the days of \ndeficit spending should the economy take a sharp turn down or a \nnational emergency arise.\n  In the time that I have been in the Senate, I have worked tirelessly \nto ensure that our on-budget surplus is used to pay down the national \ndebt.\n  In fact, during consideration of the fiscal year 2000 and the fiscal \nyear 2001 budget resolutions, I offered amendments that would direct \nwhatever on-budget surplus we received in each particular fiscal year \ntowards debt reduction.\n  In addition, I have been a staunch advocate of ``lock boxing'' both \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds to prevent the expenditure \nof these funds.\n  Further, I offered an amendment with Senator Allard this past June to \ndirect $12 billion in FY 2000 on-budget surplus dollars toward debt \nreduction. By the way, it passed by a vote of 95-3.\n  It was a great victory, but the celebration did not last long.\n  Unfortunately, all but $4 billion of that $12 billion disappeared: \nused for other spending in the Military Construction Appropriations \nConference Report.\n  My disappointment was somewhat tempered by the news that the on-\nbudget surplus that had been predicted earlier in the year was entirely \ntoo low an estimate.\n  As my colleagues know, in July, the CBO announced that our fiscal \nyear 2000 on-budget surplus had grown to $84 billion--$60 billion more \nthan was projected in January.\n  We have to be careful not to squander this windfall, because if we \nare able to maintain some fiscal restraint--and resist the temptation \nto spend it in the time we have remaining--at the end of this fiscal \nyear, that $60 billion will be used for debt reduction.\n  We must resist the temptation to tap it before the end of this \nmonth--particularly in light of the fact that as of the first of this \nmonth, Congress had increased non-defense discretionary spending in \nfiscal year 2000 to $328 billion: a 9.3 percent boost over the previous \nfiscal year, and the largest single-year increase in non-defense \ndiscretionary spending since 1980.\n  If we do resist the temptation to spend it, I think we should \ncelebrate the fact that we have made a major dent in our national debt; \nthe most significant payment using on-budget surplus funds in more than \n30 years. Think of that.\n  But, the fiscal year 2000 budget cycle is just about over. The issue \ntoday is what are we going to do to strike a blow for fiscal \nresponsibility in the coming fiscal year.\n  As my colleagues are likely aware, Majority Leader Lott and Speaker \nHastert have developed legislation, the Debt Relief Lock-Box \nReconciliation Act for Fiscal Year 2001, H.R. 5173, that will allocate \n90 percent of the fiscal year 2001 surplus towards debt reduction.\n  What will that mean?\n  Under H.R. 5173, both the Social Security and the Medicare surpluses \nwill be ``lock-boxed,'' and approximately $200 billion will be \nprotected from those who would use those funds for more spending.\n  I think the public should know, so there is no confusion, that it is \nnot a literal ``lock box''--like a safety deposit box--but it is an \niron-clad commitment that Congress cannot touch these funds for \nspending. Instead, those surplus dollars could only be used to pay down \nthe debt.\n  It took Congress until just last year to finally stop using our \nSocial Security surplus as a means to mask more than three decades of \nspending and instead, use it for debt reduction. We should continue \nthis ``hands off'' approach of the Social Security trust fund.\n  Sadly, we have not yet been able to do the same with respect to the \nMedicare surplus--having used nearly all of it on spending in fiscal \nyear 2000. Now is the time to treat the Medicare surplus the same as we \nhave treated the Social Security surplus and make sure that it is \nsubject to the same ``hands off'' policy as well.\n  Putting these trust funds in a ``lock box'' doesn't mean that we will \nhave solved the problems of Social Security and Medicare, but using \nthem to lower our debt now gives us added flexibility in the future to \naddress the long-term solvency of these two programs. It is about time \nwe reform Social Security and Medicare.\n  Also under this bill, some $42 billion of the on-budget surplus that \nthe CBO is estimating for the next fiscal year will be used strictly \nfor debt reduction. No smoke-and-mirrors, no gimmicks, just straight \ndebt reduction.\n  Therefore, under H.R. 5173, 90 percent of all fiscal year 2001 \nsurplus funds will be used for debt reduction.\n  I have heard the President and some of my colleagues say that this is \njust going to squeeze the ability to meet ``pressing needs'' in the \ncoming fiscal year. I do not agree.\n  If the disparity between the preliminary and supplemental surplus \nprojections of fiscal year 2000 are any indicator, there will likely be \nan upward readjustment of the surplus projections in FY 2001.\n  If our economy should slow and these projections turn out to be too \noptimistic, then we could cut spending--which would be fine as far as I \nam concerned. But in the meantime, this proposal will hold our feet to \nthe fire with respect to spending, and our feet need to be held to the \nfire.\n  My colleagues and I are not asking for a lot, simply that this body \nstand up and be counted. I hear people every day saying let's do \nsomething about the national debt. I hear the President of the United \nStates say it is a problem and we need to address it. So, I say to my \ncolleagues that if we agree that we need to bring down the debt, then \nlet's take advantage of the chance to do so and let's enact this \nproposal.\n  Reducing the national debt has been a principle of my party. It has \nbeen a principle of mine throughout my political career. First of all, \nyou don't go into debt. But, if you do, you get rid of it.\n  Here we have an ability to put our money where our mouths are, and \nsay, yes, we do believe in reducing the national debt. We are going to \ntake this money, put it aside, and pay down the national debt.\n  And while I personally would like to see as much of the on-budget \nsurplus used for debt reduction as humanly possible, I believe this is \nthe best proposal we are going to see as negotiations get underway over \nthe fiscal year 2001 budget.\n  Nevertheless, I believe by capping spending and tax cuts for fiscal \nyear 2001, and locking in set amounts of debt reduction, as this \nproposal does, we will have effectively established a good first step \ntowards further fiscal responsibility in fiscal year 2002 and beyond. \nIn other words, it establishes a down payment for us to do even more \nmeaningful debt reduction in years ahead.\n  I think GAO Comptroller General David Walker said it best when he \ntestified last year before the House Ways and Means Committee. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future \n     generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to \n     provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and \n     to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and \n     affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today \n     while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively \n     large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal \n     wave.\n\n  When I came to the Senate, I had one grandchild. Today, I have three. \nLike all other Americans, I think about what the future has in store \nfor them and about the legacy I want to leave to my grandchildren.\n  We have a moral obligation to remove the debt-burden that we have \nplaced on their backs. It is up to this Congress--in the weeks we have \nleft--to pass the Debt Relief Lock-Box Reconciliation Act for our \nchildren and grandchildren and for the future of our Nation.\n  The House of Representatives has already stepped up to the plate and \npassed this bill overwhelmingly, by a vote of--listen to this--381 to \n3. It is up to the Senate to do the same.\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak on the time that has been \nreserved for Senator Kennedy and ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we are now debating a conference report \nthat includes both the legislative branch and the Treasury and general \ngovernment appropriations bills. Unfortunately, the Treasury and \ngeneral government bill was never considered on the Senate floor. It \nwent directly from the Appropriations Committee into this conference \nreport.\n  There are some critical deficiencies in the Treasury and general \ngovernment appropriations bill, deficiencies that I had hoped to \naddress on the floor with an amendment. I am now prevented from doing \nthat. The deficiencies to which I want to call the attention of my \ncolleagues involve counterterrorism funding, an issue that should be of \nparticular concern to each of us.\n  As you know, terrorism is a national security threat, a threat which \nAmericans have experienced in reality. Just to mention the names: \nOklahoma City, the World Trade Center, Khobar Towers, Pan Am 103. Each \nof these reminds us of how deadly terrorism can be and how vulnerable \nwe are to it.\n  What most Americans do not know is that there are many more instances \nof attempted terrorist activities that have been averted by a \ncombination of good intelligence and effective law enforcement.\n  The apprehension of a terrorist crossing into the United States by \nCustoms agents just prior to the millennium celebration is one well-\nknown example of the success that we have had in interdicting \nterrorists before they can strike.\n  While terrorists have been around for a long time, their actions are \nbecoming increasingly more deadly. In the past 5 years, over 18,000 \npeople someplace around the world have been injured or killed in a \nterrorist incident. That 18,000 number of persons injured or killed by \nterrorism in the last 5 years represents a threefold increase over the \npreceding 5 years.\n  With the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and \neven nuclear weapons as a real threat, the potential for even deadlier \nattacks is a reality. This makes efforts to prevent attacks even more \nvital.\n  Earlier this year, the congressionally mandated National Commission \non Terrorism issued its report. The report is called: ``Countering the \nChanging Threat of International Terrorism.'' This report concluded \nthat international terrorism poses an increasingly dangerous and \ndifficult threat, and that countering the growing danger of this threat \nrequires significantly enhancing U.S. efforts.\n  It further states that priority one is to prevent terrorist attacks \nusing U.S. intelligence and law enforcement as our principal tools to \nprevent such attacks.\n  I would also like to cite a recent report by the Commission on \nAmerica's National Interests. The Commission on America's National \nInterests is a commission on which Senators Roberts, McCain, and myself \nare members.\n  The commission's report on ``America's National Interests,'' dated \nJuly 2000, lists as a vital interest that:\n\n       Terrorist groups be prevented from acquiring weapons of \n     mass destruction and using them against U.S. citizens, \n     property and troops.\n\n  The commission's report goes on to state:\n\n       As one of the most free and open societies in the world, \n     the U.S. is also among the most vulnerable to terrorism. . . \n     .\n       Protecting American citizens both at home and abroad \n     requires a well-coordinated counter-terrorism effort by all \n     U.S. government agencies, giving due regard for fundamental \n     American civil liberties and values.\n\n  The report on ``America's National Interests'' continues:\n\n       Given the severity of the potential consequence of a weapon \n     of mass destruction terrorist incident, as well as the rising \n     technical capacity of non-state actors, the U.S. government \n     should attach the highest priority to developing the capacity \n     to preempt these threats if possible, and mitigate their \n     consequences if necessary.\n\n  Mr. President, I repeat from the report on ``America's National \nInterests'' that ``the U.S. government should attach the highest \npriority to developing the capacity to preempt these threats if \npossible, and mitigate their consequences if necessary.''\n  This report could not have been more clear. Yet still another group \nof experts studying U.S. national security, the U.S. Commission on \nNational Security, commonly known as the Hart-Rudman commission, \nconcluded in its April 2000 report that our No. 1 priority should be to \nensure that the United States is safe from the dangers of a new era: \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. It \nspecifically mentions ``strengthening cooperation among law enforcement \nagencies, intelligence services, and military forces to foil terrorist \nplots. . . .''\n  The words of these three significant reports, as well as many other \nAmericans, did not go unheeded by the administration. The President \nrecognized the growing importance of law enforcement and intelligence \nin countering the terrorist threat even before these reports were \nreleased. He sent to Congress a request for over $300 million in \nadditional funding for exactly the types of enhanced counterterrorism \nefforts that these three commissions are recommending.\n  What has happened in the Congress? Of the approximately $300 million \nrequested, a portion of which was requested in a classified form, as it \nwill be used by various intelligence agencies, $28 million of that $300 \nmillion was for reprogramming requests in the fiscal year that is about \nto conclude on September 30. What happened? That request for \nreprogramming was rejected, rejected including $10 million for the \nDepartment of the Treasury and $18 million for the Department of \nJustice.\n  I am sad to report that in the bill before us today, the fiscal year \n2001 appropriations request, which begins on October 1, did not fare \nmuch better. There was a $71.1 million request for the Department of \nJustice. This has been completely unfunded in both the House and the \nSenate appropriations committees and thus in this conference report. \nThere was a $77.2 million request for the Department of the Treasury \nwhich should have been included in the bill we are currently debating; \n$74 million of that remains unfunded.\n  In addition, the request for the intelligence community was not \nfunded in the fiscal year 2001 legislation. In total, of those amounts \nwhich are available for public review, of the $300 million requested by \nthe President, $146.1 million was unfunded.\n  Let me describe a couple of specific initiatives that are \nparticularly important and that so far have not been funded in either \nthe House or Senate appropriations bill.\n  First, the administration requested over $40 million to support the \nJoint Terrorism Task Forces. These are interagency law enforcement \ngroups which combine resources and expertise for a more effective and \nefficient effort to deter and investigate terrorists. This is a proven \nconcept that brings agencies together to solve problems, hopefully \nproblems before they mature into tragic instances. The Joint Terrorism \nTask Forces were very successful in deterring and preventing terrorism \nduring the millennium. I cannot understand why this Congress would not \nsupport this request.\n  Second, the President requested $6.4 million to create a unit within \nthe Office of Foreign Asset Control dedicated to uncovering and \ntracking the financial assets of terrorist organizations. This is an \narea of law enforcement in which America, in the area of terrorism, is \nwoefully deficient. It is vitally important that we establish this new \noffice and that we gain an insight and an ability to oversee and \ncontrol terrorist financing. This was a specific recommendation of the \nNational Commission on Terrorism. This item was rejected, and so our \nwoeful deficiency will continue for another year, if the current \nposition of Congress, including the position of the legislation before \nus this afternoon, becomes law.\n  In fact, there were several items that were included in the \nPresident's request that the Commission on Terrorism specifically \nrecommended. They include increased resources to meet technology \nrequirements, expansion of linguistic capabilities, increased funding \nfor investigative initiatives--all of those unfunded.\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\n  There is also an as yet unfunded request to establish a Center for \nAnti-Terrorism and Security Training. This will provide a centralized \ntraining facility for those on the front lines fighting terrorists \naround the world, including our own Capitol Police, diplomatic security \nofficers protecting our embassies abroad, and our allies who look to us \nto help them in their fight against terrorism. The counterterrorism \nfunding I am highlighting is desperately needed. All agencies have \nagreed that we need to do more to step up our efforts against \nterrorism. These requests are supported by the bipartisan National \nCommission on Terrorism and, in more general terms, the Commission on \nAmerica's National Interests, and the Hart-Rudman commission.\n\n  What I find especially hard to imagine is why we would refuse this \n$300 million request when it is so widely recognized that the cost of \nfailure, when it comes to terrorism, involves weapons of mass \ndestruction and could be in the billions of dollars. This is an area \nwhere we must do absolutely everything we can on the prevention side to \navoid, to interdict acts of terrorism before they are inflicted upon \nour citizens.\n  Mr. President, there is yet another consequence of the action we are \nbeing asked to take by supporting an appropriations bill which is so \ndeficient in meeting this key area of our Nation's security. All too \noften we are seen as pushing other governments to do more in the fight \nagainst terrorism, to help us in an international effort against \nterrorism. If we are unwilling to support what our own experts tell us \nis needed, what is in our national interest, how can we be effective in \nconvincing others to do more? I don't think there is an answer to that \nquestion. We must practice what we preach.\n  The good news is there is still time to remedy the situation. I hope \nthe appropriations committees will fund the President's request for \ncounterterrorism funding. This is about a real threat that is here \ntoday and cannot be ignored. Failing to take action on this modest \nrequest is irresponsible. Those who call for spending more for \npotential future threats and for increasing spending on other national \nsecurity priorities cannot ignore the vital national interest, the \nfirst-line priority of an effective national protection against \nterrorism.\n  I will express my dismay, my shock at what has been done by the \nCongress thus far by voting against this bill. And should the Congress, \nin its lack of attention or lack of appropriate recognition of the \nimportance of terrorism, should we pass this appropriations bill, which \nis so deficient in responding to the challenges of terrorism, then I \nwill urge the President to veto this bill and give the Congress an \nopportunity to redeem itself from what is potentially a very serious \nerror--placing the national security of the United States at risk.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use some of my leader time to \ncomment briefly on the pending legislation.\n  I come to the floor to express my strong objection to the manner in \nwhich this was presented to the Senate. It is wrong, it is dangerous, \nit is shortsighted, and it does a real disservice to this institution, \nperiod.\n  I have no objection to appropriations bills coming to the floor, as \nthey must. I have no objection to perhaps even limiting the amendments \nat this late date to relevant legislation that may be affected in the \nbill. But I do have a strong reservation when we gag the Senate, as we \nhave once again, limiting debate about important matters directly \nrelating to tax and appropriations in a way that precludes the right of \nevery Senator to be fully engaged in these deliberations.\n  I have heard again and again from colleagues on the other side that \nit is our desire to slow things down--to stop things. Let me say that \nis poppycock. No one here wants to slow anything down. In just a moment \nI will present a list for the Record of all the things we are prepared \nto take up this afternoon--this afternoon.\n  We know why this package was cobbled together in the form and manner \nin which it now appears before the Senate. It was put together to deny \nus the right to offer amendments--something we seek to do not because \nwe want to slow things down but because we want a voice.\n  I am not necessarily opposed to the telephone tax repeal. Senator \nRobb has been an extraordinary advocate of that. I give him great \ncredit for getting us this far. But I must say I think it begs the \nquestion at this hour, with our Republican colleagues clamoring for 90 \npercent of the surplus to be used for debt retirement, should we would \nchoose the telephone tax, of all things, as one of the items to be paid \nfor with the remaining 10 percent of the surplus our Republican \ncolleagues suggest should be available for both tax reduction as well \nas investments?\n  I am told there is about $28 billion left in the budget if we reserve \n90 percent for the surplus. If we assume for the moment that we accept \nthe Republicans' proposal to use 50 percent of that $28 billion for tax \nreduction and 50 percent for investments, that leaves about $14 billion \nfor tax reduction in the remainder of this year. Fourteen billion \ndollars isn't a lot of money when you are talking about the proposals \nwe have had to vote on this year, but $14 billion represents what the \nRepublicans would make available for tax cuts.\n  The telephone tax would use up one-third of what they would allocate \nfor tax reduction in this fiscal year--one-third. Maybe we want to \ncommit one-third of the remaining surplus for tax reduction to the \ntelephone tax.\n  But this Senate is denying us the opportunity to suggest something \nelse. This Senate is denying us the opportunity to offer amendments and \nto have a debate. In fact, I must say I will bet you most people are \ngoing to vote on this and they don't even have a clue what the \ntelephone tax is. I know the Presiding Officer does. He just noted that \nto me. But I will venture a guess that a lot of people do not.\n  That is just one of the problems we have with this course of action.\n  I don't have any objection to taking up the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill. I don't have any objection to taking up \nLegislative Branch appropriations bill. But I do have an objection when \nthe administration informs us that we have virtually eliminated funding \nfor counterterrorism and have not provided the funding necessary for \nthe IRS and we have been denied the opportunity to at least debate \nthese issues.\n  Then I am told indirectly that, well, we will come up with the money \nsomewhere on another vehicle. I am mystified by that approach. What is \nit that leads us to think we can find the money elsewhere, at a later \ndate, if we can't find it now? And if we can't find it now, it just \nseems to me we are premature in moving the bill forward until we can \nfind it.\n\n  There are a lot of specific practical problems that I hope my \ncolleagues share about this approach--problems related to our ability \nto participate in the process, problems related to our ability to offer \namendments, problems related to the fundamental rights of every Senator \nto be involved in the debate, problems related directly to the \nsubstance of the issues on which we are now voting. Those are serious \nproblems, and they shouldn't be minimized. But beyond that, I have \nfundamental problems with the precedent we are setting here.\n  There are many who may come into the Senate in future years who, if \nwe continue this process, may come to the conclusion that if it is good \non appropriations, why not on any authorization? Why not on a tax bill? \nLet's just go from committee to conference. Let's forget this Chamber. \nThis Chamber might well be additional office space someday. We don't \nneed a Chamber anymore--not for deliberations, because there are none.\n  Where does it end? Not in our generation. I am sure this will be a \nslow process. But, institutionally, anybody who cares about the way the \nSenate should be run should care about the process we are using now.\n  I don't know what message it sends to our young Members on either \nside of\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\nthe Chamber about the way we do business around here. But I don't want \nto have it heard or said on the Senate floor anytime in the near future \nthat this is the greatest deliberative body, because we aren't \ndeliberating. We are not deliberating on these issues, we are rubber \nstamping. We are sending them through the process the way you might \nexpect it done in the House, but it doesn't, and it shouldn't, happen \nhere. Institutionally, Republican or Democrat, old or young, it \nshouldn't matter. I am troubled, very troubled, by this process.\n  As I said a moment ago, we have no objection--none--to moving to \nother bills. I will not do it. But I would love to ask unanimous \nconsent to move, immediately following the conclusion of our debate on \nthis package, to the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. Guess \nwhat. I would get an objection on the other side. I am not sure why. I \ndon't know why. But I know this. We haven't brought it up because \nsomebody over there doesn't want it to come up. That isn't us.\n  I would love to ask unanimous consent to take up the D.C. \nappropriations bill, the intelligence authorization bill, and the H-1B \nbill. Let's take them up. Let's have a debate. Let's offer amendments. \nI have offered to Senator Lott that we could take up the H-1B bill with \nfive amendments on a side with an hour limit on each amendment, period. \nWe would be done in a day. I believe we could do it in a day. The other \nside has rejected this offer.\n  Don't let anybody say with a straight face or with any credibility \nthat it is Democrats holding things up. Let's get to these bills. Let's \nget them done. Let's offer amendments. But, for heaven's sake, let's \nremember this institution. Let's call it the most deliberative body and \nmean it. Let's recognize the institutional quality.\n  It degrades us each time something such as this happens.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are about through with this debate, as \ndemonstrated by the fact that Senators on neither side are coming to \nthe floor. We would be able to vote more rapidly than anticipated \nexcept that some Senators have made appointments based on the \nassumption we would not be voting until 3:30 or 4. However, we have \ncleared on both sides that we can vote on the adoption of the pending \nconference report at 3:15 and that paragraph 4 of rule XII be waived. I \nask unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the adoption of that \ntime and the waiving of that rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged equally on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate will shortly vote on the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 4516, the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations Act for 2001.\n  As the managers have stated, this conference report also includes the \nTreasury-general government bill for fiscal year 2001.\n  Many Senators have voiced concern about the inclusion of the Treasury \nbill, which had not previously passed the Senate, in this conference \nreport. Many Senators have questioned me personally about this. Having \nserved in this body for nearly 32 years, I understand and share that \ncommitment to the procedures of the Senate and want to do my best to \npreserve the rights of all Senators.\n  I am here to ask Senators in this case to consider the product rather \nthan the process by which this conference report comes before the \nSenate. This report addresses critical funding priorities for all of \nthe elements of the legislative branch. Senator Bennett and Senator \nFeinstein have achieved a very balanced agreement with the House on the \nunderlying bill that merits the support of the Senate.\n  In the Treasury bill, substantial changes were made to the committee-\nreported bill, the bill that came out of our Appropriations Committee, \nto accommodate priorities of the Members of the House and of the \nexecutive branch, both in terms of funding and of legislation. It would \nbe preferable to have this bill come separately before the Senate, but \nthe Appropriations Committee now finds itself in the stranglehold of \nthe calendar.\n  In all likelihood, we have about 10 voting days remaining in this \nCongress. We are working to compress weeks of work into a handful of \ndays. There are additional changes that Members and the President seek \nin the Treasury portion of the conference report. I have extended my \npersonal commitment to Senator Dorgan to work with him and Senator \nCampbell to try to incorporate those adjustments into another \nconference report. I also have given my word to Senator Reid concerning \nproblems regarding the police section of the legislative bill itself.\n  Adoption of this report now will permit us to redouble our efforts to \nconclude our work as rapidly as possible on the other bills that still \npend before Congress, and we will be able to achieve the changes some \nsought to make in the current bill. Any other course will set the \nSenate and the Congress way back in getting our job done.\n  If this conference report is not approved, we will have to find some \nway to go back to conference with the House. And if it is decided that \nwe must bring the Treasury bill before the Senate, I can assure \nSenators that we will have a postelection session.\n  It is just not possible to finish these bills before the election and \nget home in a reasonable amount of time--at least before the election--\nfor the Members of the House and Senate who are up for election to \nconduct their campaigns.\n  I don't know of any other way to do what we have to do, other than to \ntry to match up some of these bills in conference. There are lots of \nissues that both sides of the aisle may disagree on and fight over \nduring the days that remain in this Congress.\n  The bill before the Senate, I believe, is a reasonable bill, \ncomprised of two separate bills that meet important national \nobjectives. I have come to the floor to urge the Senate to support this \nconference report, to accept the commitments that I and others have \nmade concerning the additional concerns expressed on the floor, and let \nour committee complete its work.\n  I report to the Senate that conferences are scheduled today on the \nInterior bill and Transportation appropriations bill. But there is one \nthing Senators should know; our committee will be working every day--\nnot just the 10 days of votes--between now and adjournment to try to \nfinish the bills before the scheduled day of adjournment, October 6. \nEven when that day comes, it will not be the last day for the \nAppropriations Committee. We will have to await the outcome of the \nPresident's review and determine whether there have to be changes made \nin the bills following the veto, should that occur. I am not predicting \nit will occur, but it might.\n  If the Senate votes and approves this bill and sends it to the \nPresident, it is going to lend real momentum to concluding the \nappropriations process in a very responsible way this year. There have \nbeen things that held up these bills this year, including many days on \nthe Senate floor with cloture motions and other matters. I am not \ncritical of those. That is very important work for the Senate to do.\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\n  Now we are in the appropriations process and we are trying to deal \nwith a period that will really end on the 28th, not the 30th, because \nof the holiday and our recess next week. We have to find a way to \ncomplete these bills.\n  The Senators who want to vote against the bill ought to be prepared \nto come back after the election. We are not going to be able to finish \nthese bills separately this year. We are going to have to find a way to \njoin them together. I, for one, have lived through too many \npostelection sessions. I don't want to live through another one. I urge \nMembers of the Senate to support this conference report and let us get \non about our work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, with passage of the legislative branch \nappropriations conference report, the Senate will successfully roll \nback one of the most regressive taxes in history and given Americans \neverywhere a much-deserved break.\n  For some time, now, I have pushed to repeal the telephone excise tax, \na tax that is placed on individuals and families, regardless of income \nor circumstances.\n  Quite simply, if you owned a phone, you paid the tax, and along with \nits regressive nature, the tax was lamentable because it stood as one \nmore example of how antiquated, unfair, counterproductive government \npolicies not only outlive their original design, but become almost \nimpossible to abolish.\n  The telephone excise tax was first imposed in 1898, more than 102 \nyears ago. Its purpose was to fund the Spanish-American War, to provide \nfor those who, like Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders, needed the \nwherewithal to defend U.S. interests.\n  At the time it was imposed, it came as something of a luxury tax--a \ntax on the wealthy, as few Americans owned telephones.\n  Roosevelt rode up San Juan Hill. The war came to an end. But \nWashington couldn't resist holding on to the revenue. From time to \ntime, the tax was repealed, but it always seemed to get reinstated--\nrising as high as 25 percent at one point--and placing an unfair burden \non millions.\n  Today, however, we shall successfully eliminate the telephone excise \ntax, and this--in my mind--is cause for celebration. Studies show that \nindividuals and families with income less than $10,000 spend almost 10 \npercent of their income on telephone bills. Individuals and families \nearning $50,000 spend 2 percent of their income for telephone service. \nBecause of what we have done here today, these families--and all \nfamilies--will benefit.\n  I'm proud of this action, grateful to those who supported repealing \nthis excise tax. What we have done is not only in the interest of \nAmericans everywhere, but it is a clear demonstration that we are \nwilling and able to appropriately address the need to reduce the \nexcessive tax burden that has been placed on the back of America's \nmiddle class.\n  My sincere hope is that this is the beginning of a long and \nsuccessful trend.\n  On another issue, I am concerned that the legislative branch \nappropriations conference report--while it contains good news for \ntaxpayers--while it contains good news for taxpayers--does not meet the \nfull funding needs of the Internal Revenue Service. As you know, 2 \nyears ago in a major bipartisan initiative, Congress successfully \npassed the largest IRS reform and restructuring effort in history. That \nlaw has been effective in protecting taxpayers and giving the IRS the \ndirection necessary to re-engineer its business practices, upgrade its \ncomputer systems, and provide taxpayers with better service.\n  But in order to most effectively carry out Congress' mandate, and to \nfulfill its mission to collect and protect the Federal revenue, the IRS \nneeds adequate funding.\n  This appropriations conference report, unfortunately, provides \nhundreds of millions of dollars less than what the agency needs. And \nthe absence of proper funding will cut directly into the improved \nconditions that Congress desires. Unless additional funding is \nprovided, the Service may be unable to effectively perform its audit \nand collection functions. Without adequate funding, service functions \nwill diminish.\n  There will be a loss of telephone and walk-in service for taxpayers, \na decrease in the level of toll-free service, and it will become more \ndifficult for taxpayers to receive assistance.\n  We must provide additional funds to the IRS in other appropriate \nbills before this Congress adjourns. Only by doing this can we ensure \nthat the IRS has the resources it needs to meet the standards of \nservice and accountability that Congress has required.\n  Along with eight members of the Senate Finance Committee, I have \nsigned a letter to members of the Appropriations Committee asking that \nfunding be restored. And I intend to work with my colleagues toward \nthis end.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask consent that the vote occur on \nadoption of the pending conference report at 3 p.m., and that paragraph \n4 of Rule 12 be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon on an issue \nwhich is important to all Americans, particularly the 10 million who \nare presently working for a minimum wage. Senator Kennedy of \nMassachusetts will join me in a few minutes to discuss the issue, which \nhas been a major crusade for him for the last several years.\n  Earlier I noted that until the mid-1980s the issue of a minimum wage \nincrease was never a partisan issue. In fact, Republican and Democratic \nPresidents alike endorsed the idea of periodically trying to increase \nthe minimum wage to reflect the cost of living. But for some reason, in \nthe mid-1980s, that all changed. It became a Democratic and Republican \nbattle as to whether people who were earning a minimum wage should be \nable to keep up with the cost of living, keep up with inflation. \nBecause of that battle, fits and starts and the wins and losses, many \nminimum wage workers across America started falling behind. In fact, \ntheir buying power, working for a minimum wage, was diminishing because \nCongress had failed to give them an adequate increase in their income \nto keep up with the cost of living.\n  Some arguments on the other side suggested: If you raise the minimum \nwage for workers who have no skills, entry level workers, it is going \nto basically kill jobs because employers are going to have to make a \nchoice. They are either going to pay more to a minimum wage worker on \nthe job and then reduce the size of the workforce or pay less to that \nminimum wage worker and keep a larger workforce.\n  It seems as if there is linear logic to this argument, but, in fact, \nwhen you look at it, the economic history of this country just does not \nback it up. As you will notice on this first chart which I am showing, \nas we have seen increases in the minimum wage from April of 1995 where \nthe wage was increased, in October of 1996, to $4.75, and then again in \nOctober of 1997 to $5.15 an hour, the current minimum wage, the number \nof people working in America has continued to grow. So the argument \nthat increasing the minimum wage is a job killer just does not make any \nsense.\n\n  Just the opposite seems to be true. In a growing economy, when you \ngive to\n\n[[Page S8795]]\n\nthe workers at the lowest level an increase in their living wage, they \nare likely to spend it. They need it for rent, for groceries, for their \nkids' shoes, for school expenses. So little of it is saved as lower \nincome families are forced to spend everything to make ends meet; that \nspending, of course, creates demand in the economy for the production \nof more products and services. That is what has happened to us \nrepeatedly. Since 1996, if you will take a look here at the minimum \nwage increase, unemployment is down in all the major groups.\n  People say these minimum wage jobs are just for kids who do not have \nany skills or background. When they come to the workplace and get their \nfirst job, they have to be prepared to be paid very little for it. I \nused to be one of those a long time ago. Take a look at what has \nhappened here between September of 1996 and August of the year 2000. \nThe 1996 minimum wage increase did not kill job opportunities in a \nsingle category here: Among teenagers, even among high school dropouts, \nAfrican Americans, Hispanic Americans, or women in the workforce.\n  One of the other misconceptions is that somehow the minimum wage is \njust going to be paid to those who are, frankly, children who have \nlimited work experience, a first job, so they will get a minimum wage. \nWho are these 10.1 million workers across America who would benefit \nfrom an increase in the minimum wage? I think you would be surprised to \nlearn, as I was, that 69 percent of the workers who benefit are adults \nover the age of 20. So the idea that this is a children's wage or a \nteenager's wage is just wrong. Mr. President, 69 percent of minimum \nwage workers, 7 million of them, are over 20; 60 percent of these are \nwomen and many of these women have children.\n  You know what we are talking about here. We are talking about someone \nwho has gone through a divorce, perhaps has a child they are trying to \nraise and do their very best by working a minimum wage job. Sixty \npercent of these minimum wage workers are women and 45 percent of them \nhave full-time jobs. They are full-time minimum wage workers making \nless than $11,000 a year: 16 percent African American, 20 percent \nHispanic; 40 percent of them work in retail. They sell us our \nhamburgers and our CDs at the store and all the things we buy; 27 \npercent are in the service sector; 83 percent of the minimum wage \nworkers are heads of households and they are earning between $5.15 an \nhour and $6.14 an hour. Mr. President, 40 percent of minimum wage \nworkers are the sole adult breadwinners in their families.\n  The argument that we are talking about a training wage for kids who \nreally just want a first time on the job overlooks 40 percent of the \nminimum wage workforce who are adults trying to make enough money to \nfeed a child--those are the minimum wage workers. I can recall a speech \ngiven many years ago by Rev. Jesse Jackson from Chicago, which I am \nproud to represent in the Senate, when he talked about these people \ngoing to work every day--the invisible workforce. We do not see them \ncleaning our hotel rooms, clearing off the tables, working in the \nkitchens and the day-care centers and the nursing homes; people we rely \non to make America a better place, who do the tough, often thankless \njobs in America for $5.15 an hour.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the estimate is we have over 400,000 \nminimum wage workers. These are people who deserve an increase in that \nminimum wage for a chance to be able to get out of poverty. Frankly, \nmost Americans agree: If you are a hard-working person who is not \nlooking for a handout but just looking for a chance to go to work, you \nreally deserve some sort of basic living wage.\n  Look at this chart. ``Americans Support Wages That Keep Working \nFamilies Out Of Poverty.'' Overwhelmingly, 81 percent strongly agree \nwith this. Does anyone really, listening to this speech, this debate, \nbelieve if you are making $10,700 a year you are out of poverty? That \nyou have a comfortable life? Even with the Earned-Income Tax Credit, \none of the few things with which we try to help these working families, \nby and large life is from payday to payday. They are striving just to \nmeet the necessities and basics of life. So when we talk about an \nincrease in the minimum wage, we are talking about helping these \nfamilies who are going to work every single day finally reach up over \nthe ledge and look ahead, beyond poverty.\n  If welfare reform was not about rewarding that type of person, what \nwas the debate all about? I voted for it. Some of my colleagues said \ndon't do that because you are going to leave the poor behind when they \nreally need help. I hope we never do.\n  But I can tell you, this minimum wage debate is about those people, \nfolks with limited job experience. They are finally off the dole, off \nwelfare, trying to do their best, stuck in a $5.15-an-hour job; showing \nup for work on a regular basis, full-time employees--45 percent of \nthem--and still stuck at $5.15 an hour.\n  During the Republican Convention in Philadelphia, there was a lot of \ntalk about the economy. It was amazing, in a way, because they failed \nto acknowledge, as you might expect, we are in a period of prosperity \nunparalleled in the history of the United States. We have had the \nlongest run of economic expansion ever. We are now talking about \neliminating our national debt. That has not happened since the Civil \nWar, I might add--the Civil War in the 19th century, if there is any \ndoubt what I am referring to.\n  In Philadelphia, they said the problem with this economy is it has \nleft too many people behind. It has helped create 22 million new jobs \nin this country, a lot of them in my State and other States around the \nNation. But if you are talking about leaving people behind, how about \nthe people on minimum wage who have been left behind because a \nRepublican dominated and controlled Congress refuses to give a minimum \nwage increase to the hardest working people in this country?\n  Oh, the Republicans in the House have come forward with a proposal. \nThey have had the idea of implementing this $1-an-hour increase over 3 \nyears. They want to bring it down to 2 years, but there are a couple \nattachments to it and riders and things they would like to add. For \nexample, they would like to really challenge paying overtime to workers \nin general--not talking about minimum wage workers but talking about \nworkers in general. Frankly, many of us think that is a bitter pill to \nswallow; that a lot of hard-working families would have to give up on \ntheir overtime pay so the lowest paid workers in this country earning \n$5.15 an hour would have a chance to get out of poverty and have a \nliving wage. That is not a deal which, frankly, any of us should buy.\n  It is time for us to do the right thing. We are going to go home in a \nfew weeks. A lot of Senators will be campaigning for other candidates \nor for their own reelection, and they will face a lot of crowds and \npeople coming up to them. You aren't likely to see a lot of minimum \nwage workers in those crowds. These are hard-working folks struggling \nto get by, many times with more than one job; they do not have time to \nlisten to politicians who get out and gab and make their speeches on \nthe stump.\n  But it is a shame we will not have a chance to see them because, if \nwe do, we, frankly, have to ask of them some understanding and \nforgiveness, that this Congress, with its large agenda of important \nitems, has failed to address the most fundamental need in their lives--\nan increase in the minimum wage so they can survive and raise their \nchildren and live in dignity.\n  If we value hard work in this country, we should compensate the hard \nworkers, the minimum wage workers adequately. For over 2 years we have \nrefused to do it. I see my colleague, Senator Kennedy, is on the floor. \nI salute him for the leadership he has shown on this issue time and \ntime again. I am sorry we are in a position where both parties no \nlonger have come to a bipartisan agreement on dealing with a minimum \nwage.\n  But I say to Senator Kennedy, as I am prepared to yield the floor to \nhim, that this is a battle worth fighting in the closing weeks of this \nsession. As we consider all of the possibilities and all of the special \ninterests that need to be tended to and made happy before we leave, let \nus not forget the people who cannot afford a lobbyist in this town--the \nminimum wage workers across America who we count on week in and week \nout to make America work.\n\n  I think we owe it to them to increase the minimum wage by 50 cents an \nhour\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\nover each of the next 2 years, to a level of $6.15, knowing full well \nthat that is not a comfort level, that isn't going to give them relief \nfrom concern about paying for the necessities of life; but we owe it to \nthem to increase this wage. Frankly, this Senator is prepared to say \nthat this experience with this minimum wage increase has convinced me \nonce and for all that relying on the goodness and gratitude of Congress \non an infrequent basis to give the hardest working people in this \ncountry enough money to scrape themselves out of poverty and make a \nliving has to come to an end.\n  We need to put into law a cost-of-living adjustment for the minimum \nwage, so we can say to the people across America, the millions who work \nfor this minimum wage: Your life is not going to be hanging in the \nbalance as to whether politicians in Washington are paying attention. \nYou pay attention to your family and your job every day. We should pay \nattention to you by making certain you have a living wage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If the Senator would withhold, I would like to make an \ninquiry about time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding that on the Republican side there \nare still 45 minutes remaining under the control of Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that that time be reserved for \nmy control as manager of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \nDemocratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 4 minutes, \nand Senator Kennedy has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair and yield to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I had hoped to be able to address some of \nthe issues here this afternoon, but we will have to work out additional \ntime later in the afternoon.\n  The appropriations bill that is before us effectively will increase \nthe pay for Members of Congress by over $5,000 a year. I support that \nparticular proposal, but we ought to know that that is what is \neffectively included in this legislation. That is there basically \nbecause of the Republican leadership. As I mentioned, I support that, \nas I have supported other pay increases in the past.\n  But what Americans should understand is the fact that on the one hand \nthe Republican leadership is prepared to have a $5,000 increase in the \npay of Members of Congress and still deny us the opportunity to vote \nfor a 50-cent-an-hour increase this year and a 50-cent-an-hour increase \nnext year for the hard-working Americans who are at the bottom end of \nthe economic ladder. It is basically and fundamentally wrong. And the \nAmerican people ought to understand it.\n  We have 2\\1/2\\ weeks left. We ought to be able to make a judgment \ndecision whether those Americans--some 10.1 million who will be \naffected by the increase in the minimum wage--ought to be able to have \nan increase in the minimum wage. We believe they should. We have fought \nto try to get that to happen. We have been limited in our opportunities \nto address that issue because of parliamentary tactics which have been \nused by the Republican majority in the Senate to deny us that.\n  No one needs a briefing about the issues on the increase in the \nminimum wage. They are basic. They are fundamental. Ninety-five percent \nof the Members of this body have voted on this issue. It would not take \na great deal of time. We would be willing to enter into an hour equally \ndivided if we were able to get an opportunity to vote on an increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  The American people ought to understand what the priorities are as we \nare coming to the last days of this Congress with 2\\1/2\\ weeks left. \nThis is an issue of priorities. The Republican leadership has said we \nwill put this appropriations bill forward. They have basically \nsidetracked the whole debate on the education bill, even though that \nwas a priority for them before and even though their standard bearer is \nout there talking about the importance of higher education. I wish that \nthe candidate would just call up the majority leader and say: Put the \neducation bill on the floor of the Senate. Why aren't you doing it?\n  We are going to be dealing with the H-1B legislation which is going \nto affect 100,000 visas and denying the opportunity to make other kinds \nof changes in that particular program. We are saying that that is more \nimportant than having a short debate on an increase in the minimum \nwage?\n  As my friend and colleague has pointed out--who are these people? \nThey are basically people who are assistants to teachers, who work in \nthe schools in this country.\n  Who are they? They are helping assistants to child care workers, who \nare looking after the children of working families.\n  Who are these people? They are assistants in nursing homes, who are \nlooking after the parents who have retired and are now in nursing homes \nbeing taken care of either by their children in nursing homes or \nperhaps even under the Medicaid system.\n  These are the people who are minimum wage workers. They are the men \nand women who clean the buildings around this country.\n  What has happened to them over the period? I wish the Members of this \nbody had seen the excellent piece on ABC this morning that talked about \nwhat is happening in the workforce. It pointed out that now the \nAmerican worker is working longer than any other worker and that the \nrates of productivity have increased. Generally speaking, when you have \nan increase in productivity and you have workers willing to work more, \nthey get an increase in their pay. Not here, not minimum wage workers.\n  What we have seen is that those at the top part of the economic \nladder have been experiencing a very substantial increase and those on \nthe bottom fifth of the economic ladder, which include the minimum wage \nworkers, have actually fallen behind in their purchasing power. If we \ndo not take action on an increase in the minimum wage in the final 2\\1/\n2\\ weeks, then the increase we had 3 years ago will effectively be \nwiped out for these workers. That is quite a message; that is quite a \npriority.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise me when I have 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  What has happened? We have offered this. And what has come back now \nfrom the other side, from the Republican leadership? They say: All \nright, we will let you have a 2-year increase in the minimum wage if \nyou will agree to a $76 billion tax reduction for the wealthiest \nindividuals in this country. Some deal, some deal for workers--$76 \nbillion in tax reductions. You would think at least they would have the \ncommon sense just to do it for the small mom-and-pop stores. No. This \nis for the big boys, tax cuts, $76 billion. The last time we had an \nincrease in the minimum wage, it was $21 billion. A lot of people \nthought that was too much. Seventy six billion dollars they want. And \nthat isn't enough.\n  What they also want to do is wipe out time and a half for overtime \nfor 73 million Americans, cut back on overtime pay. So you don't have \nto even pay, not only the minimum wage workers, but those above them, \novertime pay. That is part of the deal: We will give 50 cents an hour \nto hard-working Americans this year and 50 cents next year. Give us the \n$76 billion. Let us be able to make other workers work. It will save us \nbillions and billions and billions of dollars in terms of payroll. That \nis the deal they are offering.\n  Beyond that, I know this isn't a typical Republican position. They \nsay: We are going to preempt the States that are out there in terms of \nthe tax credit for workers in restaurants where they are able, instead \nof paying the full minimum wage, to say: We will only pay part. And if \nthey get the rest in terms of tips, we don't have to make up the wages. \nThat is a fine situation anyway. Someone is able to provide additional \nkinds of services; because of that, able to get a tip; and you are \ngoing to penalize them. We are going to put that into giving the credit \nto the employers. It is a lousy deal for workers in the\n\n[[Page S8797]]\n\nfirst place. The Restaurant Association and their employees have gone \nthrough the roof anyway since the last time we passed it. Nonetheless, \nwhat they are saying is, OK, here is one deal for the minimum wage, but \nbecause some of the States have been a little more understanding and a \nlittle more helpful to these workers, we will preempt those States. I \ndon't hear any statements on the other side of the aisle: Well, we \ndon't want one size fits all. If you eliminate ``one size fits all'' \nand ``Washington knows best'' from the Republican vocabulary, they \nhaven't got much to say. On this bill, there is no consistency. Give us \n$76 billion. Let us eliminate overtime. Then we will have a deal.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are going to take every opportunity--\nand there will be some that will come down--to try to do something in \nterms of the minimum wage.\n  As I have said before, this is a women's issue because the majority \nof the recipients of the minimum wage are women. It is a children's \nissue because a majority of the women who get the minimum wage have \nchildren. This is a family issue. We hear ``family values'' around \nhere. This is a family values issue because whether those parents have \ntime to spend with those children depends on income. It is a children's \nissue.\n  It is a civil rights issue because the great percentage of those who \nare out there working are men and women of color. And beyond that, it \nis fairness issue. In the United States of America, with the economy \ngoing right through the roof, with the greatest economic prosperity in \nthe history of the Nation, we are going to say: If you work hard, 40 \nhours a week, 52 weeks of the year, we don't think you ought to live in \npoverty. The Republican leadership refused to let us get a vote on \nthis. That is absolutely unconscionable. The American people ought to \nunderstand it on election day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am here in my capacity as manager of \nthe conference report. We have had very little conversation about the \nconference report or any of the items contained in the bill, but \nthrough this debate, we have had a great deal of conversation about a \nnumber of other issues.\n  I suppose in the spirit of that debate, I can be excused if I respond \nto the comments made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts. The \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts as well as the Senator from Illinois \nhave given us a great number of statistics about the minimum wage, a \ngreat deal of information from various studies that have been done \nabout the minimum wage. I remind them of the last time we had a \ndefinitive study on the minimum wage that was given to us with great \nfanfare from the Department of Labor; that further analysis of that \nstudy by objective academics indicated that the methodology of the \nstudy was false; that the conclusion of the study, which was that the \nminimum wage did not in fact destroy jobs, was false, and that the \nminimum wage does in fact have an impact.\n  I don't want to debate studies and arguments and academics. I want to \ntake us, for just a moment, into the real world of employment. We hear \nover and over that we are in the most prosperous economy that anybody \ncan remember. That is true. That creates a real world situation which \nhas not been addressed in any of the rhetoric we have just heard.\n  The real world situation is this: When the economy is very strong, \nthere is a very strong demand for labor. As a consequence, unemployment \ngoes down. Unemployment is at historic lows at this time of a good \neconomy. And in the real world, where people really seek jobs and \nemployers really seek workers, there is a shortage of workers.\n  I talk to employers in my State and I say: What is your biggest \nproblem?\n  They say: Our biggest problem is finding workers. We post jobs. We do \neverything we can to try to get people to come in and take these jobs. \nThey come in off the street and if, during the presentation of what the \njob is like, we say something that they don't particularly like, they \nturn and walk out. Why? Because they can walk into another employer \ndown the street and have exactly the same kind of presentation. They \nare in a position where they can pick and choose.\n  I know this doesn't sound like macroeconomics, but this is the \nreality of the marketplace in which we operate. If I can talk about \nmacroeconomics for a moment, let me quote Alan Greenspan, who appears \nregularly before the Senate Banking Committee and the Joint Economic \nCommittee, on both of which I have the opportunity to serve. He says to \nus the one thing he watches with greatest concern in terms of the \npossibility of this economy overheating and spiraling off into \ninflation is the shortage of labor. He says the reason he has not \nraised interest rates more is because our labor is becoming so much \nmore productive that we can have this kind of tremendous demand in the \neconomy, even though the labor force is not expanding as rapidly as one \nwould think it would have to in historic terms. The labor force is \nexpanding in productivity so that it can keep up with the demand for \nlabor in the economy without becoming inflationary.\n\n  So there are microeconomic considerations and individual \nconsiderations, but it always comes down to the same fact in the real \nworld: There is no shortage of jobs. There is no shortage of good-\npaying jobs. There is no shortage of jobs above the poverty level. The \nproblem is with people who, for whatever reason, cannot take the jobs \nthat are available. The reason is usually training. The reason is \nusually experience.\n  If I may get personal for a moment, Mr. President, I don't know how \nmany other Members of this body have worked for a minimum wage, but I \nhave. I did it when I was 14. The job, frankly, was something of a gift \nbecause I don't think I added very much value to the corporation that I \nworked for at age 14 at 50 cents an hour. For me, it was a tremendous \nexperience. I look back on the time that I worked at ages 14, 15, 16, \nand so on, in the summertime, after school, and on weekends, as one of \nthe most important formative experiences of my life. But I think if the \nFederal Government had come in and said, no, you can't pay Bob Bennett \n50 cents an hour and we are going to order you to pay him 75 cents, my \nemployer, in all probability, would have said: What he does for us is, \nfrankly, not worth 75 cents an hour, and being true to our shareholders \nand our other employees whose jobs we do not want to jeopardize, we \nwill just let him go. But the minimum wage was low enough that I could \nwork for 50 cents an hour, I could have that kind of experience and, \nfrankly, I could get the kinds of job skills that made it possible for \nme, a few years later, to command salaries at substantially higher than \nthe minimum wage.\n  When I hear about the minimum wage from people in my State, it is \nalways from employers who are employing--and this is a very pejorative \nterm, but it is true--marginal workers. And they say: Senator, if you \nraise the minimum wage, I am going to have to let them go. The \ncontribution that they make to my company, or farm, or ranch, whatever \nit might be, is marginal. I can afford to pay them the minimum wage now \nand say that I get some return from their labor. If you raise it, I am \ngoing to have to say, no, it isn't worth it; I can't afford this. These \npeople then end up unemployed. The problem with these workers is not to \nhave the Government step in and attempt to repeal the law of supply and \ndemand; the problem is to find innovative, new ways to give them the \ntraining and skills they require in order to command a higher wage on \nthe basis of their work.\n  We are about to move, I hope, on to a debate on H-1B visas. People \nwill say: What does that have to do with the minimum wage? It is a \nmanifestation of the same basic principle I am talking about here; that \nis, we cannot, no matter how powerful we think we are as Senators, \nrepeal the law of supply and demand.\n  H-1B visas are used primarily by high-tech employees from other \ncountries who come into this country to take high-tech jobs. What is \nthe demand for those high-tech jobs? Right\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\nnow, there are between 350,000 and 400,000 high-tech jobs, paying in \nthe high five figures and into the low six figures, going begging in \nthis country, and the companies that have those jobs are saying: If we \ncan't find Americans, we want people from outside America to come in \nand fill these jobs. Will you please allow us to give visas to these \npeople?\n\n  We cannot legislate that those kinds of salaries be paid to someone \nwho is not capable of doing the job. The focus here, in terms of those \nwho are at the lowest ends of our economic ladder, should be finding \nways to train them, equip them, and prepare them to command, on the \nbasis of their own skills, the wages they want instead of having the \nGovernment just automatically decree that they be paid a wage that may, \nin fact, be higher than the amount of value that they can add to their \nemployer.\n  The Senator from Illinois displayed a chart that showed the minimum \nwage going up and employment going up, and then he suggested that one \ncauses the other. I suggest that there is no relationship whatsoever \nbetween those two trend lines. There is another trend line that I think \nhas a relationship. What is the area of greatest unemployment in this \ncountry? If you break it down with the demographics and the \nmetropolitan areas, you find that the area of greatest unemployment in \nthis country is among young, black teenagers in the inner city, \nparticularly male. That is, statistically, the area of highest \nunemployment.\n  The unemployment rate among young, teenage, black males in the inner \ncity in the United States is not only in double digits; it is in high \ndouble digits. I don't have the figures with me now. I didn't \nunderstand that we were going to debate minimum wage on the legislative \nbranch bill. But they are in the 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent \narea. Those young, black men would benefit enormously by having a job \nexperience. I know that, as I say, from my own experience, when I was \npaid the minimum wage at age 14. But it was less to add value to the \ncompany than to add skills and understanding to myself.\n  If we had the law of supply and demand operating unimpeded by \nGovernment instruction, I can imagine--and I think I could find jobs \nfor those young, black teenagers to do in the inner city. They would \nnot be $6-an-hour jobs, but they would be jobs where there could be \nsome value added to the employer and tremendous experience and training \nvalue added to the employee. And the Government, over time, would get \ntremendous benefits out of that because if those young men could be \ntrained in marketable skills and then go out and command jobs at $10 \nand $12 and $15 an hour based on their skills rather than the \nGovernment demanding that they be paid that whether they produce value \nfor it or not, the economy would be better, society would be better, \nand America as a whole would be better.\n  So as I listen to these debates on the minimum wage, the emotion, the \nshouting, and the great indignation that is sent forward here, I ask \nthe Senators to step away from the academic studies. Go out among the \nemployers of their own States and ask this direct question: What will \nhappen in your business to the people you hire if the Federal \nGovernment intervenes in this situation and starts to dictate the wages \nthat you pay?\n  A comment came out of the oil crisis of the 1970s when President \nCarter was telling us that the energy crisis was a crisis that was the \nmoral equivalent of war and that we must somehow marshal the entire \nenergies of the Nation to deal with it. Interestingly enough, as the \nSenator from Alaska points out, ever since we declared that kind of \nwar, American dependence on foreign oil has gone up, not down. That is \none of the main reasons we are looking at $2-a-gallon gasoline in the \nMidwest, as we are seeing the results of 8 years of an administration \nthat has opposed any kind of energy development in the United States. \nIn that period, an economist made this point that I have never \nforgotten. He said: When the Federal Government interferes with the \nsetting of prices by the forces of supply and demand, you get one of \ntwo results.\n  If the Federal Government sets the price higher than the market would \nset it, you get a shortage. When the Federal Government sets the price \nlower than the market would set it, you get a surplus. In other words, \nwhen the Federal Government says you must pay a wage higher than these \npeople can return value for, you get a shortage of jobs that these \npeople can fill. If the Government should arbitrarily say we will set a \nprice lower than these people can produce, then you get a surplus of \npeople.\n  We don't need shortages and we don't need surpluses. We need jobs. We \ndon't need shortages. We don't need surpluses of energy. To put it back \nin the same context, we need the energy.\n  The law of supply and demand gives you a price. It is always the \nright price as supply meets demand. As soon as someone steps in to try \nto manipulate that law--be that someone a monopolist, or be that \nsomeone a Federal legislator--and you get a diversion between the price \nthat the demand would call for and that the supply would provide, you \nget either a shortage or a surplus. It has been that way since time \nimmemorial, and it will be that way forevermore into the future.\n  We need to learn that lesson and be a little humble towards that \nprocess in the Senate as we stand on the floor of the Senate and raise \nour voices in indignation to say we must do something for these people \nin the name of fairness, and realize that in the long run we are in all \nprobability hurting far more than we are helping.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \ncurrently running virtually equally between the two sides be charged \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote against the combined \nlegislative branch and Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bills.\n  While the administration has identified a couple of funding \nshortfalls in the bill, that is not my primary concern here, and it is \nnot the reason I am opposing this legislation.\n  I am voting against the bill because the Senate has never considered \nthe Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. Let me repeat that: the Senate \nis being asked to vote on a conference report on a bill that never \npassed the Senate.\n  This is a complete distortion of the legislative process. We are not \npotted plants. The people of the state of California elected me to \nrepresent them. That means debating bills, offering amendments that are \nimportant to the people of my state, and casting votes. It does not \nmean giving a rubber stamp to whatever conference report comes before \nus when we have not even debated the bill in the first place.\n  I was considering offering an amendment to this bill prohibiting the \nsale of firearms to individuals who are drunk. Believe it or not, it is \nnot against the law to sell a gun to someone who is intoxicated. I was \nconsidering offering an amendment regarding the carrying of concealed \nweapons in places of worship. And I was considering offering an \namendment praising Smith and Wesson for entering into an agreement with \nthe administration to change the way it manufactures and distributes \nfirearms.\n  But I was prevented--every Senator was prevented--from offering any \namendments because the Treasury-Postal Service bill was never brought \nup. Normally a bill that does not come before the Senate cannot become \nlaw.\n  But the majority wanted to avoid debating and voting on these \namendments, and so they found a way to\n\n[[Page S8799]]\n\nmake an end-run around the rules of the Senate and to run roughshod \nover the rights of 100 Senators.\n  I will not be a party to this process, so I will vote against the \nbill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \ncontraceptive coverage provision included in the FY2001 Treasury-Postal \nappropriations conference report currently before the Senate.\n  This provision is fundamental to the health of the approximately 2 \nmillion women of reproductive age who rely on the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program, or FEHBP, for their health care, and I thank \nChairman Campbell for again including this important language. This \nlanguage is essentially the same language that has been signed into law \nthe last 2 years.\n  This provision says that if an FEHBP health plan provides coverage of \nprescription drugs and devices, they must also cover all FDA-approved \nprescription contraceptives. It also says that plans which already \ncover outpatient services also cover medical and counseling services to \npromote the effective use of those contraceptives.\n  This language respects the rights of religious plans that, as a \nmatter of conscience, choose not to cover contraceptives. Furthermore, \nthe committee language we have before us makes it clear that this \nlanguage does not cover abortion in any way, shape, or form.\n  The contraceptive coverage provision signed into law the last 2 \nyears, and contained in this year's bill, contains a conscience clause \nthat strikes the appropriate balance between recognizing the legitimate \nreligious concerns of individual health plans and physicians with the \nequally important goal of increasing access to prescription \ncontraceptives and reducing unintended pregnancy and abortion rates in \nthis country.\n  The religious exemption in current law specifically exempts the \nreligious-based plans that the Office of Personnel Management, which \nmanages FEHBP, identified as participating in FEHBP. And it exempts \n``any existing or future plan, if the plan objects to such coverage on \nthe basis of religious beliefs.''\n  Despite concerns voiced by opponents, this provision has caused no \nupheaval in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. When plans \nhave left the program in the last 2 years they cited insufficient \nenrollment, noncompetitive premiums, or unpredictable utilization as \nthe reason for leaving the program--not the requirement to cover \nprescription contraception. And other than the five plans specifically \nexcluded in current law, no plan has requested to be excluded from the \nprovision nor has any plan complained that the conscience clause is \ninsufficient. Furthermore, OPM is not aware of any physician or other \nhealth care provider who requested an exclusion.\n  The need to retain the current committee language is clear. Today, \nnearly 9 million Federal employees, retirees, and their dependents \nparticipate in the FEHBP. Approximately 2 million women of reproductive \nage rely on FEHBP for all their medical needs. Unfortunately, before \n1998, the vast majority of these women were denied access to the broad \nrange of safe and effective methods of contraception.\n  It is clear that the need for prescription contraceptive coverage is \nwell understood by women across the country. And while we in Congress \ndebate this need and delay guaranteeing coverage to women across the \ncountry, states are taking up the call on their own. In fact there are \n13 states--Maryland, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine, New \nHampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Vermont, California, Delaware, Iowa, \nand Rhode Island--who have passed their own contraceptive coverage \nlegislation.\n  Across America, the lack of equitable coverage of prescription \ncontraceptives contributes to the fact that women today spend 68 \npercent more than men in health care costs. That's 68 percent. And this \ngap in coverage translates into $7,000 to $10,000 over a woman's \nreproductive lifetime.\n  So I ask my colleagues: with 10 percent of all Federal employees \nearning less than $25,000 what do you think is the likely effect of \nthese tremendous added costs for these Federal employees?\n  Well, I'll tell you the effect is has: Many of them simply stop using \ncontraceptives, or will never use them in the first place, because they \nsimply can't afford to. And the impact of those decisions on these \nindividuals and on this nation is a lasting and profound one.\n  Women spend more than 90 percent of their reproductive life avoiding \npregnancy, and a woman who doesn't use contraception is 15 times more \nlikely to become pregnant than women who do. Fifteen times. And of the \n3 million unintended pregnancies in the United States, half of them \nwill end in abortion.\n  Mr. President, I can't think of anyone I know, no matter their \nideology or party, who doesn't want to see the instances of abortion in \nthis nation reduced. Well, imagine if I told you we could do something \nabout it.\n  We vote year after year to restrict abortion coverage in FEHBP plans. \nMy colleagues know that I vote against this restriction every time it \ncomes up. At the same time I firmly believe that, if the Senate is \ngoing to vote against allowing FEHBP plans to cover abortion, then we \nshould require this same plan to cover prescription contraceptives if \nthey cover other prescription medications--prescription contraceptives \nwhich prevent unintended pregnancies that lead to abortion.\n  That is what the committee language does. When the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute estimates that the use of birth control lowers the likelihood \nof abortion by a remarkable 85 percent, how can we ignore a provision \nlike this which makes the use of birth control more affordable to our \nFederal employees, and do so--according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice--with negligible cost to the Federal Government.\n  The fact is, all methods of contraception are cost effective when \ncompared to the cost of unintended pregnancy. And with unplanned \npregnancies linked to higher rates of premature and low-birth weight \nbabies, costs can rise even above and beyond those associated with \nhealthy births.\n  As the American Journal of Public Health estimates, the cost under \nmanaged care for a year's dose of birth control pills is less than one-\ntenth of what it would cost for prenatal care and delivery.\n  Whatever the reason, as an employer and model for the rest of the \nnation, the Federal Government should provide equal access to this most \nbasic health benefit for women. The committee language would allow \nFederal employees to have that option.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me say that if we, as a nation, are \ntruly committed to reducing abortion rates and increasing the quality \nof life for all Americans, then we need to begin focusing our attention \non how to prevent unintended pregnancies. Retailing contraceptive \ncoverage for Federal employees is a significant step in the right \ndirection. I thank Chairman Campbell for again including this important \nlanguage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nthe conference report accompanying H.R. 4516, the Legislative Branch \nand Treasury-general government appropriations bill for FY 2001.\n  The pending conference agreement combines two of the 13 annual \nappropriations bills into one bill, which provides $34.9 billion in new \nbudget authority and $30.9 billion in new outlays to fund the \noperations of the Legislative Branch, and the Executive Office of the \nPresident, and the agencies of the Department of the Treasury, \nincluding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Customs Service, Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the General Services Administration, \nand related agencies. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and \nother completed actions are taken into account the conference agreement \ntotals $33.0 billion in BA and $32.5 billion in outlays for fiscal year \n2001.\n  The final bill is $145 million in BA and $145 million in outlays \nbelow the most recent section 302(b) allocation for these two \nsubcommittees filed on September 20th.\n  The final bill also has a revenue effect for two provisions--repeal \nof a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that temporarily \nincreases federal employee retirement contributions by 0.5 percent; and \nrepeal of the telephone tax enacted in the late 1800's to help finance \nthe Spanish-American War. A loss of revenue totaling approximately\n\n[[Page S8800]]\n\n$4.8 billion is estimated for fiscal year 2001, and additional amounts \nin the outyears.\n  I commend the subcommittee chairman and ranking members for bringing \nthis important measure to the floor.

Mr. President, we are debating the motion to proceed to \nthe legislation that would increase the number of visas for aliens who \nhave certain technical skills that are deficient within the United \nStates; that is, the H-1B visa bill. Several of us hope this bill can \nbe expanded in order to deal with other pressing issues of immigration \nto provide not only for those who are desirous of working in the high-\ntech industry--the high-tech industry which needs their services--but \nalso that we can redress some of the injustices which have seeped into \nour immigration law. So I am, today, rising to discuss those elements \nof unfairness that we hope can be considered under the title of the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  The focus of this legislation is, as the title of the act says, \nfairness. We all learned some fundamental lessons in grammar school. \nOne of those is what is fair and what is not fair. It is fair for a \nteacher to punish two noisy schoolchildren who have broken the rules in \nthe classroom by keeping both of them inside during the recess period. \nWe may, in our own childhood, have been subjected to that kind of \nsanction. But if the teacher decides to let one child go out and play \nbut keeps the other in, that wouldn't be fair. In other words, one of \nthe aspects of fairness is treating people who are in the same \ncircumstances in the same way.\n  We are here today trying to achieve that type of fairness because, in \n1996, we passed an immigration law that went too far. It violated that \nrule of treating people in the same circumstances in the same way.\n  It was also unfair because it applied retroactively. People who had \nplayed by the rules, who were doing all the things that they thought \nthis society wanted them to do in order to become a part of our \nsociety, suddenly found that all those steps were for naught, and they \nwere about to be subjected to deportation. Making laws retroactive is \nalmost always bad public policy. It is changing the rules in the middle \nof the game. That is what we have done, but this is our opportunity to \ncorrect it.\n  A little history: Central American and Haitian immigrants came to the \nUnited States, particularly in the 1980s, and were welcomed by \nPresidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. They were fleeing civil wars \nor violent upheavals in their repressive governments. They followed \nevery rule.\n  Over the past 10 or 15 years, they set down roots. They raised \nfamilies; they bought homes, started small businesses. Then, with the \npassage of the 1996 immigration bill, they suddenly became deportable. \nThey could be forced to return to their countries, the very countries \nthey fled. They were being forced to do so based on no actions of their \nown but, rather, a change in the rules enacted here in Congress.\n  Congress was quick to recognize some of the overreaching of the 1996 \nimmigration law because 1 year later, in 1997, and then 2 years later, \nin 1998, Congress took steps to correct this injustice for some \npeople--mainly Nicaraguans, Cubans, and some Haitians. In 1997, with \nbipartisan support, Congress passed the Nicaraguan Adjustment and \nCentral American Relief Act, often called NACARA.\n  In 1998, with bipartisan support, we passed the Haitian Refugee \nImmigration Fairness Act. In 2000, with the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act, we can complete the process and correct injustices for \nall who face similar circumstances.\n\n  One part of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, the part that we\n\n[[Page S8801]]\n\nrefer to as ``NACARA Parity,'' would have a tremendous impact on \nCentral American and Haitian nationals. Many of the Central American \nand Haitian beneficiaries of this legislation reside in my State of \nFlorida. I know them well. They are small business owners; they are \neducators; they are volunteers. They are raising families who are \ncontributing to our State. These residents are a vibrant and crucial \npart of our community. Many have made Florida their home for 15 or 20 \nyears or more. It is patently unfair to uproot these families after \nthey have sunk such deep roots into our communities.\n  I had the honor of participating in a hearing held recently in Miami \nwhen we originally introduced the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness \nAct. At that hearing we heard some stories, stories of adults and \nchildren; stories of people like Louisiana Micleese and Nestela \nRobergeau. It deeply affected the whole audience in attendance at the \nhearing.\n  I spoke at the hearing and told the story of a Miami resident, \nAlexandra Charles, who witnessed the brutal killing of her mother by \nmilitary personnel in Haiti. Alexandra couldn't come to the hearing \nwhen I spoke on her behalf because she was working at one of the two \njobs she is holding down in order to pay her way through the Miami Dade \nCommunity College. This young adult, who had grown up in Florida, was \nin danger of being deported to what, for her, was, for all intents and \npurposes, a foreign country. Congress did the right thing and passed \nlegislation to protect her. But we did not protect others.\n  There are other elements of this legislation, the Latino fairness \nlegislation. It is legislation which will update the registry which has \nnot been updated in many years. That is the registry of who is \ncurrently in the United States, who has been living here as a law-\nabiding person and can apply for some legal status in the United \nStates, and also a restoration of the 245(i) program, which is pro-\nbusiness, pro-family, and common sense.\n  I will not speak at length on those other two provisions in this \nlegislation because I know there are colleagues who will follow me who \ndesire to do so. But I want to make one point that is common to all \nthree components of this legislation: The ``NICARA Parity'' provision, \nthe registry update, and the restoration of the 245(i) program.\n  Many business organizations see this legislation, the three \ncomponents, not only as humanitarian and fair but one that makes \neconomic sense. I would like to submit for the Record a letter of \nsupport from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business \norganizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter dated September 8 of this year from \nthe Essential Worker Immigration Coalition be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, these immigrants are long-time employees \nof small businesses and other businesses in virtually every State. They \nare workers who do some of the toughest, hardest jobs in America. What \naffects them affects all of us, especially the businesses and the \nconsumers who rely on their dedication, energy, and commitment to \nachieving the American dream.\n  I urge all my colleagues to work with us and assure that this vital, \nlong overdue legislation, legislation that is in the best American \ntraditions of fairness and justice, becomes law and becomes law this \nyear.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             EWIC Essential Worker\n\n\n                                        Immigration Coalition,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2000.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition \n     (EWIC) is a coalition of businesses, trade associations, and \n     other organizations from across the industry spectrum \n     concerned with the shortage of both semi-skilled and \n     unskilled (``essential worker'') labor.\n       While all sectors of the economy have benefited from the \n     extended period of economic growth, one significant \n     impediment to continued growth is the shortage of essential \n     workers. With unemployment rates in some areas approaching \n     zero and despite continuing vigorous and successful welfare-\n     to-work, school-to-work, and other recruitment efforts, some \n     businesses are now finding themselves with no applicants of \n     any kind for numerous job openings. There simply are not \n     enough workers in the U.S. to meet the demand of our strong \n     economy, and we must recognize that foreign workers are part \n     of the answer.\n       Furthermore, in this tight labor market, it can be \n     devastating when a business loses employees because they are \n     found to be in the U.S. illegally. Many of these workers have \n     been in this country for years: paying taxes and building \n     lives. EWIC supports measures that will allow them to remain \n     productive members of our society.\n       We believe there are several steps Congress can take not to \n     help stabilize the current workforce:\n        Update the registry date. As has done in the past, \n     the registry date should be moved forward, this time from \n     1972 to 1986. This would allow undocumented immigrants who \n     have lived and worked in the U.S. for many years to remain \n     here permanently.\n        Restore Section 245(i). A provision of immigration \n     law, Section 245(i), allowed eligible people living here to \n     pay a $1,000 fee and adjust their status in this country. \n     Since Section 245(i) was grandfathered in 1998, INS backlogs \n     have skyrocketed, families have been separated, businesses \n     have lost valuable employees, and eligible people must leave \n     the country (often for years) in order to adjust.\n        Pass the Central American and Haitian Adjustment \n     Act. Refugees from certain Central American and Caribbean \n     countries currently are eligible to become permanent \n     residents. However, current law does not help others in \n     similar circumstances. Congress needs to act to ensure that \n     refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras have \n     the same opportunity to become permanent residents.\n       We are also enclosing our reform agenda which includes our \n     number one priority: allowing employers facing worker \n     shortages greater access to the global labor market. EWIC's \n     members employ many immigrants and support immigration \n     reforms that unite families and help stabilize the current \n     U.S. workforce. We look forward to working with you to pass \n     all of these important measures.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                  Essential Worker\n                                            Immigration Coalition.\n\n\n             Essential Worker Immigration Coalition Members\n\n       American Health Care Association, American Hotel & Motel \n     Association, American Immigration Lawyers Association, \n     American Meat Institute, American Road & Transportation \n     Builders Association, American Nursery & Landscape \n     Association, Associated Builders and Contractors, Associated \n     General Contractors, The Brickman Group, Ltd., Building \n     Service Contractors Association International, Carlson Hotels \n     Worldwide and Radisson, Carlson Hotels Worldwide and TGI \n     Friday's, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Harborside \n     Healthcare Corporation, Ingersoll-Rand.\n       International Association of Amusement Parks and \n     Attractions, International Mass Retail Association, \n     Manufactured Housing Institute, Nath Companies, National \n     Association for Home Care, National Association of Chain Drug \n     Stores, National Association of RV Parks & Campgrounds, \n     National Council of Chain Restaurants, National Retail \n     Federation, National Restaurant Association, National Roofing \n     Contractors Association, National Tooling & Machining \n     Association, National School Transportation Association, \n     Outdoor Amusement Business Association, Resort Recreation & \n     Tourism Management, US Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is a motion to proceed on \nS. 2045.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to address that subject, and \nI will probably speak for about 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have a very important issue facing us \nin California. In fact, we have two very important issues facing us in \nCalifornia that are intertwined into this particular discussion on \nimmigration policy. One of them deals with the real shortage of high-\ntech labor that we face in California and elsewhere in the country, \nwhere we are finding that the high-tech industry cannot find enough \ngood, qualified people with the proper skills, experience, and training \nto fill the high-tech jobs that are really fueling our economic \nrecovery and our economic prosperity, not only in California but in \nmany other States.\n  This is a real problem. At first, when I heard about it, I thought, \ncould this\n\n[[Page S8802]]\n\nbe true? Could it be true that we do not have these workers? Since I \nhave asked that question, and a number of others did also, there have \nbeen some studies showing that it is the case; that we do have a \nshortage of these workers. If we don't make accommodations for people \nto come into this country who have these skills, we will simply not be \nable to function as an economy.\n  The second problem we face in California--and perhaps in other \nStates, I am sure--is the question of fairness in our immigration law. \nFairness really needs to be a hallmark of what we do when it comes to \nimmigration. We should not treat people from one country who face real \nproblems differently from people from another country who face similar \nproblems. Yet we have that with respect to our Latin American policy. \nSo we really need to have a situation where we have a Latino fairness \nact, while we are, in fact, taking care of the labor shortages for our \nbusiness friends. These things are interrelated in many ways. I hope we \nwill be able to take them up together and pass them together; or if we \ncan't do it that way, I hope that we have an agreement between both \nsides of the aisle, and with the President, that we will make sure both \nof these problems are addressed and are addressed in a good and careful \nway.\n  Let me talk about the Latino fairness question. Basically, what we \nare asking for is parity for all Americans so immigrants from El \nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti have the same chance and go \nthrough the same process for permanent status or asylum as those from \nNicaragua and Cuba. It is very simple. Why should we say to immigrants \nfrom one Latin American country that they would have a different \nstandard when, in fact, there has been great suffering in all of these \ncountries?\n  It may take place in different ways, but the bottom line is that \nthere are many people from these countries who had to leave these \ncountries because of fear of harm to themselves, their families; and \nthose people were in these countries I mentioned.\n  We have heard about death squads. We have heard about horrible things \nhappening to people and people disappearing in the middle of the night. \nIn fact, the families in Guatemala have been shattered by this kind of \nthing, and a group of mothers got together and brought this issue to \nthe world's attention. So there has been suffering. We remember the \nsuffering from El Salvador with the right-wing death squads operating \nthere, and we know the horror stories from Haiti and the other \ncountries that are clamoring for some kind of fairness.\n\n  So if you lived in Nicaragua and you were hurt there by the Communist \nregime, or if you lived in Cuba and you were hurt there by the \nCommunist regime, we want to open our arms to you. Why wouldn't we want \nto open our arms to you if you were hurt by a right-wing regime? We \nshould not be playing politics at all. We should say that people who \nare persecuted by government--whether the bullet came from the right, \nleft, or the middle, it doesn't matter; it is still a bullet. We should \nbe fair to all of those people.\n  We want to update the registry so that undocumented aliens in the \nU.S. before 1986 can get a chance to remain permanently. The current \ncutoff date is 1972. Historically, we have gone back and changed those \ndates. It is time to do that.\n  We want to restore section 245(i), which allows those eligible for \npermanent resident status, who are in the U.S. already, to remain here \nwhile the process is being completed.\n  I want to tell you a real story about why this is so important. Jaime \ncame to the U.S. from Mexico, and is now married to Michelle, a U.S. \ncitizen. The couple has two daughters, both U.S. citizens. As a \ncitizen, Michelle petitioned for an immigrant visa for her husband. \nWhen it came time to complete the visa application process, Jaime and \nhis wife went to the consular offices in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico, for the \ninterview. He was unaware that if he left the United States he would be \nbarred from entering for 10 years. Michelle returned but has since lost \nher job and is struggling financially to support her children. Jaime is \nmaking very little money in Mexico--not enough to support his family in \nthe U.S. Michelle finds every day a struggle to survive without her \nhusband. The separation has caused great emotional anguish, as well as \neconomic hardship.\n  I think all of us on both sides of the aisle care about families and \ncare about family unification. We know how important it is that \nchildren have a mother and a dad at home, if it is possible. So here we \nhave a policy where this gentleman who came here a long time ago, was \nworking and supporting his family, made a mistake and left the country; \nnow he finds out he can't come back for 10 years. We need to fix this \nproblem.\n  So while we are helping our friends in the high-tech industry get \nworkers and allow those workers to come into this country, to immigrate \ninto this country, it seems to me that we ought to address this Latino \nfairness act.\n  As I said before, I was a little dubious when I heard of these \nshortages in the high-tech companies I represent. So I was very pleased \nwhen there was a study because the study showed that in fact they were \ntelling us the absolute truth; they are short a lot of people.\n  In January 2000, unemployment hit its lowest level in 30 years. What \na great economic story we have to tell. It is important to all of our \nsectors that are desperate for properly qualified employees.\n  We thought we would never see this day, even as recently as 1992, \nwhich seems like yesterday. That is when I won election to the Senate. \nThe people in my State were suffering double-digit unemployment. We are \nvery happy to stand here today and say that because of the Clinton-Gore \npolicy that made it through, we have seen the greatest economic \nrecovery in history, with the biggest surplus we have seen, having \ncreated 22 million new jobs.\n  So we have a problem, and our problem is an enviable one to the \nentire world. We really need to have more help in our high-tech \nindustry.\n  That is why this bill that is pending before us is so important. That \nis why I support it so strongly.\n  We see that an independent study group found a shortage of 400,000 \nprogrammers, systems analysts, and computer scientists.\n  We know we have a real problem. We also know we are not doing enough \nin this country to educate our kids.\n  That is why I am so excited at the idea of a huge commitment to \neducation, the kind Vice President Gore talked about--he said the \nbiggest since the GI bill. That is what we need so we don't have to \nimport these workers.\n  The number of bachelor's degrees awarded in computer science has \ndeclined 43 percent between 1986 and 1996. The number of bachelor's \ndegrees awarded in engineering declined 19 percent between 1986 and \n1996.\n  We are not turning out the graduates for the computer science and \nengineering skills that we need.\n  We need to really move on this matter; it breaks my heart to say \nthese high-paying jobs are not going to American workers.\n  Some of the good things in this H-1B visa bill deal with retraining. \nA lot of the funds will come from the fees the companies will pay. They \nhave to pay a fee when they bring a worker in to do important things--\nworkforce training; math and science engineering; technology; \npostsecondary scholarships for low-income and disadvantaged students; \nto the National Science Foundation for matching or direct grants to \nsupport private company partnerships; to assist schools in initiating, \nimproving, or expanding math and science; and information technology \ncurricula through a variety of methods. We have some funds to help our \nDepartment of Labor enforce and process these workers, and for the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service.\n  I compliment the committee for its work. I particularly thank Senator \nKennedy who did a very good job of working with the high-tech \ncommunity. They are very supportive of seeing that these fees go to \nthis education and job training. It is so important. It isn't enough. \nWe need a bigger commitment to education. That is clear.\n  When I talk about education, I always quote a wonderful man who was \nthe President in the 1950s, Dwight David Eisenhower. Ike said in those \nyears that in order for us to be strong, it took more than just a \nstrong military. He said you could have more guns than any other \ncountry. You could\n\n[[Page S8803]]\n\nhave more missiles, more ships, and more people in uniform. But if you \ndidn't have an educated workforce, if education wasn't front and \ncenter, it would mean nothing; we would be weak.\n  He was the first President in modern times to say there is a role for \nthe Federal Government in education. He signed the National Defense \nEducation Act in order to stimulate teachers to go into math and \nscience, and so on.\n  If he were here today, I think he would be saying to us: You didn't \ndo enough in education. You have done great on the military; we are the \nmost powerful Nation in the world, but we had better make sure our \npeople can run these very complicated military machines, let alone \nanything to do with the civilian sector.\n  My view is that we have a great opportunity with this bill. It is \nimportant that we give the high-tech community the workers they need so \nthey will stay in this country, and so they will continue to fuel this \neconomic growth.\n  It is also important that at the same time we are allowing so many \nthousands of farm workers into the country to help us--and we are very \nhappy and willing to do that--that we look at our immigration policy \ntoward people who have been here for many years--the Latino community--\nand pass the Latino fairness act.\n\n  I think if we did both of those things we would feel very good about \nthe Senate because it would be fairness all the way around.\n  I appreciate having this opportunity to speak on this today. I know \nfrom the Silicon Valley and other areas of my State--Los Angeles, San \nDiego, and even now in the Central Valley where there is more and more \ngrowth in the high-tech computer industries--that we need this visa \nbill.\n  I also can tell you from my Latino community that they expect to be \ntreated fairly. They are not asking for the world. They want their \nfamilies to be reunited. They want fairness and equity for all Central \nAmericans.\n  Again, if there was persecution in one country and we opened our arms \nto those good people, we should open our arms to the others from the \nother countries who have been left out.\n  Again, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti have been \nstruggling. They need our help.\n  I think this is an opportunity to help our business community and to \nhelp our immigrants who are really making our country so strong and, in \nmy opinion, doing the work that needs to be done every day. We couldn't \nfind harder workers than they. They ought to be treated with dignity \nand respect.\n  While we are at it, we ought to raise the minimum wage. I hope we can \ntake that up in the near future. I don't know if you can calculate what \nyou would make if you earned a minimum wage. It is hard to survive. It \nis practically impossible to survive.\n  I hope we can do these things for our workers, for our businesses, \nfor our immigrants, and move this country forward so the American dream \nis there for all of our people.\n  Thank you very much. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin and I be allowed to proceed as if in morning business \nfor a period of not to exceed 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins and Mr. Feingold are located in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate has been considering an \nimportant measure to increase the number of visas available for high-\ntechnology workers from other countries to come to the United States. I \nurge my colleagues to lend their support to that measure but also to an \nequally important measure, not only for providing a workforce in \nAmerica but for keeping true to our fundamental sense of American \nfairness. The bill to which I refer is the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act. I am honored to be a cosponsor of one of the three major \nelements of that act.\n  The United States is known throughout the world for the splendid \nvision that guides the actions we take as a nation. America is first \nand foremost a country that cherishes equality, a land where all people \nare equal under the eyes of the law, a land of liberty and justice for \nall.\n  This vision of America is a constant challenge to those of us in the \nSenate who are privileged to be working for the American people, \nworking to make it concrete and real in everyday life. It is a hard \ntask, indeed, to ensure equality of opportunity for all people, harder \nstill to provide equal justice. Perhaps most difficult of all is the \nchallenge of ensuring that equality of opportunity, of liberty, and of \njustice are available to the poorest, the most underrepresented, the \nmost disenfranchised segments of American society.\n  There is an area of public policy where our efforts at achieving this \nAmerican ideal have not always been successful, an area where \ncounterproductive laws and cumbersome bureaucracies have dealt a series \nof unfair blows against people least able to defend themselves, an area \nwhere inequality in the eyes of the law is too often the rule rather \nthan the exception. I am speaking of the plight of our immigrant \npopulation.\n  Let me confess at the outset that I come to this subject with some \nprejudice. My mother was an immigrant to this country. In my office in \nthe Senate above my desk is my mother's naturalization certificate. I \nkeep it there as a reminder that the son of an immigrant to this \ncountry can one day be a U.S. Senator, representing a State as great as \nthe State of Illinois.\n  My story isn't unique. There are stories such as mine all over \nAmerica--of people who came here as immigrants, their sons and \ndaughters, looking for the American dream and finding it. Given that \nopportunity to participate in this great society, to work hard, to try \nto achieve their very best, they did. Because of that, we are a great \nnation.\n  The current state of affairs is shocking when it comes to the \narbitrary treatment of immigrants coming to our country. Almost at \nrandom, Federal authorities deem some immigrants to be legally here \nwhile others in identical situations are denied any legal protection.\n  In a nation that treasures and respects ``family values'', immigrant \nfamilies are being torn apart under the capricious application of our \ncurrent laws. Husbands must leave their wives, parents are separated \nfrom their children, brothers and sisters told they may never be able \nto see one another again, all in the name of an immigration policy that \ntreats Nicaraguans differently from Salvadorans, children differently \nfrom adolescents, and skilled carpenters differently from skilled \ncomputer technicians.\n  The simple, inescapable fact is that our current immigration laws are \nunfair. They create a highly unworkable patchwork approach to the \nstatus of immigrants, one that assaults our sense of fair play. \nImmigrants from Nicaragua and Cuba who have lived here since 1995 can \nobtain green card status in the U.S. through a sensible, \nstraightforward process. Guatemalans, Salvadorans and East Europeans \nare covered by a different, more stringent and more cumbersome set of \nprocedures. A select group of Haitian immigrants are classified under \nanother restrictive status. Hondurans by yet another.\n  Here are some examples:\n  As if this helter-skelter approach isn't bad enough, existing \npolicies also treat family members of immigrants--spouses and \nchildren--differently depending on where they live, and under which \nprovision of which law they are covered. Consider the case of young \nGheycell, who came to the U.S. when she was 12 years old with her \nfather and sister. The family was fleeing from war-torn Guatemala; \nfleeing the carnage, brutality and utter chaos that ravaged their poor \ncountry. They applied for asylum here in the United States, and \nreceived work permits as their case was decided. Nine years\n\n[[Page S8804]]\n\nlater, the case is still pending. Gheycell's father and sister have \nbeen told they will get their green cards, but Gheycell, now 21 years \nold, is no longer a minor child, and has thereby lost her legal status. \nAlthough she has grown up in the United States, although she has become \nan active and integrated member of her community, although she has \nattended college here and wants to further pursue her education and her \ncareer and, most of all, although she desperately wants to stay \ntogether with her family, the vagaries of our current system have \nplunged this young lady into a status as an undocumented alien.\n  Or consider the plight of Maria Orellana, a war refugee from El \nSalvador, who fled the country when soldiers killed two members of her \nfamily. She has lived the past ten years in the United States. \nRecently, the INS ordered her deported even though she is eight months \npregnant and even though her husband--himself an immigrant--has legal \nstatus here and expects to soon be sworn in as a U.S. citizen. When a \nnewspaper reporter asked the INS to comment on Maria's case, the reply \nwas: ``I don't know why Congress wrote it differently for people of \ndifferent countries. We're not in a position to change a law given to \nus by Congress . . . we just enforce the law as written.''\n  Well, the law, in this case, was written badly, and needs to be \nfixed. That fix is before us today. It is the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act. This bill addresses three areas of the most egregious \ninequities in immigration law, offering fixes that are not only meet \nthe test of simple fairness, but also benefit our nation in important \nways.\n  The first area that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act addresses \nis NACARA parity. Currently, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act--NACARA--creates different standards for immigrants \ndepending on their country of origin. This patchwork approach relies on \nartificial distinctions and inevitably creates inequities among \ndifferent populations of immigrants. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness \nAct would eliminate these inequities by providing a level playing field \non which all immigrants with similar histories would be treated equally \nunder the law. The Act extends to other immigrants--whether from the \nAmericas or from Eastern Europe--the same opportunities that NACARA \ncurrently provides only to Nicaraguans and Cubans.\n  Secondly, a provision to restore Section 245(i) of the Immigration \nAct would restore a long-standing and sensible policy that was \nunfortunately allowed to lapse in 1997. Section 245(i) had allowed \nindividuals that qualified for a green card to obtain their visa in the \nU.S. if they were already in the country. Without this common-sense \nprovision, immigrants on the verge of getting a green card must return \nto their home country to obtain their visa. However, the very act of \nmaking such an onerous trip can put their status in jeopardy, since \nother provisions of immigration law prohibit re-entry to the U.S. under \ncertain circumstances. Restoring the Section 245(i) mechanism to obtain \nvisas here in the U.S. is a good policy that will help keep families \ntogether and keep willing workers in the U.S. labor force.\n  Third, and equally important, is changing the Date of Registry. \nUndocumented immigrants seeking permanent residency must demonstrate \nthat they have lived continuously in the U.S. since the ``date of \nregistry'' cut-off. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act would update \nthe date of registry from 1972--almost 30 years of continuous \nresidency--to 1986. Many immigrants have been victimized by confusing \nand inconsistent INS policies in the past fifteen years--policies that \nhave been overturned in numerous court decisions, but that have \nnonetheless prevented many immigrants from being granted permanent \nresidency. Updating the date of registry to 1986 would bring long \noverdue justice to the affected populations.\n  Correcting the inequities in current immigration policies is not only \na matter of fundamental fairness, it is good, pragmatic public policy. \nThe funds sent back by immigrants to their home countries are important \nsources of foreign exchange, and significant stabilizing factors in \nseveral national economies. The immigrant workforce is important to our \nnational economy as well. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has \nfrequently cited the threat to our economic well-being posed by an \nincreasingly tight labor pool. Well, this act would allow workers \nalready here to move more freely in the labor market, and provide not \njust high-tech labor, but a robust pool of workers able to contribute \nto all segments of the economy.\n  In short, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is an important step \nfor restoring a fundamental sense of fairness in our treatment of \nAmerica's immigrant population. Even in the midst of the Senate's busy \nend-of-session schedule, this is a bill that should be passed into law. \nIt is a matter of common sense, and of good public policy but most of \nall, it is a matter of simple fairness.\n  But--and this must be said--the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act has \nhad an extraordinarily difficult time seeing the light of day. My good \ncolleagues, Senators Kennedy and Reid and I tried to bring this bill \nforward for consideration in July, before the Senate left for its \nAugust recess. We were unsuccessful. We are trying again now, in the \nlimited time left for this Congressional session, and again, we have \nbeen unsuccessful. And I must ask, for the sake of preserving families, \nshouldn't this bill be voted on? For the sake of our national economy--\nbeset as it is by a shortage of essential workers--shouldn't this bill \nbe voted on? For the sake of the economies of those Latin American \ncountries that receive considerable sums from immigrants to the U.S. \nwho are able to legally live and work here, shouldn't this bill be \nvoted on? For the sake of our national sense of fairness, of justice, \nof our very notion of right and wrong, shouldn't this bill be voted on?\n  The Latino Immigration and Fairness Act has unusually broad support. \nPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore both actively support the \nprovisions in this bill. So does Jack Kemp. Empower America supports \nthis bill as pro-family and pro-market. AFL-CIO supports it as pro-\nlabor. Many faith-based organizations have lent their support as well, \nrecognizing the simple fairness that is at the heart of this \nlegislation. In light of this broad spectrum of bipartisan support for \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, it seems the only proper course \nof action is to bring this bill forward in the Senate for full \nconsideration. Again, I have to close by asking this esteemed body: \nShouldn't this bill be voted on?\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois has said. He, of course, has worked so long on both the \nH-1B visas issue and the immigration issues included in the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. I know of nobody who spends more time on these \nissues than he does. I am proud to be here with him, and I invite him \nto return to these issues as we proceed in this debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8804-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8804-S8806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               H-1B VISAS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are finally turning \nour attention to this legislation and a debate over the best way to \nincrease the number of H-1B visas, a policy goal that is shared widely \nin this body. The bill was reported from the Judiciary Committee more \nthan six months ago. It has taken us a very long time to get from Point \nA to Point B, and it has often appeared that the majority has been more \ninterested in gaining partisan advantage from a delay than in actually \nmaking this bill law.\n  The Democratic Leader has consistently said that we would be willing \nto accept very strict time limits on debating amendments, and would be \nwilling to conduct the entire debate on S. 2045 in less than a day. Our \nLeader has also consistently said that it is critical that the Senate \ntake up proposals to provide parity for refugees from right-wing \nregimes in Central America and to address an issue that has been \nignored for far too long--how we should treat undocumented aliens who \nhave lived here for decades, paying taxes and contributing to our \neconomy. I joined in the call for action on H-1B and other critical \nimmigration issues, but our efforts were rebuffed by the majority.\n\n[[Page S8805]]\n\n  Indeed, months went by in which the majority made no attempt to \nnegotiate these differences, time which many members of the majority \ninstead spent trying to blame Democrats for the delay in their bringing \nthis legislation to the floor. At many times, it seemed that the \nmajority was more interested in casting blame upon Democrats than in \nactually passing legislation. Instead of working in good faith with the \nminority to bring this bill to the floor, the majority spent its time \ntrying to convince leaders in the information technology industry that \nthe Democratic Party is hostile to this bill and that only Republicans \nare interested in solving the legitimate employment shortages faced by \nmany sectors of American industry. Considering that three-quarters of \nthe Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted for this bill, and that \nthe bill has numerous Democratic cosponsors, including Senator \nLieberman, this partisan appeal was not only inappropriate but absurd \non its face.\n  Finally, last week, the majority made a counteroffer that did not \nprovide as many amendments as we would like, but which did allow \namendments related to immigration generally. We responded \nenthusiastically to this proposal, but individual members of the \nmajority objected, and there is still no agreement to allow immigration \namendments. At least some members of the majority are apparently \nunwilling even to vote on issues that are critical to members of the \nLatino community. This is deeply unfortunate, and leaves those of us \nwho are concerned about humanitarian immigration issues with an \nuncomfortable choice. We can either address the legitimate needs of the \nhigh-tech industry in the vacuum that the majority has imposed, or we \ncan refuse to proceed on this bill until the majority affords us the \nopportunity to address other important immigration needs. I voted \nyesterday to proceed to S. 2045 because I believe it presents a good \nstarting point for discussion, and because I believe we should make \nprogress on immigration issues in this Congress. I still hope that an \nagreement can be reached with the majority that will allow votes \non other important immigration matters as part of our consideration of \nthis bill.\n\n  I believe there is a labor shortage in certain areas of our economy, \nand a short-term increase in H-1B visas is an appropriate response. Due \nto the stunning economic growth we have experienced in the past eight \nyears, unemployment is lower than the best-case scenario envisioned by \nmost economists. Increasing the number of available H-1B visas is \nparticularly important for the high-tech industry, which has done so \nmuch to contribute to our strong economy. Although it is important that \nthe high-tech industry ensure that it is making maximum possible use of \nAmerican workers, it should also have access to highly-skilled workers \nfrom abroad, particularly workers who were educated at American \nuniversities. Under current law, however, which allowed for 115,000 \nvisas for FY 2000, every visa was allotted by March, only halfway \nthrough the fiscal year.\n  So I support this bill's call for an increase in the number of visas. \nBut I believe the legislation can be improved, and I look forward to \nthe opportunity to make improvements through the amendment process. \nMost importantly, instead of including an open-ended provision \nexempting from the cap those foreign workers with graduate degrees from \nAmerican universities, as S. 2045 does, I believe we should retain a \nconcrete cap on the number of these visas. I believe we should increase \nthe cap to 200,000, and then set aside a significant percentage of \nthose visas for such workers. This should address employers' needs for \nhighly-skilled workers, while also limiting the number of visas that go \nto foreign workers with less specialized skills.\n  I regret that we will likely be unable to offer other important \namendments to this bill. For much of the summer, the majority implied \nthat we were simply using the concerns of Latino voters as a \nsmokescreen to avoid considering S. 2045. Speaking for myself, although \nI have had reservations about certain aspects of S. 2045, I voted to \nreport it from the Judiciary Committee so that we could move forward in \nour discussions of the bill. I did not seek to offer immigration \namendments on the Senate floor because I wanted to derail S. 2045. Nor \ndid the White House urge Congress to consider other immigration issues \nas part of the H-1B debate because the President wanted to play \npolitics with this issue, as the distinguished Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee suggested on the floor last Friday. Rather, the \nmajority's inaction on a range of immigration measures in this Congress \nforced those of us who were concerned about immigration issues to \nattempt to raise those issues. Under our current leadership, the \nopportunity to enact needed change in our immigration laws does not \ncome around very often, to put it mildly.\n  It is a disturbing but increasingly undeniable fact that the interest \nof the business community has become a prerequisite for immigration \nbills to receive attention on the Senate floor. In fact, with only a \nfew weeks remaining before we adjourn, this will be the first \nimmigration bill to be debated on the floor in this Congress. Even \nhumanitarian bills with bipartisan backing have been ignored in this \nCongress, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The bipartisan bills that have suffered from the majority's neglect \ninclude both modest bills designed to assist particular immigrant \ngroups and larger bills designed to reform substantial portions of our \nimmigration and asylum laws. Bills to assist Syrian Jews, Haitians, \nNicaraguans, Liberians, Hondurans, Cubans, and Salvadorans all need \nattention. Bills to restore due process rights and limited public \nbenefits to legal permanent residents have been ignored.\n  The Refugee Protection Act, a bipartisan bill with 10 sponsors that I \nintroduced with Senator Brownback, has not even received a hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee, despite my request as Ranking Member. The \nRefugee Protection Act addresses the issue of expedited removal, the \nprocess under which aliens arriving in the United States can be \nreturned immediately to their native lands at the say-so of a low-level \nINS officer. Expedited removal was the subject of a major debate in \nthis Chamber in 1996, and the Senate voted to use it only during \nimmigration emergencies. This Senate-passed restriction was removed in \nwhat was probably the most partisan conference committee I have ever \nwitnessed. The Refugee Protection Act is modeled closely on that 1996 \namendment, and I hope that it again gains the support of a majority of \nmy colleagues.\n  As a result of the adoption of expedited removal, we now have a \nsystem where we are removing people who arrive here either without \nproper documentation or with facially valid documentation that an INS \nofficer suspects is invalid. This policy ignores the fact that people \nfleeing despotic regimes are quite often unable to obtain travel \ndocuments before they go--they must move quickly and cannot depend upon \nthe government that is persecuting them to provide them with the proper \npaperwork for departure. In the limited time that expedited removal has \nbeen in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum \nseekers who were kicked out of our country without the opportunity to \nconvince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their \nnative lands. To provide just one example, a Kosovar Albanian was \nsummarily removed from the U.S. after the civil war in Kosovo had \nalready made the front pages of America's newspapers.\n  The majority has mishandled even those immigration bills that needed \nto be passed by a date certain to avoid significant humanitarian and \ndiplomatic consequences. First, the Senate failed to pass a bill to \nmake permanent the visa waiver program that allows Americans to travel \nto numerous other countries without a visa. The visa waiver pilot \nprogram expired on April 30, and the House passed legislation to make \nthe program permanent in a timely manner, understanding the importance \nof not allowing this program--which our citizens and the citizens of \nmany of our closest allies depend upon--to lapse. The Senate, however, \nsimply ignored the deadline and has subsequently ignored numerous \ndeadlines for administrative extensions of the program.\n  Second, the Senate has thus far refused to act on the bipartisan S. \n2058, which would extend the deadline by one year for Nicaraguans, \nCubans, and Haitians to apply for adjustment of\n\n[[Page S8806]]\n\nstatus under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, \nNACARA, and the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act, HRIFA. The \noriginal deadline expired on March 31. But the Senate did not extend \nthe deadline--an action that the Judiciary Committee unanimously \napproved--by March 31. And the Senate has not acted to extend the \ndeadline in the intervening five and a half months. No one has \nexpressed any opposition to S. 2058, which counts Senators Mack and \nHelms among its sponsors; rather, the majority has simply allowed the \nbill to sit and fester, perhaps holding it hostage to the passage of S. \n2045. As a result, we in the Congress have had to rely upon the \nAdministration's assurances that it would not remove those who would be \naided by the extension from the United States while this legislation \nwas pending. As someone who has served for more than 25 years in the \nSenate, I find it profoundly disturbing that this body must rely on the \nAdministration not to enforce the law because it has taken us so long \nto actually make good on our intention to change it. We should not need \nto rely on the good graces of the Administration--we should do our job \nand legislate.\n\n  I am well aware that immigration is just one of the many issues that \nCongress must address. Indeed, there may be some Congresses where \nimmigration needs to be placed on the backburner so that we can address \nother issues. But this is not such a Congress. It was only four years \nago that we passed two bills with far-reaching effects on immigration \nlaw--the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. There are still \nmany aspects of those laws that merit our careful review and \nrethinking. Among many others, Senators Kennedy, Moynihan, and Durbin \nhave been actively involved in promoting necessary changes to those \nlaws, in an attempt to rededicate the United States to its historic \nrole as a leader in immigration policy. But their efforts too have been \nignored by the majority.\n  When a bill such as S. 2045 comes to the floor, then, those of us who \nare concerned about immigration legislation would be abdicating our \nduty not to raise other potential immigration legislation. Most members \nof both parties want to see a significant increase in the number of H-\n1B visas. If there had been another avenue to obtain consideration of \nthe rest of our immigration agenda, we would have taken it. But such an \navenue was not offered.\n  I voted to proceed to consideration of this bill. I hold out hope \nthat we can reach an agreement to discuss other critical immigration \nmatters. If the majority truly wishes to display compassionate \nconservatism, and show concern for all Americans, such an agreement \nshould be easy to reach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8806-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8806-S8807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LATINO AND IMMIGRANT FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me speak about the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act and why we should consider this bill now.\n  I say this with no ulterior motive. Obviously, if anyone looks at the \ndemographics of Vermont, they know I am not speaking about this because \nof a significant Hispanic population in the State of Vermont. I speak \nabout it out of a sense of fairness. It is called the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. That is what it is.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, not only as a Senator but \nas ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, because it addresses \nthree very important issues to the Latino community.\n  We fought on our side of the aisle consistently to obtain debate and \na vote on these proposals either as an amendment or as a freestanding \nbill.\n  Once again, I call on the leadership to give us either a vote as a \nfreestanding bill or as an amendment because we ought to stand up in \nthe Senate and say how we stand on this issue. If my colleagues on the \nother side believe in compassionate conservatism, they will allow a \nvote on this bill, which offers help to hardworking families who pay \ntaxes and help keep our economy strong.\n  First off, this legislation ensures that we treat all people who fled \ntyranny in Central America equally, regardless of whether the \ntyrannical regime they fled was a left-wing or right-wing government.\n  I remember going into a refugee camp in Central America and talking \nto a woman who was there with her one remaining child. Her husband had \nbeen killed. Her other children had been killed.\n  I said: Do you ally yourself with the left or the right? She didn't \nknow who was on the left or who was on the right in the forces that \nwere fighting. She only knew that she and her husband had wanted to \nraise their family and to farm a little land. And yet the forces of the \nregime came in and killed the whole family with the exception of her \nand her one child.\n  People who have no political position get caught in terrible \ncircumstances, in between forces to which they have no allegiance.\n  In 1997, Congress granted permanent residence status to Nicaraguans \nand Cubans who fled dictatorship and who met certain conditions. It may \nwell have been the right step. But others were left behind.\n  It is past time to extend the benefits of the 1997 law to \nGuatemalans, Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Haitians. To benefit under \nthis bill, an immigrant would have to have been in the United States \nsince December of 1995 and would have to demonstrate good moral \ncharacter.\n  In addition to the clear humanitarian justifications for treating an \nimmigrant from Guatemala who fled terror in the same way we treat an \nimmigrant from Nicaragua who fled terror, there is also a strong \nforeign policy justification for this bill. These immigrants send money \nback to their families. They help support fledgling economies in what \nremain fragile democracies. The United States has devoted significant \neffort to assisting democratic efforts in Latin America, and the hard \nwork that Latin American immigrants perform in America helps to \nstablize the growth of democracy there.\n\n  Second, this amendment would reinstate section 245(i), which, for a \n$1,000 fee, allows immigrants on the verge of getting legal permanent \nresidence status to achieve that status from within the United States, \ninstead of being forced to leave their families and their jobs for \nlengthy periods to be able to complete the process. Section 245(i) was \na part of American law until 1997, when Congress failed to renew the \nprovision. There is bipartisan support for correcting this erroneous \npolicy, and now is the time to do it. It is important to note that \nthese are people who already have the right under our laws to obtain \npermanent residency--this provision simply streamlines that process \nwhile contributing a significant amount to the Treasury. Indeed, in the \nlast fiscal year in which section 245(i) was law, it produced $200 \nmillion in revenue for the government. At a time when the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service is plagued by backlogs, that is funding that \nwould be useful.\n  Third, of course, the amendment would allow people who have lived and \nworked here for 14 years or more, contributing to the American economy, \nto adjust their immigration status. That has been a part of the \nimmigration law since the 1920s. It has been continually updated. It \nshould be updated now for the first time in 14 years. This will adjust \nthe status of thousands of people already working in the United States, \nhelping both them and their employers to continue playing a role in our \ncurrent economic boom. These are people who have built deep roots in \nthe United States, who have families here and children who are American \ncitizens, and who have in many cases done jobs that American citizens \ndid not want. We should continue our historical practice and update the \nregistry.\n  This legislation has the strong support of numerous groups \nrepresenting Hispanic Americans, including the League of United Latin \nAmerican Citizens, the National Council of La Raza, the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National \nAssociation of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. It also has the \nsupport of conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform and \nEmpower America. It has received union support from the AFL-CIO, the \nUnion of Needletrades and Industrial Textile Employees, and the Service \nEmployees International Union. Religious groups ranging from the U.S. \nCatholic Conference to the Anti-Defamation League\n\n[[Page S8807]]\n\nto Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services have also endorsed the \nbill. Finally, business organizations including the National Restaurant \nAssociation and the American Health Care Association have also \nencouraged this bill's passage.\n  When we talk about H-1B visas, we are usually talking about giving \nimmigration benefits to people who are going to have high-paying, high-\ntech jobs. Everybody wants to do that. We worked to get that out of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  But I would say to those who are holding up the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act, don't think only of people in high-tech, high-paying \njobs. Think of the needs of ordinary workers.\n  It seems that the immigration concerns of everyday families have been \nignored day after day in this Congress. I am talking about people who \nare not going to be in executive positions, and who cannot afford \nlawyers or anything else they want. I am talking about men and women \nwho work for an hourly wage, who try to raise their families, who go to \nchurch, who want to see their children go to school, who want to live \nthe American life, the American dream.\n\n  My grandparents came to this country. They did not speak a word of \nEnglish. But they raised a family. They raised six children, including \nmy mother. They started a small business. They had a grandson who ended \nup in the Senate. But they also had six children. They weren't wealthy. \nMy grandfather came here not speaking a word of English, with his \nbrother, and they started a stone shed. Then when they had enough money \nto afford to send back to Italy for their wives and their children, \nthey did. It was the American dream. People still have that dream. We \nshould help them, especially in this case.\n  There are also important due process issues that need to be fixed if \nAmerica wants to retain its historic role as a beacon for refugees and \na nation of immigrants. But in this Congress, even humanitarian bills \nwith bipartisan backing have been completely ignored, both in the \nJudiciary Committee and on the Senate floor. The bipartisan bills that \nhave suffered from the majority's neglect include both modest bills \ndesigned to assist particular immigrant groups and larger bills \ndesigned to reform substantial portions of our immigration and asylum \nlaws. Bills to assist Syrian Jews, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Liberians, \nHondurans, Cubans, and Salvadorans all need attention. Bills to restore \ndue process rights and limited public benefits to legal permanent \nresidents have been ignored.\n  The Refugee Protection Act, a bipartisan bill with 10 sponsors that I \nintroduced with Senator Brownback, has not even received a hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee, despite my request as Ranking Member. The \nRefugee Protection Act addresses the issue of expedited removal, the \nprocess under which aliens arriving in the United States can be \nreturned immediately to their native lands at the say-so of a low-level \nINS officer. Expedited removal was the subject of a major debate in \nthis chamber in 1996, and the Senate voted to use it only during \nimmigration emergencies. This Senate-passed restriction was removed in \nwhat was probably the most partisan conference committee I have ever \nwitnessed. The Refugee Protection Act is modeled closely on that 1996 \namendment, and I hope that it again gains the support of a majority of \nmy colleagues.\n  As a result of the adoption of expedited removal, we now have a \nsystem where we are removing people who arrive here either without \nproper documentation or with facially valid documentation that an INS \nofficer suspects is invalid. This policy ignores the fact that people \nfleeing despotic regimes are quite often unable to obtain travel \ndocuments before they go--they must move quickly and cannot depend upon \nthe government that is persecuting them to provide them with the proper \npaperwork for departure. In the limited time that expedited removal has \nbeen in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum \nseekers who were kicked out of our country without the opportunity to \nconvince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their \nnative lands. To provide just one example, a Kosovar Albanian was \nsummarily removed from the U.S. after the civil war in Kosovo had \nalready made the front pages of America's newspapers.\n\n  The majority has mishandled even those immigration bills that needed \nto be passed by a date certain to avoid significant humanitarian and \ndiplomatic consequences. In the most egregious example, the Senate \nfailed to pass a bill to make permanent the visa waiver program that \nallows Americans to travel to numerous other countries without a visa. \nThe visa waiver pilot program expired on April 30, and the House passed \nlegislation to make the program permanent in a timely manner, \nunderstanding the importance of not allowing this program--which our \ncitizens and the citizens of many of our closest allies depend upon--to \nlapse. The Senate, however, simply ignored the deadline and has \nsubsequently ignored numerous deadlines for administrative extensions \nof the program.\n  I am well aware that immigration is just one of the many issues that \nCongress must address. Indeed, there may be some Congresses where \nimmigration needs to be placed on the backburner so that we can address \nother issues. But this is not such a Congress. It was only four years \nago that we passed two bills with far-reaching effects on immigration \nlaw--the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act.

But their efforts too have been \nignored by the majority.\n  In the limited time we have remaining, I urge the majority to just \nbring up the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act and have a vote on it. \nWe know we could pass it if we could only be allowed to have a vote. \nLet's show the kind of fairness that America wants to show. Let us be \nthe beckoning country that it was to my grandparents and my great-\ngrandparents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is absolutely critical that Congress \ntake action this year to address some of the unintended consequences of \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which has been exacerbated by a host \nof ill-conceived new regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton \nadministration.\n  The combination of regulatory overkill and budget cutbacks is \njeopardizing access to critical home health services for millions of \nour Nation's most frail and vulnerable senior citizens.\n  Tonight, the Senator from Wisconsin and I are taking the opportunity \nto talk about this very important issue. The Senator from Wisconsin has \nbeen a real leader in helping to restore the cuts and to fight the \nonerous regulatory requirements imposed by the administration which \nhave affected home health care services across the Nation.\n  I also want to recognize that there have been many other Senators who \nhave been involved in this fight. I am going to put a list of the \ncosponsors to the legislation that I have introduced into the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list of cosponsors, which exceeds 50 \nSenators, be printed in the Record, reflecting the contributions many \nof our colleagues have made to this fight.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Cosponsors of S. 2365\n\n       Spencer Abraham, Wayne Allard, John Ashcroft, Max Baucus, \n     Robert F.

Warner, \n     Paul D. Wellstone.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, health care has come full circle. \nPatients are spending less time in the hospital. More and more \nprocedures are being done on an outpatient basis, and recovery and care \nfor patients with chronic diseases and conditions has increasingly been \ntaking place in the home. Moreover, the number of older Americans who \nare chronically ill or disabled in some way continues to grow each \nyear. Concerns about how to care for these individuals will only \nmultiply as our population ages and is at greater risk of chronic \ndisease and disability.\n  As a consequence, home health has become an increasingly important \npart of our health care system. The kinds of highly skilled--and often \ntechnically complex--services that our nation's home health agencies \nprovide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older \npersons to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they \nwant to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes.\n  By the late 1990s, home health was the fastest growing component of \nMedicare spending. The program grew at an average annual rate of more \nthan 25 percent from 1990 to 1997. The number of home health \nbeneficiaries more than doubled, and Medicare home health spending \nsoared from $2.5 billion in 1989 to $17.8 billion in 1997.\n  This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted the \nCongress and the Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, to initiate changes that were intended to slow this growth in \nspending and make the program more cost-effective and efficient. These \nmeasures, however, have unfortunately produced cuts in home health \nspending far beyond what Congress intended. Home health spending \ndropped to $9.7 billion in FY 1999--just about half the 1997 amount. \nAnd on the horizon is an additional 15 percent cut that would put our \nalready struggling home health agencies at risk and would seriously \njeopardize access to critical home health services for millions of our \nnation's seniors.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations where we heard about the financial distress and cash-\nflow problems that home health agencies across the country are \nexperiencing. Indeed, over 2,500 agencies, about one-quarter of all \nhome health agencies nationwide, have either closed or stopped serving \nMedicare patients. Others have laid off staff or declined to accept new \npatients with more serious health problems. Moreover, the financial \nproblems of home health agencies have been exacerbated by a number of \nburdensome new regulatory requirements imposed by the Health Care \nFinancing Administration.\n  One witness, who is a CEO of a visiting nurse service in Saco, ME, \ntermed HCFA's regulatory policy as that of being ``implement and \nsuspend.'' No longer had the agency spent all this money and time and \neffort in complying with a new regulatory requirement, then the Federal \nGovernment decided: never mind; we really didn't mean it; we weren't \nready to implement this.\n  We also heard numerous complaints about OASIS, a system of data \ncollection containing data on the physical, mental, and functional \nstatus of patients receiving care from home health agencies. Not only \nhas this been a very expensive and burdensome paperwork process, but \nthe process of collecting information invades the personal privacy of \nmany patients, which they understandably are concerned about.\n  I recently met with home health nurses in southern Maine and I heard \ncomplaints about the administrative burdens and paperwork requirements \nassociated with OASIS and its effect on patient care. I also heard what \nthe real impact of the budget cutbacks has meant for many of the people \nin the State of Maine.\n  I call attention to a chart that shows the impact that we are already \nexperiencing in the State of Maine. As shown in the chart, nearly 7,500 \nMaine citizens have lost access to home health services altogether. \nWhat has happened to those 7,500 senior citizens? Believe me, I know \nfrom my discussions with dedicated nurses who were providing home \nhealth services to them, it is not that they have recovered; it is not \nthat they have gotten well. Rather, the loss of home health services \nhas forced many of them into nursing homes prematurely or has put them \nat risk of increased hospitalization.\n  Ironically, the Medicare trust fund pays far more for nursing home \ncare or for hospitalization than it would continuing to provide home \nhealth care services to these individuals. The chart shows the \nfinancial burden in Maine in a year's time has suffered a 26-percent \ndecrease in reimbursements for a 30-percent cut in visits. Again, it is \nour most vulnerable, frail, ill, elderly citizens who are bearing the \nbrunt of these cutbacks.\n  I heard very sad stories about the impact. Consider the case of one \nelderly woman who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease, \npneumonia, and hypertension, among other illnesses. She was bed bound, \nverbally nonresponsive, and had a number of other serious health \nissues, including infections and weight loss. This woman had been \nreceiving home health services for 2 years. That allowed her to \ncontinue to stabilize through the care and the coordination of a \ncompassionate and skilled home health nurse. Unfortunately, the agency \nreceived a denial notice, terminating home health care for this woman.\n  A true tragedy happened in this case. Less than 3 months later, after \nher home health care had been terminated, this woman died as a result \nof a wound on her foot that went untreated, a serious wound that \nundoubtedly her home health nurse would have recognized.\n\n  This is only one of the heart-wrenching stories that I heard during \nthat visit. It is only one of the countless testimonials that I have \nheard from both patients and home health providers across the State.\n  It is now clear that the savings goals set forth for home health in \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have not only been met but far \nsurpassed. According to a recent study by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, spending for home health care has fallen by more than 35 \npercent in the last year. In fact, CBO cites this larger than \nanticipated reduction in home health care spending as the reason why \noverall Medicare spending fell last year for the first time.\n  The CBO now projects that the post-Balanced Budget Act reductions in \nhome health will be about $69 billion between fiscal years 1998 and \n2002. This is over four times the $16 billion that Congress expected to \nsave as a result of the 1997 act. It is a clear indication, \nparticularly when combined with the regulatory overkill of this \nadministration, that the Medicare home health cutbacks have been far \ndeeper and far wider reaching than Congress ever intended.\n  I have introduced legislation which is cosponsored by the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin who, as I said, has been a leader in this area, with my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Bond. In fact, both Senator Bond and \nSenator Ashcroft, as well as many of my other colleagues, are \ncosponsors of legislation that eliminates the further 15-percent \nreduction in Medicare payments to home health agencies that is \ncurrently scheduled to go into effect on October 1 of next year. If we \ndo not act to eliminate this 15-percent cut that is looming on the \nhorizon, it will sound the death knell for thousands of home health \nagencies. And ultimately the people, the true victims, will be those \nsenior citizens who will no longer receive the care they need. I know \nthe Presiding Officer has also been very concerned about the impact in \nhis State; all Members who have rural States know the importance of \nhome health care.\n  As Congress prepares for action on Medicare, we should give top \npriority to providing much needed relief to our Nation's beleaguered \nhome health agencies. The legislation I have introduced currently has \n55 Senate cosponsors--32 Republicans and 23 Democrats.\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\n It has the strong backing of patient and consumer groups, ranging from \nthe American Diabetes Association, the National Council on Aging, \nEaster Seals, the American Nurses Association, and the National Family \nCaregivers Association, as well as the two major industry groups \nrepresenting home health care agencies with whom we have worked very \nclosely.\n  It is imperative we solve this problem before we adjourn this year. I \nappreciate the opportunity to address this issue.\n  The remainder of the time will be reserved for the Senator from \nWisconsin, with whom it has been a real pleasure to work on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the Senator \nfrom Maine in talking about the importance of eliminating the automatic \n15-percent reduction in Medicare payments to home health agencies. It \nis currently scheduled for October 1, 2001. I am very pleased to be \nworking with her on this because she is a tremendous leader on this \nissue. It is a very good example of the kind of bipartisanship that is \nessential for this body to function well. I am most pleased to be \nworking with the Senator on this because it is so obvious she has taken \na great deal of time to listen to her constituents about this very \nimportant issue.\n  I have heard the same sad story in Wisconsin, and we hear a lot of \nvery compelling human stories in this job. But I find this one \nimpossible to ignore. I know the Senator from Maine feels the same way. \nThe fact is, this system of home health care--at least in the State of \nthe Senator from Maine and my State--was working. It is not as if it is \nsomething we are trying to create. It was working. Because of some \npoorly constructed policies, it is being harmed in a way that is truly \nharming older people in our country.\n  The story the Senator from Maine gave is a very compelling example of \na broader series of tragedies that are occurring, I think, on an almost \ndaily basis in my State of Wisconsin, and in many other States.\n  So, I thank her. I believe strongly that Congress must act to \npreserve access to home health care for seniors and others. That is why \nI have made the preservation of access to home health services one of \nmy top priorities in the U.S. Senate.\n  For seniors who are homebound and have skilled nursing needs, having \naccess to home health services through the Medicare Program is the \ndifference between staying in their own home and moving into a nursing \nhome.\n  The availability of home health services is integral to preserving \nindependence, dignity, and hope for many beneficiaries. I feel strongly \nthat where there is a choice, we should do our best to allow patients \nto choose home health care. I think seniors need and deserve that \nchoice.\n  Mr. President, as you know, and as many of our colleagues know, the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 contained significant changes to the way \nthat Medicare pays for home health services. Perhaps the most \nsignificant change was a switch from cost-based reimbursement to an \ninterim payment system, or IPS.\n  IPS was intended as a cost-saving transitional payment system to tide \nus over until the development and implementation of a prospective \npayment system or PPS, for home health payments under Medicare. \nUnfortunately, the cuts went deeper than anyone--including CBO \nforecasters--anticipated, leaving many Medicare beneficiaries without \naccess to the services they need.\n  These unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have \nbeen severe indeed. Instead of the $100 billion in 5-year savings that \nwe targeted, present projections indicate that actual Medicare \nreductions have been in the area of $200 billion.\n  Home health care spending, which the Congressional Budget Office \nexpected to rise by $2 billion in the last 2 years even after factoring \nin the Balanced Budget Act cuts, has instead fallen by nearly $8 \nbillion, or 45 percent.\n  These painful cuts have forced more than 40 home health care agencies \nin 22 Wisconsin counties to close their doors, in just 2 years.\n  So, what do these changes mean for Medicare beneficiaries?\n  Frankly, in many parts of Wisconsin, these changes mean that \nbeneficiaries in certain areas or with certain diagnoses simply do not \nhave access to home health care.\n  I am concerned that a further 15-percent cut in home health care \nreimbursements will further jeopardize care and leave some of our \nfrailest Medicare beneficiaries without the choice to receive care at \nhome. Last year, I was proud to work with Senator Collins and others to \ndelay the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare home health \npayments for one year. However, I believe this reduction must be \neliminated in order to preserve access to home health care.\n  I think seniors need and deserve the choice to stay in their homes, \nand I hope my colleagues will follow the leadership of Senator Collins \nand others by supporting the elimination of the 15-percent cut.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I believe that will be sufficient. I \nwill just proceed, if I may.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8809-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8809-S8810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL HONORARIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \ndeep concern about a provision that is tucked into the Commerce, State, \nJustice appropriations bill. It came to light in a front page story \nlast Thursday in the Washington Post. We have become accustomed in this \nbody to hearing about outrageous special interest provisions finding \ntheir way into must-pass appropriations bills, but this one is really \nspecial. Section 305 of the bill that was reported by the \nAppropriations Committee exempts Federal judges from the ban on \nreceiving cash honoraria contained in the Ethics in Government Act.\n  If this provision becomes law, Federal judges will once again be able \nto accept cash compensation for speeches. There will be no limit on \nthis additional compensation because the bill also provides that \nhonoraria will not be considered outside income, which is subject under \ncurrent law to a cap equal to 15 percent of the salary of a Level II \nexecutive employee, or about $22,000. With this change, Federal judges \nwill be able to supplement their Federal salaries of over $140,000 per \nyear with tens of thousands of dollars from speaking engagements.\n  The Federal judiciary as a whole is widely respected, and deservedly \nso. But it has been a bad few months for the reputation of the \njudiciary. Even before this effort to lift the honoraria ban, there has \nbeen increasing attention to the practice of Federal judges traveling \nto posh resorts and dude ranches to attend seminars and conferences. \nThese junkets are ``all-expenses paid,'' and the bill is often footed \nby legal foundations and industry groups with litigation interests \nbefore the very judges who attend the seminars.\n  A recent report released by Community Rights Council found that at \nleast 1,030 Federal judges took over 5,800 privately funded trips \nbetween 1992 and 1998. Some of these seminars are conducted at posh \nvacation resorts in locations such as Amelia Island, FL and Hilton \nHead, SC, and include ample time for expense-paid recreation. These \nkinds of education/vacation trips, which have been valued at over \n$7,000 in some cases, create an appearance that the judges who attend \nare profiting from their positions. More important, they create an \nappearance that is not consistent with the image of an impartial \njudiciary.\n  That is the same image that is threatened by this proposed repeal of \nthe honoraria ban. Who in this body believes that the powerful \ninterests that seek our good will through campaign contributions would \nnot try to curry favor with judges with generous honoraria? Have we \nlearned nothing over the past two decades? In 1989, the Congress took a \nbig step forward by increasing the salaries of federal employees and \nprohibiting honoraria. Perhaps we need to revisit the issue of the \nsalaries of federal judges in light of current economic circumstances. \nBut one thing I am absolutely certain we should not\n\n[[Page S8810]]\n\ndo is relax the ethical standards to which they are subject. The \nindependence and impartiality of the judiciary are too important to our \nsystem of justice. This would truly be a case of cutting off our nose \nto spite our face.\n\n  Now let me say a few words about the process by which this \nsignificant change in the ethical guidelines that apply to judges has \ncome close to becoming law. The provision was included in the bill \nreported by the Appropriations Committee on July 18. It was very \nquietly added to that bill. It takes up only a page and a half of 126 \npages of legislative language. And the committee report, which usually \ncan be counted on to explain the bill says the following about section \n305:\n\n       * * * section 305 amends section 501 of 5 U.S.C. App.\n\n  That is it. No explanation, no rationale, no argument for why this \nchange should be made, or why it is being done in an appropriations \nbill instead of in substantive legislation that might be the subject--\nwhich you might imagine we would like to have--of hearing and committee \nconsideration.\n  At any rate, the Commerce State Justice appropriations bill still has \nnot yet come to the floor and now it appears very likely it will never \ncome to the floor. That means that those of us who oppose the lifting \nof the honoraria ban, not to mention other troubling provisions in that \nbill, will never have a chance to offer an amendment to delete it from \nthe bill. We will never have a chance to ask our colleagues to vote on \nthis provision. We will never know whether the United States Senate \nsupports what the Appropriations Committee has done.\n  I think that is outrageous. We should be ashamed. This is a very \nimportant revision to the Ethics in Government Act. The Senate should \nbe permitted to vote on it. But the Republican leadership will not let \nthat happen. That means that the crucial decision will be made by the \nappropriators in their mock conference, and by the negotiators of a \nfinal omnibus spending bill.\n  It appears that lifting the honoraria ban for judges in some of our \ncolleagues' minds is just a first step to allowing other public \nofficials to supplement their salaries with payments from special \ninterests. The majority leader was quoted as saying that we'll probably \nneed to get rid of the ban for Members of Congress as well. I urge the \npeople who are crafting these bills to think twice before starting down \nthis slippery slope. Let's keep the honoraria ban in place for judges \nand ensure that our judiciary maintains its integrity and the respect \nof the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8810-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of \nmy colleagues to an urgent matter, and that is the reauthorization of \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The legislation is sitting here today \nand awaits clearance. It is contained in the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act, or EPCA.\n  We have a hold on the passage of EPCA, which contains the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve reauthorization. Also in the EPCA package is the \nNortheast home heating oil reserve. I know this is of great interest to \nMembers from the Northeast, who are concerned, legitimately, about the \npotential of higher prices for home heating oil this fall and this \nwinter, particularly if we should have a very cold winter.\n  The White House, the Secretary of Energy, has pleaded with Congress \nto pass EPCA, including the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nreauthorization. I am chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. We passed a companion measure out of this committee. Now \nEPCA waiting on the floor. An effort was made last night to clear it. \nThe administration claims it is an emergency that they have the \nreauthorization. They are contemplating going into the SPR and taking \noil out of it to try an address this crisis. The merits of that deserve \nadditional consideration by this body.\n  I will just share this observation on the logic of such a move. SPR \nis a reserve, it holds about a 50-day supply of oil, which is to be \nused in the case of emergency disruption of our foreign oil. Currently \nour dependence on foreign oil amounts to about 58 percent of our \nconsumption. However, because of the high prices and the inadequacy of \nour refining industry, we are facing a train wreck relative to energy \nprices, gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products. If it seems I \nam being a little ambitious in citing the critical nature of this \ncrisis, let me tell you that the Government of Great Britain and Prime \nMinister Tony Blair find it a real issue relative to the stability and \ncontinuity of that Government.\n  The responses we have seen in Germany, England, Poland, and other \ncountries to the increasing price of energy and what it means to the \nconsumer is not only of growing concern, but it has reached a crisis \nmentality. During this country's last energy crisis, we had our \ncitizens outraged. It was in 1973 when the oil embargo associated with \nthe production from OPEC--it was called the Arab oil embargo--hit this \ncountry. We had gas lines around the block. People were mad, outraged, \nindignant. At that time, we were only 37-percent dependent on imported \noil. Today, we are 58 percent. The Department of Energy contemplates we \nmight be as high as 63 or 64 percent in the not too distant future.\n  The oil price yesterday was the highest in 10 years, more than $37 a \nbarrel. There are those who predict it is going to go to $40 a barrel. \nHere we have the reauthorization of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, at \nthe request of the administration, being held up by a Member on the \nother side of the aisle. There may be other reasons the Senator has \nseen fit to put a hold on this legislation.\n  I certainly would be happy to debate one of the issues that concerns \nactivity in my State. It is the measure that allows power plants \nsmaller than 5-megawatts to be licensed through a state procedure in \nAlaska. It would allow our Native people in rural areas to have clean, \nrenewable energy rather than the high-cost diesel power they now burn.\n  I want to tell my colleagues, the Native people in Alaska really need \nthis exemption. This is utilizing the renewable resource; namely, \nrainwater, snowfall. The inability of these small projects to support \nthe cost of a Federal energy regulatory relicensing procedure--which is \nappropriate for large-scale projects--makes it absolutely beyond the \ncapability of these small villages to utilize renewable resources \nassociated with a 5 megawatt powerplant generated by water power.\n  I do not know whether there is an objection on the royalty-in-kind \nprovision. No other Senator has indicated an objection, nor has the \nadministration. It is hard to understand an objection when the \nprovision simply says that the Secretary of the Interior may accept gas \nand oil in lieu of cash payments. The Department of the Interior has \nthat power now and is using it in pilot projects.\n  The provision allows the Secretary more administrative flexibility to \nactually increase revenues from the Government's oil and gas royalty-\nin-kind program. Under current law, the Government has the option of \ntaking its royalty share either as a portion of production--usually \none-eighth or one-sixth--or its equivalent in cash.\n  Recent experiences with the MMS's royalty-in-kind pilot program has \nshown that the Government can increase the value of its royalty oil and \ngas by consolidation and bulk sales. Under royalty-in-kind, the \nGovernment controls and markets its oil without relying on its lessees \nto act as its agent. This eliminates a number of issues that have \nresulted in litigation in recent years and allows the Government to \nfocus more directly on adding value to its oil and gas.\n  I would hope my appeal results in the administration, the Secretary \nof Energy, and others who believe very strongly that EPCA should be \npassed, including the reauthorization of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. This action is especially timely, when indeed this country \nfaces a crisis in the area of oil. I think the merits of the President \nhaving this authority at a time when we contemplated an emergency \nsuggests the immediacy of the fact that this matter be resolved and \naddressed satisfactorily. We should adhere to the plea of the President \nto reauthorize SPR. I want the Record to note it is certainly not this \nside of the aisle that is holding this matter up. I would suggest it be \ndirected by the appropriate parties to get clearance so we can pass \nEPCA out of this body.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8811-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8811-S8812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n           FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THE 2002 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I could not believe my ears yesterday \nafternoon when I heard the Senator from Arizona take out after my home \nState and my home city.\n  On behalf of the people of Utah and America, I express our outrage \nover the notion that supporting our country's Olympic Games could be \ntermed either ``parochial'' or ``pork barrel.'' Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  I frankly do not agree with every provision the committee recommends \neither. But, I do not question the motives or sincerity of my \ncolleagues who put it there.\n  Yesterday, the Senator from Arizona specifically questioned the level \nof federal support for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. \nIt is, of course, his right to oppose such assistance. But, before he \nwalks further down the plank, I would like to provide a few facts. \nPerhaps the Senator will reevaluate his position.\n  First, the report just issued by the General Accounting Office, \n``Olympic Games: Federal Government Provides Significant Funding and \nSupport,'' is flawed in several respects. I am sorry that the Senator \nfrom Arizona has relied so heavily on this document to form his \nopinions about the Salt Lake Games.\n  Foremost among the problems with the GAO report is the fact that it \nerrs in categorizing a number of projects, specifically in the \ntransportation area, as ``Olympic'' projects. In fact, these are \nimprovements to transportation infrastructure that would have been \nrequested regardless of whether Salt Lake had been awarded the Olympic \nbid.\n  I would be happy to show the Senator from Arizona the details of the \nI-15 improvements and why they were necessary to repair road and bridge \ndeterioration, implement safety designs, and relieve congestion. None \nof this has anything to do with the Olympic Games. Local planning for \nthis project was actually begun in 1982, 13 years before Salt Lake City \nwas awarded the Games.\n  GAO itself implies that the inclusion of these projects as Olympic \nprojects is misleading. The report states on page 8: ``According to \nfederal officials, the majority of the funds would have been provided \nto host cities and states for infrastructure projects, such as highways \nand transit systems, regardless of the Olympic Games.''\n\n  The major effect of the 2002 Olympic Games on this project is the \ntimetable for completion. Quite obviously, we cannot have jersey walls \nmarking off construction zones and one-lane passages during the Games.\n  Moreover, while Utah has sought and received some federal assistance \nfor the project, the I-15 reconstruction project has been funded \nsubstantially by Utah's Centennial Highway Fund, which was established \nin 1997 and funded by an increase in the state's gasoline tax. This \nfact seems to disappear from the radar screen during these debates.\n  The GAO report also ascribes the TRAX North-South light rail system \nto the Olympic expense column. This, too, is not the case. The full \nfunding agreement for the North-South light rail project was granted by \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation in August 1995, less than two \nmonths after Salt Lake was awarded the Games. Clearly light rail was \nnot initiated because of the Games.\n  While the light rail system will certainly benefit Olympic spectators \nduring the Games, that is not why Salt Lake City and communities south \nof the city built it.\n  Salt Lake is growing by leaps and bounds. More and more people \ncommute into the city--not unlike the Washington metropolitan area. It \nis a city that is striving to reduce air pollution by encouraging the \nuse of public transportation. That is why they built light rail.\n  I would like to point out to my colleagues that the General \nAccounting Office did another report entitled, ``Surface \nInfrastructure: Costs, Financing and Schedules for Large-Dollar \nTransportation Projects.'' In this 1998 report, the GAO evaluated \nUtah's major transportation projects for the House Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee. This report concluded that both the I-15 \nand light rail projects were being efficiently run and were well within \nbudget. Many of the contracts were being awarded at costs lower than \nexpected. Yet, this fact was not included in the debate yesterday.\n  The Department of Transportation Inspector General issued a report in \nNovember 1998 concluding that the I-15 reconstruction project was on \nschedule and that the cost estimates were reasonable. It also praised \nUtah's use of the ``design-build'' method of contracting on this \nproject. This fact was similarly omitted from the discussion yesterday.\n  Contrary to the impression left by the Senator from Arizona, the Salt \nLake Olympic Committee, SLOC, has never sought to ``sneak'' anything \ninto an appropriations bill. Mitt Romney and his staff have been open \nabout every dime being requested.\n\n  Those transportation projects which are necessary to put on the \nOlympic Games in 2002 were delineated in a transportation plan \nsubmitted to and approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The \nfunds being requested were detailed in that plan.\n  The Senator from Arizona yesterday implied that these so-called \n``pork barrel'' appropriations for the 2002 Winter Games were an \noutgrowth of the Olympic bribery scandal which has embarrassed my home \nstate. His comments were most unfortunate for many reasons--not the \nleast of which is his suggestion that these appropriations requests are \nin any way improper is just wrong.\n  SLOC made its budget publicly available to the press. It has briefed \nofficials at federal agencies and at the White House. SLOC has \nregularly visited with members of Congress including members of the \nHouse and Senate Appropriations Committees. Right from the outset, SLOC \noutlined their plans and budgets and has provided periodic updates. \nThese updates have showed lower requirements for federal assistance. \nBut, again, this fact was not mentioned in the GAO report or by the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  A second criticism of the GAO report is its comparison of federal \nsupport for the Los Angeles Summer Games in 1984 to federal assistance \nfor the Salt Lake Games in 2002. Simply put, this is an apples to \noranges comparison.\n  First, the Salt Lake Olympic Committee has fully integrated planning \nfor the Paralympic Games with the Olympic Games. The Paralympics did \nnot even exist in 1984. In 1996, Atlanta chose to have two separate \norganizing entities.\n  Second, the Senator from Arizona may not have noticed, but there have \nbeen an estimated 7,282 reported terrorist attacks since 1984. Let me \nrefresh my colleagues' memories. These attacks have included: Pam Am \nFlight 103 in 1988; the World Trade Center in 1993; the Oklahoma City \nFederal Building in 1995; the Tokyo subway in 1995; Khobar Towers in \n1997; and U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.\n  Not all of them have been on the front pages of major newspapers, but \nthis startling number demonstrates the need for enhanced security at an \ninternational event like the Olympic Games. The same level of security \nprovided for the Los Angeles Games would most likely be inadequate for \nthe Salt Lake Games. It is essential that we provide security based on \nthe situation in the year 2002.\n  Security and counterterrorism are legitimate federal duties. I am \nglad the Secret Service is getting $14.8 million for communications \ninfrastructure. I want our law enforcement personnel to have the best \nequipment available, not just for the Salt Lake City Olympics, but at \nall times.\n\n  I do not believe that the Secret Service, FBI, and other security \nagencies are buying disposable products. This equipment will be well \nused to keep Americans safe in cities all across America.\n  Third, and perhaps most importantly, by the GAO's own calculation, \nonly $254 million is requested for planning and staging the Games, not \nthe $1.3 billion figure cited yesterday. I would like to note that this \nis roughly 25 percent of the entire budget for the Salt Lake Games.\n  If that seems like a lot, let us review the point made by the \nCongressional Research Service in its 1997 report, ``Financing the \nOlympic Games Held in the United States, 1904-1960: A Brief Overview,'' \nand noted by the GAO. In\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\n1960, Squaw Valley received an appropriation of $20 million to assist \nin staging the Winter Olympic Games--about 25 percent of the total \nbudget for the Games.\n  Let me be clear that I am not advocating an automatic 25 percent \nfederal subsidy for a host city. But, I wish to make the point that \nthis level of assistance is not unprecedented and could be construed as \nquite modest when compared with governmental subsidies foreign cities \nreceive from their national governments.\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I would like to make one final \npoint.\n  The Senator from Arizona suggested yesterday that the USOC should not \nconsider bids of cities that do not have the capacity to host the \nGames.\n  Well, Mr. President, that would eliminate every city in America from \nhosting an Olympic Games, summer or winter. No city--not even New York \nor Los Angeles--could put on a 21st century, multi-week, international \nevent like this entirely on its own.\n  Think about this: Lake Placid, New York, has hosted the Winter Games \ntwice, in 1932 and in 1980. But, in 1990, Lake Placid had a population \nof fewer than 2500 people. There is no way metropolitan Salt Lake City, \nwith a million people, let alone Lake Placid could host these Games \nunder the proposed McCain criteria.\n  Allow me to suggest, Mr. President, that America itself will host the \n2002 Winter Olympic Games, just as it did in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Lake \nPlacid, or Squaw Valley. An American bid city is selected by the United \nStates Olympic Committee for its organizational ability and world class \nsporting venues. It becomes America's choice. If chosen by the IOC, the \ncity does not host the Games on its own behalf, but for our whole \ncountry.\n  When a U.S. athlete mounts the podium in Salt Lake City two years \nfrom now, the music you hear will not be ``Come, Come Ye Saints.'' No, \nit will be ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' our country's national anthem.\n  I agree with the GAO and with Senator McCain on one thing. I agree \nthat we ought to give some consideration to how, if the United States \never hosts another Olympic Games, we should support the host city. \nThere is much to commend a better process for such support.\n  I would be very happy to join Senator McCain in such a mission. But, \nI wish that, in the meantime, he would join us in support of America's \nhost city for the XIX Winter Olympiad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8812-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Following \nare the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year \nago today.\n  September 20, 1999:\n  Donetta L. Adams, 26, Bloomington, IN; Barbara F. Allen, 65, \nBloomington, IN; Eugene S. Bassett, Jr., 35, Davenport, IA; Antonio \nButler, 19, Miami, FL; William Cook, 38, Detroit, MI; Rosa Gomez, 41, \nMiami, FL; Travis L.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the vote I cast \nyesterday in support of H.R. 4444, the bill extending permanent normal \ntrading relations to the Peoples' Republic of China.\n  While the vote we cast yesterday was to grant China PNTR, it cannot \nbe viewed separate from the question of China's accession to the WTO. \nIn our negotiations with the Chinese over their entry in the WTO, we \nagreed to end the annual exercise of renewing NTR and to extend NTR to \nChina permanently. In fact, if we do not grant China PNTR we will be \nthe ones in violation of the WTO's rules when China is ultimately \ngranted entry into the WTO. And, as a result, we will lose access to \ntheir markets and the beneficiaries of this will be our trade \ncompetitors in Europe, Asia, and South America. Most importantly, we \nhave gained some very important trade concessions in our negotiations \nwith the Chinese over their entry into the WTO, and we stand to gain \neven greater trade concessions from them once they join the WTO and \nbecome subject to its rules and dispute resolution procedures.\n  By extending PNTR and allowing China entry into the WTO, the U.S. can \nexpect to increase exports to China by an estimated $13.9 billion \nwithin the first five years. And according to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, American farmers will account for $2.2 billion of that \nincrease in exports to China. If our economy is to continue to grow and \nwe are to continue to create more good-paying, skilled jobs so that \nunemployment remains low and Americans can take home more income, we \nmust expand our economic opportunities. The best way to accomplish that \nis to find new markets for our products. And the most lucrative new \nmarket that exists is China.\n  As our colleague from Texas, Senator Phil Gramm, pointed out in a \n``Dear Colleague'' letter he circulated earlier this week, things in \nChina are changing significantly, if perhaps not as quickly or as \ncomprehensively as we wish. Senator Gramm quoted a report on China \nrecently issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in which the \nobservation is made: ``Beijing's billboards no longer spout ideology. \nThey advertise consumer products like Internet service, cell phones, \nand credit cards.'' There can be little doubt that China is changing. \nThe task left to us to decide is how best to effectuate positive change \nthere.\n  My primary concern, in evaluating how to vote on PNTR and China's \naccession to the WTO has always been: ``What is in the best interests \nof Michigan's workers and businesses?''\n  China was Michigan's 15th largest export market in 1998. That rank \nhas almost certainly risen since then. Michigan's exports to China grew \nby 25 percent during the 5 years between 1993 and 1998, increasing from \n$211 million to $264 million. Businesses in the Detroit area accounted \nfor $180 million of those exports in 1998, an 11 percent increase over \nits 1993 figure. Other areas of Michigan are seeing truly phenomenal \ngrowth in trade with China. Exports to China from businesses located in \nthe Flint and Lansing areas grew by more than 84 percent from 1993 to \n1998. And exports from Kalamazoo and Battle Creek businesses to China \ngrew by an astounding 353 percent during that same period, according to \nthe U.S. International Trade Administration.\n  The growth in China trade outside of Detroit is due to the \nsurprisingly high number of small and medium-sized businesses in \nMichigan that are exporting to China. According to the Commerce \nDepartment, more than 60 percent of the Michigan firms exporting to \nChina in 1997 were either small or medium-sized companies. Of the 149 \nsmall and medium-sized Michigan businesses exporting to Michigan in \n1997, as substantial majority of these were small businesses with fewer \nthan 100 employees. This trend extends beyond Michigan as well. \nNationwide, not only did small and medium-sized businesses in 1997 \ncomprise 35 percent of all U.S. merchandise exports to China--up from \n28 percent in 1992--but this 35 percent share of the Chinese market was \nhigher than the share small and medium-sized businesses had of overall \nU.S. merchandise exports that year--31 percent.\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\n  While Michigan's manufacturing sector certainly stands to benefit \nfrom passing PNTR and China's accession to the WTO, we must not \noverlook the tremendous benefits that Michigan farmers also stand to \ngain from these agreements. Agriculture is Michigan's second largest \nindustry, and exporting is a vital component of the state's \nagricultural business. Michigan agricultural exports totaled almost $1 \nbillion in 1998, but that figure was down almost $100 million from two \nyears earlier. With increased competition in agriculture at home and \nabroad from the European Community and major S. American exporters such \nas Chile, opening up a massive new market such as China would be of \ntremendous benefit to a state like Michigan that relies so heavily on \nagriculture production and export.\n  The agreement the U.S. negotiated with China, which includes PNTR, \ncontains significant trade concessions by the Chinese in four areas \ncritical to Michigan agriculture. Michigan exported $240 million worth \nof soybeans and soybean products in 1998, and China is the world's \nlargest growth market for soybeans. China has agreed to lower tariff \nrates on soybeans to 3 percent with no quota limits. Michigan is also a \nlarge feed grains producer, exporting $163 million worth of feed grains \nand products in 1998. China has agreed to lower their quota to a \nnominal 1 percent within an agreed upon import quota schedule. However, \nthat quota grows at a tremendous rate, starting at 4.5 million metric \ntons and growing to 7.5 million metric tons by 2004. By comparison, \nChina imported less than 250,000 metric tons of corn from all countries \nin 1998. The circumstances are much the same for two other very \nimportant Michigan agriculture products--vegetables and fruit. On \nvegetables, China's tariff rates are scheduled to drop anywhere from 20 \nto 60 percent by 2004. With respect to fresh and processed deciduous \nfruit, China has committed to tariff reductions of up to 75 percent. To \na state like Michigan, which is known for its cherries, apples, pears, \nand peaches, this is a significant breakthrough for our fruit growers.\n\n  Of course, Mr. President, this is not the end of the story. While \nmany of these tariffs will be substantially reduced and quotas are \nlifted or expanded considerably, tariffs and quotas will still remain \non many U.S. goods--as they in fact will continue to exist on certain \ngoods coming from China into the United States. But once China is a \nmember of the WTO, the U.S. will continue to push to have Chinese trade \nbarriers reduced even further and eliminated altogether.\n  A critical element of this debate that too often gets overlooked is \nthe degree to which our membership in the WTO helps us eliminate unfair \ntrading practices amongst our trading partners. The WTO provides a \nforum to which we can take trade disputes with our trading partners \ninvolving unfair trading practices by them. One of the primary \nfunctions of the WTO is to provide procedures to settle trade disputes \npromptly, eliminating a significant deficiency of the previous GATT \nsystem in which the process often dragged out indefinitely. The WTO \nprocedures are inherently more fair and more predictable--and that is \nto our benefit as the world's largest economy and as the world's \nforemost promoter of free and fair trade.\n  The United States has filed more complaints to the WTO against other \ncountries--49 of them as of April of this year--than any other WTO \nmember country. The U.S. has also prevailed in 23 of the 25 complaints \nacted upon up to that time--clear evidence that the WTO is of \ntremendous assistance to us in getting other countries to stop their \nunfair trading practices. This is also why we can be confident that \nonce China becomes a member of the WTO that we will be able to further \nreduce the remaining trade impediments they have against our goods and \nthat we will be able to ensure that they live up to the commitments \nthey have already made to us in exchange for PNTR and our support for \nthem joining the WTO.\n  While I have supported annual renewal of NTR each year I have been in \nthe Senate, I have also been a severe critic of many of China's \npolicies and actions and their human rights record. In 1997, I \nintroduced the China Policy Act, in which I attempted to outline a new \nparadigm for dealing with the Chinese. Specifically, I felt it was \nunwise for us to use trade continually as our weapon of first resort \neach time an issue arose between our two countries, whether it be \nnuclear non-proliferation and missile sales to rogue nations, religious \npersecution, repression in Tibet, forced abortion, or threatening \ngestures towards Taiwan.\n  I feel it unfair to American companies and farmers doing business in \nChina to make them constantly bear the brunt of our efforts to get the \nChinese to modify their behavior. I am also concerned about pursuing \nsuch a strategy when it would likely result in U.S. companies and \nfarmers losing market share and market access in China to our trade \ncompetitors in Europe, Asia, and South America. The China Policy Act \nlegislation I introduced in 1997 essentially said, ``Let us reserve \nusing trade as a weapon only for those occasions when our dispute with \nChina is trade related.''\n  My China Policy Act took a very tough stand on what I believe was \nunacceptable behavior by the Chinese in the area of missile sales and \nnuclear proliferation. In response to China's sale of 60 cruise \nmissiles to Iran, which I viewed as a direct violation of the Iran-Iraq \nNon-Proliferation Act of 1972, my legislation required the President to \nimpose the sanctions provided for by the 1972 act against China. In \naddition, because I believed the Chinese sale was so dangerous, my \nlegislation suspended the President's ability to waive those sanctions.\n  I have also taken other steps to thwart China's ability to export \ndangerous armaments and weapons of mass destruction. I voted for the \nCochran amendment to the FY '98 DoD Authorization bill to control the \nexport to China of supercomputers that could be utilized by them in \ntheir development of missiles and in exploiting nuclear technology. I \nalso supported the Hutchinson amendment to the FY '99 DoD Authorization \nbill to study the development of U.S. Theater Missile Defense systems \nagainst potential Chinese ballistic missiles.\n  Based on this track record and of my continuing concerns for China's \nactions in this area, I felt compelled to support the Thompson \namendment because I believed it was the wisest approach to dealing with \nthis very real threat to our national security. To those who argued \nthat the Thompson amendment would undermine the very principles upon \nwhich PNTR was based, I would counter that Senator Thompson made a \nnumber of significant modifications to his legislation to address these \nvery concerns.\n  The Senator from Tennessee went to great lengths to ensure that \nAmerican agriculture would be spared the brunt of any trade actions \ntaken against China. This ensures that our farmers are not unfortunate \nvictims of attempts by U.S. policymakers to punish the Chinese for \ntheir behavior in non-trade areas. Senator Thompson also gave the \nPresident greater flexibility to respond to crises by making sanctions \nagainst supplier countries under the act discretionary rather than \nmandatory. And the evidentiary standard in the legislation for imposing \nmandatory sanctions on companies identified as proliferators has been \nraised to give the President discretion in determining whether a \ncompany has truly engaged in proliferation activities.\n  So I believe the most problematic areas of Senator Thompson's \noriginal legislation have been addressed responsibly and that made it \nworthy of support. While I remain a staunch supporter of PNTR for China \nand supporting China's accession into the WTO, I simply cannot ignore \nChina's past practices in the area of missile sales to rogue nations \nand it's role in nuclear proliferation. The U.S. must maintain the \nability to confront such aggressive arms practices abroad as a means of \nprotecting its own national security.\n  In conclusion, I am keenly aware of the deeply divided feelings \nAmericans have over the questions of PNTR and China's accession to the \nWTO. There are few, if any, states in which feelings are more polarized \non this subject than in Michigan. I respect the fact that sincere \npeople can and will draw a conclusion different from mine. To those who \ncame to a different conclusion, I say that we here in Congress have \npromised to pay close attention to the reports\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\nissued by the Congressional-Executive Commission on Human and Labor \nRights created in this legislation. If China's behavior does not \nimprove and if they do not abide by the agreements they have signed, I \nam sure that Congress will respond accordingly. I certainly intend to.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, both my wife and I grew up in \nunion households. Her father was a member of the United Auto Workers. \nAnd my father was a UAW member as well. That is not an uncommon \nsituation in a state like Michigan, as you can well imagine, where a \nsignificant percentage of the population is employed either by one of \nthe automakers or one of the various supplier companies. But like most \nMichiganders who grew up in a union household or are currently living \nin one I know what it's like to see a father or mother come home \ncelebrating a raise or some benefits they had secured in a recently \nratified contract. And I also know the pain and stress that goes with \nlayoffs or plant closings, things my state has had all too much \nexperience with in the not too distant past.\n  Many current union workers and their families have come up to me in \nthe past year and said they were scared about what will happen if we \npass PNTR and allow China into the WTO. They fear that the Chinese will \nnot live up to the commitments they have made with respect to \neliminating trade barriers or that American companies might choose to \nmove their operations overseas leaving workers here unemployed and \nwithout any available jobs or careers into which to move. Those are \nvery real fears. And I take those concerns very seriously and to heart.\n  China will open its markets in the very near future. The question is: \nWill U.S. firms be among those competing for these new markets, \ncompeting for a portion of the one billion new consumers that are going \nto be available in China? Or are we going to cede those new \nopportunities to our competitors in Europe, Asia, and South America? \nLikewise, the question is not whether U.S. companies will eventually do \nbusiness in China. The question is whether it will be on our terms or \non China's. Will companies be forced to move over to China in order to \navoid high tariffs, quotas on U.S. produced goods, or other \nrestrictions which make it difficult for them to do business there? Or \nwill we attempt to eliminate such barriers to market access now through \nnegotiation, so that U.S. companies can continue to operate here in the \nStates, employing U.S. workers and paying U.S. Taxes, and still export \ngoods and services to China in a competitive environment with our \ntrading competitors?\n  I think when most workers consider the options we face, they will \nagree that the best course for our nation is to join with the other \nnations of the world in accepting China into the WTO and attempting to \nwork with the procedures available there to open their markets further \nand ensure they live up to the commitments they have already made.\n  That is the conclusion to which this Senator has come. That is why I \nvoted for permanent normal trade relations for the Peoples' Republic of \nChina. That is why I support China's accession to the WTO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8814-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ARMED FORCES CONCURRENT RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY PROVISION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the defense authorization conference is \nmeeting, I rise today to urge my colleagues to stand behind the Senate \nversion of the bill with respect to Section 666 of H.R. 4205. This \nprovision permits retired members of the Armed Forces who have a \nservice connected disability to receive military retired pay \nconcurrently with veterans' disability compensation.\n  Veterans from Nevada and all over the country care about this \nlegislation.\n  Career military retired veterans are the only group of federal \nretirees who are required to waive their retirement pay in order to \nreceive VA disability. Simply put, the law discriminates against career \nmilitary men and women. All other federal employees receive both their \ncivil service retirement and VA disability with no offset.\n  This inequity is absurd. How do we explain this inequity to these men \nand women who scarified their own safety to protect this great nation? \nHow do we explain this inequity to Edward Lynk from Virginia who \nanswered the call of duty to defend our nation? Mr. Lynk served for \nover 30 years in the Marine Corps and participated in three wars, where \nhe was severely injured during combat in two of them.\n  Or George Blahun from Connecticut who entered the military in 1940 to \nserve his country because of the impending war. He served over 35 years \nduring World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He is 100% \ndisabled because of injuries incurred while performing military \nservice. He asks that Congress stop giving veterans the ``arbitrary \nbureaucratic rhetorical nonsense'' and truly support this legislation. \nWe must demonstrate to these veterans that we are thankful for their \ndedicated service. As such, we must fight for the amendment in the \nSenate version of the national defense authorization bill for FY 2001.\n  This is an absolute injustice to our career military retired \nveterans. Federal employees, for example a member of Congress or a \nstaffer here on Capital Hill or an employee from the Department of \nEngery, are not penalized if they receive disability benefits. While \ncareer military men and women that have incurred injuries while in the \nline of duty are prohibited from doing so because of an archaic, out-\ndated 109-year-old law.\n  The amendment in the Senate bill represents an honest attempt to \ncorrect this inequity that has existed for far too long. Allowing \ndisabled veterans to receive military retired pay and veterans \ndisability compensation concurrently will restore fairness to the \nentire Federal retirement policy.\n  It is unfair for our veterans not to receive both of these payments \nconcurrently. We must ensure that our veterans who are facing serious \ndisabilities as a result of injuries sustained during their service do \nnot have to choose between retirement pay and losing a portion of their \ndisability benefits.\n  We have an opportunity to show our gratitude to these remarkable \n437,000 disabled military men and women who have scarified so much for \nthis great country of ours.\n  We are currently losing over one thousand WWII veterans each day. \nEvery day we delay acting on this inequity means that we have denied \nfundamental fairness to thousands of men and women.\n  The Senate passed this provision by unanimous consent and the House \ncompanion bill, H.R. 303 from Congressman Bilirakis has 314 cosponsors. \nOur veterans have earned this and now it is our chance to honor their \nservice to our nation. Freedom isn't free--and this is a small cost to \nthe Federal government given the immeasurable sacrifices made by these \ndedicated Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8814-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8814-S8816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SPACE TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, \nAlabama on the occasion of Marshall's 40th Anniversary. My second \npurpose is to share some thoughts on the importance of Space \nTransportation in light of the VA/HUD Appropriations Bill that will \ncome before this body in the not too distant future. These two issues \nare inextricably linked in that Marshall Space Flight Center is the \nworld leader in space transportation yet ever dependent on the funding \nthat the VA/HUD appropriators provide. For that reason, I compliment \nSenator Kit Bond, and his superlative staff in advance of the bill \nbeing debated for all they continue to do on behalf of NASA and the \nnation. Their foresight will ultimately make the difference as we \ncontinue to move forward as a nation of explorers.\n  In September, 1960 President Dwight Eisenhower dedicated the Marshall \nSpace Flight Center which soon began making history under the \nmentorship and direction of Dr. Wernher von Braun. From the Mercury-\nRedstone vehicle that placed America's first astronaut, Alan B. \nShepard, into sub-orbital space in 1961, to the mammoth Saturn V rocket \nthat launched humans to the moon in 1969, Marshall and its industry \npartners have successfully engineered\n\n[[Page S8815]]\n\nhistory making projects that gave, and continue to give, America the \nworld's premier space program.\n  We in Alabama and across America have so much to be thankful for and \nin a small way Marshall and its scientists, engineers and support \npersonnel have carved out a niche of excellence that brought history to \nthe community, state and nation. From Skylab, to the space shuttle to \nthe lunar roving vehicle, America has looked to Marshall for experience \nand leadership. They were the right stuff, and they continue today to \nbe the best with over 30 world-class facilities and test facilities. As \nNASA's Center of Excellence for Space Propulsion the men and women of \nMarshall are not simply dreamers of what may be, but are working hard \nin research and development to provide the propulsion systems that will \nenable NASA to provide the nation safe, reliable, low-cost access to \nspace, rapid interplanetary transportation, and the hope of exploration \nbeyond the solar system. This is not folly, Mr. President, this is \nreality.\n  These initiatives require us to make new investments in Space \nTransportation and this is what I believe Senator Bond and his \ncommittee are trying to do. Investments are being made and must \ncontinue to be made in the years to come in the Space Launch \nInitiative, the Third Generation technology program, and in Shuttle \nupgrades if we are going to achieve our collective space destiny.\n  I would like to take a few moments today to discuss these initiatives \nand the promise they hold for our country. I would also like to talk \nabout some of the technology spin-offs these investments will yield for \nother parts of our economy.\n  The Space Launch Initiative is intended to dramatically reduce the \ncost of access to space by an order of magnitude over the next 10 years \nand to increase the reliability of space launch vehicles.\n  This initiative will result in the creation of a ``highway to space'' \nthat will enable increased commercial activity in Earth orbit and \nbeyond. The impact for our nation's economy will be dramatic, I \nbelieve. We need only to look at the past to understand the \npossibilities associated with opening new frontiers. Throughout our \nhistory, commerce and growth have been fueled when boundaries have been \npushed back.\n  Let me briefly describe the elements and the purpose of NASA's Space \nLaunch Initiative. The Space Shuttle remains the world's only reusable \nlaunch vehicle and continues to be a workhorse for NASA and the \nAmerican public. You may have been watching the recent activities in \nspace surrounding STS-106 (which landed this morning in Florida), our \nfirst shuttle mission to the International Space Station since the \narrival of its newest component, the Russian supplied service module--\nZvezda. The Shuttle is the first generation of reusable launch systems, \nbut it has its faults and we must improve on this system. It is a very \nexpensive system to operate and requires thousands of people and months \nof work to prepare the system for launch. In order to meet the goals of \nthe Space Launch Initiative, NASA and its partners must develop systems \nthat only require around 100 people and about one week for turnaround.\n  The Space Launch Initiative will focus on reducing technical and \nprogrammatic risks as well as the business risks associated with the \ndevelopment of new space launch technologies. While the goal will be to \ndevelop a Second Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle that increases crew \nsafety by a factor of 10 and decreases cost by the same amount, the \ntechnology we develop along the way will only serve to enrich the \neconomy. Let me provide an example--its NASA's X-33 program.\n  The X-33 is a sub-scale flight demonstrator designed to test many \ntechnologies that will drive a full-scale Second Generation vehicle. \nLike many developmental programs, the X-33 has had its share of \nsetbacks. However, even with setbacks the X-33 program has actually \nspun off technology that will improve the lives of many newborn \nchildren.\n  Let me explain. The X-33's original composite tank contained fiber \noptic sensing technology embedded along the edge to monitor the health \nof the system. Realizing the potential of this technology could be far \nreaching, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center partnered with Dr. Jason \nCollins of the Pregnancy Institute in Slidell, Louisiana and with \nPrism, a San Antonio manufacturer of medical products, to improve \nobstetric forceps used to position an infant in the mother's womb prior \nto delivery, and in some cases used to assist with the delivery. \nObstetrical forceps have been in use for over 300 years with more than \n700 variations of the design, however, none of these allowed the \nphysician to assess the force the instrument placed on the infant. An \nimprovement was definitely needed that would minimize the risk to \nnewborns delivered by forceps. NASA's solution: forceps made of \npolymeric material which flexes under pressure with fiber optic sensors \nfrom the X-33 program embedded in the material during the manufacturing \nprocess that indicate strain.\n  It is predicted that the fiber optic forceps will reduce the number \nof cesarean section deliveries, reduce the risk of injury to the \nmother, and significantly lower the occurrence of fetal injury caused \nby ordinary forceps, thus reducing overall health care costs.\n  Another part of the Space Launch Initiative is a program called the \nAlternate Access to the Space Station. This is an extremely important \npart of the Initiative for several reasons. The Alternate Access to \nSpace Station effort will provide our country with more than one way \nservice to the Space Station. As you may recall, Mr. President, in the \naftermath of the Challenger disaster, the Shuttle program was down for \nseveral years. However, once the International Space Station is on \norbit with a permanent crew on board, we cannot afford to face a time \nin which the Shuttle or any one launch vehicle is out of service for an \nextended period of time.\n  We must have a very robust method of keeping the Station re-supplied. \nWe cannot afford to be tied to one or even two launch systems, but must \nhave access to several launch vehicles. The Alternate Access program is \ndesigned to develop some of the most innovative launch vehicle concepts \nthat exist today in industry for the purpose of providing resupply \ncapability to the Station. This effort will give many up-and-coming \naerospace companies and entrepreneurs the ability to break into the \nmarket by using NASA's requirements as the baseline on which to build \ntheir business case and attract investors.\n  While the Space Launch Initiative is designed to reduce the cost of \naccess to space from $10,000 a pound to $1,000 a pound, in order to \nmake space travel truly routine for the average citizen, we must do \nmore. NASA is also planning to invest in Third Generation technologies \nto further reduce the cost of putting a pound of payload in orbit. The \ngoal of the Third Generation activities is to get launch costs down to \n$100 a pound within 25 years. At that point, routine access to space \nfor a variety of activities will become possible.\n  NASA's Third Generation program has been dubbed Spaceliner 100--the \nidea being that the technology advancements would result in a launch \nvehicle with commercial airliner reliability and again, a cost of \naround $100 a pound for launch. I was pleased last year to jump-start \nthis investment. In a bipartisan effort, I along with Majority Leader \nTrent Lott, Senators Shelby, Breaux, Landrieu, Voinovich, DeWine, and \nCochran pressed for the inclusion of $80 million dollars in the FY 00 \nVA-HUD bill for Spaceliner 100.\n  I am glad to see that this action did not go unnoticed by the \nAdministration. In this year's FY 2001 budget submission, the White \nHouse included $1.2 Billion for NASA's Third Generation effort over the \nnext five years. This funding will support research in earth-to-orbit, \nin-space, and interstellar transportation technologies.\n  Earlier in my comments, I mentioned the Space Shuttle and the \ntremendous contribution it has made and will continue to make to our \nnation's space program. As we move towards these advanced launch \nvehicles, NASA must not take their eye off of the launch vehicle we \ndepend on today. I am pleased to see that this is not the case, in fact \nthe agency is taking steps to ensure that the Shuttle continues to be a \nrobust vehicle. In fact, NASA is actually advocating upgrades for the \nShuttle and the Administration proposed to\n\n[[Page S8816]]\n\nspend $1.4 Billion dollars over five years in upgrades to the Shuttle. \nHowever, in light of the investments in Second and Third Generation \ntechnologies, you might wonder if Shuttle upgrades are worth it. The \nanswer is yes and here's why:\n  First, we are dealing with a crew safety issue. Today the Shuttle \nperforms on the edge of its capabilities. Statistically speaking, the \nShuttle system will encounter a catastrophic failure once in every 450 \nlaunches. However, with the proposed upgrades, the Shuttle would have a \nmuch better safety margin.\n  With the upgrades, for every launch of the Shuttle, the catastrophic \nfailure rate would be one in every 1,000 launches. Although this is not \neven close to the one in 2 million safety margin we enjoy on commercial \nairliners, it is a vast improvement. And when you are dealing with \nhuman lives, every little bit helps.\n  Second, every upgrade proposed for the Shuttle will be a candidate \nfor use on Second Generation systems. In other words, not only is NASA \nimproving safety for Shuttle crews, they are getting the opportunity to \n``road test'' many new technologies.\n  I have briefly described NASA's Space Launch Initiative as well as \nthe Agency's Third Generation efforts. I have provided an example or \ntwo of spin off technologies we are receiving and will continue to \nreceive from this significant investment. These efforts are important \nto our nation's economic future as well as our continued National \nsecurity. I believe these efforts will amount to a defining moment in \nour nation's space program in the day's ahead.\n  I am proud of the lead role NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in \nHuntsville, Alabama is taking in these efforts. But as anyone at \nMarshall will tell you, this will take the combined efforts of many of \nNASA's other Field Centers, along with the full participation of \nAmerica's aerospace industry, and the help of many academic partners.\n\n  I began my remarks today by describing the 40 year effort at Marshall \nand the hard work that we have witnessed by Senator Bond's committee. \nWe should not be lured into a false sense of security that we will \nalways have the talent in our field centers we have today, or the great \nsupport we enjoy from the authorization and appropriations committees. \nAs we look into the future, access to space will be as important to us \nas civil aviation is today. However, we all have a lot of work ahead of \nus, and this is an endeavor we must educated ourselves on and monitor \nclosely that it doesn't stray off course. There is simply too much at \nstake to allow that to happen.\n  In the mid-1970's, the U.S. dominated the worldwide commercial space \nlaunch market. Today, we launch only 30 percent of the world's \ncommercial payloads. Our re-emergence into the commercial market place \nwill depend on bold investments, and on the boldness of our leaders who \nwish for America to remain a Nation of Explorers.\n  I urge my colleagues therefore to study carefully the upcoming NASA \nappropriation bill and suggest to them that they support the VA/HUD \nAppropriations Bill, and the investments in the Space Launch \nInitiative, Third Generation technologies, and Shuttle upgrades. These \ninvestments will truly be the keys to our future success in space and \nin the future global marketplace.\n  They also guarantee that the men and woman at the George C. Marshall \nSpace Center have the tools to unlock the technological mysteries that \nlie before us, and in doing so make planet Earth a better place to \nlive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8816-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8816-S8817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR JIM HUNT ON EDUCATION REFORM--VOUCHERS ARE THE \n                              WRONG ANSWER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of our top priorities in Congress is \nto improve public schools for all students--by reducing class size, \nimproving training and support for teachers, expanding after-school \nprograms, modernizing and building safe school facilities, and \nincreasing accountability for results. But some in Congress advocate \ndiverting scarce resources to subsidize private schools through \nvouchers, when it is public schools that need the help and support.\n  An article in today's Wall Street Journal by North Carolina Governor \nJim Hunt eloquently explains why we should do more to support public \nschools, and why we should oppose private school vouchers.\n  Governor Hunt is a respected leader and renowned champion on \neducation issues. He has been a strong advocate for many years for \nimproving public schools, particularly by upgrading curricula, \nsupporting better teacher training, and increasing early childhood \neducation opportunities. As Governor Hunt states, it would be a step in \nthe wrong direction to undermine these important priorities by relying \non voucher schemes, just as we are starting to see solid results in \nimproved student achievement.\n  I believe that Governor Hunt's article will be of interest to all of \nus who care about these issues, and I ask unanimous consent that it may \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From The Wall Street Journal, Wed., Sept. 20, 2000]\n\n                     The Voucher Chorus Is Off-Key\n\n                      (By Gov. James B. Hunt Jr.)\n\n       We are hearing a chorus of voices arguing that school \n     vouchers are the key to improving American education, \n     especially for minority groups and other low-income students \n     in urban areas. We are accustomed to hearing such arguments \n     from the political right, but now the voices are sounding in \n     stereo.\n       My friend Robert Reich has taken to the pages of The Wall \n     Street Journal to propose a far-reaching voucher plan (``The \n     Case for `Progressive' Vouchers,'' editorial page, Sept. 6). \n     With all due respect to Mr. Reich and his allies on both the \n     right and the left, let me suggest that vouchers are the \n     wrong solution to the wrong problem at the wrong time. \n     Instead of focusing on how to improve schools, they assume \n     that pulling money out of failing schools provides an \n     appropriate incentive to turn such schools around.\n       But school improvement is hard work. In 1983, Americans \n     received a wake-up call about public schools. In a stinging \n     report ``A Nation at Risk,'' a blue-ribbon national \n     commission warned that the level of teaching and learning in \n     primary and secondary schools was so low that it threatened \n     our economic competitiveness. As a result, a national \n     movement was launched to improve academic performance. \n     Virtually every state has now spelled out high standards for \n     student achievement, many of them enforced by tests for \n     promotion and graduation from high school. Rigorous \n     accountability systems have been introduced for teachers and \n     school administrators accompanied by monetary incentives for \n     success and sanctions for failure. Many states are focusing \n     on reducing class sizes.\n       It has taken us nearly two decades to put together these \n     and other strategies relating to curricula, teacher training, \n     early childhood education and other elements that contribute \n     to a successful school, and they are now paying off. It is \n     wishful thinking to assert, as voucher proponents do, that \n     struggling schools will somehow magically transform \n     themselves because of a threat that some of their students \n     will take a voucher, pack up their book bags and go \n     elsewhere.\n       Vouchers address the wrong problem by narrowing the issue. \n     Few would dispute that private schools can provide a good \n     academic education. But there is a group of students whose \n     needs must also be considered: the 90% of our kids who will \n     remain in public schools. Mr. Reich acknowledges that the \n     ``closest thing we've seen to a national school-voucher \n     experiment'' occurred in New Zealand and that the result of \n     that decade-long experiment was that ``the worst schools grew \n     worse.'' The New Zealand study proves the point of voucher \n     opponents. We cannot support a policy of educational triage \n     that allows a few students to get help while neglecting the \n     needs of the many more students left behind.\n       Finally, the current push for vouchers is ill-timed. As \n     already noted, we now have evidence that the concerted \n     efforts in recent years to improve the teaching and learning \n     that occurs in public schools is paying off. In North \n     Carolina we have the ABCs of Public Education, a reform \n     effort that emphasizes accountability at the school level. \n     During the 1999-2000 school year 69.6% of our 2,100 public \n     schools met or exceeded their growth standards on achievement \n     tests. For schools that are falling behind, our state \n     dispatches special teams to fix the lowest performing \n     schools--not withdraw funds, as voucher proponents would have \n     us do.\n       While we are raising the standards, we are also raising the \n     pay of those in the classroom to the national average. In \n     addition, teachers, guidance counselors and administrators \n     can receive as much as $1,500 each and teaching assistants as \n     much as $500 if their schools reach a certain level of \n     proficiency. The RAND Corp. report found that between 1990 \n     and 1996 students in our state showed the highest average \n     annual gain on the National Assessment of Education Progress \n     reading and math tests. Our state's average total SAT score \n     moved up two points in 1999-2000, continuing the upward\n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\n     trend the state has experienced since 1989. We also have the \n     highest number of teachers who've proven their expertise by \n     earning certification through the National Board for \n     Professional Teaching Standards.\n       Voucher proponents do make one point that needs to be taken \n     seriously--vouchers can contribute to diversity and \n     innovation in the system. It is true that we have moved well \n     beyond the point where one-size-fits-all education is \n     adequate. We need to encourage schools to offer a variety of \n     approaches. But this can readily be achieved, as is already \n     happening, within the public system through the design and \n     promotion of magnet, subject-focused and other alternative \n     schools that meet the specific interests of students and \n     their parents while meeting high standards.\n       Let's also not assume, as has been implied by Mr. Reich, \n     that where parents live determines their level of interest in \n     schools. An expensive home in the suburbs doesn't guarantee a \n     parent is passionate about where their children are learning. \n     We need to make sure every parent is active and involved with \n     his or her child's education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8817-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY SERVICES\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th \nanniversary of the establishment of African American Family Services.\n  This inspirational organization has spent the past 25 years providing \nculturally specific services to the Minnesota African American \ncommunity. Since 1975, it has expanded its services from solely dealing \nwith chemical dependency to providing critical services in chemical \nhealth, family preservation, domestic violence, and adolescent violence \nprevention and anger management.\n  In addition to these programs, African American Family Services \nprovides its clients with two other invaluable services--a resource \ncenter, which includes a resource library and a cross-peer education \nmentoring project, and a technical assistance center, which creates \ntraining programs to educate human and social service professionals on \nenhancing service delivery to African American clients.\n  Twenty-five years after its founding, this organization is still \nsearching for new and innovative ways to serve Minnesotans. Currently, \nAfrican American Family Services is attempting to work more directly \nwith the children of its clients, hoping that this will help to break \nthe cycle of self-destructive behavior that many families experience.\n  As the leading provider of human services to the Minnesota African \nAmerican community, this organization has served countless individuals \nand families. By providing an effective network of dedicated staff and \nvolunteers who have worked hard to serve every person who walks through \nits doors, African American Family Services truly has been able to make \na difference in the lives of its clients.\n  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with this wonderful \norganization, and am proud to commend its outstanding record of success \nand service to the community on the floor of the United States Senate. \nPlease join me in honoring all of the people who have made the success \nof the African American Family Services possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8817-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNHCR DEATH IN GUINEA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the tragic \nevents that occurred over the weekend in the West African country of \nGuinea. West Africa is a very rough neighborhood, and for years Guinea \nhas borne a heavy refugee burden, as Liberian and Sierra Leonean people \nhave fled into its borders to escape violence in their home countries. \nIn fact, Guinea hosts more refugees than any other country in Africa--\nnearly half a million of them.\n  The region's tensions have, unfortunately, spilled over to affect the \nwelfare of refugees. Recently, a crisis erupted when a series of armed \nincursions into Guinea from Liberia and Sierra Leone provoked a violent \nreaction on the part of Guinean authorities who rounded up and arrested \nthousands of foreigners, including refugees, accusing them of aiding \nthe attackers.\n  On Sunday, in the town of Macenta, Mensah Kpognon, a Togolese \nemployee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was \nkilled, and another UNHCR worker from the Ivory Coast, Sapeu Laurence \nDjeya, was abducted by unidentified attackers. Reports indicate that \ndozens of civilians were also killed in the raid.\n  This terrible tragedy marks the fourth murder of a UNHCR worker in \nless than two weeks. Three others, including an American citizen, \nCarlos Caceres, were murdered on September 6, 2000 in Atambua, West \nTimor by a militia mob while Indonesian armed forces and police failed \nto stop the violence.\n  These terrible crimes, committed against individuals who dedicated \ntheir lives to helping others in need, must not continue. All \nresponsible members of the international community must work together \nto provide security for the humanitarian workers laboring in difficult \nconditions around the globe. Governments in the region must ensure that \nthose responsible for these acts must be held accountable for their \nactions. Cross-border raids into Guinea must be stopped. And most \nurgently, the governments of West Africa must work to find Sapeu \nLaurence Djeya and to ensure her safety and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8817-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. \nGilman targeted these scholarships to low income students who otherwise \nwould not have been able to consider a study abroad program. I believe \nthat by increasing the number of students that will benefit from an \ninternational education we can only enhance the capacity of our \ncitizens to participate in a global society.\n  This legislation passed unanimously in the House and I hope that we \nwill be able to pass it in the Senate before the end of session.

JOAB M. LESESNE, JR.\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, now here is one thing with which \nI can\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\nagree, and not be in a minority. Dr. Joab M. Lesesne, Jr. has not only \nheaded Wofford College with distinction for 28 years, but he has \nbrought luster to the National Association of Independent Colleges and \nUniversities as its Chairman. A man of many talents, Joe served as a \ngeneral in the South Carolina National Guard and is presently Chairman \nof the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Governing Board. \nDr. Shi, the eminent President of Furman University, cites this record \nbetter than I in a recent editorial in the Greenville News. I ask that \nthe editorial be reprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Greenville News, Sept. 17, 2000]\n\n               Joe Lesesne Stands as a True American Hero\n\n                             (By David Shi)\n\n       In an age with few heroes, it becomes even more important \n     to honor those who stand above the crowd. Last week, Furman \n     University had the privilege of bestowing an honorary \n     doctoral degree on Joab Lesesne, the recently retired \n     president of Wofford College. He had served it well--with a \n     special genius that everyone observed yet no one can define.\n       Joe Lesesne was raised on a college campus. His father, a \n     Wofford graduate, served as president of Erskine College. \n     After graduating from Erskine, the younger Lesesne went on to \n     earn his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in history from the \n     University of South Carolina. He began his career at Wofford \n     in 1964 as an assistant professor of history, and he soon \n     distinguished himself in the classroom. Lesesne was a \n     luminous teacher who made the past shine with interest and \n     significance.\n       Professor Lesesne was appointed assistant dean in 1967. \n     Soon thereafter, he implemented the college's interim term, a \n     four-week winter learning program that has become an \n     indispensable part of a Wofford education. He later became \n     director of development and then dean of the college. In \n     1972, at the ripe age of 34, he was named Wofford's ninth \n     president.\n       Lesesne quickly realized that going from the faculty to the \n     presidency means abandoning righteousness for pragmatism. He \n     also discovered that a college president needs the endurance \n     of an athlete, the wisdom of a Solomon and the courage of a \n     lion. But perhaps most important is to have the stomach of a \n     goat in order to accommodate all of the civic club luncheons, \n     campus banquets and meals-on-the-run.\n       As a resolute champion of the distinctive virtues of \n     residential liberal arts colleges, Lesesne led Wofford \n     through a remarkable era of progress, change and achievement. \n     The college's endowment soared during his long tenure, new \n     buildings were constructed, and he helped attract a stronger, \n     more diverse faculty and student body. Along the way, \n     President Lesesne displayed extraordinary composure and \n     resilience. Hard to surprise and even harder to shock, he \n     displayed the magnanimity of a saint in dealing with \n     complaints and crises.\n       President Lesesne became a leader of national prominence \n     within the higher education community. He was the first \n     Southerner to chair the board of the National Association of \n     Independent Colleges and Universities, and he headed the \n     council of presidents of South Carolina's private colleges. \n     In addition, he is a retired major general in the South \n     Carolina Army National Guard, and he continues to chair the \n     South Carolina Commission on Natural Resources.\n       Yet the real value of a career can sometimes be better \n     gauged by a person's character than by a public portfolio. \n     Joe Lesense is a genial representative of a fast vanishing \n     world of grace, civility, loyalty, faith and moral rectitude. \n     A warm man with a big heart, he has no enemies--even among \n     those who disagree with him. Known for his casual intensity \n     and refreshing humility, he loves to tell stores and to catch \n     fish.\n       For almost 30 years as a college president, Joe Lesesne \n     manifested unshaken nerve, rescuing wit, and, above all, a \n     love for Wofford that has never waned. He had a special \n     affection for students. He teased them, entertained them, \n     inspired them and guided them. They responded with equal \n     affection.\n       It has been invigorating for those of us still in our age \n     of impetuous vanities to associate with such a wise \n     colleague. I cannot imagine anyone more effective at helping \n     the people of this state appreciate the important role played \n     by Wofford and the other private liberal arts colleges. Joe \n     Lesesne is one of those refreshing people who prefers to grin \n     rather than scowl, banter rather than pontificate. What a \n     wonderful mentor he has been to me and many others.\n       In his compassionate awareness of others, in his \n     instinctive respect for them, in his declared willingness to \n     help, in his courtesy, tolerance and gentleness, Joe Lesesne \n     demonstrated that the highest intelligence is at its most \n     fertile and expressive when allied to the deepest humanity. \n     As to all of these traits, he has provided us the great gift \n     of his example. Blessed are those who perform good works and \n     earn our respect and admiration. Thanks, Joe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8818-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8818-S8819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS IN MARYLAND\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate and \nwelcome to our Nation's Capitol the two middle schools and two high \nschools from Maryland that have been named Blue Ribbon School Award \nwinners by the United States Department of Education. These schools are \namong only 198 middle and high schools nationwide to be honored with \nthis award, the most prestigious national school recognition for public \nand private schools.\n  The designation as a Blue Ribbon School is a ringing endorsement of \nthe successful techniques which enable the students of these schools to \nsucceed and achieve. Over the past few years, I have made a commitment \nto visit the Blue Ribbon Schools and have always been delighted to see \nfirst hand the interaction between parents, teachers, and the \ncommunity, which strongly contributed to the success of the school. I \nlook forward to visiting each of these four schools and congratulating \nthe students, teachers and staff personally for this exceptional \naccomplishment.\n  According to the Department of Education, Blue Ribbon Schools have \nbeen judged to be particularly effective in meeting local, state and \nnational goals. These schools also display the qualities of excellence \nthat are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of \nthe next century. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools which have \nstrong leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared \nby all connected with the school; high quality teaching; challenging, \nup-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe \nenvironment conducive to learning; a solid commitment to family \ninvolvement; evidence that the school helps all students achieve high \nstandards; and a commitment to share the best practices with other \nschools.\n  After a screening process by each State Department of Education, the \nDepartment of Defense Dependent Schools, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nand the Council for American Private Education, the Blue Ribbon School \nnominations were forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education. A panel \nof outstanding educators from around the country then reviewed the \nnominations, selected schools for site visits, and made recommendations \nto Secretary of Education Richard Riley.\n  The four winning Maryland secondary schools are as follows:\n  Baltimore City College High School: founded in 1839 is the third \noldest public high school in the country. A college preparatory magnet \nhigh school emphasizing the liberal arts and serving students and \nparents in Baltimore, City College sends 95 percent of its graduates to \npost-secondary institutions and, in doing so, has played a part in the \nAmerican dream--preparing students to succeed in college as well as \ngiving them day-to-day experience in working with people of all \nbackgrounds to lead in the community.\n  Bel Air Middle School: located in Harford County, is a high-\nperforming model of teaching and learning because of its outstanding \nacademic programs and the high level of commitment from teachers, \nstudents, local businesses, and parents. Bel Air Middle School has \ndeveloped an integrated assessment program entitled, ``Student \nAchievement and Improvement through Lifelong Learning'', SAIL, which \nhas been recognized nationally by the National Council of Teachers of \nEnglish. Additionally, Bel Air Middle School has a literacy Team, which \nprovides the faculty with ongoing professional development, \nparticularly in the areas of reading and writing.\n  Paint Branch High School: in Burtonsville, Montgomery County, offers \na dynamic and innovative whole-school signature program in science and \nthe media. In addition to delivering a rigorous, comprehensive high \nschool program with a full complement of honors and advanced placement \nclasses and additional support related, community service, and extra-\ncurricular experiences emphasizing research and experimentation. \nSeveral business partnerships support the largest internship program in \nthe county, with nearly 170 students this year earning credit at such \nsites as the National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins University \nApplied Physics Laboratory, Discovery Communication, Inc., and Black \nEntertainment Television.\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\n  Plum Point Middle School: in Huntingtown, Calvert County, exhibits \nenthusiasm and strength which grows from school-wide philosophy that \nconsiders each member valuable and every minute important. Students are \nencouraged to participate in a variety of educational and \nextracurricular activities. Over 75 percent of its students are \ninvolved in after-school activities. The school has been county \nathletic champion 13 times in various sports. Over 20 percent of the \nteaching staff have been award winners--including Maryland's 1999 \nTeacher of the Year, Rachael Younkers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8819-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF CLAIRE HOWARD\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize Ms. Claire Howard of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania \nwho will serve as President of the USA Council of Serra International \nnext year. This is a most noteworthy accomplishment, as she is the \nfirst woman ever to serve in this high capacity. I would like to insert \nthe following article into the Record, which was printed in the \nAllentown Diocese Times on August 3, 2000:\n\n       Claire Howard of Bethlehem was installed as President-Elect \n     by United States Serra clubs at the annual Serra \n     International Convention in Kansas City. She will serve a \n     one-year term as President-Elect on the USA/Canada Council \n     Board. In 2001, she will become the first woman President of \n     not only the USA Council, but also the first in Serra \n     International's 65-year history.\n       As President-Elect of the USA Council (USAC) of Serra \n     International, a worldwide organization that works to foster \n     and promote Catholic religious vocations, she will work \n     closely with the national staff and local Serra clubs, and \n     assist the president as needed. She also serves as a liaison \n     with the council's 13 standing committees.\n       ``I'm looking forward to making sure we all really commit \n     ourselves to the ministry of building up the body of Christ \n     through our Serran work,'' Howard said.\n       A charter member of the Serra Club of Bethlehem, Howard has \n     served two years as club President. An active member over the \n     years, she has served on almost all the standing committees.\n       Her future seat as president is not Howard's only ``first'' \n     in Serra International; she has trail-blazed the way for \n     women in Serra for years, ascending steadily through the \n     ranks of the organizational structure. In 1993, she was the \n     first woman to serve as District Governor of Serra \n     International and in 1994 became the first regional \n     representative (again the first woman) of Region 3 of the \n     then newly formed USA/Canada Council of Serra International.\n       She has chaired USACC's Meetings and Conventions Committee, \n     which is responsible for coordination of the fall regional \n     conventions in the 13 regions of the United States and \n     Canada. In recent years she has served as USA Council Vice \n     President for the Membership and Programs committees.\n       For the past six years, she has been the Coordinator of the \n     Serra Clubs of the Allentown Diocese's ``Life/Vocation \n     Awareness Weekend,'' working closely with diocesan Director \n     of Vocations the Rev. Francis A. Nave. The weekend offers any \n     adult who would like to explore the possibilities of entering \n     the priesthood or a religious order a time of reflection, \n     prayer and interaction with priests and religious [leaders].\n       Howard was also appointed by the Most Rev. Edward P. \n     Cullen, D.D., Bishop of Allentown, to be the Serran \n     representative for the Allentown Diocese Vocation Recruitment \n     Committee.\n       An active member of St. Anne Church, Bethlehem, she serves \n     as a Eucharistic minister, lector and coordinator of the \n     adult Bible study group. Howard's community work includes \n     active membership in Morning Star Rotary; sustaining \n     membership in the Junior League of the Lehigh Valley; \n     Bethlehem Palette Club; and Bethlehem Quota Club.\n       She works as a full-time associate real estate broker with \n     RE/MAX 100 Real Estate of the Greater Lehigh Valley. She is \n     married to John J. Howard Jr., and they have three grown \n     children. They divide their spare time between a small home \n     in Orlando, Fla. and a season home in Stone Harbor, N.J.\n       The USA Council was formed officially June 1, 1994, as a \n     national council for all Serra clubs in the United States and \n     originally included clubs in Canada. The USA Council \n     represents Serra International in the United States and is \n     committed to its mission.\n       As Serra International is the lay vocations arm of the \n     church, the council's mission is to foster and affirm \n     vocations to the ministerial priesthood and vowed religious \n     life in America, and through this ministry, further their \n     members' common Catholic faith.\n       The council's primary purpose is to establish communication \n     links between the Catholic Church hierarchy, Serra clubs and \n     local Serrans to effectively distribute information, \n     coordinate vocations programs and activities, and promote \n     membership growth in the two countries. There are 12,585 \n     Serrans in 313 Serra clubs in more than 100 dioceses in the \n     United States.\n       Serra International, founded in 1935 in Seattle, \n     Washington, is a Catholic membership organization of lay men \n     and women who work to promote vocations to the priesthood and \n     religious life while developing their Catholic identity. \n     There are more than 22,000 Serrans organized into 732 clubs \n     in 35 countries throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8819-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF MS.

Mr. President, it is at this time that I would \nlike to recognize Ms. Sue Dillon for her efforts as founder and \npresident of Tail's End Farm Animal Rescue. Ms. Dillon started this \norganization to save horses from going to slaughter and focused on \nfinding them good homes.\n  In 1993, she realized that there were no organizations or facilities \nin Pennsylvania to accommodate homeless farm animals needing shelter. \nConsequently, in order to save the lives of these animals, Ms. Dillon \ndecided that she would take on the challenge of providing a safe haven \nfor these animals. In 1996, she discovered that she needed to turn her \nfacility into a full-scale, no-kill, animal facility. She obtained a \nnon-profit status, the correct licences and opened her doors to cats, \ndogs, and any other homeless animals.\n  Although Ms. Dillon has volunteers to run the farm, help with \nadoption, and other facets of the operation, she remains to be a huge \npart of the Rescue. She continues to be actively involved with the \neveryday operations of the organization.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Sue Dillon in \ntaking the lead to provide a safe haven for many of these animals. She \nis an exemplary citizen, and I applaud her efforts on this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8819-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION OF HOT PINK PITTSBURGH DANCE RECITAL\n\n   Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nfundraiser Hot Pink Pittsburgh, a collaboration of Family Health \nCouncil and Pink Ribbons Project Dancers in Motion Against Breast \nCancer, which will increase the awareness of breast cancer, its \ntreatment and prevention. The event will raise funds to provide \nessential health care services to a growing number of uninsured women \nin Pennsylvania.\n  Hot Pink Pittsburgh will take the stage of the Byham Theater on \nOctober 2, 2000 to showcase performers and increase community awareness \nand appreciation. Dancers from the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Dance \nAlloy, Shona Sharif African Dance and Drum Ensemble and Hope Stone \nDance as well as members of the Pittsburgh Symphony will donate their \nperformances for the benefit.\n  This event will help Family Health Council provide annual exams, \nbreast and cervical cancer screening and health education. Early \ndetection and treatment gives women their best chance of breast cancer \nsurvival, while cervical cancer is preventable with screening and \ntreatment.\n  Family Health Council, founded in 1971, serves more than 100,000 \nwomen and their families in western Pennsylvania every year. As a non-\nprofit organization you provide gynecological and obstetric care; \nbreast and cervical cancer screening; comprehensive nutrition services; \nnationally recognized teen pregnancy prevention resources; domestic and \ninternational adoption; and applied research in women's health. Family \nHealth Council also administers a network of more than 20 community-\nbased health care organizations. Your organization is supported by \npatient fees, private and public grants, and individual gifts.\n  I commend the efforts of the Family Health Council and Pink Ribbon \nProject Dancers in Motion Against Breast Cancer as well as those so \ndedicated to increasing the awareness of breast cancer, its treatment \nand prevention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8819-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8819-S8820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\n\n       H.R. 2842.

A bill to repeal the provisions of law that provide \nautomatic pay adjustments for Members of Congress, the Vice President, \ncertain senior executive officers, and Federal judges, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                congressional pay adjustment legislation\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \nput an end to automatic cost-of-living adjustments for Congressional \npay.\n  As my Colleagues are aware, it is an unusual thing to have the power \nto raise our own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of our \nconstituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual \nis good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to \nexercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, \namendment, and a vote on the Record.\n  Earlier today, the Senate voted down the conference report on the \nLegislative Branch appropriations bill. As I noted during the debate on \nthat bill, by considering the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill as \npart of that conference report, shielded as it was from amendment, the \nSenate blocked any opportunity to force an open debate of a $3,800 pay \nraise next year for every Member of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. This process of pay raises without accountability must \nend.\n  The stealth pay raise technique being employed this year began with a \nchange Congress enacted in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In section \n704 of that Act, Members of Congress voted to make themselves entitled \nto an annual raise equal to half a percentage point less than the \nemployment cost index, one measure of inflation. Many times, Congress \nhas voted to deny itself the raise, and Congress traditionally does \nthat on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.\n  And by bringing the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill to the Senate \nfloor for the first time this week in a conference report, without \nSenate floor consideration, the majority leadership prevented anyone \nfrom offering an amendment on that bill to block the pay raise. The \nmajority leadership tried to make it impossible even to put Senators on \nrecord in an up-or-down vote directly for or against the pay raise. The \nmajority nearly perfected the technique of the stealth pay raise.\n  And the majority also made it impossible to link this Congressional \npay raise directly to other pay issues of importance to the American \npeople. The majority made it impossible to consider, among other \nthings, an amendment that would have delayed the Congressional pay \nraise until working Americans get a much-needed raise in the minimum \nwage.\n  The majority leadership thus appears to believe that cost-of-living \nadjustments make sense for Senators and Congressmen, but that cost-of-\nliving adjustments do not make sense for working people making the \nminimum wage.\n  The process that gives Senators and Congressmen an automatic cost-of-\nliving adjustment makes it easier for the majority leadership to block \nthe Senate from rectifying this injustice. If the Senate had to debate \nand vote on a bill to raise its pay, a Senator could offer an amendment \nthat would point out inequities like this.\n  The question of how and whether Members of Congress can raise their \nown pay was one that our Founders considered from the beginning of our \nNation. In August of 1789, as part of the package of 12 amendments \nadvocated by James Madison that included what has become our Bill of \nRights, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the \nConstitution providing that Congress could not raise its pay without an \nintervening election. Almost exactly 211 years ago, on September 9, \n1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September of 1789, \nCongress submitted the amendments to the states.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin state Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by three-fourths of the states.\n  The 27th Amendment to the Constitution now states: ``No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.''\n  I try to honor that limitation in my own practices. In my own case, \nthroughout my 6-year term, I accept only the rate of pay that Senators \nreceive on the date on which I was sworn in as a Senator. And I return \nto the Treasury any additional income Senators get, whether from a \ncost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise we vote for ourselves. I don't \ntake a raise until my boss, the people of Wisconsin, give me one at the \nballot box. That is the spirit of the 27th Amendment.\n  Now, this year's procedural device allowing another pay raise to go \ninto effect without a recorded vote does not violate the letter of the \nConstitution. But stealth pay raises like the one that the Senate \nallowed this year certainly violate the spirit of that amendment.\n  Mr. President, this practice must end. To address it, I am \nintroducing this bill to end the automatic cost-of-living adjustment \nfor Congressional pay. Senators and Congressmen should have to vote up-\nor-down to raise Congressional pay.\n\n[[Page S8824]]\n\n  The majority has sought to prevent votes on pay raises. My bill would \nsimply require us to vote in the open. We owe our constituents no less.\n  I urge my Colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3075\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an undergraduate grant program of the \nDepartment of State to assist students of limited financial means from \nthe United States to pursue studies abroad; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n             international academic opportunity act of 2000\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the International \nAcademic Opportunity Act of 2000. I'm pleased to be joined by Senators \nSchumer, Collins, and Feingold in introducing this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Our bill attempts to address a gap in U.S. institutions of higher \neducation among undergraduate students who wish to study abroad but who \nlack the financial means to do so. Specifically, our bill would \nestablish an undergraduate grant program in the Department of State for \nthe purpose of assisting American students with limited financial means \nto pursue studies abroad. It would provide grants for eligible students \nof up to $5,000 toward the cost of studying overseas for up to one \nacademic year. These grants would be made available from existing \nappropriations, so we are not requesting any new funds to administer \nthe program.\n  The program would be administered by the Department of State and \nfunded through the 150 International Affairs budget. Global education \nis a foreign policy and national security issue, not only an education \nmatter. During the cold war period and now, international education is \npart of the glue that helps to hold alliances together, that promotes \ncooperative bilateral relationships, that enhances international trade \nand business and narrows the psychological distance between counties \nand cultures. Our target population are the many students who wish to \nstudy abroad but who are unable to do so because of financial \nlimitations. Our bill attempts to remedy this gap in American higher \neducation.\n  To qualify for these grants, an individual must be a student in good \nstanding at a United States institution of higher education, must have \nbeen accepted for up to one academic year of study at an institution of \nhigher education outside the United States or be in a study program \nabroad approved by the student's home institution, and must be a \ncitizen or national of the United States. Priority would be given to \nthose who have a demonstrated financial need and who meet these other \neligibility requirements.\n  It is my understanding that this proposal has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Council on Education, the Association of State College and \nUniversities, the Alliance for International Education and Cultural \nExchange, NAFSA (Association of International Educators), the Institute \nof International Education, the American Councils for International \nEducation: ACTR/ACCELS, and other educational associations and \norganizations involved in promoting and implementing international \nexchanges and higher education.\n\n  Mr. President, there are roughly five foreign students studying in \nthe United States for every one U.S. student studying abroad. Only one \npercent of our total university population in the United States--about \n15 million--studies abroad. This imbalance is troubling and should be \nrectified. 95 percent of the world's population--and all potential \ntrading partners and customers for U.S. exports--live outside the \nUnited States. We need to improve the availability and the means for \nmore students, scholars and practitioners to study abroad--in \ninstitutions of higher learning, to engage in language studies, to \nconduct field research, and to participate in international exchanges.\n  There is extensive research which indicates that experience in study \nabroad programs produces significant measurable language improvement, \ntypically raising students from survival level skills to real fluency. \nResearch also shows that alumni of study abroad programs view that \nexperience as critical to their career choices and to the performances \nof their jobs.\n  In a globalized economy, our ability to understand, communicate, and \nconduct international commerce and other forms of cross-national and \ncross-cultural interactions hinge on our ability to understand and work \neffectively with other societies. Globalization makes the imperative of \nknowing and understanding the rest of the world more compelling than \never. The global economic and technology revolutions have helped \nredefine our nation's economic security. The opening of markets, the \nexpansion of international trade, the extraordinary effects of Internet \ntechnology, and the need for American business to compete around the \nworld require a larger global vision that can be advanced through \nexpanded contacts and international education.\n  In order to make our program successful, other countries need to \nimprove their exchange programs to attract American students by making \nmore classroom space available, more and better housing, and improved \nlanguage capabilities. For our part, we need to do more to encourage \nundergraduate students to explore the challenges and opportunities of \nliving abroad in another culture, of being exposed to different values \nand different mores.\n  I believe this bill merits special attention. The costs are minimal, \nit adds no new funding to the already-strained appropriations for \ninternational affairs and it addresses the needs of those undergraduate \nAmerican students who wish to study abroad but cannot ordinarily do so \nbecause they lack the financial means.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this initiative.\n  I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to make corrections \nand refinements in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP health insurance \nprograms, as revised by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the \nMedicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nDaschle and many of my Democratic colleagues in sponsoring the Balanced \nBudget Refinement Act of 2000 (BBRA-2000). First, a few words on the \ngenesis of this bill.\n  As part of the effort to balance the Federal Budget, the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 (BBA) provided for reduction in Medicare payments \nfor medical services. At the time of enactment, the Congressional \nBudget Office (CBO) estimated that these provisions would reduce \nMedicare outlays by $112 billion over 5 years. We now know that these \nBBA cuts have been much larger than originally anticipated.\n  Hospital industry representatives and other providers of health care \nservices have asserted that the magnitude of the reductions are having \nunintended consequences which are seriously impacting the quantity and \nquality of health care services available to our citizens.\n  Last year, the Congress address some of those unintended \nconsequences, by enacting the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA), \nwhich added back $16 billion over 5 years in payments to various \nMedicare providers, including: Teaching Hospitals; Hospital Outpatient \nDepartments; Medicare HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations); Skilled \nNursing Facilities; Rural Health Providers; and Home Health Agencies.\n  However, Members of Congress are continuing to hear from providers \nwho argue that the 1997 reductions are still having serious \nunanticipated consequences.\n  To respond to these continuing problems, the President last June \nproposed additional BBA relief in the amount of $21 billion over the \nnext 5 years. On July 27, Senator Daschle and I announced the outlines \nof a similar, but more substantial, Senate Democratic BBA relief \npackage that would provide about $40 billion over 5 years in relief to \nhealth care providers and beneficiaries. Today, along with many of our \ncolleagues, Senator Daschle and I are introducing this package as the \nBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000 (BBRA-2000).\n  Before I submit for the record a summary of this legislation, I want, \nin particular, to highlight that our legislation would prevent further \nreductions in payments to our Nation's teaching hospitals. The BBA, \nunwisely in my view, enacted a multi-year schedule of cuts in payments \nby Medicare to academic medical centers. These cuts would seriously \nimpair the cutting edge research conducted by teaching hospitals, as \nwell as impair their ability to train doctors and to serve so many of \nour nation's indigent.\n  Last year, in the BBRA, we mitigated the scheduled reductions in \nfiscal years 2000 and 2001. The package we are introducing today, would \ncancel any further reductions in what we call ``Indirect Medical \nEducation payments,'' thereby restoring nearly $2.7 billion over 5 \nyears ($6.9 billion over 10 years) to our Nation's teaching hospitals.\n  I have stood before my colleagues on countless occasions to bring \nattention to the financial plight of medical schools and teaching \nhospitals. Yet, I regret that the fate of the 144 accredited medical \nschools and 1416 graduate medical education teaching institutions still \nremains uncertain. The proposals in our Democratic BBRA-2000 package \nwill provide critically needed financing in the short-run.\n  In the long-run, however, we need to restructure the financing of \ngraduate medical education along the lines I have proposed in the \nGraduate Medical Education Trust Fund Act (S. 210). What is needed is \nexplicit and dedicated funding for these institutions, which will \nensure that the United States continues to lead the world in this era \nof medical discovery. The Graduate Medical Education Trust Fund Act \nwould require that the public sector, through the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms, and the private sector through an assessment on health \ninsurance premiums, provide broad-based financial support for graduate \nmedical education. S. 210 would roughly double current funding levels \nfor Graduate Medical Education and would establish a Medical Education \nAdvisory Commission to make recommendations on the operation of the \nMedical Education Trust Fund, on alternative payment sources for \nfunding graduate medical education and teaching hospitals, and on \npolicies designed to maintain superior research and educational \ncapacities.\n  In addition to restoring much needed funding to our Nation's teaching \nhospitals, BBRA-2000 would add back funding in many vital areas of \nhealth care. Key provisions of the bill we are introducing today would: \nprovide full market basket (inflation) adjustments to hospitals for \n2001 and 2002; prevent further reductions in Indirect Medical Education \n(IME) payments to teaching hospitals; target additional relief to rural \nhospitals; eliminate cuts in payments to hospitals for handling large \nnumbers of low-income patients (referred to as ``disproportionate share\n\n[[Page S8826]]\n\n(DSH) hospital payments''); repeal the scheduled 15 percent cut in \npayments to home health agencies; provide a full market basket \n(inflation) adjustment to skilled nursing facilities; assist \nbeneficiaries through preventive benefits and smaller coinsurance \npayments; provide increased payments to Medicare manager care plans \n(HMOs); and improve eligibility and enrollment processes in Medicaid \nand the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill language, a \nsummary of the bill, and several letters of support which I send to the \ndesk, be placed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement. I \nwould like to thank Kyle Kinner and Kirsten Beronio of the minority \nhealth staff of the Finance Committee for their efforts in assembling \nthis legislation.\n\n                                S. 3077\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall \n     award grants described in subsection (b) to States to support \n     real choice systems change initiatives that establish \n     specific action steps and specific timetables to achieve \n     enduring system improvements and to provide consumer-\n     responsive long-term services and supports to eligible \n     individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate based \n     on the unique strengths and needs of the individual, the \n     priorities and concerns of the individual (or, as \n     appropriate, the individual's representative), and the \n     individual's desires with regard to participation in \n     community life.\n       (2) Eligibility.--To be eligible for a grant under this \n     section, a State shall--\n       (A) establish a Consumer Task Force in accordance with \n     subsection (d); and\n       (B) submit an application at such time, in such manner, and \n     containing such information as the Secretary may determine. \n     The application shall be jointly developed and signed by the \n     designated State official and the chairperson of such Task \n     Force, acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Task \n     Force.\n       (3) Definition of state.--In this section, the term \n     ``State'' means each of the 50 States, the District of \n     Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the United States Virgin \n     Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern \n     Mariana Islands.\n       (b) Grants for Real Choice Systems Change Initiatives.--\n       (1) In general.--From funds appropriated under subsection \n     (f), the Secretary shall award grants to States to--\n       (A) support the establishment, implementation, and \n     operation of the State real choice systems change initiatives \n     described in subsection (a); and\n       (B) conduct outreach campaigns regarding the existence of \n     such initiatives.\n       (2) Determination of awards; state allotments.--The \n     Secretary shall develop a formula for the distribution of \n     funds to States for each fiscal year under subsection (a). \n     Such formula shall give preference to States that have a \n     higher need for assistance, as determined by the Secretary, \n     based on indicators such as a relatively higher proportion of \n     long-term services and supports furnished to individuals in \n     an institutional setting but who have a plan described in an \n     application submitted under subsection (a)(2).\n       (c) Authorized Activities.--A State that receives a grant \n     under this section shall use the funds made available through \n     the grant to accomplish the purposes described in subsection \n     (a) and, in accomplishing such purposes, may carry out any of \n     the following systems change activities:\n       (1) Needs assessment and data gathering.--The State may use \n     funds to conduct a statewide needs assessment that may be \n     based on data in existence on the date on which the \n     assessment is initiated and may include information about the \n     number of individuals within the State who are receiving \n     long-term services and supports in unnecessarily segregated \n     settings, the nature and extent to which current programs \n     respond to the preferences of individuals with disabilities \n     to receive services in home and community-based settings as \n     well as in institutional settings, and the expected change in \n     demand for services provided in home and community settings \n     as well as institutional settings.\n       (2) Institutional bias: remedies and promotion of community \n     participation.--The State may use funds to identify, develop, \n     and implement strategies for modifying policies, practices, \n     and procedures that unnecessarily bias the provision of long-\n     term services and supports toward institutional settings and \n     away from home and community-based settings, including \n     policies, practices, and procedures governing statewideness, \n     comparability in amount, duration, and scope of services, \n     financial eligibility, individualized functional assessments \n     and screenings (including individual and family involvement), \n     knowledge about service options, and promotion of self-\n     direction of services and community-integrated living and \n     service arrangements that facilitate participation in \n     community life to the fullest extent possible and desired by \n     the individual.\n       (3) Over medicalization of services.--The State may use \n     funds to identify, develop, and implement strategies for \n     modifying policies, practices, and procedures that \n     unnecessarily bias the provision of long-term services and \n     supports by health care professionals to the extent that \n     quality services and supports can be provided by other \n     qualified individuals, including policies, practices, and \n     procedures governing service authorization, case management, \n     and service coordination, service delivery options, quality \n     controls, and supervision and training.\n       (4) Interagency coordination; single point of entry.--The \n     State may support activities to identify and coordinate \n     Federal and State policies, resources, and services, relating \n     to the provision of long-term services and supports, \n     including the convening of interagency work groups and the \n     entering into of interagency agreements that provide for a \n     single point of entry with one-stop access for long-term \n     support services and the design and implementation of a \n     coordinated screening and assessment system for all persons \n     eligible for long-term services and supports.\n       (5) Training and technical assistance.--The State may carry \n     out directly, or may provide support to a public or private \n     entity to carry out training and technical assistance \n     activities that are provided for individuals with \n     disabilities, and, as appropriate, their representatives, \n     attendants, and other personnel (including professionals, \n     paraprofessionals, volunteers, and other members of the \n     community).\n       (6) Public awareness.--The State may support a public \n     awareness program that is designed to provide information \n     relating to the availability of choices available to \n     individuals with disabilities for receiving long-\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\n     term services and support in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate.\n       (7) Transitional costs.--The State may use funds to provide \n     transitional costs such as rent and utility deposits, first \n     months's rent and utilities, bedding, basic kitchen supplies, \n     and other necessities required for an individual to make the \n     transition from an institutional facility to a community-\n     based home setting where the individual resides.\n       (8) Task force.--The State may use funds to support the \n     operation of the Consumer Task Force established under \n     subsection (d).\n       (9) Demonstrations of new approaches.--The State may use \n     funds to conduct, on a time-limited basis, the demonstration \n     of new approaches to accomplishing the purposes described in \n     subsection (a)(1).\n       (10) Improvement in the quality of services and supports.--\n     The State may use funds to improve the quality of services \n     and supports provided to individuals with disabilities and \n     their families.\n       (11) Other activities.--The State may use funds for any \n     systems change activities that are not described in any of \n     the preceding paragraphs of this subsection and that are \n     necessary for developing, implementing, or evaluating the \n     comprehensive statewide system of community-integrated long-\n     term services and supports.\n       (d) Consumer Task Force.--\n       (1) Establishment and duties.--To be eligible to receive a \n     grant under this section, each State shall establish a \n     Consumer Task Force (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Task Force'') to assist the State in the development, \n     implementation, and evaluation of real choice systems change \n     initiatives.\n       (2) Appointment.--Members of the Task Force shall be \n     appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of the State in \n     accordance with the requirements of paragraph (3), after the \n     solicitation of recommendations from representatives of \n     organizations representing a broad range of individuals with \n     disabilities and organizations interested in individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       (3) Composition.--\n       (A) In general.--The Task Force shall represent a broad \n     range of individuals with disabilities from diverse \n     backgrounds and shall include representatives from \n     Developmental Disabilities Councils, Mental Health Councils, \n     State Independent Living Centers and Councils, Commissions on \n     Aging, organizations that provide services to individuals \n     with disabilities and consumers of long-term services and \n     supports.\n       (B) Individuals with disabilities.--A majority of the \n     members of the Task Force shall be individuals with \n     disabilities or the representatives of such individuals.\n       (C) Limitation.--The Task Force shall not include employees \n     of any State agency providing services to individuals with \n     disabilities other than employees of agencies described in \n     the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 6000 et seq.) or the Protection and Advocacy \n     for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 10801 et \n     seq.).\n       (e) Availability of Funds.--\n       (1) Funds allotted to states.--Funds allotted to a State \n     under a grant made under this section for a fiscal year shall \n     remain available until expended.\n       (2) Funds not allotted to states.--Funds not allotted to \n     States in the fiscal year for which they are appropriated \n     shall remain available in succeeding fiscal years for \n     allotment by the Secretary using the allotment formula \n     established by the Secretary under subsection (b)(2).\n       (f) Annual Report.--A State that receives a grant under \n     this section shall submit an annual report to the Secretary \n     on the use of funds provided under the grant. Each report \n     shall include the number and percentage increase in the \n     number of eligible individuals in the State who receive long-\n     term services and supports in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate, including through community attendant services \n     and supports and other community-based settings.\n       (g) Funding.--\n       (1) Fiscal year 2001.--For the purpose of making grants \n     under this section, there are appropriated, out of any funds \n     in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $50,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2001.\n       (2) Fiscal year 2002 and thereafter.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section for fiscal year 2002 and each fiscal year \n     thereafter.\n                                  ____\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000--Summary\n\n       The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 made some important \n     changes in Medicare payment policy and contributed to our \n     current period of budget surpluses through significant cost \n     savings in Medicare. CBO originally estimated the Medicare \n     spending cuts at $112 billion over 5 years. Some of the \n     policies enacted in the BBA, however, cut payments to \n     providers more significantly than expected--in some cases \n     more than double the expected amount--and threaten the \n     survival of institutions and services vital to seniors and \n     their communities throughout the country.\n       The Congress addressed some of those unintended \n     consequences last year, by enacting the Balanced Budget \n     Refinement Act (BBRA), which added back $16 billion over 5 \n     years in payments to various Medicare providers.\n       However, Congress is continuing to hear serious concerns \n     from health care providers and beneficiaries in our States--\n     particularly teaching hospitals and hospitals serving people \n     who are uninsured or underinsured, as well as concerns from \n     skilled nursing facilities, rural health providers, home \n     health agencies, and Medicare managed care providers.\n       In light of the projected $700 billion on-budget surplus \n     over the next 5 years and the problems facing vital health \n     care services, the Congress should enact an additional, \n     significant package of BBA adjustments and beneficiary \n     protections. Senate Democrats are therefore today introducing \n     the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000 (BBRA-2000), which \n     is a package of payment adjustments and access to care \n     provisions amounting to about $40 billion over 5 years.\n       Hospitals. A significant portion of the BBA spending \n     reductions have impacted hospitals. According to the Medicare \n     Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), ``Hospitals' financial \n     status deteriorated significantly in 1998 and 1999,'' the \n     years following enactment of BBA. BBRA-2000 would address the \n     most pressing problems facing hospitals by:\n       Fully restoring, for fiscal years `01 and `02, inpatient \n     market basket payments to keep up with increases in hospital \n     costs, an improvement that will help all hospitals.\n       Preventing implementation of further reductions in (IME) \n     payment rates for vital teaching hospitals--which are on the \n     cutting edge of medical research and provide essential care \n     to a large proportion of indigent patients. Support for \n     medical training and research at independent children's \n     hospitals is also included in the Democratic proposal.\n       Targeting additional relief to rural hospitals (Critical \n     Access Hospitals, Medicare Dependent Hospitals, and Sole \n     Community Hospitals) and making it easier for them to qualify \n     for disproportionate share payments under Medicare.\n       Providing additional support for hospitals with a \n     disproportionate share of indigent patients, including \n     elimination of scheduled reductions in Medicare and Medicaid \n     disproportionate share (DSH) payments, and extending Medicaid \n     to legal immigrant children and pregnant women, as well as \n     providing State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) \n     coverage to these children.\n       Establishing a grant program to assist hospitals in their \n     transition to a more data intensive care-delivery model.\n       Providing Puerto Rico hospitals with a more favorable \n     payment rate (specifically, the inpatient operating blend \n     rate) as MedPAC data suggests is warranted.\n       Home Health. The BBA hit home agencies particularly hard. \n     Home health spending dropped 45 percent between 1997 and \n     1999, while the number of home health declined by more than \n     2000 over that period. MedPAC has cautioned against \n     implementing next year the scheduled 15 percent reduction in \n     payments. BBRA-2000 would:\n       Repeal the scheduled 15 percent cut in home health \n     payments, delay for at least two years the inclusion of \n     medical supplies in the home health prospective payment \n     system (PPS), and provide a 10-percent upward adjustment in \n     rural home health payments for two years to address the \n     special needs of rural home health agencies in the transition \n     to PPS. BBRA-2000 would also provide an exception for ``very \n     rural'' home health agencies under the branch office \n     definition.\n       Provide full update payments (inflation) for medical \n     equipment, oxygen, and other suppliers.\n       Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs). The BBA was expected to \n     reduce payments to skilled nursing facilities by about $9.5 \n     billion. The actual reduction in payments to SNFs over the \n     period is estimated to be significantly larger. BBRA-2000 \n     would:\n       Allow nursing home payments to keep up with increases in \n     costs through a full market basket update for SNFs for FY \n     2001 and FY 2002, and market basket plus two percent for \n     additional payments.\n       Further delay caps on the amount of physical/speech therapy \n     and occupational therapy a patient can receive while the \n     Secretary completes a scheduled study on this issue.\n       Rural. Rural providers typically serve a larger proportion \n     of Medicare beneficiaries and are more adversely affected by \n     reductions in Medicare payments. In addition to the rural \n     relief measures noted above (under ``hospitals''), BBRA-2000 \n     addresses the unique situation faced in rural areas through a \n     number of measures, including: a permanent ``hold-harmless'' \n     exemption for small rural hospitals from the Medicare \n     Outpatient PPS; assistance for rural home health agencies; a \n     capital loan fund to improve infrastructure of small rural \n     facilities; assistance to develop technology related to new \n     prospective payment systems; bonus payments for providers who \n     serve independent hospitals; ensuring rural facilities can \n     continue to offer quality lab services to beneficiaries; and \n     specific provisions to assist Rural Health Clinics.\n       Hospice. Payments to hospics have not kept up with the cost \n     of providing care because of the cost of prescription drugs, \n     the therapies now used in end-of-life care, as well as \n     decreasing lengths of stay. Hospice base rates have not been \n     increased since 1989. BBRA-220 would provide significant \n     additional funding for hospice services to account for their \n     increasing costs, including full market basket updates for \n     fiscal years `01 and `02 and a 10-percent upward adjustment \n     in the underlying hospice rates.\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\n       Medicare+Choice. This legislation would ensure that \n     appropriate payments are made to Medicare+Choice (M+C) plans. \n     Expenditures by Medicare for its fee-for-service providers \n     included in BBRA-2000 indirectly benefit M+C plans to a \n     significant extent. Moreover, the legislation includes an \n     increase in the M+C growth percentage for fiscal years `01 \n     and `02, permitting plans to move to the 50:50 blended \n     payment one year earlier, and allowing plans which have \n     decided to withdraw to reconsider by November 2000.\n       Physicians. Congress understands the pressures that \n     physicians face to deliver high-quality care while still \n     complying with payment and other regulatory obligations. \n     BBRA-2000 provides for comprehensive studies of issues \n     important to physicians, including: the practice expense \n     component of the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) \n     physician payment system, post-payment audits, and regulatory \n     burdens. BBRA-2000 would provide relief to physicians in \n     training, whose debt can often be crushing, by lowering the \n     threshold for loan deferment from $72,000 to $48,000.\n       Beneficiary Improvements. Senate Democrats continue to \n     believe that passage of a universal, affordable, voluntary, \n     and meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit is the \n     highest priority for beneficiaries. In addition, BBRA-2000 \n     would directly assist beneficiaries in the following ways:\n       Coinsurance: BBRA-2000 would lower beneficiary coinsurance \n     to achieve a true 20 percent beneficiary copayment for all \n     hospital outpatient services within 20 years.\n       Preventive Benefits: The bill would provide for significant \n     advances in preventive medicine for Medicare beneficiaries, \n     including waiver of deductibles and cost-sharing, glaucoma \n     screening, counseling for smoking cessation, and nutrition \n     therapy.\n       Immunosuppressive Drugs: The bill would remove current \n     restrictions on payment for immunosuppressive drugs for organ \n     transplant patients.\n       ALS: The bill would waive the 24-month waiting period for \n     Medicare disability coverage for individuals diagnosed with \n     amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n       M+C Transition: For beneficiaries who have lost \n     Medicare+Choice plans in their area, BBRA-2000 includes \n     provisions that would strengthen fee-for-service Medicare and \n     assist beneficiaries in the period immediately following loss \n     of service.\n       Return-to-home: The bill would allow beneficiaries to \n     return to the same nursing home or other appropriate site-of-\n     care after a hospital stay.\n       Other Provisions. BBRA-2000 would address other high \n     priority issues, including: improved payment for dialysis in \n     fee-for-service and M+C to assure access to quality care for \n     end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients; increased market \n     basket updates for ambulance providers in fiscal years `01 \n     and `02; an immediate opt-in to the new ambulance fee \n     schedule for affected providers; and enhanced training \n     opportunities for geriatricians and clinical psychologists. \n     BBRA-2000 also includes important modifications to the \n     Community Nursing Organization (CNO) demonstration project, \n     and additional funding for the Ricky Ray Hemophilia program\n       Medicaid and SCHIP. The growing number of uninsured \n     individuals and declining enrollment in the Medicaid program \n     are issues which also must be addressed. To improve access to \n     health care for the uninsured and ensure that services \n     available through the Medicaid and SCHIP programs are \n     reaching those eligible for assistance, BBRA-2000 includes \n     the following provisions:\n       Improve eligibility and enrollment processes in SCHIP and \n     Medicaid.\n       Extend and improve the Transitional Medical Assistance \n     program for people who leave welfare for work.\n       Improve access to Medicare cost-sharing assistance for low-\n     income beneficiaries.\n       Give states grants to develop home and community based \n     services for beneficiaries who would otherwise be in nursing \n     homes.\n       Create a new prospective payment system (PPS) for Community \n     Health Centers to ensure they remain a strong, viable \n     component of our health care safety net.\n       Extend Medicaid coverage of breast and cervical cancer \n     treatment to women diagnosed through the federally-funded \n     early detection program.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Immigration\n\n\n                                                   Law Center,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     464 Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: We strongly applaud your decision to \n     include important health care restorations for low-income \n     immigrant children and pregnant women in the Senate \n     Democrat's Balanced Budget Act Refinement and Access to Care \n     proposal. The provisions would permit federal reimbursement \n     to states that choose to cover lawfully present children and \n     pregnant women under their Medicaid and State Children's \n     Health Insurance Programs.\n       As you know, legislation passed in 1996, at a time of very \n     tight budgets, left the safety net for legal immigrants in \n     tatters. As a result, health dare coverage for low-income \n     lawfully present immigrant children and pregnant women has \n     become a state-by-state patchwork, with tragic results. In \n     many states, there is no coverage at all for large numbers of \n     these children and pregnant women.\n       The policy of denying federal health care to lawfully \n     present immigrants is unfair and unwise. It is unfair because \n     immigrants pay the same taxes as all others, and deserve the \n     same access to health care that those taxes buy. In fact, \n     immigrant taxes are more than sufficient to pay for the \n     health care needs and all other expenses associated with \n     immigration. The average immigrant contributes $1,800 more \n     each year in taxes than the government pays out for her, \n     including the costs of roads, infrastructure, and education, \n     as well as all government services.\n       The policy is unwise because we are counting on these \n     immigrant children to join with all other children in \n     contributing to the American dream. They cannot do so if they \n     are hindered in their early years because they could not \n     obtain health care. And it is unwise because it shifts the \n     responsibility for immigrant health care from the federal to \n     the state governments, rather than maintain a shared federal-\n     state responsibility.\n       The Balanced Budget Act Refinement and Access to Care \n     proposal recognizes that some of the cuts to health care \n     providers made in the name of balancing the budget went too \n     far. In this time of surpluses, as Congress considers \n     proposals to eliminate the excesses of those budget cuts on \n     behalf of health care providers, Congress should also restore \n     services to lawfully present immigrant children and pregnant \n     women who sacrificed as much as anyone under the budget \n     balancing legislation of the 1990's.\n           Sincerely,\n         Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, Alliance for \n           Children and Families, American College Obstetricians \n           and Gynecologists, Center for Public Policy Priorities, \n           Children's Defense Fund, Coalition for Humane Immigrant \n           Rights of Los Angeles, Council of Great City Schools, \n           Families USA, Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, Inc., \n           Florida Legal Services, Inc., Hebrew Immigrant Aid \n           Society, Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Immigration \n           and Refugee Services of America, Jewish Federation of \n           Metro Chicago, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, March \n           of Dimes, Migrant Legal Action Program, National Asian \n           Pacific American Legal Consortium, National Association \n           of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, National \n           Council of La Raza, National Head Start Association, \n           National Health Law Program, National Korean American \n           Service & Education Consortium (NAKASEC), National \n           Immigration Law Center, New Jersey Immigration Policy \n           Network, Inc., New York Immigration Coalition, \n           Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, \n           Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, Texas Appleseed, \n           Texas Immigrant and Refugee Coalition, and United \n           Jewish Communities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Association of Public\n\n\n                                 Hospitals and Health Systems,\n\n                                Washington DC, September 20, 2000.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Association of Public Hospitals & Health Systems \n     (NAPH) to express our strong support for the ``Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Further Refinement Act of \n     2000.'' NAPH represents more than 100 metropolitan area \n     safety net hospitals and health systems. As safety net \n     institutions, our members are essential providers of care to \n     uninsured and vulnerable populations whose access would \n     otherwise be severely limited. More than 65 percent of the \n     patients served by these systems are either Medicaid \n     recipients or Medicare beneficiaries; another 25 percent are \n     uninsured.\n       NAPH is pleased that this legislation includes a number of \n     provisions that will assist low-income Medicaid beneficiaries \n     and the providers that serve them. In particular, we are \n     pleased that the legislation would avert Medicaid DSH \n     allotment reductions after fiscal year 2000 otherwise \n     required by the BBA. Medicaid DSH is our nation's primary \n     source of support for safety net hospitals that serve the \n     most vulnerable Medicaid, uninsured and underinsured \n     patients.\n       NAPH has long been supportive of efforts to expand access \n     to health insurance coverage and is pleased that the \n     legislation includes a number of these provisions. In \n     particular, the proposed legislation would allow states the \n     option to provide coverage under Medicaid and/or SCHIP for \n     legal immigrants, which will reduce confusion regarding \n     eligibility in the immigrant community, allow legal \n     immigrants to receive more appropriate care, and improve \n     public health in general. The legislation also includes a \n     state option to provide Medicaid coverage for certain women \n     diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer and provides \n     requirements designed to simplify Medicaid eligibility. We \n     are grateful for your efforts to expand Medicaid and SCHIP to \n     ensure that all low-income Americans have access to \n     appropriate health coverage.\n       NAPH is also pleased that the legislation addresses many of \n     the severe payment reductions in many areas (in addition to \n     Medicaid DSH) imposed by the BBA on providers. In particular, \n     NAPH is pleased that the legislation eliminates further \n     Medicare DSH reductions, freezes IME adjustments, and \n     restores the full market basket index update to hospital PPS \n     rates beginning April, 2001.\n       We thank you for your ongoing leadership in developing \n     legislation to assure the maintenance of the health care \n     safety net and we look forward to working with you further to \n     develop solutions to the problems of our nation's poor and \n     uninsured.

Recent studies have shown that uninsured Americans are \n     less likely to have a usual source of care, are more likely \n     to delay seeking care, and are less likely to use preventive \n     services. In addition, uninsured Americans are four times \n     more likely than insured patients to require both avoidable \n     hospitalizations and emergency hospital care.\n       These provisions will help more people get access to public \n     health insurance programs. Please let us know if we can be of \n     assistance in getting these provisions enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F.

In particular, we commend \n     your leadership over the years in improving our nation's \n     fiscal health. Through this visionary leadership, the nation \n     now has a projected $2.2 trillion on-budget surplus over the \n     next 10 years. It is both appropriate and fair that a portion \n     of this surplus should help offset severe problems facing our \n     health care services.\n       AMCHP strongly supports efforts included in your \n     legislation to improve access to health care for many \n     uninsured people including legal immigrant children and \n     pregnant women. In addition, we applaud efforts to improve \n     eligibility and enrollment processes in SCHIP and Medicaid. \n     AMCHP and its members want to particularly thank you for your \n     support of enhanced coordination and cooperation among the \n     various health care programs aimed at improving maternal and \n     child health and for your efforts to increase the \n     authorization level for Title V.\n       The Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs is an \n     organization dedicated to providing leadership in assuring \n     the health and well being of all women of reproductive age, \n     children and youth, including those with special health care \n     needs and their families. The state directors of Title V and \n     related programs formed the association in 1944 to share \n     information and collaborate with each other and others \n     concerned with the health of mothers and children.\n       In closing, thank you for your most recent efforts on \n     behalf of maternal and child health through the introduction \n     of legislation intended to further refine the BBA and improve \n     access to health care.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Deborah F.

Tom Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Daschle and Moynihan: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC), the \n     nationwide network of 3,000 health centers, and the more than \n     11 million patients they serve, I am writing to express our \n     extreme gratitude for your inclusion of the text of S. 1277, \n     the Safety Net Preservation act, in your legislation to \n     provide relief from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA).\n       As you know, the BBA eliminated a fundamental underpinning \n     of America's health center safety net by phasing-out and \n     eventually terminating the Medicaid cost-based reimbursement \n     system for Federally qualified health centers. Because health \n     centers are required by Federal law to provide access to care \n     to anyone, regardless of ability to pay, centers cannot \n     afford to be underpaid for services provided to Medicaid \n     patients. In other words, without this payment system, health \n     centers will be forced to subsidize low Medicaid payments \n     with grant dollars intended to care for the uninsured--\n     thereby forcing them to reduce the health care services they \n     provide in their communities.\n       In an effort to protect health centers from the loss of \n     this system, the Safety Net Preservation Act has been \n     introduced in the House and Senate to ensure that health \n     centers receive adequate Medicaid payments. This legislation, \n     which has the bipartisan support of 54 members of the Senate \n     and 243 members of the House of Representatives, has been \n     endorsed by NACHC, the National Association of Rural Health \n     Clinics, the National Rural Health Association, the United \n     States Conference of Mayors, and the National Association of \n     Counties.\n       Health centers believe that this legislation is essential \n     to their continued survival and will ensure that they remain \n     a viable part of America's health care safety net. Thank you \n     again for your commitment to protecting health centers \n     through your BBA relief legislation. It is our sincerest hope \n     that the Safety Net Preservation Act will be included in any \n     BBA relief package and signed into law by the time the 106th \n     Congress adjourns.\n       Please feel free to contact me if there is anything that I \n     can do for you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Thomas J. Van Coverden,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Center on Budget and\n\n\n                                            Policy Priorities,\n\n                                               September 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: We write to applaud your efforts to \n     help low-income families and children access much-needed \n     health care coverage. In particular, the Center on Budget and \n     Policy Priorities strongly supports provisions in your \n     ``Medicare, Medicaid, and S-CHIP Balanced Budget Refinement \n     Act of 2000'' aimed at reversing a trend of declining access \n     to health coverage by low-income families and immigrant \n     children. These provisions are important because families \n     with children have been losing out on health care coverage as \n     a result of unanticipated consequences of recent federal and \n     state actions.\n       A growing body of evidence indicates that a significant \n     number of low-income families with children have been \n     inadvertently harmed by federal and state laws enacted in \n     recent years to promote welfare reform. Despite the best \n     intentions of many policymakers, disturbing numbers of \n     families leaving welfare for work have lost out on health \n     care coverage. Indeed, a recent Center analysis found that \n     roughly half of parents and nearly one out of three children \n     leaving welfare lost Medicaid and were at high risk of being \n     uninsured even though the vast majority of them remained \n     eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. Similarly, studies indicate \n     that the Medicaid participation of children in legal \n     immigrant families has dropped in recent years. The largest \n     group of such children consists of those who remain eligible \n     for Medicaid because they are citizens of the United States. \n     These children were not the intended targets of immigration-\n     based restrictions on Medicaid coverage included in the 1996 \n     welfare law, but they nevertheless have been adversely \n     affected by the confusion and fear generated by the \n     immigration-based restrictions on health care coverage \n     included in the 1996 welfare law and modified in the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997.\n       For these reasons, we strongly applaud the provisions in \n     your legislation that would undue many of the unintended \n     consequences on health care coverage for low-income families \n     of recent state and federal actions, as well as restore \n     health care coverage to all legal immigrant children. In \n     particular, we strongly support the provisions designed to \n     promote the simplification, coordination, and streamlining of \n     states' application and re-enrollment procedures; to expand \n     state flexibility to allow schools and other organizations \n     that work with families to enroll children in health care \n     coverage under the ``presumptive eligibility'' option; to \n     give states more flexibility to provide transitional Medicaid \n     coverage to families leaving welfare for work; and to restore \n     state flexibility to cover legal immigrant children and \n     pregnant women who arrived in the United States after August \n     22, 1996. In combination, these provisions would represent a \n     very significant step forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert Greenstein,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              THE NATIONAL COUNCIL\n\n\n                                                 ON THE AGING,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     464 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: On behalf of the National Council on \n     the Aging (NCOA)--the nation's first organization formed to \n     represent older Americans and those who serve them--I write \n     to express our sincere gratitude and support for the numerous \n     provisions in your Medicare Balanced Budget Act (BBA) \n     refinement bill that would directly help Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       In particular, we strongly support provisions to: (1) \n     clarify the Medicare home health ``homebound'' problem; (2) \n     improve Medicare low-income protections; (3) improve Medicare \n     coverage and utilization of preventive services; (4) remove \n     the arbitrary\n\n[[Page S8854]]\n\n     cap on immunosuppressive drug coverage; (5) provide grants to \n     states for home and community-based care; and (6) accelerate \n     the phase-in period for reducing hospital outpatient \n     coinsurance.\n       First, under current law, in order for Medicare \n     beneficiaries to receive coverage for home health services \n     they must be ``confined to home.'' Current irrational and \n     inconsistent interpretations of this homebound requirement \n     are causing substantial harm to Medicare beneficiaries by \n     effectively forcing home health users to be imprisoned within \n     their own homes. We deeply appreciate the provision to permit \n     beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia to \n     receive therapeutic treatment in adult day centers without \n     losing home health coverage. We urge that you consider going \n     further by including Senator Jeffords' S. 2298, which is \n     endorsed by 46 national organizations and would provide \n     relief for all beneficiaries suffering under the homebound \n     problem.\n       Second, our current methods for protecting low-income \n     Medicare beneficiaries against increasing out-of-pocket costs \n     are simply abysmal. A shocking number of those eligible for \n     protection simply do not receive it. Current Medicare low-\n     income protections are a national embarrassment. NCOA \n     strongly supports provisions in your bill to: provide for \n     presumptive eligibility for low-income protections; \n     significantly improve the QI-1 program for beneficiaries with \n     incomes between 120% and 135% of poverty; index the asset \n     test to inflation, which is long overdue; and improve \n     outreach for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries.\n       Third, NCOA strongly supports the provisions to improve \n     preventive care for Medicare beneficiaries. It is often \n     easier and less expensive to prevent disease than to cure it. \n     Disease prevention must be an essential component of Medicare \n     beneficiaries' continuum of care. Medicare, however, still \n     fails to cover a number of important preventive services, and \n     those that are covered are underutilized. We support \n     provisions to extend Medicare coverage to tobacco cessation \n     counseling, glaucoma screening and medical nutrition therapy. \n     The addition of these new benefits will accelerate the \n     critical shift in Medicare from a sickness program to a \n     wellness program. We also support the provision to eliminate \n     all coinsurance and deductibles for preventive services. \n     Utilization of these critical services has been surprisingly \n     low. By encouraging greater utilization of these services, \n     beneficiaries' quality of life will be greatly enhanced and \n     Medicare expenditures will decline over the long run.\n       Fourth, NCOA supports the provision to eliminate the \n     arbitrary and costly cap on benefits for immunosuppressive \n     drug coverage under Medicare. The Institute of Medicine \n     recently recommended eliminating the time limitation, noting \n     the positive economic, clinical and social implications. It \n     makes no sense for Medicare to pay for the more expensive \n     consequences of organ rejection, such as dialysis or a second \n     transplant, but refuse to pay for the drugs to prevent the \n     rejection of the initial transplanted organ beyond 44 months. \n     This coverage can mean the difference between life and death \n     for some and, for others, the difference between a transplant \n     recipient having to experience the pain of an organ \n     rejection, a return to dialysis--for kidney recipients--and \n     the return to a long waiting list for another organ.\n       Fifth, we strongly support providing grants to states for \n     home and community-based care and to assist in implementing \n     the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision. These services are \n     grossly underfunded, resulting in unreasonable and costly \n     burdens on caregivers and premature placement in \n     institutions. Funding for home and community-based care \n     promotes dignity and independence and helps keep families \n     together. America's long-term care crisis will only grow \n     worse as our population ages. The proposed grants are a good \n     start in addressing the serious institutional bias that \n     exists for persons with disabilities needing long-term \n     services and supports.\n       Sixth, we support accelerating the phase-in period for \n     reducing hospital outpatient coinsurance. Coinsurance for \n     these services now averages almost 50 percent of costs. \n     Although current law provides that coinsurance amounts will \n     remain fixed at their current dollar level until they are \n     reduced to 20 percent of Medicare-approved payment amounts, \n     the process will take up to 40 years for some services. By \n     comparison, the most gradual phase-in Medicare has used to \n     date for any payment system change is 10 years. The current \n     phase-in schedule is simply far too long.\n       NCOA commends and thanks you for your strong leadership on \n     these important issues for America's seniors. Please let us \n     know if there is anything we can do to assist you in enacting \n     these provisions into law this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Howard Bedlin,\n     Vice President, Public Policy and Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Greater New York\n\n\n                                         Hospital Association,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     464 Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan, The Greater New York Hospital \n     Association (GNYHA) is extremely pleased to express its \n     strong and unqualified support for your bill, ``The Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000,'' \n     co-sponsored by your colleagues, Senator Charles E. Schumer \n     and Senator Tom Daschle. This bill, if enacted, would greatly \n     improve the Medicare program for all of its beneficiaries as \n     well as provide critical, permanent relief for America's \n     hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health \n     agencies from Medicare reductions contained in the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997 (BBA).\n       For beneficiaries, your legislation makes a number of \n     important improvements in the Medicare program including new \n     coverage for many critical preventive health care benefits. \n     In addition, you provide an option for states to provide \n     Medicaid and SCHIP coverage for pregnant women and children \n     who, because they are immigrants, have been denied health \n     care coverage due to the restrictions contained in the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \n     Act of 1996. The bill also simplifies the SCHIP enrollment \n     process and improves SCHIP and Medicaid in a variety of other \n     ways. GNYHA strongly supports these provisions.\n       Your bill also recognizes that Medicare and Medicaid \n     beneficiaries cannot receive quality health care services \n     unless the health care providers they rely upon have the \n     resources to provide the best care possible. To that end, \n     GNYHA strongly supports the following provisions.\n       The bill halts further Medicare reductions to teaching \n     hospitals by maintaining the indirect medical education (IME) \n     payment adjustment at 6.5 percent permanently, incorporating \n     the provisions of your Teaching Hospital Preservation Act (S. \n     2394). As you know, the BBA called for a 29 percent reduction \n     in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals for the indirect \n     costs of medical education. The BBRA postponed the cuts by \n     one year; however, under current law, the IME adjustment \n     would be reduced to 6.25 percent in FY 2001 and 5.5 percent \n     in FY 2002 and years thereafter. The Further Refinement Act \n     freezes IME adjustments at 6.5 percent, saving America's \n     teaching hospitals from over $2 billion in additional \n     Medicare cuts. The bill also provides greater flexibility to \n     allow hospitals to increase the number of residents training \n     in geriatrics and allows hospitals to be reimbursed by \n     Medicare for the costs of training clinical psychologists.\n       The bill provides a full market basket update for \n     prospective payment system hospitals, nursing homes, and home \n     health agencies for the next two years. Under the BBA, \n     hospitals would have received market basket minus 1.1 percent \n     in FY 2001 and FY 2002, and nursing homes and home health \n     agencies would have received market basket minus 1 percent. \n     The BBA reduced inflation updates so substantially that the \n     market basket update reductions constituted the largest \n     single cuts suffered by hospitals and continuing care \n     providers under the BBA. This bill ensures Medicare payments \n     will keep pace with the increased costs of caring for \n     Medicare beneficiaries by providing full market basket \n     updates.\n       This bill restores Medicare funding for disproportionate \n     share hospitals (DSH) by eliminating cuts in DSH payments, \n     thus strengthening the safety net DSH hospitals provide for \n     low-income patients.\n       The bill eliminates further reductions in Medicare DSH \n     payments to states, thus enabling states to provide critical \n     support for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of \n     low-income and uninsured patients.\n       The bill creates a grant program to help hospitals obtain \n     advanced information systems to improve quality and \n     efficiency.\n       The bill eliminates the 15 percent reduction for home \n     health reimbursement rates, which under current law would \n     take affect in 2002.\n       The bill extends the ``prudent layperson'' standard to \n     ambulance services, so that ambulance providers are not \n     unfairly denied payment by HMOs for services legitimately \n     provided to Medicare beneficiaries.\n       The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Further \n     Refinement Act of 2000 recognizes the need to improve the \n     Medicare program by providing much-needed coverage for \n     Medicare beneficiaries, the need to improve the Medicaid and \n     SCHIP programs for low-income Americans, and the need to \n     repair the damage to hospitals and continuing care providers \n     as a result of the BBA. Without your efforts, hospitals and \n     continuing care providers will continue to struggle to \n     provide quality care and will be forced to close down \n     services essential to the health care needs of their \n     communities.\n       GNYHA will work diligently with members of Congress to \n     ensure passage of this very important legislation. GNYHA \n     would like to thank you for once again providing the strong \n     leadership necessary to improve the health care of all New \n     Yorkers.\n       My best.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth E. Raske,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join today with Senator Moynihan and \nmany of our colleagues in introducing the Balanced Budget Refinement \nAct of 2000 (BBRA-2000).\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) made some justified changes in \nMedicare payment policy and contributed to our current budget \nsurpluses. It also included important provisions to improve seniors' \naccess to preventive benefits, and it created the Children's\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\nHealth Insurance Program. These are important accomplishments.\n  But some of the policies enacted in the BBA cut providers \nsignificantly more than expected. This has created severe problems for \nhealth care providers all over the country. Last year, we took steps to \ncorrect these problems. But we did not go far enough.\n  When I met with hospital administrators in South Dakota earlier this \nsummer, one told me that since the cuts from the BBA were implemented, \nhis hospital has been just barely breaking even. Usually, that alone \nwould be cause for concern. But then other hospital administrators told \nme they were jealous, because they are far from breaking even. In my \nstate, the operating margins for hospitals with 50 or fewer beds were a \nrelatively healthy 2 percent before the BBA. Last year, these small \nhospitals--which are so vital to their communities--had negative \nmargins of 6 percent.\n  Hospitals are not the only health care providers facing this problem. \nHome health agencies, nursing homes, hospices, and many other providers \nare all struggling to make ends meet in the face of deeper-than-\nexpected cuts.\n  The package of payment adjustments that Senate Democrats are \nintroducing today will provide a much-needed boost to these providers--\ntotaling $80 billion over 10 years. This will ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries continue to have access to the care that we have promised \nthem.\n  The bill has many provisions, but I would like to highlight a few.\n  For hospitals, BBRA-2000 would restore the full inflation update. It \nwould also improve payments for Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) \nand teaching hospitals, who provide essential care for some of the \nneediest patients.\n  Our bill repeals the 15 percent cut in home health, and delays adding \nmedical supplies to the home health prospective payment system (PPS). \nThese fixes are essential to an industry that has seen an unprecedented \ndrop in spending.\n  For skilled nursing facilities we would restore the full inflation \nupdate, with an additional two percent increase in fiscal years 2001 \nand 2002. We would also delay therapy caps for two additional years so \nthat beneficiaries do not face an arbitrary limit on the amount of care \nthey can receive.\n  Although the cost of providing care at the end of life has risen \ndramatically, the base for hospice payments has not been changed since \n1989. The bill restores the full inflation update for hospice \nproviders, and provides a ten percent upward adjustment in hospice base \nrates.\n  We are committed to ensuring that appropriate payments are made to \nMedicare+Choice plans. BBRA-2000 increases the growth rate in payments \nto these plans and allows plans to move to a 50-50 national blend one \nyear earlier.\n  The bill also improves payment for ambulance providers, medical \nequipment suppliers, and dialysis facilities, who all provide important \nservices to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  We recognize the special circumstances of rural health care providers \nin our bill. The rural health provisions include increasing payments \nfor small rural hospitals, rural home health agencies, and rural \nambulance providers.\n  There are other steps we need to take to improve beneficiaries' \naccess to care. The bill we are introducing today includes a package of \nrefinements to Medicare that directly help beneficiaries. For example, \nthe bill will build on provisions in the BBA to lower beneficiary \ncopayments and expand preventive benefits in Medicare.\n  We also provide for increased access to health care through \nimprovements to Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nThese include changes to the BBA, such as improving state processes for \nenrolling people who are eligible for Medicaid and CHIP. We also make \nchanges to the health-related provisions of immigration and welfare \nreform legislation that passed in 1996. For example, the bill would \nextend assistance to people who leave welfare for work.\n  Senate Democrats continue to believe that passage of an affordable, \nvoluntary, meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit is of highest \npriority. This bill, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000, is the \nnext step in ensuring that beneficiaries have access to the care they \nneed.\n  I want to thank Senator Moynihan and his staff for their hard work \nputting this bill together. They have spent the last two months \nlistening to health care providers, beneficiaries, community leaders, \nand members of our caucus. Through that listening process they have \ndrafted a bill that addresses the needs of the many communities that \nare struggling to deal with the impact of the Balanced Budget Act.\n  We know the problems providers are facing in health care. And we know \nhow to fix many of them. The bill we are introducing today is a \ncomprehensive plan to ensure the stability that health care providers \nneed and that beneficiaries depend on. We must take this opportunity to \nact, before it is too late to save some of the providers who are so \nclose to closing their doors.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nDaschle, Senator Moynihan, and other colleagues in introducing the \nBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000. This bill takes the next step \nin our continued effort to restore the excessive Medicare cuts in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. This legislation also includes several \nproposals to ease the financial burden and improve care for all \nbeneficiaries. It also includes important proposals to increase the \neffectiveness of Medicaid and the children's Health Insurance Program, \nand to improve access to care for vulnerable populations, including \nlegal immigrant children and pregnant women. Our goal is to pass this \nlegislation before the end of the year.\n  The cost-saving measures enacted by Congress as part of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 have turned out to be far deeper than the estimates \nat that time, and these excessive cuts have put countless outstanding \nhealth care institutions across the country at risk.\n  In Massachusetts, 25 percent of home health agencies no longer serve \nMedicare patients. Forty-three nursing homes have closed in the state \nsince 1998, and another 20 percent are in bankruptcy. Two out of every \nthree hospitals in Massachusetts are losing money on patient care.\n  The record surpluses we currently enjoy and anticipate in the years \nahead are partly due to the savings achieved by cutting Medicare in the \nBBA. Most of these savings came from policy and payment reforms, \nincluding actual cuts in payments for various services. While some \nchanges were clearly justified, the overall cuts were much deeper than \nintended and are too severe to sustain.\n  Last year, in passing the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, we \nmade a good start. It gave needed relief to Medicare providers. But \nwhen we enacted that bill last year, we also knew that it was only a \ndown-payment, and that additional relief would be needed.\n  The bill we are introducing today follows through on that commitment. \nIt would invest $80 billion over 10 years to restore payments to \nMedicare and Medicaid providers, improve benefits, and increase access \nto health care under Medicaid and CHIP. It provides the funding needed \nto allow these essential health professionals and institutions to do \nwhat they do best--provide the best health care possible for elderly \nand disabled Americans on Medicare. It will ensure that the nation's \nhealth care system is able to care responsibly for today's senior \ncitizens, and is adequately prepared to take care of those who will be \nretiring in the future.\n  No senior citizen should be forced to enter a hospital or a nursing \nhome because Medicare can't afford to pay for the services that will \nkeep her in her own home and in her own community.\n  No person with a disability should be told that occupational therapy \nservices are no longer available. Because legislation to balance the \nbudget reduced the rehabilitation services they need.\n  No community should be told that their number one employer and \nprovider of health care will be closing its doors or engaging in \nmassive layoffs, because Medicare can no longer pay its fair share of \nhealth costs.\n  No freestanding children's hospital should wonder whether it can \ncontinue to train providers to care for children, because of uncertain \nfederal support for its teaching activities.\n  Yet these scenes and many others are playing out in towns and cities \nacross the country today, in large part due to the excessive cuts \nrequired by the Balanced Budget Act three years ago.\n  With the retirement of the baby boom generation, the last thing we\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\nshould do is jeopardize the viability and commitment of the essential \ninstitutions that care for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet that is now \nhappening in cities and towns across the nation. In the vast majority \nof cases, the providers who care for Medicare patients are the same \nproviders who care for working families and everyone else in their \ncommunity. When hospitals who serve Medicare beneficiaries are \nthreatened, health care for the entire community is threatened too.\n  This legislation is an important step to maintain excellence \nthroughout our health care system. I commend Senator Daschle and \nSenator Moynihan for their leadership on this vital issue. It deserves \nprompt consideration by the Finance Committee and the entire Senate, \nand it should be enacted into law before we adjourn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am joining with my colleagues Senator \nMoynihan, Senator Daschle, and others today to introduce the Balanced \nBudget Refinement Act of 2000. This legislation seeks to address some \nof the unintended consequences the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997 is \nhaving on access to Medicare services vital to older Americans. The BBA \nhas had a particularly serious impact on rural health care providers, \nand I am pleased that the legislation we are introducing today \nacknowledges the special needs of rural America.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I supported the Balanced Budget Act when \nit was enacted by Congress in 1997 with strong bipartisan support. \nPrior to the passage of this law, Medicare was projected to be \ninsolvent within two years (by 2001), so it was imperative that we took \naction to extend Medicare's financial health and to constrain its rate \nof growth to a more sustainable level. Thanks in part to this law, we \nhave a flourishing economy in most parts of the country and the \nMedicare trust fund is projected to be solvent until 2025.\n  But in some respects, the Balanced Budget Act was successful beyond \nour wildest expectations in reducing Medicare program costs. The \nCongressional Budget Office originally estimated that Medicare spending \nwould be reduced by $112 billion over five years, but instead, the \nreduction in spending growth has been nearly double that amount. This \nunexpected result is having real consequences for Medicare \nbeneficiaries and health care providers, and Congress simply must take \naction to address these problems before adjourning this year.\n  Congress took a step in the right direction towards addressing the \nproblems facing Medicare providers by enacting the Balanced Budget \nRefinement Act, BBRA, of 1999. Unfortunately, however, there is growing \nevidence that the negative changes resulting from the BBA have not been \nadequately addressed by the BBRA. Moreover, the impacts continue to \ndisproportionately affect rural health care providers and the quality \nof care rural Medicare beneficiaries receive.\n  Part of the problem facing rural providers is simply demographics: My \nhome state of North Dakota is the second oldest in the nation, and our \noverall population is shrinking. In fact, in six of North Dakota's \n``frontier'' counties, there were 20 or fewer births for the entire \ncounty for the entire year of 1997. Admissions to rural hospitals have \ndropped by a drastic 60 percent in the last two decades, and those \npatients who do remain tend to be older and sicker. This means that \nrural hospitals tend to be disproportionately dependent upon Medicare \nreimbursement, to the extent that Medicare accounts for 85 percent of \ntheir revenue. Obviously, given this reality, changes in Medicare \nreimbursement have a tremendous impact on the financial health of rural \nhospitals.\n  Another part of the problem is that Medicare has historically \nreimbursed urban health care providers at a higher rate than their \nrural counterparts. Of course, some of this difference can be explained \nby regional differences in the cost of health care and variations in \nthe health status of older Americans. But this isn't the whole \nexplanation. Even after adjusting for these factors, a report by health \ncare economists found that, for example, Medicare's per beneficiary \nspending was about $8,000 in Miami, but only $3,500 in Minneapolis. \nWhen average Medicare payments for the same procedure are compared, the \ndisparities in payment in different areas of the country are dramatic. \nFor example, Medicare pays $6,588 for the treatment of simple pneumonia \nin the District of Columbia, but only $3,383 in North Dakota. In my \nopinion, this difference is largely explained by a Medicare \nreimbursement system that is skewed in favor of urban areas. For the \nmost part, the BBA further perpetuates this inequity, despite efforts \nby some of us to address this concern.\n  There are a few areas of the Balanced Budget Act and BBRA that I \nthink warrant further scrutiny and action, and these areas are \naddressed in the legislation being introduced today. The first is \nhospital payments, particularly for outpatient services. A recent \nanalysis by a health policy research firm estimates that the BBA would \nreduce Medicare payments to North Dakota hospitals by $163.8 million \nbetween FY 1998 and FY2002. The BBRA passed last year restores only $16 \nmillion of those reductions. So even with BBRA refinements, North \nDakota hospitals face a loss of $147.8 million in revenues. Outpatient \nservices are a particularly critical component of care in many North \nDakota hospitals: 40 percent of the hospitals in my state get more than \nhalf of their revenues from outpatient services. Senator Daschle and \nMoynihan's legislation will address the problems faced by rural \nhospitals by, among other things, providing a full inflation increase \nin Medicare payments to all hospitals in 2001 and 2002 and holding \nrural hospitals permanently harmless from the outpatient prospective \npayment system.\n  This legislation also addresses the issue of home health \nreimbursement. Nearly 70 percent of the home health agencies in my home \nstate are hospital-based, so the changes in home-health reimbursement \nare having a domino effect on North Dakota's hospitals. I am concerned \nthat the Health Care Financing Administration's, HCFA, proposed rule \nfor the new home health Prospective Payment System, PPS, does not take \naccount of the smaller size of rural home health agencies and the \nhigher fixed costs per visit. And, HCFA did not take sufficient account \nof the greater travel cost per visit in rural areas, and the higher \nincidence of chronic illness in rural communities. Today's legislation \nwould address this concern by providing a 10 percent increase in rural \nhome health payments for the next two years and repealing the 15 \npercent cut in home health reimbursement scheduled to take place on \nOctober 1, 2001.\n  This legislation also proposes other changes I think are worth \nfurther mention, including a further delay in the arbitrary caps on the \namount of physical, speech, and occupational therapy Medicare \nbeneficiaries can receive, and a 10 percent increase in the base \npayment rate for hospice care, which hasn't been increased in over a \ndecade.\n  Finally, while all of the provisions of this bill will together help \nto ensure that Medicare beneficiaries can continue to rely on the \nquality care they need and expect, this legislation includes a number \nof changes that will also make Medicare an even better deal. In \nparticular, this bill will expand Medicare's emphasis on preventive \nmedicine by adding such benefits as coverage for glaucoma screening, \ncounseling for smoking cessation, and nutrition therapy. The bill will \nalso eliminate the current three-year time limit on Medicare's coverage \nof immunosuppressive drugs, the expensive medicines that transplant \nrecipients need to keep their bodies from rejecting their new organs or \ntissue.\n  In short, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000 addresses many \nof the needs and concerns of Medicare beneficiaries and health care \nproviders. I hope this legislation will help lay the framework for the \nenactment of bipartisan legislation to address these issues before the \n106th Congress goes home.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Balanced \nBudget Refinement Act introduced today that works to correct the \ninequities of Medicare reforms included in the Balanced Budget Act \n(BBA) of 1997.\n  I would like to commend Senator Daschle for his tremendous efforts on \nthis issue and for his leadership with the introduction of this bill. \nAs well, I\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\ncongratulate a number of my other colleagues who have contributed \nimmensely to the crafting of this critically important piece of \nlegislation, including Senators Moynihan, Rockefeller, Conrad, Graham, \nKerrey, Robb, Baucus, Breaux and others.\n  By way of background, as part of the effort to balance the federal \nbudget, the BBA of 1997 provided for major reforms in the way Medicare \npays for medical services. The BBA made some important changes in \nMedicare payment policy and contributed to our current period of budget \nsurpluses through significant cost savings in Medicare. These changes \nwere originally expected to cut Medicare spending by about $112 billion \nover five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n  However, projections showed spending falling nearly twice that much, \nand as a result, unintended payment cuts to providers had deepened more \nsignificantly than expected. In the face of these profound cuts, health \ncare providers began to struggle, and beneficiary access to care became \nthreatened, due to forced reductions in services especially in rural \nparts of the country such as South Dakota. As a result, Congress \naddressed some of these unintended consequences of the BBA by enacting \nthe Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) last year which provided $16 \nbillion over 5 years in payments to various Medicare providers, \nincluding; Hospital Outpatient Departments; Skilled Nursing Facilities; \nRural Health Providers; Home Health Agencies; Medicare HMOs; and \nTeaching Hospitals. The impact in South Dakota indicated that \napproximately 9% of Medicare funding reductions imposed by the BBA of \n1997 were returned as a result of the BBRA passed last year, resulting \nin approximately $15.3 million being restored to South Dakota Medicare \nproviders.\n  While this was certainly a step in the right direction, the BBRA of \n1999 did not do enough as concerns from hospital and nursing home \nadministrators, home health facilities, rural health providers, \nambulance services and Medicare beneficiaries continued to be heard \nacross the country.\n  Not surprising, I continue to hear from many South Dakota safety net \nproviders about the devastating effects such reductions in Medicare \nreimbursements are having throughout the health care industry in my \nhome state. Consumers are also feeling the pain, as many individuals \nare being turned away from hospitals and nursing homes who cannot \nafford to accept new patients because of the lower reimbursement rates \nincluded in BBA of 1997. The undesirable and unintended cuts are \ndevastating and feared to have severe implications on the quality and \naccess of health care throughout our nation, including South Dakota, \nunless Congress acts immediately to further correct these problems. In \nSouth Dakota, and other rural parts of the country, hospitals and other \nhealth care providers have an extremely high percentage of Medicare \nbeneficiaries making these cuts in reimbursement even more devastating. \nIf Congress does not act in a timely fashion many of these providers \nmay be forced to close their doors.\n  Nowhere can we see the impact of closures more evident than within \nthe nursing home industry. Nursing homes are experiencing closures at \nrecord rates across the country. In South Dakota, just last month we \nendured our first nursing home closure in Parker, South Dakota. Not \nonly was this devastating for residents and workers, but the domino \neconomic impact that goes hand in hand with such a facility closure is \nenormous for small communities to absorb.\n  As well, one does not have to look far in my home state of South \nDakota to see the impact many other health care providers and \nfacilities are experiencing. Furthermore, the consequences are being \nfelt across the board, from larger health systems in South Dakota \ncommunities such as Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Aberdeen, to medium \ncenters in Brookings, Watertown, Pierre and Yankton, to the smaller \nrural facilities in places like Martin, Edgemont, Gregory, Miller, Hot \nSprings and Redfield, just to name a few. The situation is arduous for \nmany of these facilities, who often carry the immense task of being the \nsole health care provider in the entire county. By way of example, \nGregory Healthcare Center is a 26 bed rural hospital serving \napproximately 9,000 people. Not surprising, Gregory is the only local \nprovider to offer a range of services including surgery, obstetrics, \nand various therapies, and also operates the only home health agency in \nthe area. The facility in Gregory was forced to cut back its' home \nhealth services as a result of the BBA Medicare reductions. Many \nindividuals once benefiting from specialized medication oversight and \ncondition management services through Gregory's home health agency were \nnow at home performing these services on their own, resulting in some \ncases to unnecessary hospitalizations. The situation in Gregory is by \nfar not an isolated situation and facilities nationwide are being \nforced to cut services just to survive. Whether it be Gregory, South \nDakota, or one of far too many other facilities in this country with \nsimilar issues, these are direct examples of the intense real life \nsituations that facilities, providers and beneficiaries are \nexperiencing every day as a result of inadequate BBA adjustments, \npayment updates and beneficiary protections.\n  Therefore, I stand in strong support of the BBRA legislation being \nintroduced today which will address problems facing vital health care \nservices. I look forward to working with my colleagues on passage of \nthe BBRA of 2000 which develops a creative, cost-effective approach to \naddress the unintended, long-term consequences of the BBA. The proposed \nbudget surplus provides Congress the unique opportunity to address many \nof the deficiencies in our nation's health care system. We need to \naddress the valid concerns of teaching hospitals, skilled nursing \nfacilities, home health providers, rural and community hospitals, and \nother health care providers who require relief from the consequences of \nthe BBA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 3078. A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the Santa Fe Regional Water Management and River \nRestoration Project; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    reclamation wastewater and groundwater study and facilities act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing a \nbill authorizing the next logical step in the City of Santa Fe's \nRegional Water Management and River Restoration Strategy. This bill \nallows the Secretary of Interior to participate in the design, planning \nand construction of the Santa Fe, New Mexico, regional water management \nand river restoration project, consisting of the diversion and reuse of \nwater, the conversion of irrigation uses from potable water to \nreclaimed water, and the use of reclaimed water to restore Santa Fe \nRiver flows.\n  Limited water resources in the Santa Fe region and increased demands \nthreaten the sustainability of surface and groundwater supplies. The \nRegional Water Management and River Restoration Strategy is a \ncomprehensive, collaborative plan to responsibly and sustainability \naddress the region's water supply needs. The full program goals are to \nreturn flow to the river, protect riparian habitat and the traditional, \ncultural and religious uses of the water.\n  The Santa Fe area has been working overtime to determine how best to \nimprove its water supply. I have been proud to help fund its efforts. \nThe FY99 Energy and Water Appropriations Act provided $450,000 and the \nFY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations Act included $750,000 to \nsupport the Santa Fe Regional Water Management and River Restoration \ninitiative to address long-term water supplies in the greater Santa Fe \narea. That funding allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue and \ncomplete environmental studies required under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act for the comprehensive plan to improve Santa \nFe's regional water supplies through a reuse program and restoration of \nthe Santa Fe River watershed.\n  I was also pleased to gain approval for $750,000 to support the \nproject in the Senate FY01 VA/HUD bill to assist in the planning, \ncoordination and development of restoration projects for the Santa Fe \nRiver under a comprehensive, watershed-based implementation\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\nprogram. The funding, provided through EPA's Environmental Programs and \nManagement program, would help the WMRRS reuse treated effluent to \naugment streamflow, recharge the regional aquifer, and enhance the \nriparian habitat and recreational uses within the Santa Fe River \ncorridor.\n  The Santa Fe Water Management and River Restoration Strategy is a \ncooperative partnership among Santa Fe County, the city of Santa Fe, \nand the San Ildefonso Pueblo. The city of Espanola, the Eldorado Water \nand Sanitation District, and the Northern Pueblos Tributary Water \nRights Association (representing San Ildefonso, Nambe, Pojoaque and \nTesuque pueblos) are also involved.\n  In June of this year, a $601,000 grant was awarded to the project \nfollowing my request in the FY 2000 Veterans' Affairs, Housing and \nUrban Development and Independent Agencies (VA-HUD) Appropriations \nBill. The funding was awarded through the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development's Economic Development Initiative (EDI) program.\n  This funding represents federal support for the effort to \nrehabilitate the Santa Fe River, a project that is one aspect of an \noverall initiative to address the future of water in the Santa Fe area. \nThose funds will be used for urban river restoration planning, source \nwater protection planning, and development of a comprehensive trails \nand open space plan.\n  This authorizing legislation takes the water management strategy to \nthe next phase. The plan has already been backed by a local and \nregional commitment of at least $2.7 million for the multi-year \nprogram. The sponsors of the program have requested this authorization \nto provide additional financial support for this project. This \nlegislative authority will make the project eligible for future funding \nas the project is developed, as well as federal cooperation with the \nsurrounding pueblos. I hope that this body can take swift action on the \nworthy legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 3082. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the manner in which new medical technologies are made available \nto Medicare beneficiaries under the Medicare Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act 20000\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when I first introduced this legislation \nover one year ago, Medicare beneficiaries with advanced heart disease \ncould not gain access to ventriculaassist devices. Medicare patients \nwho could have benefitted from cochlear implants did not receive them.\n  It is now over a year later. Unfortunately, these problems still \npersist. Medicare beneficiaries still have trouble gaining access to \nmany technologies that are covered under private plans. And while the \nOmnibus Budget legislation for FY 2001 addressed the overall problem \nand by addressing access concerns for Medicare beneficiaries, there is \nstill plenty of work that needs to be done. That is why I am \nintroducing the Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act 2000 today.\n  We must eliminate the delays and barriers to access that have arisen \nin the way Medicare decides to cover, code and pay for new devices and \ndiagnostics. The measure I am introducing today is identical to \nlegislation introduced by Congressman Jim Ramstad and Congresswoman \nKaren Thurman earlier this year. It seeks to build off of the success \nwe had last year in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act. The BBRA \nrepresented an important first step in creating a Medicare program that \nprovides timely access to needed treatments.\n  The BBRA, which was signed into law as part of last year's omnibus \nbudget legislation made significant changes. We crafted special \ntemporary payments for new breakthrough technologies to ensure they are \nprovided to Medicare beneficiaries in a timely manner. We also \nestablished payment categories that better reflect advances in clinical \npractice and technology.\n  The Medicare Patient Access to Technology Act 2000 recognizes that \nall Medicare beneficiaries, not just those in the outpatient setting, \nshould be able to benefit from these kinds of improvements.\n  The bill would require: annual updates of Medicare's payment \nprograms; temporary procedure codes to be issued by Medicare for new \ntechnologies at the time of FDA review; quarterly updates of Medicare's \npayment codes; external data to be used to improve the timeliness and \nappropriateness of reimbursement decisions; and annual reports be made \non the timeliness of its coverage, coding and payment decisions.\n  There are some notable changes in this new version of the bill:\n  A provision to extend the issuance of temporary codes and quarterly \ncoding updates to inpatient, or ICD-9, codes as well as outpatient \n(HCPCS) codes.\n  A provision to require HCFA to create open, timely procedures and \nsound methods for making coding and payment decisions for new \ndiagnostic tests. It would also give stakeholders the ability to appeal \na coding or payment decision for a diagnostic test.\n  This legislation will provide assistance to Medicare beneficiaries \nwho currently face almost insurmountable barriers to advanced \ntechnologies.\n  Without this bill, Medicare will continue to fall far short of making \nthe latest technologies and procedures available to beneficiaries in a \ntimely manner.\n  I will fight for enactment of this bill in an effort to make sure \nthat our seniors have access to the advanced treatments that can save \nand improve their lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 3083. A bill to enhance privacy and the protection of the public \nin the use of computers and the Internet, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       Enhancement of Privacy and public Safety in Cyberspace Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the end of July, the administration \ntransmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives legislation \nintended to increase privacy and security in cyberspace. Today, at the \nrequest and on behalf of the Administration, I introduce this \nlegislation, the Enhancement of Privacy and Public Safety in Cyberspace \nAct.\n  The White House Chief of Staff, John Podesta, announced the \nadministration's cyber-security proposal in an important speech at the \nNational Press Club on Monday, July 17, 2000. This is a complex area \nthat requires close attention to get the balance among law enforcement, \nbusiness and civil liberties interests just right. I welcome the \nAdministration's participation in this debate on the privacy \nimplications of government surveillance, which certainly deserves just \nas much attention as the issue of the collection and dissemination of \npersonally-identifiable information by the private-sector.\n  The means by which law enforcement authorities may gain access to a \nperson's private ``effects'' is no longer limited by physical \nproximity, as it was at the time the Framers crafted our Constitution's \nFourth Amendment right of the American people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures. New communications methods and surveillance devices have \ndramatically expanded the opportunities for surreptitious law \nenforcement access to private messages and records from remote \nlocations.\n  One example of these devices is the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \nCarnivore software program, which screens Internet traffic and captures \ninformation targeted by court orders. The Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittees have both conducted hearings on Carnivore to discuss how the \nsoftware works and whether it minimizes intrusion or maximizes the \npotential for government abuse. The Attorney General is arranging for \nan independent technical review of Carnivore, and I look forward to \nreviewing the results.\n  In short, new communications technologies pose both benefits and \nchallenges to privacy and law enforcement. The Congress has worked \nsuccessfully in the past to mediate this tension with a combination of \nstringent procedures for law enforcement access to our communications \nand legal protections to maintain their privacy and confidentiality, \nwhether they occur in person or over the telephone, fax machine or \ncomputer. In 1968, the Congress passed comprehensive legislation \nauthorizing government interception, under carefully defined \ncircumstances, of voice\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\ncommunications over telephones or in person in Title III of the Omnibus \nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act.\n  We returned to this important area in 1986, when we passed the \nElectronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to \nsponsor, that outlined procedures for law enforcement access to \nelectronic mail systems and remote data processing systems, and that \nprovided important privacy safeguards for computer users.\n  The Administration's legislation is an important contribution to the \nongoing debate over the sufficiency of our current laws in the face of \nthe exponential growth of computer and communications networks. In \nfact, this legislation contains some proposals which I support. For \nexample, the bill would allow judicial review of pen register orders so \nthe judge is not just a rubber stamp, and would update the wiretap laws \nto apply the same procedural rules to e-mail intercepts as to phone \nintercepts.\n  Nevertheless, the merits of other provisions in this legislation \nwould benefit from additional scrutiny and debate. For example, the \nlegislation proposes elimination of the current $5,000 threshold for \nlarge categories of federal computer crimes. This would lower the bar \nfor federal investigative and prosecutorial attention with the result \nthat lesser computer abuses could be converted into federal crimes.\n  Specifically, federal jurisdiction currently exists for a variety of \ncomputer crimes if, and only if, such criminal offenses result in at \nleast $5,000 of aggregate damage or cause another specified injury, \nsuch as the impairment of medical treatment, physical injury to a \nperson or a threat to public safety. Elimination of the $5,000 \nthreshold would criminalize a variety of minor computer abuses, \nregardless of whether any significant harm results. Our federal laws do \nnot need to reach each and every minor, inadvertent and harmless \nhacking offense--after all, each of the 50 states has its own computer \ncrime laws. Rather, our federal laws need to reach those offenses for \nwhich federal jurisdiction is appropriate. This can be accomplished, as \nI have done in the Internet Security Act, S. 2430, which I introduced \nearlier this year, by simply adding an appropriate definition of \n``loss'' to the statute.\n  Prior Congresses have declined to over-federalize computer offenses \nand sensibly determined that not all computer abuses warrant federal \ncriminal sanctions. When the computer crime law was first enacted in \n1984, the House Judiciary Committee reporting the bill stated:\n\n       The Federal jurisdictional threshold is that there must be \n     $5,000 worth of benefit to the defendant or loss to another \n     in order to concentrate Federal resources on the more \n     substantial computer offenses that affect interstate or \n     foreign commerce. (H.Rep. 98-894, at p. 22, July 24, 1984).\n\n  Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of \nSenator Thurmond, rejected suggestions in 1986 that ``the Congress \nshould enact as sweeping a Federal statute as possible so that no \ncomputer crime is potentially uncovered.'' (S. Rep. 99-432, at p. 4, \nSeptember 3, 1986).\n  For example, if an overly-curious college sophomore checks a \nprofessor's unattended computer to see what grade he is going to get \nand accidentally deletes a file or a message, current Federal law does \nnot make that conduct a crime. That conduct may be cause for discipline \nat the college, but not for the FBI to swoop in and investigate. Yet, \nunder the Administration's legislation, this unauthorized access to the \nprofessor's computer would constitute a federal offense.\n  As the Congress considers changes in our current laws with a view to \nupdating our current privacy safeguards from unreasonable government \nsurveillance, I commend the administration for focusing attention on \nthis important issue by transmitting its legislative proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3083\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for State accreditation of diabetes self-management training \nprograms under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nstate accreditation of diabetes self-management training programs under \n                          the medicare program\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nwill allow all state diabetes education programs to be reimbursed by \nthe Medicare program. Currently, state diabetes education programs that \nonly have state certification are not able to receive Medicare \nreimbursement for the fine work that they do as far as educating \ndiabetics in the communities. As a result, these individuals have less \naccess to the education that they need to control their diabetes.\n  This issue was brought to my attention by the Program Director of the \nUtah Diabetes Control Program. There are 32 diabetes education programs \nin Utah that are either Utah certified or recognized by the American \nDiabetes Association. Eighteen of those programs have only state \ncertification and seven of those are located in rural communities of \nUtah, including Moab, Price, Roosevelt, Gunnison, Payson, and Tooele.\n  Without this legislation, these 18 programs cannot be reimbursed by \nMedicare unless they are certified by the American Diabetes \nAssociation. In Utah, our state certification program exceeds national \nstandards. In addition to submitting an application and documentation \nthat the education programs meet the national standards, Utah Diabetes \nControl Program staff conduct site visits with all applying programs. \nThe staff also collects data through annual reports to assess continued \nquality and outcomes.\n  One of the biggest concerns that has been brought to my attention by \nthe Utah Department of Health is that the American Diabetes Association \ncharges $850 for state programs to apply for ADA certification. The \nsmaller state diabetes education programs have indicated that the ADA \nfee is cost-prohibitive for them, especially in the more rural areas. \nOn the other hand, state certification is free to all applicants.\n  I understand that this problem not only exists in Utah, but across \nthe country. I believe that this matter needs to be addressed by \nCongress so that all Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of where they \nlive, will have access to diabetes education programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Cleland, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 3085. A bill to provide assistance to mobilize and support United \nStates communities in carrying out youth development programs that \nassure that all youth have access to programs and services that build \nthe competencies and character development needed to fully prepare the \nyouth to become adults and effective citizens; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                       the younger americans act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Younger \nAmerican's Act with Senators Kennedy, Cleland, and Murray. This \nlegislation embraces the belief that youth are not only our nation's \nmost valuable resource, they also are our most important \nresponsibility. The needs of youth must be moved to a higher priority \non our nation's agenda.\n  It is not enough that government responds to youth when they get into \ntrouble with drugs, teen pregnancy, and violence. We need to strengthen \nthe positive rather than simply respond to the negative. Positive youth \ndevelopment, the framework for the Younger American's Act, is not just \nabout preventing bad things from happening, but giving a nudge to help \ngood things happen. And we know that it works.\n  Evaluations of Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Clubs, and \nother youth development programs have demonstrated significant \nincreases in parental involvement, youth participation in constructive \neducation, social and recreation activities, enrollment in post-\nsecondary education, and community involvement. Just as important, \nyouth actively participating in youth development programs show \ndecreased rates of school failure and absenteeism, teen pregnancy, \ndelinquency, substance abuse, and violent behavior.\n  We also know that risk taking behavior increases with age. One third \nof the high school juniors and seniors participate in two or more \nhealth risk behaviors. That is why it is important to build a youth \ndevelopment infrastructure that engages youth as they enter pre-\nadolescence and keeps them engaged throughout their teen years. The \nYounger American's Act is targeted to youth aged ten to nineteen. This \nencompasses both the critical middle-school years, as well as the \nincreasingly risky high school years.\n  The Younger American's Act is about framing a national policy on \nyouth. Up until now, government has responded to kids after they have \ngotten into trouble. We must take a new tack. Instead of just treating \nproblems, we have to promote healthy development. We have to remember \nthat just because a kid stays out of trouble, it doesn't mean that he \nor she is ready to handle the responsibilities of adulthood. Research \nhas shown that kids want direction, they want close bonds with parents \nand other adult mentors. And I believe we owe them that. Ideally, this \ncomes from strong families, but communities and government can help.\n  In order to keep kids engaged in positive activities, youth must be \nviewed as resources; as active participants in finding solutions to \ntheir own problems. Parents also must be part of those solutions. This \nlegislation requires that youth and parents be part of the decision-\nmaking process on the federal and local levels.\n  The United States does not have a cohesive federal policy on youth. \nCreating an Office on National Youth Policy within the White House not \nonly raises the priority of youth on the federal agenda, but provides \nan opportunity to more effectively coordinate existing federal youth \nprograms to increase their impact on the lives of young Americans. The \nefforts of the Office of National Youth Policy in advocating for the \nneeds of youth, and the Department of Health and Human Service in \nimplementing the Younger American's Act will be helped by the Council \non National Youth Policy. This Council, comprised of youth, parents,\n\n[[Page S8863]]\n\nexperts in youth development, and representatives from the business \ncommunity, will help ensure that this initiative continually responds \nto the changing needs of youth and their communities. It will bring a \n``real world'' perspective to the efforts of the Office and HHS.\n\n  The Younger American's Act provides communities with the funding \nnecessary to adequately ensure that youth have access to five core \nresources:\n  Ongoing relationships with caring adults;\n  Safe places with structured activities in which to grow and learn;\n  Services that promote healthy lifestyles, including those designed to \nimprove physical and mental health;\n  Opportunities to acquire marketable skills and competencies; and\n  Opportunities for community service and civic participation.\n  Block grant funds will be used to expand existing resources, create \nnew ones where none existed before, overcome barriers to accessing \nthose resources, and fill gaps to create a cohesive network for youth. \nThe funds will be funneled through states, based on an allocation \nformula that equally weighs population and poverty measures, to \ncommunities where the primary decisions regarding the use of the funds \nwill take place. Thirty percent of the local funds are set aside for to \naddress the needs of youth who are particularly vulnerable, such as \nthose who are in out-of home placements, abused or neglected, living in \nhigh poverty areas, or living in rural areas where there are usually \nfewer resources. Dividing the state into regions, or ``planning and \nmobilization areas,'' ensures that funds will be equitably distributed \nthroughout a state. Empowering community boards, comprised of youth, \nparents, and other members of the community, to supervise decisions \nregarding the use of the block grant funds ensures that the programs, \nservices, and activities supported by the Act will be responsive to \nlocal needs.\n  Accountability is integral to any effective federal program. The \nYounger American's Act provides the Department of Health and Human \nServices with the responsibility and funding to conduct research and \nevaluate the effectiveness of funded initiatives. States and the \nDepartment are charged with monitoring the use of funds by grantees, \nand empowered to withhold or reduce funds if problems arise.\n\n  The Younger Americans Act will help kids gain the skills and \nexperience they need to successfully navigate the rough waters of \nadolescence. My twenty-first century community learning centers \ninitiative supports the efforts of schools to operate after-school \nprograms that emphasize academic enrichment. It's time to get the rest \nof the community involved. It's time to give the same level of support \nto the thousands of youth development and youth-serving organizations \nthat struggle to keep their doors open every day.\n  I remember a young man, Brad Luck, who testified before the H.E.L.P. \nCommittee several years ago. As a 14-year-old, Brad embarked on a two-\nyear mission to open a teen center in his home town of Essex Junction, \nVermont. He formed a student board of directors, sought 501(c)(3) \nstatus and gave over 25 community presentations to convince the town to \nback the program. Demonstrating the tenacity of youth, he then spear-\nheaded a successful drive to raise $30,000 in 30 days to fund the \nstart-up of the center. Today, the center is thriving in its town-\ndonated space. This is an example of the type of community asset \nbuilding supported by the Younger Americans Act. The Younger Americans \nAct is about an investment in our youth, our communities, and our \nfuture. I want to thank America's Promise, the United Way, and the \nNational Collaboration for Youth for their work in providing the \noriginal framework for the legislation. I am proud and excited to be \npart of this important initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Younger Americans Act--Summary\n\n       The Younger Americans Act provides a framework for a \n     cohesive national policy on youth. Loosely based on the Older \n     Americans Act, this legislation is an opportunity to better \n     coordinate the services, activities and programs that help \n     our young people make a successful transition from childhood \n     to adulthood. The bill includes a block grant program to \n     support local communities in their efforts to strengthen the \n     resources that are available to youth. But perhaps most \n     importantly, The Younger Americans Act is about forging \n     partnerships between parents, youth, government, and youth \n     serving organizations.\n       The Younger Americans Act begins with a statement of \n     national youth policy that youth need to have access five \n     core resources:\n       Ongoing relationships with caring adults;\n       Safe places with structured activities;\n       Services that promote healthy lifestyles, including those \n     designed to improve physical and mental health;\n       Opportunities to acquire marketable skills and \n     competencies; and\n       Opportunities for community service and civic \n     participation.\n       Reflecting the high priority which youth need to occupy on \n     the national agenda, the legislation establishes an Office of \n     National Youth Policy within the White House. This office \n     will serve as an effective advocate for youth within the \n     federal government and assist in resolving administrative and \n     programmatic conflicts between federal programs that are \n     barriers to parents, youth, communities, and service \n     providers in accessing the full array of core resources for \n     youth. Funds for this Office are authorized for $500,000 a \n     year.\n       The Younger Americans Act creates a Council on National \n     Youth Policy to advise the President, the Director of the \n     Office of National Youth Policy and the Department of Health \n     and Human Services on the developmental needs of youth, youth \n     participation, and federal youth policies. The membership of \n     the Council ensures that youth are active participants in the \n     finding solutions to many of their own problems. The Council \n     is authorized to conduct public forums for discussion and \n     serve as an information conduit between policy makers, youth, \n     and others involved in the provision of youth services. It is \n     authorized for $250,000 per year.\n       The Younger Americans Act creates a formula-based state \n     block grant to support community-based youth development \n     programs, activities and services. Ninety-seven percent of \n     the funds will be distributed to states, Native American \n     tribes and organizations, and outlying territories. The \n     Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to use \n     the remainder of the funds to conduct demonstration program \n     for youth populations that are particularly vulnerable. Funds \n     are distributed to states based on the population of youth \n     aged 10-19, and the number of children and youth receiving \n     free- or reduced priced lunches. There is a small state \n     minimum of .4 percent.\n       To implement the block grant, states are required to divide \n     the state into geographical regions called planning and \n     mobilization areas. States are encouraged to utilize existing \n     state administrative or programmatic regions. States may use \n     up to 4 percent of the funds for program review, monitoring, \n     and technical assistance; and no more than 3 percent of \n     the funds to address the needs of particularly vulnerable \n     youth populations, including youth in out-of-home \n     residential settings, such as foster care, communities \n     with high concentrations of poverty, rural areas, and \n     youth that have been abused or neglected. The remaining 93 \n     percent of the funds allotted to the states must be \n     equitably distributed among the planning and mobilization \n     areas, based on the same population and school lunch \n     program participation formula used for the distribution of \n     the federal funds.\n       An ``area agency for youth'' will be designated to \n     administer the funds, under the direction of a community \n     board. States are encouraged to build on existing community \n     resources and systems. After assessing the available assets \n     for youth, as well as gaps in and barriers to services in the \n     community, a plan to address the needs of local youth in the \n     five core resources is developed for each region of the \n     state. At least 30 percent of the funds provided to the area \n     agency for youth must be used to address the needs of the \n     most vulnerable youth populations in the region. As part of \n     the planning process, area agencies for youth and community \n     boards must identify measures of program effectiveness upon \n     which future progress will be evaluated.\n       Funds are distributed, on a competitive basis, to \n     community-based youth serving organizations and agencies in \n     such a manner as to build a cohesive network of programs, \n     services and activities for local youth. Provisions in the \n     legislation ensure the participation of youth and their \n     families in decisions about how best to meet the needs of \n     local youth. There is a state or local match requirement of \n     20 percent for the first two years, increasing to 50 percent \n     by the fifth and subsequent years. The match can meet through \n     cash or in-kind contributions, fairly evaluated. The \n     legislation contains an illustrative list of youth \n     development activities, programs and services that may \n     receive funds from the Younger American's Act. That list \n     includes a broad variety of effective youth development \n     activities such as youth mentoring, community youth centers \n     and clubs, character development, non-school hours programs, \n     sports and recreation activities, academic and cultural \n     enrichment, workforce preparation, community service, and \n     referrals to health and mental health services. The block \n     grant is authorized for $500 million the first year, ramping\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\n     up to $2 billion in the fifth year of the legislation, for a \n     total of $5.75 billion over five years.\n       Although research has demonstrated the effectiveness of \n     positive youth development programs, accountability and \n     evaluation must be part of any significant investment of \n     federal funds. The legislation requires the Department of \n     Health and Human Service to conduct extensive research and \n     evaluation of the programs, services and activities funded \n     under the Act. The Department also has responsibility for \n     funding professional development activities for youth workers \n     and other training and education initiatives to increase the \n     capacity of local boards, agencies and organizations to \n     implement the block grant. These efforts are authorized for \n     $7 million per year.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Jeffords for his \nleadership on this important legislation and it is a privilege to join \nhim as a cosponsor on this legislation. I also commend the thirty-four \nyouth organizations that comprise the National Collaboration for Youth \nand the more than 200 young people who have worked on this bill. They \nhave been skillful and tireless in their efforts to focus on the need \nfor a positive national strategy for youth.\n  Our goal in introducing the Younger Americans Act is to establish a \nnational policy for youth which focuses on young people, not as \nproblems, but as problem solvers. The Younger Americans Act is intended \nto create a local and nation-wide collaborative movement to provide \nprograms that offer greater support for youth in the years of \nadolescence. This bill, modeled on the very successful Older Americans \nAct of 1965, will help youths between the ages of 10 and 19. It will \nprovide assistance to communities for youths development programs that \nassure that all youth have access to the skills and character \ndevelopment needed to become good citizens.\n  In other successful bipartisan measures over the years, such as Head \nStart, child care, and the 21st century learning communities, we have \ncreated a support system for parents of preschool and younger school-\nage children. These programs reduce the risk that children will grow up \nto become juvenile delinquents by giving them a healthy and safe start. \nIt's time to do the same thing for adolescents.\n  Americans overwhelmingly believe that government should invest in \ninitiatives like this. Many studies detail the effectiveness of youth \ndevelopment programs. Beginning with the Carnegie Corporation Report in \n1992, ``A Matter of Time--Risk and Opportunity in the Nonschool \nHours,'' a series of studies have shown repeatedly that youth \ndevelopment programs at the community level produce powerful and \npositive results.\n  In this report this last March, ``Community Counts: How Youth \nOrganizations Matter for Youth Development,'' Milbrey McLaughlin, \nprofessor of education at Stanford University, calls for communities to \nrethink how they design and deliver services for youths, particularly \nduring non-school hours. The report confirms that community involvement \nis essential in creating and supporting effective programs that meet \nthe needs of today's youth.\n  Effective community-based youth development programs build on five \ncore resources that all youths need to be successful. These same core \nresources are the basis for the Younger Americans Act. Youths need \nongoing relationships with caring adults, safe places with structured \nactivities, access to services that promote healthy lifestyles, \nopportunities to acquire marketable skills, and opportunities for \ncommunity service and community participation.\n  The Younger Americans Act will establish a way for communities to \ngive thought and planning on the issues at the local level, and to \ninvolve both youths and parents in the process. The Act will provide \n$5.76 billion over the next five years for communities to conduct youth \ndevelopment programs that recognize the primary role of the family, \npromote the involvement of youth, coordinate services in the community, \nand eliminate barriers which prevent youth from obtaining the guidance \nand support they need to become successful adults. The Act also creates \na national youth policy office and a national youth council to advise \nthe President and Congress and help focus the country more effectively \non the needs of young people.\n  Too often, the focus on youth has emphasized their problems, not \ntheir successes and their potential. This emphasis has sent a negative \nmessage to youth that needs to be reversed. We need to deal with \nnegative behaviors, but we also need a broader strategy that provides a \npositive approach to youth. The Younger Americans Act will accomplish \nthis goal in three ways, by focusing national attention on the \nstrengths and contributions of youths, by providing funds to develop \npositive and cooperative youth development programs at the state and \ncommunity levels, and by promoting the involvement of parents and \nyouths in developing positive programs that strengthen families.\n  The time of adolescence is a complex transitional period of growth \nand change. We know what works. The challenge we face is to provide the \nresources to implement positive and practical programs effectively. \nInvesting in youth in ways like that will pay enormous dividends for \ncommunities and our country. I urge all members of Congress to join in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8864-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8864-S8865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL SPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Baucus) was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to amend the \nTariff Act of 1930 to eliminate disincentives to fair trade conditions.\n\n\n                                 s. 63\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kohl, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n(Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 63, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a credit against tax for \nemployers who provide child care assistance for dependents of their \nemployees, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                s. 1185\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Chair lay before \nthe Senate a message from the House of Representatives to accompany \nH.R. 2909.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of the \n     Senate to the bill, H.R. 2909, entitled ``An Act to provide \n     for implementation by the United States of the Hague \n     Convention on Protection of Children in Co-operation in \n     Respect of Intercountry Adoption, and for other purposes,'' \n     with an amendment.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Regarding the last bill that went through, I want to take \na moment to compliment a colleague of mine from Massachusetts, \nCongressman Delahunt, who has worked so hard and so diligently. It will \ngive me a great deal of pleasure to tell him it has passed. I thank my \nfriend.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that today the \nSenate is giving advice and consent to the Hague Convention on \nIntercountry Adoption, and approval to the related implementing \nlegislation.\n  The Senate's approval of these measures will send both of them to the \nPresident for his signature. This is good news for American parents \nlooking to adopt overseas, and good news for the thousands of orphaned \nchildren overseas looking for loving homes.\n  This treaty is important for a very simple reason--it will help \nfacilitate international adoptions and provide important safeguards for \nchildren and adoptive parents. It is a good thing when the government \ncan make things easier for its citizens--in this case, adoptive \nparents. An adoption is a joyous occasion, but the current system can \nbe confusing and present uncertainties.\n  The Hague Convention establishes a uniform system for adopting \nchildren from other countries--so that both adoptive parents and \nbiological parents have the assurance that an adoption is being done \nright. The Hague Convention and the implementing bill also establish \nmechanisms for improved governmental oversight for international \nadoptions--in order to guard against fraud and other problems \nassociated with such adoptions.\n  The implementing legislation is the product of compromise between a \nnumber of people--the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Helms, Senator Landrieu, Senator Brownback, and myself, and \nseveral people in the other body, including Chairman Ben Gilman, and \nRepresentative Sam Gejdenson, Bill Delahunt, and Dave Camp. None of us \ngot all that we wanted. But I believe we have a good product here. I \nwant to express my appreciation to them and their staffs for the hard \nwork that went into the drafting of this bill. Several people in the \nexecutive branch, too numerous to mention, also contributed greatly to \nthis bill.\n  Now the hard work of putting the promise of the Hague Convention into \nreality begins. The executive branch will have much to do in \nimplementing this treaty, and Congress will have a duty to oversee this \nwork closely. But today we are taking an important step for parents and \nchildren--a step about which we can all be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8866-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8866-S8868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE SESSION--TREATIES\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

105-48), which was signed by the United States, subject to \n     ratification, on December 13, 1996, referred to in this \n     resolution of ratification as ``The Convention,'' subject to \n     the understandings of subsection (a), the declarations of \n     subsection (b) and the provisos of subsection (c).\n       (a) Understandings.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     is subject to the following understandings, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification of the Convention \n     and shall be binding on the President:\n       (1) Article vi (``secretariat'').--The United States \n     understands that no permanent secretariat is established by \n     this Convention, and that nothing in the Convention obligates \n     the United States to appropriate funds for the purpose of \n     establishing a permanent secretariat now or in the future.\n       (2) Article xii (``international cooperation'').--The \n     United States understands that, upon entry into force of this \n     Convention for the United States, the United States will have \n     no binding obligation under the Convention to provide \n     additional funding or technical assistance for any of the \n     measures listed in Article XII.\n       (3) Article xiii (``financial resources'').--Bearing in \n     mind the provisions of paragraph (7), the United States \n     understands that establishment of a ``special fund,'' as \n     described in this Article, imposes no obligation on Parties \n     to participate or contribute to the fund.\n       (b) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate is \n     subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) ``No reservations'' clause.--Concerning Article XXIII, \n     it is the sense of the Senate that this ``no reservations'' \n     provision has the effect of inhibiting the Senate in its \n     exercise of its constitutional duty to give advice and \n     consent to ratification of a treaty, and the Senate's \n     approval of these treaties should not be construed as a \n     precedent for acquiescence to future treaties containing such \n     provisions.\n       (2) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification of the INF Treaty, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1998, and Condition (8) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the Document Agreed Among \n     the State Parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces \n     in Europe, approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (3) New legislation.--Existing federal legislation provides \n     sufficient legislative authority to implement United States \n     obligations under the Convention. Accordingly, no new \n     legislation is necessary in order for the United States to \n     implement the Convention. Because all species of sea turtles \n     occurring in the Western Hemisphere are listed as endangered \n     or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as \n     amended (Title 16, United States Code, Section 1536 et seq.), \n     said Act will serve as the basic authority for implementation \n     of United States obligations under the Convention.\n       (4) Articles ix and x (``monitoring programs,'' \n     ``compliance'').--The United States understands that nothing \n     in the Convention precludes the boarding, inspection or \n     arrest by United States authorities of any vessel which is \n     found within United States territory or maritime areas with \n     respect to which it exercises sovereignty, sovereign rights \n     or jurisdiction, for purposes consistent with Articles IX and \n     X of this Convention.\n       (5) It is the sense of the Senate that the entry into force \n     and implementation of this Convention in the United States \n     should not interfere with the right of waterfront property \n     owners, public or private, to use or alienate their property \n     as they see fit consistent with pre-existing domestic law.\n       (c) Provisos.--The advice and consent of the Senate is \n     subject to the following provisos:\n       (1) Report to congress.--The Secretary of State shall \n     provide to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a \n     copy of each annual report prepared by the United States in \n     accordance with Article XI of the Convention. The Secretary \n     shall include for the\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\n     Committee's information a list of ``traditional communities'' \n     exceptions which may have been declared by an party to the \n     Convention.\n       (2) Supremacy of the constitution.--Nothing in the \n     Convention requires or authorizes legislation or other action \n     by the United States of America that is prohibited by the \n     Constitution of the United States as interpreted by the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I further ask unanimous consent that any statements be \nprinted in the Congressional Record as if read, and that the Senate \ntake one vote on the resolutions of ratification to be considered as \nseparate votes. Further, that when the resolutions of ratification are \nvoted upon, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the \nPresident be notified of the Senate's action, and that following the \ndisposition of the treaties, the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The understandings to the resolutions of ratification are agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for a division vote on the resolutions of \nratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A division has been requested.\n  Senators in favor of the resolutions of ratification will rise and \nstand until counted.\n  Those opposed will rise and stand until counted.\n  On a division, two-thirds of the Senators present having voted in the \naffirmative, the resolutions of ratification are agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8868-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATION SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have now been in the Senate almost 4 \nyears. Some of the days have been extremely long, but the years have \nbeen extremely short. We work through a process here that I am sure, as \npeople watch, seems extremely slow and cumbersome. That is probably \nbecause it is. It was designed that way by our forefathers. They \nintended that legislation that affects this Nation would be carefully \nconsidered in two separate bodies and then submitted to the executive \nbranch for the possibility of a veto. That takes a long time.\n  The bodies have grown in size as a number of States came into the \nNation, and that makes it more difficult. But it is a system that works \nbetter than that in any other country in the world, and it is working \nnow. It is difficult, very difficult; long days, tough issues, tough \nchoices.\n  When I first came to the Senate, the first issue I got to talk about \nwas the balanced budget amendment. At that time, it was just a dream \nthat at some point we could get the discipline to balance a budget. It \nhad been years since a budget had been balanced around here. As we went \nthrough that debate, people said: Oh, this doesn't give us enough \nleeway. What if we would have a war? Technically, I guess, we have had \na couple since that time, and we have still balanced the budget. Not \nonly that, the economy has increased, and many will attribute that to \nthe budget being balanced. In countries around the world, as they \nbalance the budget, their economy improves. We balanced the budget, the \neconomy improved. It gave us a lot more money to work with.\n  In fact, we have so much money, we have started talking about honesty \nwith the Social Security surplus. That is music to my heart. I am the \nonly accountant in the Senate. It was pretty obvious that, with our \naccounting techniques, we were spending the Social Security surplus. \nPeople pay into Social Security, and the money that is paid in is, for \nthe most part, paid in to the recipients of Social Security. It doesn't \nreally flow into a trust fund and stay there with the portion of the \ntrust fund for the person on retirement being used. No, the money flows \nin and the money flows out. But at the moment, there are more people \nworking than receiving. As a result, there is a surplus in Social \nSecurity.\n  That is going to change pretty drastically in about 2013. At that \npoint, we are going to have more people retiring than working, and \nthere will be a deficit in Social Security. So it has been very \nimportant that we be honest on Social Security and start to put that \nSocial Security away.\n  We also tried a motion to assure that would be put away. It is called \na lockbox on Social Security. That has never passed around here--\nsimilar to the balanced budget amendment, which did not pass. But the \nAmerican people understood how important that balanced budget amendment \nwas, that the Federal Government couldn't spend money, just as they \ncannot spend more money than they have, and they insisted on a balanced \nbudget, and we got it. We talked about a lockbox. I think we had seven \ndifferent votes to end the filibuster to put that into law. It has not \nhappened. But the message has been delivered by the people of this \ncountry that we are going to put a lockbox on Social Security; we are \ngoing to put that money away; we are not going to touch it, so the \nlittle bit that there is--this is just a surplus, the money that is \nflowing in and out--will be there later.\n  One of the things we are doing with that is we are paying down the \nnational debt. You will hear a number of us around here say if you \nreally look at the accounting on this, are we paying down the national \ndebt? No, we are paying down the public national debt. We are taking \nthat money that individuals across this country have invested in \nTreasury bills and we are buying their Treasury bills back. What that \ndoes is put IOUs into the Social Security trust fund--not money. We got \nrid of the money.\n  At the moment, if you have a Treasury bill, you are paid interest \nperiodically. We have to pay the interest if the public owns the debt. \nSo what do we achieve by taking Social Security money and buying up \nthis public debt? I will tell you what we achieve. We achieve the \nability to spend more money because we do not pay Social Security \ninterest in cash at the moment that it is due. We take a little bit of \nIOU and we use it to make the Social Security trust fund a little bit \nbigger. But it is not real money. If we wanted to spend it, we would \nhave to put in money in order to take money out. How would we do that? \nWe would increase the public debt.\n  If you call the Treasury and they tell you the national debt at the \nmoment--that is, the total, public and private--\n\n[[Page S8869]]\n\nis bigger than it was a year ago, then we really have not paid off any \nof the national debt. But we have made the country a little more secure \nfor Social Security.\n  One of the things we need to do now, the new push--for some of us, \nthis is not a new push. The Presiding Officer, since he came here, has \nbeen adamant on paying down the national debt honestly. Senator Allard \nof Colorado and I got together our first year and talked about how this \ncountry ought to commit to paying down the national debt. There is not \nanybody in my State who does not understand that debts come due, and if \nwe have a debt--and we talked about having a surplus--maybe we ought to \ntake care of that debt a little bit. We put together a bill that put \nthe national debt on a system like a house payment. We figured out how \nyou could pay off the national debt in 30 years. That is about the time \nyou normally pay a house down; it works similar to a house payment.\n  You start with a fixed payment. This number still seems to be an \nawfully big number to me, but around Washington it is not a big number. \nYou just start with a measly $10 billion. You pay that $10 billion in, \nand it saves you some interest--genuinely saves you interest. What you \ndo is you take that interest that you save and, instead of spending it \nor putting phony IOUs in a box, you take that actual cash and you add \nit to the $10 billion. That is your next year's payment.\n  So each year the $10 billion grows by the amount of interest you \nsave, so that the final payment is huge--kind of the way a house \npayment works. The amount of principal that gets paid off in the 30th \nyear on your house is practically the whole payment. With some \ndiscipline and a steady plan, that is the same thing as anybody in this \ncountry does when they are buying a house: We can pay off the national \ndebt in 30 years.\n  You will hear a lot of rhetoric around here about how we might have a \nwar; what would we do? Some unusual expenditures might come up. That is \nan excuse for not paying a normal payment to pay off the debt. It is \njust an excuse. If we were really serious about paying off the national \ndebt, we would enter into that kind of agreement and then we would say: \nHere is how it works if we have a war. People who have a home sometimes \noutgrow their home, it is kind of an emergency, and they decide they \nwill add to their home a little bit.\n  What do they do? They take out a second mortgage. That is what we \nought to be doing, figuring out the lifespan of how we pay for that \nU.S. purchase and adding it to the payment so we stretch the payment \nout over a little period of time. That is money we borrowed from our \nkids. They are the ones who will have to pay that back.\n  I have to tell you, we have not gotten a single Democrat to sign onto \nthe debt reduction in any of the forms that we have proposed it.\n  This year, we tried a little different approach because the surplus \nis growing so fast that, evidently, those estimating it cannot keep up \nwith the estimations because every time there is a new estimation, it \nis greater than the one before. So what we have done in the \nappropriations bills this year is put in a little provision--in almost \nall of them, as another announcement is made of this huge new surplus--\nthat half of that surplus has to genuinely go to the national debt. We \nhave been successful in putting that in almost every bill.\n  Now we have a third plan. We are still trying to get some people in \nthis body to sign on to debt reduction. There isn't anybody in this \nbody who does not talk about the importance of debt reduction for this \ncountry. For some, that is a code word for, ``We could spend it, and we \nought to spend, and it is more fun to spend it.'' But that is not the \nright thing to do with it.\n  So we have said, OK, this year, for the fiscal year for which we are \nappropriating, we are going to have about $280 billion in surplus. The \n$280 billion is part Social Security surplus and part real surplus. But \nwe made a proposal that 90 percent of that $280 billion ought to go to \ndebt reduction--part of it the way we have been doing it with the \nSocial Security and part of it with the real money. That still leaves \nus an increase of 10 percent, which actually works out to a little more \nthan 10 percent. It is 10 percent of the surplus, but it is a bigger \nincrease in spending.\n  We have said, how about if we save that other 10 percent, and, at the \nmost, allocate half of it to tax reduction and half of it to spending? \nThat is a proposal we are still putting forth. It has a lot of \npopularity across the country. Again, people recognize the need to pay \ndown the debt, but people also realize that that puts a tremendous \nsafety mechanism in our budget process at the moment.\n  But you will not see much on that in the papers. The papers don't \ncarry debt reduction very much. People do not really carry it around as \na code word. I guess it is kind of an accounting thing. But I have to \ntell you, I travel back to Wyoming almost every weekend, and we drive \n300 to 500 miles and go to all the towns--the big ones and the little \nones--and the people out there understand it. They say: That is a top \npriority. Pay down that debt. We got into that debt. We need to get out \nof that debt. And we need to take care of our kids.\n  I mentioned the media probably will not carry much about that. I have \nnot seen it in the eastern media. I am often disturbed at what the \neastern media puts in the paper. Right now, of course, what they are \ndoing is trying to generate some interest in the political races, \nparticularly the Presidential race. The media isn't really being fair \non that issue.\n  I attended the Republican convention. That was on television, and I \nnoticed there were 48 hours of it that were broadcast across the \ncountry. Then the Democratic convention happened later in the month, \nand evidently there was not anything else happening because they got 80 \nhours. That is not quite equal time. It is nowhere near equal time. It \nis almost twice as much time.\n  I also noticed that the people covering the conventions were the same \nat both conventions, and their political colors showed. When they were \nat the Republican convention, they criticized everything. When they \nwere at the Democratic convention, they lauded everything. That does \nnot sound like United States good, old American fairness to me.\n  The closest I have seen in fairness is in today's Washington Post \neditorial, which is entitled ``Al Gore vs. Business.'' It offers us a \nglimpse of the skin-deep approach to many policies, but particularly \nhealth care policies. Those are important in this country right now.\n  We, through the media, have elevated that to a higher level than it \nhas ever been before. Even the Washington Post speculates that: ``the \ncandidate''--by candidate, they mean Vice President Gore--``plans to go \nafter, in the same vein, a different industry every day, each target \nundoubtedly poll-tested.''\n  I would like to read the closing of their editorial and then offer \nsome facts for your consideration on these health care things we are \ntalking about. This is the Washington Post. This is not me.\n\n       There are fair points to be made about the right balance \n     between free enterprise and regulation, and useful debates to \n     be had. Mr. Gore seems more intent upon telling us that he's \n     for the people, not the powerful. Given his history, the \n     slogan seems about as sincere as it is useful.\n\n  Not me--the Washington Post, that doesn't carry the stuff I really \nlike to read about. But he is going to take on a different industry.\n  I am not concerned about big industry in this country. Big industry \ncame about because of big government. If you are going to handle the \nbureaucracy, you have to have specialists. Big business has grown to \ntake care of some of the specialists needed to handle the bureaucracy. \nThe folks I am worried about are the small businesses.\n  When I first came to the Senate, again, one of the early debates we \nhad on the Small Business Committee--which is one of the really joyful \ncommittees for Wyoming because all of our businesses are small \nbusinesses--one of the first discussions we had was: What is a small \nbusiness? The Federal definition says: Under 500 employees. I guess we \ndon't have any big business in Wyoming--not one. I contend that a small \nbusiness is the one where the owner of the business sweeps the \nsidewalk, cleans the toilets, does the bookkeeping, and waits on \ncustomers.\n  In this country, if it is going to succeed, we need to get to a \nsituation\n\n[[Page S8870]]\n\nwhere that small business can deal with the bureaucracy and the forms \nand all of the things we put on them because that is where the \nentrepreneurship in this country starts. That is where the businesses \nstart.\n  One of the things we are talking about with businesses, of course, is \nhealth insurance. We are trying to encourage the businesses to provide \nhealth insurance. But at the same time, here we come up with a lot of \ncomplicated situations for how we are going to handle that, that make \nit necessary for businesses to be bigger and have specialists.\n  We are also talking about Medicare and Social Security and how we are \ngoing to keep them solvent. One of the things we are good at doing here \nis trying to outbid everything. We have a Medicare system that is going \nbroke. We have a Medicare system that everybody admits needs to be \nfixed. The President, in his State of the Union speech, mentioned the \nimportance of fixing Medicare.\n  Plans for fixing Medicare? There is a bipartisan plan. It came out of \na commission. Senator Breaux and Senator Frist headed up this \ncommission. They have a plan that will save it.\n  Are we working on that plan? No. It doesn't generate enough \npublicity. We have gone to something that is a little catchier than \nthat, and that is prescription drugs, and we are concerned about how \npeople in this country can afford their prescription drugs and how \nnobody in this country should have to make a choice between food and \nprescription drugs. There isn't anybody here who thinks that kind of a \nchoice ought to be made.\n  What kind of a plan do we have? I know of six of them among Members \nhere in this body. I know of four that are on this side. And then there \nare a couple more because in the Presidential election this has been \npoll-tested as an important feature and both candidates have a plan.\n  The Washington Post has been covering the plans. I want to show you a \nlittle bit about how they are covering it.\n  The biggest secret out there is the details of Mr. Gore's plan. But \nthe Washington Post has delved into them a little bit and given us a \nlittle bit of information. Again, this isn't what I have written. But \nthe Washington Post does give Bush some credit for detailing a Medicare \nplan. They say:\n\n       Texas Gov. George W. Bush today proposed spending $198 \n     billion to enhance Medicare over the next 10 years, including \n     covering the full cost of prescription drugs for seniors with \n     low incomes.\n       Bush's plan was modeled on a [bipartisan] proposal by Sen. \n     John Breaux (D-LA) and Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN).\n       [Bush's plan proposes] fully subsidizing people with \n     incomes less than 135 percent of the poverty level and \n     creating a sliding scale for people with slightly more money. \n     But Gore would stop the sliding scale at 150 percent of the \n     poverty level, while Bush would extend it to 175 percent.\n\n  I do appreciate them also going through the work of drawing up a \nlittle comparison and putting that in the paper. If you remember, on \nthe other side it said it was going to cost $198 billion. They did the \ncourtesy of adding up the columns for the two different proposals; the \nGore proposal, the Bush proposal. The Gore proposal shows $158 billion \nby 2010. Why did he say $198 billion on the other page? Mystery. It \nalso sounds as if he is spending an awful lot of money. When we total \nup this column, it comes to $253 billion. That is a little more than \n$158 billion.\n  They also do a comparison of how it is supposed to work. The biggest \ndifference on the two sides of this chart is how it is handled, two \ndifferent philosophies on how it is handled. One philosophy says the \nGovernment knows best. Send your money to Washington. Washington will \nhandle it.\n  On the other side, Governor Bush says, we have a lot of things in \nplace in this country, and they have been working well. Let's encourage \nthem to work better and provide for more. Let's definitely not turn \nthis thing over to HCFA.\n  HCFA is one of those acronyms we use around here. All you have to do \nis mention HCFA to any medical provider and see the grimace they get on \ntheir face. It is a system that isn't working for the things they have \nalready been assigned, and now we are talking about assigning them more \nwork.\n  Federal plan--Government knows best--as opposed to use what we have-- \ndistribute it to the States, have the States use it through the plans \nthat have been providing health care to the people already.\n\n  I will go into the details of this at another time. I hope all of you \ndo pay attention to what is being suggested out there because people \nthink there is going to be a prescription drug plan that is going to be \ndone between now and the time we adjourn this year, during this time of \nvolatile politics.\n  That isn't how we do any of the bills. That is how I started this \nout, mentioning how our process works slowly and pretty well. It goes \nthrough a committee process usually. That is where the ``bipartisan'' \nis supposed to come in. That is where both sides suggest amendments to \na good plan. But that takes time. We have limits on how long in advance \nbefore a markup, which is where they insert amendments into the bill, \nthat you have to turn these amendments in. And then often the markup, \nparticularly if it is a complicated issue, one as far reaching as \nprescription drugs, might take several different days of working \nthrough the amendments, meeting and compromising and trying to come up \nwith the plan that will work best for our country.\n  That is where we need to go now. We need to have that process; we \nneed to do that process. We should not latch on to any particular plan \nthat is out there, unless, of course, we do the one that came out of \nthe commission, that evolved in a bipartisan way over a long process. \nBut that is not going to happen when the two sides have two plans.\n  I know the hour is getting late. I have already done my part on an \neducation program. I want to emphasize, again, we need to pay down the \nnational debt. I want to emphasize, again, the need to have a \nprescription drug plan for this country but to have the right one, not \na flash-in-the-pan program, particularly not one that takes people who \nalready have a prescription benefit and shoves them into a Federal plan \nagainst their will, taking away the right to choose that they have now. \nI hope we have a situation where we can work together and come up with \na plan where those who are happy with their situation can continue to \ndo it that way, and those who aren't can have a new opportunity.\n  That is a commitment Governor Bush has already made. He has outlined \nthe plan. He has a plan. He has a policy. We are a little short on \npolicies around here, but it is something that could be worked through.\n  One of the things I was impressed with when he became the Governor of \nTexas was the legislature was Democrat. He was Republican. He sat down \nwith each and every legislator, face to face, one on one, and talked \nabout what needed to be done for Texas. Then they did it.\n  Every time a new President is elected, I grab a biography that \nparticular President likes and I read it. One of the things I found is \nthat people repeat successes. I am sure the next President will be no \ndifferent than any other President. If it is Governor Bush, I expect \nthe opportunity to sit down with him--I look forward to it--face to \nface, one on one, and talk about the things that I see as necessary for \nthis country and that he sees as necessary for this country. But more \nimportantly, he will sit down with the people on the other side of the \naisle.\n  One of the things we are missing in this country right now is more of \na bipartisan effort, that time of sitting down and working things out. \nThat is how it starts, with the leadership, with the President. I will \nbe expecting him to visit with each and every person here and all 435 \non the other end of this building. A tremendous effort? Absolutely. It \nis the most essential thing I can think of. It is the way to get things \ndone in a bipartisan manner. That is how we will get a prescription \ndrug plan. That is how we will improve the medical plans we already \nhave in this country that are recognized internationally as being some \nof the best.\n  One of the great things about America is that we say we have the \nbest, but we are always looking for ways to make it better. That is how \nour economy works. That is how the Government works. That is how free \nenterprise works.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/20/senate-section/article/S8870-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
