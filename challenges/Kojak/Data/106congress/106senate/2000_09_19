Under the previous order, there will now be 90 \nminutes of debate under the control of each leader.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Daschle, I yield 5 \nminutes to Senator Lautenberg and 5 minutes to Senator Murray when \nSenator DeWine completes his remarks.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I yield \nmyself 30 minutes. I candidly don't expect to take 30 minutes. For \nthose Senators who wish to speak after me, it will probably be a \nshorter period of time than 30 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the legislation before us--\nH.R. 4444, the legislation extending Permanent Normal Trading Relations \nto the People's Republic of China or PNTR. As we approach's today's \nfinal vote, I want to make it clear that I believe strongly in free and \nfair trade. And, I support efforts aimed at increasing free and fair \ntrade with China. However, as we approach the vote, I think we must \ntake a few minutes and try to put the current debate into its proper \nperspective. That is what I intend to do.\n  Passing PNTR will result in lower trade barriers and more U.S. sales \nto China. We know that. But, the extent of our increased sales will \ndepend on factors beyond our control. Our ability to send more exports \nto China depends largely on China's continued economic growth, its \ncompliance with the bilateral agreement, and its development of a \nmiddle-class.\n  While increasing trade with China certainly is important, we must put \nthis current debate into its proper context. We need to view this \ndebate as it relates to both our worldwide trade policy and to our \nforeign policy and national security interests. With this broader \nperspective in mind, it becomes very clear that passing the PNTR \nlegislation is just one part of our overall relationship with China and \none part of our overall global trade policy. There remain other \npressing foreign policy issues and other trade issues that await our \nnext President, the next Congress, and the American people. Let me \nexplain.\n  The fact is, as we all know, the United States is a leader in the \narea of free trade. If we fail to pass the PNTR legislation, we would \nbe sending a signal to the world that the United States wants to \nisolate China. That's a signal we don't want to send. Both by word and \ndeed, the United States must be the world's leader in promoting free \ntrade. At the same time, though, we also don't want to send China--and \nthe\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\nworld--a signal that we will tolerate the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction--a practice China engages in openly.\n  In terms of our overall trade policy, we also cannot send a signal to \nour neighbors in the Western Hemisphere that says we are only \ninterested in concentrating on the Chinese market. Since so much time \nand energy and resources has been directed to liberalizing trade in \nChina, it may be a surprise to some that China represents only two \npercent of our foreign sales.\n  To keep it in proper perspective, there was no one who estimates that \npercentage will go beyond 2\\1/2\\ or 3 percent in the immediate future. \nTwo percent of our total foreign markets is only $13 billion in U.S. \nsales to China.\n  Now, compare that to markets closer to home. Last year, Canada was \nour number one export destination, with $167 billion in U.S. sales, \nwhile Mexico was our second largest export market with $87 billion in \nsales. Further, our exports to Brazil ($13.2 billion) last year \nexceeded our sales to China. And what's more, forty-four percent of our \nexports remained right here in our own hemisphere.\n  Those $13 billion in sales to China pale in comparison to trade \nwithin our hemisphere. Yet, the Administration and the business \ncommunity have made granting PNTR to China their single-minded trade \nfocus. This narrow agenda has not come without cost.\n  Because the Administration has not emphasized expanding free trade in \nour hemisphere, other nations are taking the lead in seizing the \neconomic opportunities that are right in our backyard. Our inaction in \nthis hemisphere has essentially made it easier for Europe, Asia, and \nCanada to significantly expand their exports throughout Latin America. \nThe European Union (EU), for example, is now Brazil's largest trading \npartner. The EU's exports to Brazil have grown 255 percent from 1990 to \n1998.\n  Additionally, during that same period, Asia experienced an incredible \n1664 percent increase in its growth of exports to Argentina.\n  The next administration and the business community need to pay \nattention to our own hemisphere. That means that the next \nadministration and the next Congress need to pass fast-track trading \nauthority and move toward a hemispheric free trade area. It is \nimperative that we do this. That means that we will need to expand the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, which, over this last decade, has \nadvanced economic cooperation and growth between the United States and \nMexico, increasing U.S. exports to Mexico by 207 percent. And, that \nmeans that we must abandon this very narrow focus with which the \ncurrent administration has viewed trade policy and start widening the \nlens to be more inclusive of the markets right here in our own \nbackyard. This is significant unfinished business that our next \nPresident and our next Congress and the American people will have to \naddress.\n  But, even more significant in terms of our unfinished business are \nthe considerable national security issues at stake regarding our \noverall relationship with China. I say that because this is China we \nare talking about. China is different. China, as my colleagues all \nknow, is unlike any other country in the world. China is a major \npower--a nuclear power--and China is the world's major proliferator of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Sadly, this administration has failed to stop the Chinese \ngovernment's weapons proliferation. Sadly, this administration has not \ndemonstrated the kind of leadership necessary to prevent China from \nmanufacturing and selling weapons technology worldwide.\n  Like the United States, China is a co-signator of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, yet over the last decade, its government has \nviolated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty willingly, openly, and \negregiously. Their actions are well documented. For example, Washington \nTimes National Security reporter, Bill Gertz, writes in his recent \nbook:\n\n       [f]or at least a decade, China has routinely carried out \n     covert weapons and technology sales to the Middle East and \n     South Asia, despite hollow promises to the contrary.\n\n  The PRC has shown no remorse for its past actions--and certainly no \ninclination to change them. Rather, China has flaunted--openly--its \nviolations.\n  At the beginning of the last decade, Pakistan was believed to possess \na very modest nuclear weapons program--one that was inferior to \nIndia's program. Our own laws effectively banned U.S. government \nassistance to Pakistan because of its decision to go nuclear, and our \nsanctions laws contained tough penalties for any nation attempting to \nfeed Pakistan's nuclear hunger.\n\n  That was then. Today, China has single-handedly worked to change the \nbalance of power in South Asia and, in turn, has made the region far \nmore different and far more dangerous.\n  Today, according to news reports, Pakistan possesses more weapons \nthan India and has a better capability to deliver them. President \nClinton stated earlier this year that South Asia has now become the \nmost dangerous place in the world. We have China to thank for that.\n  The significant change in the balance of power between Pakistan and \nIndia was engineered by China, which provided Pakistan with critical \ntechnology to enrich and mold uranium, M-11 missile equipment and \ntechnology, and expertise and equipment to enable Pakistan to have its \nown missile production capability.\n  What has this Administration done to change this behavior? \nEssentially nothing. Time after time, as reporters, like Bill Gertz, \nuncovered extraordinary information on proliferation activities, this \nAdministration failed to impose even the mildest sanctions against \nChina as required by law. For example, in 1995, at the same time this \nAdministration was aware of China's transfer of sensitive nuclear \ntechnology to Pakistan, the Administration was seeking to weaken our \nnon-proliferation laws against Pakistan. And, rather than aggressively \nuse the sanctions laws on the books to try to bring about a change in \nChina's behavior, this Administration sought to find ways to show it \nhad reached a common understanding with China to prohibit these \nactivities and thus avoid sanctions.\n  However, according to the Central Intelligence Agency's unclassified \nbi-annual report to Congress on the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, China remained a ``key supplier'' last year of weapons and \nmissile assistance to Pakistan.\n  In the Middle East, it's the same story. News reports have documented \nChina's contributions to Iran's nuclear development and ballistic and \ncruise missile programs, including anti-ship missiles that are a threat \nto our naval presence and commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. \nFurther, the CIA's bi-annual report also confirmed that Chinese \ngovernment multi-nationals are assisting the Libyan government in \nbuilding a more advanced missile program.\n\n  As it stands, international rules of conduct and pledges to our \ngovernment to forego its proliferation activity have not deterred \nChina's arms-building practices. Further, this administration has not \nenforced U.S. non-proliferation laws adequately nor effectively. The \nChinese government certainly does not take our government seriously on \nthe question of weapons proliferation--and frankly, why should they? \nThe current Administration hasn't been a leader in encouraging nations \nto honor international non-proliferation agreements. Consequently, \nweapons of mass destruction are in more questionable hands than ever \nbefore.\n  Last year, a bipartisan commission headed by former CIA Director, \nJohn Deutch, concluded that our Federal Government is not equipped to \nfight nuclear proliferation. What does that say about our international \ncredibility? What does that say about our ability to prevent the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction? What it says is that our \ndiminished credibility may oblige other countries who are adversaries \nof Pakistan, Iran, and Libya to build their own weapons capabilities to \ncounter these emerging threats.\n  In simple terms, the current administration has not led on these \nproliferation issues. That is why we should have passed Senator \nThompson's amendment last week.\n  The Thompson amendment was important because it would have given us \nthe ability to hold the People's Republic of China, and any nation, \naccountable for proliferating weapons of mass destruction and the means \nto deliver them. The bottom line is that if we are\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\ngoing to sacrifice our annual review of normal trade relations with \nChina, then our next President and the next Congress will need new \ntools to pursue our national security objectives. Candidly, the next \nPresident will also have to use the tools that we have now given him.\n  So, where are we? When we put this whole debate in perspective--when \nwe put the debate into its proper economic and national security \ncontexts--where does this leave us? Realistically, approval of PNTR \ndoes not change the disagreements we have with China on weapons \nproliferation. It certainly will not change China's behavior. China \nwill continue to proliferate. China will continue to pursue policies \nthat will destabilize two critical regions of the world, placing our \nsoldiers and our allies in serious danger.\n  Now that we are about to pass this legislation--now that we are about \nto advance our free trade policy--what do we intend to do to advance \nour non-proliferation policy and our own national security? Does this \nAdministration have an answer? No, I do not think they do. Quite \ncandidly, they never have.\n\n  We need an answer. And, from the vantage point of our national \nsecurity strategy, I believe that if we fail to show vigilance in the \nenforcement of non-proliferation policy, we will place this nation at a \nterrible disadvantage. If we fail to show vigilance, we will \neffectively continue a de facto policy that has worked to undermine our \nnational non-proliferation policy and is working to make our world a \nmore dangerous place.\n  Had this administration pursued a non-proliferation policy with the \nsame amount of intensity, creativity, and vigor it showed in advancing \nour commercial relationship with China, this would have been a far \neasier vote to cast.\n  Had the Senate done the right thing and adopted the Thompson \namendment, that too would have made today's vote easier to cast.\n  I fear if we do not act soon to change the current course of our \nweapons proliferation policy--if we do not revisit the Thompson \namendment, and we will revisit the Thompson amendment--we will be \nsending a signal to China and to the world that says our trade \ninterests are more important than the security of our Nation, more \nimportant than the security of our children and grandchildren.\n  I intend to vote for the PNTR legislation before us because I believe \nstrongly in the power of fair and free trade.\n  The United States has been the world's most outspoken advocate for \nfree trade. We are the world's free trade leader. We believe free trade \nis a cornerstone of a free society and a free people. We believe it can \nbe a step toward helping closed nations become open and democratic. No \none here can say with certainty that it will work in China, but as the \nworld's leader in free trade, I believe we have to try.\n  With this vote today, we are keeping our word as that leader, and we \nare moving forward. To do otherwise, to go back on the agreement this \ncountry negotiated last November, would send the wrong message to the \nworld. It would say that the United States cannot be counted on to \npractice what we preach, and the implications of that message will \nextend far beyond our ability to negotiate trade agreements with China. \nA message such as that will affect our credibility worldwide.\n  Further, I have concluded that a ``no'' vote will do nothing to wean \nChina from its weapons-building addiction. But that is why we must not \nstop here with today's vote. We should move forward and show clear \nleadership and clear direction in regard to our nonproliferation \npolicy.\n  With this vote, I pledge to work with our next President to change \nthe current state of affairs and to work toward maintaining our place \nas the world's model for free and fair trade. I will continue to push \nfor free trade opportunities, both within and beyond our hemisphere. \nMuch more important, I also pledge to work toward making our world a \nsafer and more secure place for our children, our grandchildren, and \nour great grandchildren. I will continue to insist that China and other \nweapons-proliferating nations abide by international agreements, and I \nwill continue to insist again, again, and again that our Nation take \nthe lead in this area.\n  This is not the last time I will be on this floor talking about the \nproblems with China. This Senate will regret if we do not return to \nthis issue. The Thompson amendment will come back, and we will insist \nthat it be voted on. This country has to stand strong and firm against \nChina and their proliferation policies. Their proliferation policies \nthreaten the security of our children and our grandchildren, and we \nwill ignore their actions at our peril.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my Senate colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations \nstatus to China. This is about moving China in the right direction, and \nin the process allowing America's workers to benefit from the massive \ntrade concessions we have won at the negotiating table.\n  This is a critical vote. China is home to one out of every five \npeople on the planet, and our relationship with China is important. \nThis vote can also have a positive impact on regional relationships \nthroughout Asia. That is because Taiwan and Asian nations like Japan \nsupport China's accession to the World Trade Organization. They know \nthat China's engagement will be a positive development. If Congress \nfails to grant PNTR to China, we will hinder our broader relationship \nwith that country, make it harder for us to promote change there, and \ndamage America's workers and industries as they compete with other \ncountries for a place in China's market. The Chinese have agreed to \nradically open their market to U.S. goods and services. Chinese trade \nconcessions will benefit the United States across all economic sectors \nin virtually every region of our country. And, the changes China has \ncommitted itself to--in order to join the WTO--will further open China \nto Western ideas.\n  I have come to the floor today to illustrate the ways that PNTR for \nChina will help our families, our industries, and our economy. \nWashington State is the most trade-dependent State in our Union. The \npeople of my state--from aerospace workers to wheat farmers to \nlongshoremen--have urged me to make sure we take advantage of the \nconcessions we have won from the Chinese. If we do not, good-paying \nfamily jobs will be lost, and our industries will be set back for \nyears.\n  Before I elaborate on the ways PNTR for China will help America's \nworkers, I must address many of the concerns we have about China. Over \nthe years, I, like my colleagues, have been frustrated by the actions \nof the Chinese government on issues like human rights, religious \nfreedom and weapons proliferation. As I have listened to the debate it \nis clear that we all want the same things: We want the people of China \nto have more freedom and more opportunities, and we want to bring China \ninto the community of nations as a responsible partner. We all want the \nsame results. The question is: What is the best way to get there? It is \nnot to politicize our trade agreements. It is not to turn a trade vote \ninto a referendum on how we feel about China. That is why I oppose the \namendments that my colleagues have offered. These amendments will not \nsolve the problems they highlight.\n  Instead, they will kill the bill for this Congress and perhaps longer \nand that will have a negative impact on our country. Killing this bill \nwill do serious harm to our efforts to impact change in China on many \nissues. Killing this bill now will forever handicap U.S. exporters to \nChina. It will punish U.S. workers, and it will give our competitors \nfrom Europe and Asia a massive head start as China opens its market to \nthe world.\n  As I have thought about our relationship with China, I think one of \nthe things that really frustrates us is that we are accustomed to quick \nfixes. In our political culture, we expect to be able to fix problems \novernight. China, on the other hand, has a far different culture. \nThroughout its 4000 year history, China has resisted outside \ninfluences. As much as we would like to, we can't change China \novernight. But we can change China over time. PNTR gives us the vehicle \nto help China move into the community of nations and to benefit \nAmerica's families, industries and economy in the process.\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\n  Now that I have addressed the expectations and context surrounding \nour relationship with China, I want to return to the question I posed a \nmoment ago: What is the best way to help China enter the community of \nnations? The answer is to engage with China. In fact, our own history \nhas shown this to be true. Since 1980, when the United States \nnormalized relations with China, our engagement has helped to change \nChina for the better. I think it is useful to recall the history of how \ndifferent China is today, than it was just 20 years ago. Before we \nnormalized our relations, the Chinese people lived under the iron fist \nof their government. They enjoyed virtually no personal freedoms. Their \njobs were predetermined. Their housing was assigned to them. Education, \nmedical care, and travel were all dictated by a government-controlled \nsystem that rewarded blind loyalty to the state and harshly punished \nall dissent. Externally, China was closed to the outside world. \nInternally, China was hemorrhaging from the impact of the Cultural \nRevolution and other political conflicts. U.S. engagement with China \nhas had a positive impact on that country. Certainly, we all want to \nsee more progress and more changes in Chinese government behavior. I \nrespect the concerns of my colleagues, but I recognize that we are \nmaking progress by engaging with China. We should not let our specific \nconcerns override the many advantages that will flow to America's \nworkers by supporting PNTR for China.\n  After considering the cultural and historic issues that have factored \ninto this debate, I would like to focus on what this vote is about. The \nquestion before the Senate is really quite simple. The United States \nnegotiated a trade deal with China. The agreement radically opens \nChina's market to American workers, forces China to end its unfair \npractices, and gives the United States tough mechanisms to hold China \naccountable. The question before the Senate is: do we want to take this \ndeal?\n  On behalf of my constituents and the American people, I will vote to \nput these Chinese concessions--literally thousands of market-opening \nconcessions--to work for the benefit of our country. The Chinese \nconcessions are far reaching and will impact every sector of our \nnation's economy and every region of our country. This agreement \nradically slashes tariffs. In fact, for some of our most important \nindustries, it eliminates tariffs altogether. It preserves and in some \ncases strengthens our trade laws on issues like dumping, export \ncontrols, and the use of prison labor. China will no longer be able to \nrequire firms to transfer technologies and jobs to China in exchange \nfor business. If China violates its commitments, it will have the 135 \nmember countries of the WTO to contend with--rather than just the \nUnited States. This is an opportunity to build a strong presence in the \nworld's largest emerging market just as it opens its doors to the \nworld.\n  The people of Washington State have a unique perspective on what this \ntrade agreement will mean for our families, our industries and our \neconomy. One of my predecessors, Senator Warren Magnusson, was one of \nthe first Senators to call for closer U.S.-China ties in the 1970s. For \nmore than 20 years, the entire period of China's most recent opening to \nthe outside world, no other state has been as engaged with China and \nthe Chinese people as extensively as my state has. Washington State is \nthe most trade dependent state in the country. Soon, one in three jobs \nwill rely on international trade. Our ports, rail yards, and airports \nserve as gateways to and from the Pacific Rim for millions of products. \nMy entire state stands to gain a great deal from China's accession to \nthe WTO.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues how increased trade with \nChina will affect three important Washington industries: aerospace, \nagriculture, and technology. Let me begin by talking about our \naerospace industry because Washington state produces the finest \ncommercial airplanes in the world. We are home to the Boeing Company, \nand thousands of Washington families work for Boeing. As my colleagues \nknow, Boeing competes with Airbus, its European rival. But the playing \nfield isn't level. Airbus is subsidized by European states, and it gets \nadditional financing assistance, allowing Airbus customers to finance \naircraft on favorable terms. China is a huge new market for airplanes. \nAviation experts predict China will purchase 1,600 new commercial \nairplanes worth $120 billion in the next 20 years. These sales will be \nhotly contested. We know that Airbus is a very aggressive competitor in \nthe China market. Passing PNTR will give the workers in my state the \nchance to compete in that marketplace. Thousands of Washington state \njobs--good family jobs, good union jobs--hang in the balance as Boeing \nand Airbus fight for the China market. That is why organized labor at \nBoeing, Local 751 of the International Association of Machinists and \nAerospace Workers, has publicly endorsed PNTR. The Boeing Machinists \nknow that if we do not compete for aircraft sales in China, we will \nhave ceded the largest marketplace in the world for commercial aircraft \noutside of the United States. Such an outcome would be disastrous for \nthe future of our aerospace industry, and we're not just talking about \none company or one industry. Thousands of small businesses in \nWashington state subcontract with Boeing. In addition, Boeing \nsubcontracts in every state in the union--creating the jobs that \nworking families rely on. Passage of PNTR will give Boeing and so many \nother American companies the opportunity to compete freely and fairly \nin China. I have every confidence that Boeing and the thousands of \nAmericans whose jobs are tied to aerospace will succeed in this new \nenvironment. Mr. President, let me turn to another important industry \nin my state.\n  Washington State is home to some of our country's finest agricultural \nproducts from wheat to apples to a host of specialty crops. But we've \nhad trouble opening China's market to our exports. For more than 25 \nyears, Washington wheat has been kept out of China by an unfair trade \nbarrier. This year, as China neared membership in the World Trade \nOrganization, it dropped its unfair trade barrier against wheat from \nthe Pacific Northwest. As a result, this year, Washington's first wheat \nsale to China in 28 years recently sailed from the Port of Portland.\n  Thanks to PNTR and WTO accession, my constituents will have new \nopportunities to feed China's population, which equals 20 percent of \nthe world's population. The opportunities are also great for another \nmajor crop, Washington state apples. With this agreement, \nChina's market could open to an estimated $75 million a year in \nbusiness for Washington's apple growers. Overall, agriculture stands to \nsee one-third of its export growth tied to new sales to China. \nWashington growers and producers will see new opportunities across the \nboard from pork, potatoes and barley to specialty crops like \nraspberries, hops and asparagus. It is easy to see why the agriculture \ncommunity has been such a strong voice for this U.S.-China agreement \nand PNTR. Agriculture has done a great job working to ensure members \nunderstand that this agreement, and PNTR is vitally important to \nAmerican agriculture.\n\n  Finally I want to turn to America's high-tech industries. I am proud \nthat Washington State is home to Microsoft and other technology \ncompanies including Nintendo, Real Networks, and Amazon.com. These \ncompanies will benefit from new protections for U.S. intellectual \nproperty. They will benefit from the elimination of high tech tariffs, \nfrom anti-dumping protections, and from the right to import and \ndistribute goods free from government regulation and interference. The \nInternet is taking hold in China. It holds immense potential for \nchanging China's society. Thanks to this agreement, Washington State \nInternet companies will be aggressive competitors in this new market. \nIn addition, America's telecommunications companies will benefit as \nwell, including AT Wireless and VoiceStream Wireless, which are both \nbased in Washington State.\n  As I have shown, opening China's markets will help the thousands of \npeople in my state who work in the aerospace, agriculture and \ntechnology industries. We should make sure America's workers have \naccess to the many benefits of China's marketplace. After 20 years of \nnormalized relations between the U.S. and China, now is the time to \npass PNTR. After 13 years of tough negotiations between the United \nStates and China, now is the time to\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\npass PNTR. And after more than 10 years of congressional consideration \nof China's trade status, now is the time to pass PNTR. The Senate has \njust spent two weeks debating PNTR, China's accession to the World \nTrade Organization, and many other China issues. The heart of the \nquestion before us is: Do we want American workers to benefit from the \nenormous trade concessions we have won from the Chinese? I want America \nto benefit, and I will vote for PNTR. At the same time, this is not our \nfinal China vote. Congress has a very legitimate role to play in \nhelping shape our relationship with China and addressing our concerns. \nI look forward to those debates and those opportunities to advance our \nideals in China. I encourage my colleagues to vote for PNTR, and I urge \nmy colleagues to continue to closely follow the important U.S.-China \nrelationship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield from Senator Daschle's time 10 \nminutes to Senator Hollings when Senator Lautenberg completes his 8 \nminutes. Senator Daschle has given Senator Lautenberg 3 minutes to his \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have had an invigorating debate on a \nvery important and complex issue--whether to grant permanent normal \ntrade relations, PNTR, status to China. There are many aspects to this \ndebate: expansion and regulation of the international trading system; \nrealignment of the US position within that system; review of China's \ninternal policies--in particular its human rights record; assessment of \nthe prospect for constructive and systemic change in China; and the \neffect of PNTR upon U.S. businesses and consumers.\n  As many of my colleagues may remember, 2 months ago in the Finance \nCommittee I cast the sole vote in opposition to granting PNTR to China. \nAlthough I believe in engagement with China, not isolating China, I \nfelt strongly that I could not in good conscience vote to make this \nstatus permanent at that time. I told my colleagues about Ngawang \nChoephel, a Fulbright student from Middlebury College in Vermont, who \nwas arrested by Chinese authorities while filming traditional song and \ndance in Tibet in 1995. Intent only on preserving traditional Tibetan \nmusic, Ngawang was charged with espionage and sentenced to 18 years in \nprison. I strongly protested his arrest and incarceration, together \nwith the other Members of the Vermont delegation, the administration, \nand human rights supporters all over the world.\n  For 5 years, we received virtually no information on Ngawang's \nwhereabouts and his condition. In spite of a Chinese law guaranteeing \nevery prisoner the right to receive regular visits from next of kin, \nChinese officials ignored the repeated pleas from Ngawang's mother, \nSonam Dekyi, to visit him. During Finance Committee discussion of the \nPNTR legislation, I made clear my anger over the Chinese Government's \nunconscionable refusal to adhere to its own laws. I am pleased to \nreport that a couple weeks later, the Chinese Ambassador to the United \nStates called to inform me that Sonam Dekyi would be granted permission \nto visit her son. I thank my many colleagues who raised this case with \nthe Chinese, and I particularly thank the Chinese Ambassador for his \nefforts on Sonam Dekyi's behalf.\n  Last month, Sonam Dekyi and her brother traveled to China to see \nNgawang Choephel. They were treated very well and were allowed two \nvisits with Ngawang. In addition, they had a meeting with the doctors \nat a nearby hospital who recently have treated Ngawang for several very \nserious illnesses. While Sonam Dekyi was very appreciative of the \nchance to see her son, she was disappointed to be granted only two \nvisits and quite saddened to be denied her request just to touch her \nson after all these years. Most alarmingly, she found her son to be in \nvery poor health. Despite receiving medical attention, he is very gaunt \nand reported ongoing pains in his chest and stomach. His mother fears \nfor his life.\n\n  I fervently hope that in the wake of his mother's visit, greater \nattention will be paid to Ngawang's health, and that every effort will \nbe made by Chinese medical personnel to treat his illnesses. However, I \nbelieve that the only solution to his health condition is medical \nparole. Ngawang needs extensive treatment and considerable \nrehabilitation. This cannot be accomplished under the harsh conditions \nof prison, especially a Chinese prison.\n  On humanitarian grounds, I appeal to the Chinese authorities to \nrelease Ngawang Choephel. This is the right thing to do, the decent \nthing to do, the human thing to do. Until Ngawang Choephel is released, \nI cannot in good conscience vote for PNTR. I urge the Chinese \nauthorities to recognize the length of time Ngawang has already spent \nin prison and to move now before his 18 year sentence becomes a death \nsentence. I urge the immediate release of Ngawang Choephel.\n  I have not come to this position of opposition to PNTR easily. For \nthe past 10 years, I have supported engagement with China and renewal \nof most favored nation status. The benefits of international trade for \nthe Vermont economy are very clear, and Vermont businesses have proved \nvery resourceful at developing high paying and desirable jobs for \nVermonters. In 1989, in the wake of the Tiananmen Square uprising, this \nwas a particularly tough position. It was difficult to know how to \nchannel my profound outrage over Chinese behavior and how to bring \nabout the greatest degree of change in the shortest period of time. \nAfter considerable research and much discussion with people holding \nmany points of view, I concluded that change in China would be most \nrapid if the channels of communication were open to the rest of the \nworld. Engagement with China on all fronts, including economic \nengagement, is going to be necessary to produce the long-term, systemic \nchange required for expression of personal freedom and personal \ninitiative.\n\n  The past decade has proven that change is slow and difficult. But \nthere is progress, nonetheless. The reformers in the Chinese hierarchy \nare now pushing for membership in the World Trade Organization, WTO. \nThey wish to be part of the global trading system and to open their \ncountry and their economy to international investment and influences. \nWhile there are some significant problems with the WTO system that need \nto be addressed, I am convinced that we must be a part of that system \nand we must exert a strong influence on its development. Our national \ninterests are best served if all major economies are a part of this \nsystem, agree to play by the same rules, and are subject to the same \nenforcement mechanisms if they do not.\n  We have a very strong interest in encouraging diversification and \ndecentralization in the Chinese economy and greater freedom of \nexpression for Chinese citizens. The less citizens are dependent \ndirectly on the government for their jobs and housing, the more likely \nthey are to get involved in local issues, to advocate for causes that \nconcern them, to develop advocacy and democracy at the grass roots. In \nthe long run, I believe this is also the best way to improve the human \nrights situation. It will take time. It will be incremental. Chinese \nsociety will never look just like American society, but hopefully it \nwill be reconfigured more to the advantage of the average Chinese \ncitizen.\n  Today, my overwhelming concern is for a young man who committed his \nlife to the preservation of his own musical heritage. He found shelter \nin the green mountains of Vermont, even though his heart always lay in \nthe rugged mountains of his homeland. Ngawang touched many Vermonters \nwith his quiet manner and intensity of purpose. Vermont will not forget \nNgawang Choephel. I have not forgotten Ngawang Choephel. I will not \nvote for PNTR until he is free.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will my colleague yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Sure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the \nproper order of speakers, after Senator Lautenberg and Senator Hollings \nand a Republican Senator are recognized to speak, I then be recognized \nto speak for 10 minutes of my leader's time.\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the United States is now considering a \nbill authorizing the President to grant Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations to the People's Republic of China when that country joins the \nWorld Trade Organization. This can radically improve our relationship \nwith the world's most populous country.\n  There is so much at stake, in my view. That is why I traveled last \nmonth to China to meet with China's leadership and some of its people, \nto see for myself what is happening in China, and to ensure that I make \na well-informed decision on this day.\n  Some of what I saw, quite frankly, disturbed me. But I also saw and \nheard encouraging things that gave me hope about China's future. And I \nhave concluded that the best way to promote positive change in China is \nto grant China permanent normal trade relations status.\n  Many Americans, including environmental activists and members of \norganized labor and human rights groups, believe this vote is about far \nmore than trade. And I agree. We cannot consider trade policy without \nunderstanding the implications for the economy, our society, and the \nenvironment in America and the world.\n  Moreover, the granting of PNTR would eliminate the annual debate over \ngranting normal trade relations, which we used to call MFN, to China. \nThat annual debate allowed us to review all aspects of our relationship \nwith China and developments in that country. Successive administrations \nand Congresses achieved progress on issues of importance to Americans \nby raising them in the context of that annual review.\n  This time, however, we are not merely considering whether China has \nmade sufficient progress in economic, social, environmental and human \nrights reforms to merit extending the opening of our market--China's \nlargest export market--for another year. Rather, we are considering \nwhether China is on a firm enough course of progress that we can \njustify an act of faith and open our market permanently as China joins \nthe WTO and substantially opens its markets to American goods and \nservices.\n  That is why I traveled to China a few weeks ago, joined by my good \nfriend the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  I went so I could better understand China and raise my concerns with \nChina's leaders about human rights, labor conditions, national security \nand the environment. I went to see for myself the condition of China's \ncities and rural areas, to compare the wealthy coast and the \nunderdeveloped interior, to talk to garment workers and farmers, to \nassess the extent of freedom of religion and freedom of speech, to \nmeasure progress on human rights protection and environmental \nprotection, and to look into the proliferation of weapons and the \nintimidation of Taiwan, to consider the abuse of power and the rule of \nlaw.\n  China presented a very mixed picture. The patriotic Catholic Bishop \nin Shanghai, Bishop Jin, expressed it well when he said, ``China is \nvery complicated.''\n  One thing was obvious: China is undergoing a tremendous \ntransformation as a result of Deng Xiaoping's 1978 decision to open \nChina to the world. The past two decades have seen the rise of free \nenterprise and international trade, and many of the Chinese people have \nexperienced a dramatic improvement in their standard of living. China's \nGDP growth, while surely lower than official estimates, has averaged \nmore than 6 percent over the past two decades and remains strong \ndespite the impact of the Asian financial crisis. China's economic \ndevelopment is amazing, particularly in the modern city of Shanghai.\n\n  I would like to speak briefly about some of the issues I raised with \nChina's leaders and that will need to be addressed as we proceed in our \nstrengthened relationship with China.\n  We have to consider the national security aspects of the U.S.-China \nrelationship. The United States and China are not natural or historic \nenemies. But serious problems and tensions exist.\n  One key issue is China's proliferation of technologies and materials \nfor missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Earlier this year, the \nCIA reported on China's continuing missile-related aid to Pakistan, \nIran, North Korea and Libya, as well as nuclear cooperation with Iran \nand contributions to Iran's chemical weapons program. These \nrelationships are not in China's interest and directly threaten U.S. \ninterests.\n  When I raised this issue, Vice Premier Qian Qichen acknowledged that \nChina provided missile assistance to Pakistan in the past but insisted \nit had not done so in recent years. Premier Zhu Rongji dismissed my \nconcerns and demanded evidence of China's proliferation activities. Of \ncourse, China has not accepted the key Annex to the Missile Technology \nControl Regime. I hope China will acknowledge its past mistakes and \nfully commit itself to international non-proliferation efforts.\n  U.S. officials have made progress in addressing Chinese proliferation \nover the years. For example, they secured China's commitment not to \nhelp Iran develop new nuclear projects. But we must do more.\n  The United States and China have a common interest in ending the \ndestabilizing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the \nmissiles to deliver them. We have to improve cooperation toward that \ncritical goal.\n  A second national security issue concerns Taiwan. Wang Daohan, the \nChinese official who conducts the Cross-Straits Dialogue for the \nMainland and influences China's policy toward Taiwan, stressed to us \nthat Beijing is willing to give Taiwan considerable autonomy if Taipei \naccepts the ``One China'' policy and supports reunification. I am not \nconvinced that making Taipei's acceptance of the ``One China'' policy a \npre-condition for talks is a constructive approach.\n  I hope that China will withdraw its missiles that are only directed \nat Taiwan, because these threaten an arms race over Taiwan. As I told \nMr. Wang, if you're extending a hand of peace it cannot be clenched \ninto an iron fist.\n  We also need to consider protection for human rights and the rule of \nlaw in China. Fortunately, the House addressed these issues \nconstructively in the bill before us by providing for an annual review \nof human rights in China. The bill before us also rightly authorizes \nU.S. assistance for rule of law programs in China. I know that the Ford \nFoundation and other private groups are supporting rule of law efforts \nin China. We should be prepared to put some of our resources toward \nachieving this worthy, if long-term, goal.\n  On the whole, we have to acknowledge that China has made some \nprogress on human rights, though it still has a long way to go.\n  The limited ability of the Chinese people to have freedom of religion \nis a very real concern. The Chinese people, many of whom recognize the \nvacuousness of Marxist and Maoist rhetoric, are unsatisfied with their \ndaily lives and seek a higher moral purpose, a spiritual side to life. \nWe saw some Chinese practicing recognized religions in permitted \nplaces, but others are not so fortunate. Buddhists pray and burn \nincense at a temple near the Great Buddha in Leshan. Catholics attend \nMass at patriotic Catholic Churches or in private homes used by the \nunderground Catholic Church. Muslims pray at the mosque in Xian. But \nMuslims in Northwest China, who are not ethnically Chinese, cannot \nworship freely.\n  Judaism is not a recognized religion, so it is illegal. Practitioners \nof Falun Gong are arrested virtually every day when they do their \nexercises on Tiananmen Square or in other public places. And no member \nof any religion is allowed to proselytize freely, even though spreading \nthe word is a key element of many faiths.\n  While Senator Harkin and I did not have the opportunity to visit \nTibet, I remain concerned about efforts to suppress Tibetan culture and \nreligion. I hope the Chinese government will enter into dialogue with \nthe Dalai Lama--without preconditions--with the aim of allowing him to \nreturn to Tibet as a spiritual leader.\n  So is there freedom of religion in China? I think a typical Chinese \nanswer might be ``Yes, within limits.''\n  Freedom of speech is similarly limited. Pre-publication censorship \nthrough approved publishing houses ensures that the Chinese government \ncan review and approve the content of any published work. Some books \nhave been\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\nbanned, recalled and destroyed after publication because a senior party \nmember or official found them offensive.\n  During my visit to Beijing, I was pleased to hear Premier Zhu Rongji \ncommit to continued progress on human rights. However, much work still \nneeds to be done.\n  One of China's most egregious laws, under which people could be \njailed as ``counter-revolutionary,'' was repealed in 1997. But hundreds \nor perhaps thousands of people sentenced under that statute remain \nlocked up.\n  Perhaps the worst element of China's totalitarian state and arbitrary \nrule is the system of ``re-education through labor.'' Under this \nsystem, people can be deprived of their freedom for up to three years \nby the decision of a local police board--without ever being charged \nwith a crime, much less having a fair trial. While indications suggest \na change in the ``re-education'' system may be in the works, I hope \nChina will eliminate it entirely.\n\n  Further, I was disturbed by the Chinese government's efforts to \nsuppress dissenting voices. Our Chinese hosts refused to pursue our \nrequest to meet with Bao Tong, a former government official imprisoned \nfor warning Tiananmen Square demonstrators of the impending crackdown, \nsaying it was ``too sensitive.''\n  We will not forget the crackdown on democracy protesters in Tiananmen \nSquare, nor will we sweep current human rights problems under the rug. \nThat is not the mission. I am hopeful that a renewed United States-\nChina relationship will yield better respect for human rights in China.\n  China's environmental policies are another serious concern. During \nthe discussions in Kyoto about the world's climate, China insisted that \nonly the U.S. and other developed countries should have to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. But China is the fourth largest and the most \npopulous country in the world, so addressing global climate change will \ndemand China's participation.\n  I raised these concerns with China's senior leaders and later with \nChina's Environment Minister, Xie Zhenhua, at the State Environmental \nProtection Administration. The reaction I got was decidedly mixed. \nMinister Xie described China's concerted efforts to address \nenvironmental problems. For example, China has reduced annual soft coal \nproduction, and thus consumption, from 1.3 to 1.2 billion tons, with a \ngoal of a further reduction to 1 billion tons, to reduce sulfur dioxide \nand particulate emissions and improve air quality. China is also \nincreasing use of natural gas and has taken steps to remove the worst-\npolluting vehicles from the country's roads. However, Minister Xie then \nlaunched into a diatribe, saying that the U.S. bears principal \nresponsibility for the degradation of the Earth's environment and that \nChina has a right to pollute so it can develop economically.\n  I certainly hope recognition of the importance of environmental \nprotection in China and global climate change will overcome the stale \nrhetoric of the old North-South economic discussions, so the U.S., \nChina and other countries can join together to address common concerns. \nAnd I am hopeful that increased trade will foster more cooperation on \nthat issue, including sales of environmentally sound American \ntechnology.\n  Many Americans are also rightly concerned about the working \nconditions and the rights of Chinese workers, particularly since \nAmerican firms that follow American labor laws have to compete with \nChinese producers.\n  Certainly, migrant workers in southeastern China--including underage \nworkers--are exploited. And workers in China cannot meaningfully \norganize to protect their interests. China has strong labor laws, but \nenforcement is clearly lacking.\n  I visited a state-owned factory in Leshan, in Sichuan province, which \nproduces equipment for power generation. Workers using large machine \ntools and working with large metal components had no protection for \ntheir eyes or ears, no hard hats and no steel-toed boots, as would be \nrequired in the U.S. Their work was clearly hard and dangerous, the \nhours long and the pay meager.\n  I also visited a garment factory in Shenzhen, the Special Economic \nZone established 20 years ago near the border with Hong Kong. The \nfactory manager told me workers are usually on the job for 40 hours a \nweek, occasionally putting in overtime when the factory is busy. \nWorkers themselves meekly said they probably work about 12 hours a day. \nBut my staff looked through the rack of time cards near the door and \ndiscovered that virtually all of these textile workers arrive before 8 \na.m., take a short lunch break and clock out after 10 p.m.--working \nnearly 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. And that earns them wages of 80 \nor 90 U.S. dollars per month, a bunk in a dormitory and meals.\n  The presence of American and other foreign investors and buyers can \nmake a huge difference.\n  Senator Harkin and I visited a factory near Shanghai that produces \nclothing for Liz Claiborne. The company appeared to be making a real \neffort to enforce fair labor association standards. We could see the \nresults in working conditions. For example, the factory was well-lit \nand well-ventilated, even air-conditioned. Liz Claiborne's \ninterventions led to the construction of a fire escape, and the \nworkers' rights were clearly posted near the entrance. A Liz Claiborne \nrepresentative on site not only ensures the quality of the product but \nalso monitors compliance with China's labor laws limiting overtime \nhours.\n  Unfortunately, not all American and other foreign firms are as \nresponsible. When I was in Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post had \na front-page story about child labor in a factory in Guandong Province \nproducing toys for McDonald's Happy Meals. Indeed, the toy industry is \nprobably the most notorious for looking the other way as its Chinese \nsuppliers exploit their workers. The bottom line is that trade with the \nUnited States and U.S. investment does not automatically lead to better \nworking conditions and fairer treatment for Chinese workers. American \nand other foreign companies need to make fair labor standards a real \ncondition of their business relationships.\n  So these are some of the problems I observed and concerns I raised in \nChina.\n  I come to the key question: Can we as a nation best make progress on \nthese issues by granting PNTR or by denying it?\n  Our annual reviews of Most Favored Nation treatment of China have \nprovided important leverage with Beijing. Congress reviewed issues of \nimportance to us, and members of the House and Senate and \nAdministration officials raised these concerns with Chinese officials. \nMany times, China took significant steps to show progress, and arguably \nfuture-oriented leaders used the opportunity to promote reforms. Under \nH.R. 4444, a commission will still look at China's human rights record \nand other concerns each year, but without the implicit leverage of a \nvote on MFN.\n  Some have suggested we vote down PNTR to maintain our annual vote and \nthe associated leverage. After all, China will still be interested in \nselling goods in the U.S. market, though we would not have access to \nWTO rules and dispute settlement mechanisms.\n  However, voting down PNTR would not simply maintain the status quo. \nChinese leaders--and many Chinese citizens--see this debate on PNTR \nlegislation as a referendum on the U.S.-China relationship. Rejecting \nPNTR means rejecting any hope of a cooperative relationship with China \nin the near-term. And cooperation, too, has yielded important progress. \nOn the national security front, the U.S. and China have cooperated to \npromote peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. And the WTO \ncontains a national security exception that will allow us to maintain \ntechnological controls and other national security restrictions on \ntrade. On the human rights front, China has signed the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, though the National People's \nCongress has yet to ratify it. The presence of American firms willing \nto forego some of their profits to treat workers decently has helped \nraise standards of working conditions.\n  China is going to have access to the U.S. market regardless of how we \nvote. If we grant PNTR to China, however, we will gain the benefit of \nWTO dispute settlement mechanisms to better ensure China's commitment \nto free trade. By granting PNTR, we do give up the right to review \nChina's trade status annually, but we can advance our agenda\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\non non-economic issues through increased dialogue, by bringing China \ninto multilateral agreements and institutions, and through stronger \nbilateral cooperation.\n  Economically, I believe the world and the American and Chinese people \nhave a lot to gain by granting PNTR.\n  As I discussed earlier, China's economic growth over the past two \ndecades has been staggering, as a result of its opening to the world \nsome 20 years ago. China has risen to become the world's ninth largest \nexporter and the eleventh largest importer.\n  In November 1999, we completed a landmark Bilateral Trade Agreement \nwith China, which is contingent on our approving PNTR. In that \nagreement, China pledged to reduce tariffs on a number of imports. For \nexample, all tariffs on information technology products such as \nsemiconductors, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer \nequipment are to be eliminated by 2005. Tariffs on industrial products \nwould decline from a simple average of 24.6 percent to 9.4 percent.\n  The agreement also opens China's markets in a wide range of services, \nincluding banking, insurance, telecommunications, distribution, \nprofessional services and other business services. China is expected to \njoin the WTO's Basic Telecommunications Agreement and end geographic \nrestrictions on wireless services and its ban on foreign investment in \ntelecommunication. Such changes are good not only for China but for \nAmerica.\n  But establishing Permanent Normal Trade Relations is something we can \ndo only once. Some economists have raised serious questions about \nwhether we have gained enough access to China's markets for goods and \nservices. Did USTR's negotiators get a good deal? I think that's a \ndifficult question to answer now. Our annual trade deficit with China \nstands at a shocking $56.9 billion.\n  One key factor which will determine how good a deal we got is \ncompliance. How well will China fulfill its obligations? Through \nChina's WTO accession and the establishment of PNTR, we will be able to \nhold China accountable for its trade commitments through the WTO's \ntransparent, rules-based dispute settlement mechanisms. If China \narbitrarily increases a tariff on an American product or engages in \nretaliatory actions against the U.S., we could seek redress under WTO \nregulations.\n  How effectively will we monitor compliance and use these mechanisms \nand our trade laws to bring China's laws and practices into line? This \nis a very serious question. China is a large country--nearly the size \nof the United States--and the application of national laws is grossly \ninconsistent across the country. Moreover, U.S. firms doing business \nthere seem to understand their immense reliance on the goodwill of \nChina's government and Communist Party. Will these firms be willing to \nrisk a deal in Guangzhou by asking USTR to pursue action against \narbitrary and discriminatory treatment in Inner Mongolia? Or will \nAmerican firms continue to emphasize cooperation with Chinese \nauthorities?\n  This bill rightly stresses the need for the U.S. government to \nmonitor China's compliance with its trade obligations and use the WTO's \ndispute settlement mechanisms. But if we fail to grant PNTR for China, \nWTO dispute mechanisms will not be available to us.\n  Mr. President, China is already America's fourth largest trading \npartner. According to administration statistics, American exports to \nChina and Hong Kong support an estimated 400,000 well-paying U.S. jobs.\n  China's WTO accession and the 1999 bilateral agreement will further \nopen China's markets to American goods and services and protects \nAmerican intellectual property rights. I believe will prove to be a \ngood deal for America's working families.\n  New Jersey undoubtedly stands to benefit from China's accession to \nthe WTO and improved market access. At the end of 1998, China ranked as \nNew Jersey's ninth largest export destination, with merchandise exports \nworth $668 million. Important New Jersey firms, such as Lucent \nTechnologies and Chubb Insurance, are already active in China and will \nhave more opportunities as a result of China's market opening under the \n1999 bilateral trade deal.\n  Mr. President, there are some potential risks in granting permanent \nnormal trade relations to China now. While I have concerns about \nChina's record in the areas I have outlined, I believe that China is \nundergoing momentous change. The best way to promote continued progress \non issues of concern and help our economy is to grant China permanent \nnormal trade relations status.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one would think from the comments made \nby my distinguished friend from New Jersey and others that the issue \nwas the welfare and benefit of the People's Republic of China. I have \nno particular gripe at this moment about China. I think, as the Senator \nfrom New Jersey pointed out, it is working. China has a very \ncompetitive trade policy. They are making improvements industrially, \neconomically, even environmentally, and perhaps with labor standards. \nThat is not the issue.\n  The issue is the viable, competitive trade policy of the United \nStates of America. You would think that we had the finest, most \nwonderfully competitive trade policy there could be. The fact is, we \nhave a $350 billion trade deficit that we know of, and this year, 2000, \nit is going to approximate $400 billion.\n  Last month, the Department of Commerce announced we had lost 69,000 \nmanufacturing jobs. The fact is, we have gone from the end of World War \nII, with some 42 percent of our workforce in manufacturing, down to 12 \npercent.\n  As the head of Sony--the Japanese just beat us in softball last \nnight, and they are beating us in trade--as the head of Sony, Akio \nMorita, said, that world power that loses its manufacturing capacity \nwill cease to be a world power.\n  We hear high tech, high tech. They are running around here as if they \nhave discovered something. Senator, you don't understand global \ncompetition, they say. We have high tech. We want to get away from the \nsmokestack jobs to the high-tech jobs.\n  Let me say a word about that. I know something about both. I have \nboth. I would much rather have BMW than Oracle or Microsoft. Why do I \nsay that? BMW is paying $21 an hour. A third of Microsoft's workers are \npaid $10 an hour, part time, temporary workers, Silicon Valley. Forty-\ntwo percent of the workers in Silicon Valley are part-time, temporary \nworkers. I am not looking for temporary jobs. I am looking for hardcore \nmiddle America jobs.\n  That is the competition. The competition in global competition is \nmarket share and jobs. We treat foreign trade as foreign aid. Free \ntrade, free trade. They say: You don't understand high tech. The truth \nis, we have a deficit in the balance of trade in advanced technology \nproducts with the People's Republic of China. Last year, it was $3.2 \nbillion. It will approximate $5 billion this year.\n  But Senator, agriculture. Agriculture? There is a glut of agriculture \nin the People's Republic. Once they solve their transportation and \ndistribution problems, they are not only going to feed the 1.3 billion, \nbut the rest of the world. Come now, the 800 million farmers they have \nat the moment can certainly outproduce the 3.5 million farmers we have \nin America.\n  We had a deficit in the balance of trade of $218 million last year \nwith the People's Republic of China. People don't understand where we \nare. I have a deficit in the balance of trade of cotton. I am importing \ncotton from the People's Republic of China.\n  They say: Wait a minute, what about the airplanes? Well, yes, they \nhave orders for 1,600, we just heard a minute ago. We will cut that in \nhalf. That is really 800, because 50 percent, according to Bill Greider \nof the 777 Boeing plane, is going to be made in downtown Shanghai. The \nMD 3010, 70 percent of that aircraft is made in the People's Republic \nof China. So what are we doing? Are we transferring all of the \nwonderful middle-class American jobs to China? And we are running all \nover the country hollering, ``I am for the working families, I am for \nthe working families,'' when, since NAFTA, they have eliminated 30,700 \nworking families in my little State of South Carolina. We lost over \n500,000 over the Nation. So we are eliminating working families, and we \nsay, ``But China is going to\n\n[[Page S8675]]\n\nreally start enforcing and adhering and be made accountable.'' Not at \nall.\n\n  Japan is not. Incidentally, Japan has been in the WTO for 5 years and \nit hasn't opened up yet. I don't know where they get the idea that once \nwe get this particular agreement and China in the WTO, it is going to \nopen its market. That doesn't open markets. Otherwise accountable? The \nPeople's Republic see what happened with the United States and Japan \nand with the United States and the United Kingdom. The President was up \nin New York the week before last with Prime Minister Blair, and the \nPrime Minister is fighting for a thousand jobs, and the President of \nthe United States is exporting them like gang busters and fighting for \nbananas that we don't even produce. Fighting for bananas. Come on. When \nare we going to sober up and get a competitive trade policy?\n  For a second, I don't have the idea that we ought to cut off trade; \nthat is ridiculous because it is impossible. We are going to trade with \nChina. I just want to cut the word ``permanent'' out and have a look-\nsee and try to get organized a trade policy whereby we can correlate 20 \ndifferent departments and agencies, our Department of Commerce and \nTrade, and start really competing in a controlled global economy.\n  The fight there, of course, as I see it, is for market share. The \nfight is for jobs. We are not doing it. I guess my time is pretty well \nlimited.\n  Alexander Hamilton enunciated the competitive trade policy of the \nPeople's Republic of China in 1789. The first was for the Seal of the \nUnited States. The second bill that passed this Congress in July 1789 \nwas a 50-percent tariff on 60 articles. Protectionism. We learn how to \nbuild up. The Brits suggested to us that we trade with them what we \nproduce best and they trade back what they produce best. Free trade, \nfree trade. Hamilton, in his writing ``Report on Manufacturers,'' told \nthe Brits: Bug off, we are not going to remain your colony, exporting \nour raw materials, our agriculture, our timber, our iron ore, and \nimporting your manufactured products. And therein is the policy of the \nPeople's Republic of China. I welcome it. I welcome the competition. \nBut you can't find it here in the Congress. You can't find it in the \nPresidential race.\n  You would think we had a good policy of some kind. Nothing on the \nfloor. People are coming up here, like myself, reciting their little \npositions, with no debate. Somebody said ``invigorating debate.'' They \ncouldn't care less. This vote has been fixed. This thing has been fixed \nsince midsummer. You know it and I know it. They will give you time. \nThere is nobody seated on the other side. Let the Record show that. \nAbsolutely nobody is in a chair on the Republican side of the Senate as \nI speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague--I have 10 minutes reserved--if my \ncolleague from Illinois needs to speak----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I make the following unanimous consent \nrequest. I understand 6 minutes is left of the Democratic leader's \ntime. Senator Wellstone asked for 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nto follow Senator Wellstone and to speak for 6 minutes on the \nDemocratic leader's time, unless a Republican Member comes to the \nfloor, at which point I will yield to them to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Hollings \nfrom South Carolina, for his remarks. Let me say to my colleague from \nSouth Carolina, I can't imagine the Senate without Senator Hollings--\nthe color, the power of the oratory and, frankly, being willing to \nstand by the courage of his convictions. He is a great Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator is too kind. I thank the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to include this in the Record \ntoday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 19, 2000]\n\n                     Catholic `Criminals' in China\n\n       The Communist regime in China has identified and rooted out \n     another enemy of the state: 81-year-old Catholic Bishop Zeng \n     Jingmu. The Cardinal Kung Foundation, a U.S.-based advocate \n     for the Roman Catholic Church and its estimated 10 million \n     followers in China, reports that Bishop Zeng was nabbed last \n     Thursday. An embassy spokesman here said he could't comment. \n     This wouldn't be a first for this apparently dangerous \n     cleric. He was imprisoned for a quarter-century beginning in \n     1958. In 1983, the Communists let him out--for one month. The \n     they jailed him for another eight years, until 1991. In \n     1996--at the age of 76--he was sentenced to three years of \n     forced labor and reeducation. When he was released with six \n     months still to run on that sentence, in 1998, the Clinton \n     administration trumpted the news as ``further evidence that \n     the president's policy of engagement works.'' The fatuousness \n     of that statement must be especially clear to the bishop from \n     his current jail cell.\n       Bishop Zeng has been guilty of a single crime all along: He \n     is a Catholic believer. He refuses to submit to Communist \n     atheism or to the control of the Catholic Patriotic \n     Association, an alternative ``church'' created by the regime \n     that does not recognize the primacy of the pope. China's \n     government is willing to tolerate some religious expression \n     as long as it is dictated by the government. Anyone who will \n     not submit--whether spiritual movements such as Falun Gong, \n     evangelical Protestant churches, Tibetan monasteries or the \n     real Catholic Church--is subject to ``repression and abuse,'' \n     the State Department said in its recent report on \n     international religious freedom. The admirably straighforward \n     report noted that respect for religious freedom \n     ``deteriorated markedly'' in China during the past year. \n     ``Some places of worship were destroyed,'' it said. ``Leaders \n     of unauthorized groups are often the targets of harassment, \n     interrogations, detention and physical abuse.''\n       Bishop Zeng is a man of uncommon courage, but his fate in \n     China is sadly common. Three days before his arrest, Father \n     Ye Gong Feng, 82 was arrested and ``tortured to \n     unconsciousness,'' the Cardinal Kung Foundation reports. It \n     took 70 policemen to perform that operation. Father Lin \n     Rengui of Fujian province ``was beaten so savagely that he \n     vomited blood.'' Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have \n     been arrested during the past year; the State Department \n     cites ``credible reports'' that at least 24 have died while \n     in police custody.\n       Last month the Chinese government launched a public \n     relations mission to the United States, dispatching exhibits, \n     performers and lecturers--on the subject of religious \n     freedom, among others--on a three-week charm offensive. \n     ``American voters should get to know us,'' said the Chinese \n     functionary in charge. The U.S. ambassador to China, Joseph \n     Prueher, appeared at a joint news conference announcing the \n     mission, and a number of U.S. business executives--from \n     Boeing. Time Warner and elsewhere--happily sponsored it. We \n     have nothing against goodwill cultural exchanges, but Chinese \n     and American officials should not delude themselves that U.S. \n     suspicions are caused chiefly by prejudice or lack of \n     understanding. On the contrary, Americans understand just \n     fine what kind of government throws 81-year-old clerics into \n     jail.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is all so timely. In this \nWashington Post article, the lead editorial is: ``Catholic `Criminals' \nin China.''\n  The first sentence reads:\n\n       The Communist regime in China has identified and rooted out \n     another enemy of the state: 81-year-old Catholic Bishop Zeng \n     Jingmu.\n       . . . Bishop Zeng was nabbed last Thursday.\n\n  He spent a good many years in prison.\n\n       . . . Bishop Zeng has been guilty of a single crime all \n     along: He is a Catholic believer.\n\n  Bishop Zeng was picked up last week and is now imprisoned again. I \nquote again from the editorial:\n\n       . . . Bishop Zeng has been guilty of a single crime all \n     along: He is a Catholic believer.\n\n  Mr. President, every Senator should read this editorial today before \nthey vote. I came to the floor of the Senate with an amendment. It \nmerits a report from a commission we had established, to report back to \nus, a Commission on Religious Freedom, chaired by David Sapperstein. \nThe commission looked at the situation in China and it made a \nrecommendation to us. The commission's recommendation was, right now in \nChina, as evidenced by what happened to this Catholic bishop, an 81-\nyear-old bishop imprisoned for being a Catholic, that it is a brutal \natmosphere and we in the Senate and the House of Representatives ought \nto at least reserve for ourselves the right to annually review trade \nrelations with China so we can have some leverage to speak out on human \nrights. That amendment lost.\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\n  I brought another amendment to the floor. I said based upon China's \nagreement with the United States in 1991, a memorandum of \nunderstanding, and then another agreement in 1993, which the President \nused as evidence that we would delink human rights with trade policy \nwith China, we should call on China to live up to its agreement that it \nwould not export to this country products made by prison labor. Many of \nthese people are in prison because they have spoken out for democracy \nand human rights. That amendment lost.\n  I brought another amendment to the floor of the Senate, which was an \namendment that said men and women in China should have the right to \norganize and bargain collectively; they should be able to form an \nindependent union. I cited as evidence Kathy Lee and Wal-Mart paying 8 \ncents an hour from 8 in the morning until 10 at night--mainly to young \nwomen. They get 1 day off a month. I said shouldn't we at least say we \nwant to extend the right to annually review trade relations until China \nlives up to this standard? That amendment lost.\n  Then I offered an amendment with Senator Helms from North Carolina, a \nbroad human rights amendment, citing one human rights report after \nanother saying that China needed to live up to the basic standard of \ndecency when it comes to respecting the human rights of its people. \nThat is a sacred issue to me--anywhere in the world. That amendment \nlost.\n  I want to conclude my remarks on the floor of the Senate in three \nways. First, I hope I am wrong, but I believe we will deeply regret the \nstampede to pass this legislation and the way in which we have taken \nall the human rights, religious freedom, right to organize, all of \nthose concerns, and we have put them in parentheses and in brackets as \nif they don't exist and are not important. I think we will regret that. \nI think we will regret that because if we truly understand the \nimplications of living in an international economy, it means this.\n  It means that if we care about human rights, we have to care about \nhuman rights in every country. If we care about the environment--not \njust in our country--if we care about the right to organize--not just \nin our country--if we care about deplorable child labor conditions, we \nhave to be concerned about that in every country. When we as the Senate \nand as Senators do not speak out on human rights, we are all \ndiminished. When we have not spoken out on human rights in China, I \nthink our silence is a betrayal.\n  I will make two other final points.\n  I have heard my colleagues argue ``exports, exports.'' I have spoken \nplenty about this legislation, and I will not repeat everything I said \nbut just to say I think the evidence is pretty clear. Not more exports \nbut more investment--there is a difference.\n  I think what will happen is China will become the largest export \nplatform with low-wage labor under deplorable working conditions \nexporting products abroad, including to our country, and our workers \nwill lose their jobs. Frankly, we will be talking about not raising the \nliving standard of working people but lowering the living standard.\n  On agriculture, I think there was a piece in the New York Times on \nSunday. Every day there is an article in the newspaper about China. It \nis not a pretty picture. It is as if many of my colleagues want to turn \ntheir gaze away from the glut in production--about the protests, about \npeople being arrested for the protests.\n  Frankly, as to the argument that we are going to have many more \nexports to China and that is going to be the salvation of family \nfarmers--the President of the United States came out to Minnesota and \nbasically made that argument--we can have different views about human \nrights and whether or not there will be more respect for human rights \nas we have more economic trade relations in China, but so far that is \nnot the evidence. I can understand how people honestly disagree. I \ndon't believe that most-favored-nation status or normal trade relations \nwith China is the salvation of family farmers for this country.\n  I want my words in this debate to be heard. I want to stick by these \nwords, and I want to be held accountable. I want every other colleague \nwho has made such a claim, that this will be the salvation for our \nfamily farmers in this country, to also be held accountable.\n  Finally, I say to Senators that I believe we will lose this. And \npeople in good conscience have different viewpoints. I can't help \nspeaking with some strong feeling at the end of this debate to say \nthis: I will look at this debate and vote with a sense of history. One-\nhundred years ago, our economy was changing. We were moving to a \nnational economy--industrialized national economy. You had farmers, \nlaborers, religious communities, populists, and women. And they made a \nset of standards. They wanted an 8-hour day. They wanted to abolish \nsome of the worst child labor conditions--antitrust action; women \nwanted the right to vote; direct election of U.S. Senators. They wanted \nthe right to organize and bargain collectively. The Pinkertons were \nkilling labor organizers. The media were hostile. Money dominated \npolitics. But many of those demands became the law of the land over the \nyears and made our country better. So it is today. This is the new \neconomy. It is an emerging global economy.\n  What we were saying is we want to civilize the global economy and \nmake it work--not just the large conglomerates. We want this new global \neconomy to work for the environment; to work for family farmers and \nproducers; to work for human rights; to work for religious freedom; to \nwork for workers. That is what this debate has been about.\n  I think this will become where you stand in relation to this new \nglobal economy. I think it can become some kind of axis of American \npolitics over the next 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 years to come.\n  I am proud to stand for human rights. I am proud to stand for \nreligious freedom. I am proud to stand for the right of people to \norganize. I am proud to stand for an international economy but an \ninternational economy that is based upon some standard of decency and \nfairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, Senator Daschle, I \nyield 30 minutes to Senator Byrd, 5 minutes to Senator Baucus, and 15 \nminutes to Senator Moynihan. I say to my Democratic colleagues, that is \nall the time we have. Senators shouldn't ask for an extension of time \nbecause there is no more time on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I asked for 6 minutes. Was that calculated?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I understood that had also been granted. If not, I \ngrant 6 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations with China. Today the United States Senate will vote to grant \nPNTR to China and its 1.2 billion people. We will decide whether or not \nto allow American farmers, manufacturers, businessmen and women to \ntrade their products, their ideas, their goods with one-fifth of the \nworld's population.\n  Last November, after more than a decade of negotiations, the Clinton \nAdministration signed a bilateral agreement that will drastically \nreduce barriers on American products and services going to China. The \nagreement is clearly in the best interests of our nation's farmers, \nmanufacturers, and workers. Supporting China's entry into the WTO is \nclearly in the best interests of our economy, national security and \nforeign policy.\n  Trade is the future. Make no mistake about it: trade can open up the \nexchange of ideas--ideas like democracy, freedom of speech, freedom to \nworship, and freedom of association. China stands on the brink of \nbecoming the most important trading partner the U.S. has ever seen and \nthe U.S. Senate will go on record in support of this important step in \ninternational trade and foreign policy.\n  When China concludes similar agreements with other countries, it will \njoin the WTO. For us to benefit though, we must grant China PNTR \nstatus--the same status we have given other countries in the WTO. And, \nMr. President, that's what this debate is about. Do we give China the \nsame status as the other countries already in the WTO? Do we put them \nin an environment where\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\nthey will have to follow the rules and be held accountable if they \nbreak them?\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the floor of the United States \nSenate over the last several weeks to offer amendments to this \nlegislation. They've all been defeated, with my help, despite the fact \nthat I agree with the intention of almost everyone of them. I voted \nagainst every amendment offered because I know and the American people \nwatching this debate know that amending H.R. 4444, at this point in the \nprocess is a death knell.\n  We defeated goodfaith amendments like Senator Thompson's non-\nproliferation amendment, Senator Wellstone's religious freedom and \nright to organize amendments, and Senator Helms' amendment regarding \nforced abortions. I agree with the intent of my colleagues. China \nshould not engage in the proliferation of nuclear technology. China \nshould not prevent workers from organizing. China should not force \nwomen to adhere to any type of ``one family, one child'' policy.\n  But, the bill we're debating is a trade bill. And if it's changed in \nany way, shape, or form, it will go back to the House of \nRepresentatives and die.\n  My friend in the House of Representatives, Rep. Sander Levin, \nsuccessfully added language to the House-passed legislation that, I \nbelieve, holds China accountable. The Levin/Bereuter language \nestablishes a formal Congressional-Executive Commission on China to \ninstitutionalize mechanisms for maintaining pressure on China to \nimprove its human rights record, increase compliance with basic labor \nstandards, and abide by current and future commitments. This commission \nwould review and report on China's progress in these areas and make \nrecommendations to the Administration and Congress. My friends who \noffered amendments regarding human rights on the floor of the Senate \nwill be able in the future to review China's record in this important \narea.\n  The Levin proposal would also push for more transparency at the WTO, \nincluding urging prompt public release of all litigation-related \ndocuments and the opening of secret meetings of the dispute settlement \npanels. The United States pays dues to the WTO and we have a right to \nknow what goes on in those meetings. I've heard over and over again \nabout the secrecy of the WTO. It's time for the WTO to shed some light \non what really happens in these meetings that affect real American \nworkers, so that workers will be able to see that we can rely on their \nrules-based trading system for relief when and if it's needed.\n  The Levin-Bereuter proposal empowers the Congress by seeking \nspecial congressional review of U.S. participation in the WTO two years \nafter China's accession, to assess China's implementation of WTO \ncommitments. We'll have the power to see just how well China is abiding \nby its commitments.\n\n  And finally, the legislation expresses congressional support for \nTaiwan's accession to the WTO immediately after China's accession. \nWhile the Chinese aren't happy about this provision, I believe that \nit's important to allow Taiwan the same trading rights as mainland \nChina.\n  America began as an agrarian nation, then transformed itself into an \nindustrial power, and now over 200 years later, we're the leading \neconomy in the world due, in part, to our ability to recognize that \ncompetition can force a country or a company to excel or fail. America \nhas never feared competition.\n  And it's a reality that global competition is here and it's here to \nstay. Opponents argue that we must stop globalization, that we must \npunish the Chinese for all their human rights abuses, for prison labor \nabuses, for Tiananmen Square. Every year, we vote on whether or not to \ngrant NTR status to China. Throughout my time in the House and Senate, \nI've voted both for and against NTR. Every year, we take a look at how \nChina treats its citizens, wondering whether or not our annual review \nof their trade status would change their behavior.\n  Many say that the Congress shouldn't give up that right to annual \nreview--that if we annually examine how the Chinese treat their people, \nand based upon that, deny or give them preferred trading status, \nsomehow they will clean up their act and guarantee every Chinese \ncitizen basic human rights. It's time we changed our approach. It's \ntime to bring democracy to China via the Internet, via U.S./Chinese \ncommerce relationships, via other U.S. products. It's time to bring \nsocial progress to China, not with messages from Congress but messages \nfrom across America, from businesses, labor traders, educators with new \naccess to a society too often closed to diverse opinion.\n  President Clinton noted recently that ``In the new century, liberty \nwill spread by cell phone and cable modem.'' Take a look at America \nwith access to the Internet and now think back to the days when access \nto world knowledge was only through the printed media. America is a \ndifferent nation because of this progress and China has the potential \nto change too.\n  Think for a moment about what would happen if we denied PNTR to \nChina. I believe that if we sent that signal to the Chinese people, the \nwalls of isolation would be strengthened. The hardline Communists would \nbe emboldened more so than before. If we vote against PNTR, Beijing \nwon't free a single prisoner. They will turn inward and the limited \nfreedoms the Chinese people currently enjoy could well disappear.\n  And this argument ignores our experience with the Soviet Union during \nthe height of the Cold War. We spent trillions of dollars to oppose a \nregime that was rife with human rights abuses, yet we still sold them, \nin the words of the late Hubert Humphrey, ``just about anything they \ncould not shoot at us.''\n  China will enter the WTO, with or without our support. The questions \nis: will America benefit from it or will the Chinese buy products and \nservices from the Europeans or the Canadians or the Mexicans? To me, \nit's a clear choice: Americans will benefit from free and fair trade \nwith China. And China will change for the better as it opens its doors \nto the world.\n  What about Illinoisans? How will farmers from Peoria and Cairo \nbenefit from this action? How will major Illinois-based U.S. \ncorporations like Motorola and Caterpillar and Bank of America and the \nthousands of Americans they employ benefit from this agreement?\n  The average tariff for agriculture products will be 17.5 percent and, \nfor U.S. priority products, 14 percent, down from 31 percent. Farmers \nin downstate Illinois, will benefit from this; there's no doubt about \nit. At present, China severely restricts trading rights and the ability \nto own and operate distribution networks. For the first time, Illinois \nexporters will have the right to distribute products without going \nthrough a State Owned Enterprise. Illinois is already a significant \nexporter of farm and industrial goods. In 1999, Illinois exported $9.3 \nbillion worth of industrial/agriculture machinery. We shipped just over \n$6 billion in electric equipment as well. Illinois farmers exported \nroughly $3 billion in commodities to other countries. Illinois exports \nin 1999 totaled over $33 billion. Of that, $850 million was sold to \nChina.\n\n  Companies like Motorola (with over 25,000 employees in Illinois) \nwhich pays tariffs of 20 percent on pagers and 12 percent for phones, \nwill see those tariffs slashed. The Illinois soybean farmer will see \nthe tariff-rate quotas completely eliminated.\n  Banks will be able to conduct business in China within the first two \nyears of accession. They will have the same rights as Chinese banks. \nGeographic and customer restrictions will be lifted in five years, \nthereby allowing them to open a branch anywhere in China, just like \nthey can here. U.S. automakers, like the Chrysler plant in Belvedere, \nIllinois, will see tariffs on their products slashed from 100 percent \nto 25 percent.\n  Pike County, Illinois pork producers will be able, for the first \ntime, to export pork to China. Under the current scheme, China's import \nbarriers have effectively denied access to American pork products. \nWe're talking tariffs in the range of 20 percent that will drop to 12 \npercent by 2004.\n  What about Illinois steelworkers, still reeling from the 1998 steel \ncrisis? China will reduce its tariffs on steel and steel products from \nthe current average of 10.3 percent to 6 percent. They've agreed that \nany entity, like Acme Steel with facilities in Riverdale and Chicago or \nNorthwestern Wire and\n\n[[Page S8678]]\n\nRod in Sterling, will be able to export into any part of China, phased \nin over 3 years.\n  Peoria-based Caterpillar, with almost 30,000 Illinois employees, has \nrecently invested in several new facilities in China. They've also \nrecently announced the sale of 18 new trucks to the Shanghai Coal \nCompany, trucks that will be made in Decatur, Illinois, and shipped \nhalfway around the world. This is the type of investment by Caterpillar \nthat maintains local jobs throughout towns and cities across Illinois.\n  Of course, many of these are big corporations. What about small \nbusinesses? How will they benefit from this agreement?\n  In 1997, 82 percent of all U.S. exporters were small businesses, \ngenerating over 35 percent of total merchandise exported to the East. \nPaperwork burdens for America's small businesses will be reduced \ndrastically as customs and licensing procedures will be simplified. \nAmerica's small businesses don't export jobs to China. They export \nideas and products to a people who need and want their products and \nservices.\n  No one expects this trade agreement and our future relationship with \nChina to be easy. Already, Beijing officials have begun backtracking on \nseveral of their commitments made last November. I understand that at \nthe most recent session of the WTO Working Party on China's accession, \nChina objected to having its implementation of trade obligations \nreviewed every other year. A Chinese proposal dated July 14th strikes \nlanguage in the protocol referring to bi-annual reviews and replaces it \nwith language providing for reviews every four years. Their rationale \nis that they're a ``developing'' country.\n  This is absolutely unacceptable. The fact is, China is not a \ntypically developing country and it shouldn't be allowed to cloak \nitself in that status. It's a uniquely large country and economy, where \nthe essential elements of a market economy are taking root. Four years \nis far too long a time between reviews of China's implementation. If \nthis proposal were adopted, it would make WTO dispute settlement the \nonly formal channel by which we could ensure China's fulfillment of its \ntrade obligations. Just one example: if China automatically received \ndeveloping country status, it would receive special treatment like \nallowable export subsidies that wouldn't be treated as subsidies. If \nthe Chinese flooded the U.S. market with steel (as is the case now), \nthe U.S. steel industry wouldn't be able to use U.S. countervailing \nduty trade laws because that law doesn't apply to subsidization for \ndeveloping countries. There are other areas where the Chinese would \nlike to backpedal. But, Mr. President, we must hold them to the \nNovember agreement and discourage future backtracking of that agreement \nby Chinese trade officials. Any unwillingness by the Chinese to abide \nby this agreement at this point should be roundly condemned by this \nAdministration and other foreign nations, who just might find the \nChinese backtracking with them as well.\n\n  Trade with foreign countries means nothing if it's not carried out \nunder a rules-based system. Trade commitments require full enforcement \nto have meaning. With China's WTO membership, we will gain a number of \nadvantages in enforcement we do not currently enjoy.\n  First, there is the WTO dispute mechanism itself. Remember that China \nhas never agreed to subject its decisions to impartial review, \njudgment, and possible sanctions if necessary. That will now happen.\n  Second, we will continue to have the right to use the full range of \nAmerican trade laws, including Section 301 and our Anti-dumping/\nCountervailing Duty laws. It's important, though, to have an \nadministration that will use these trade laws effectively. It's my hope \nthat the next President will not hesitate to bring cases against China \nand other countries if they break our trade laws.\n  And finally, we strengthen our enforcement capabilities through the \nmultilateral nature of the WTO. In effect, China will be subject to \nenforcement by all 135 WTO member nations, thus limiting their ability \nto play its trading partners against one another. The U.S. won't be \nalone if China breaks the rules.\n  Opponents of PNTR argue that it's NAFTA all over again. You'll \nremember Ross Perot's soundbite: ``That great sucking sound.'' You'll \nremember that some said the American economy would go down the tubes, \nthat hundreds of thousands of American workers would lose their jobs to \ncheap labor in Mexico if NAFTA were enacted.\n  Here's Illinois' story. Gross jobs added in export industries from \n1993-1998 totaled over 60,000. Net jobs totaled almost 40,000. There \nwas no great sucking sound. US unemployment is still low. There are \nmore people employed in Illinois right now than at any time in its \nhistory. The Illinois Department of Commerce estimates that nearly half \na million jobs are supported by exports and that there's been a 51.6 \npercent increase in Illinois jobs sustained by exports since enactment \nof NAFTA.\n  Yes, some folks have lost their jobs due to trade. The Department of \nLabor certified 50 Trade Adjustment Assistance cases in Illinois from \n1994-1999, totaling 5,718 jobs lost. Frankly, losing 5,718 jobs is \nstill too many. When workers lose their jobs, we should do more than \njust provide TAA. We should find ways to train our workers in emerging \nfields and industries so they get new jobs that are at least as good as \nthe ones they lost. That's the responsibility of the American business \ncommunity, educators, and federal, state, and local governments. This \nis the best opportunity we've had in years to export American ideals \nand products. We should also ensure we don't export American jobs.\n  Worker re-training is one of the most important debates that this \nCongress should focus on. Today, we voted on a cloture motion on H1B \nvisas. I have almost 6,000 Illinoisans who've lost their jobs due to \ntrade, yet we have to import workers from foreign countries because we \nhave industries begging for skilled workers to show up for that 9-5 \njob. Yet, our way of solving the skills shortage in the U.S. seems to \nbe through the importation of highly-skilled foreign workers--a Band-\nAid approach that doesn't solve the underlying problem. America, as a \nnation that gains from trade, has an obligation to use a portion of \nthose gains to support and re-train those who've been ill-affected. We \nmust do more to help American workers train for and get jobs that will \nmove them up the economic ladder.\n  In 1998, we passed the Workforce Investment Act. One important \ncomponent of the WIA is the funding stream for dislocated workers. \nGrants to states and local communities provide core, intensive training \nand support services to laid off workers. Under President Clinton, \ndislocated worker funding has tripled from $517 million in 1993 to \n$1.589 billion for FY2000. This is an important program, like Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, that helps American families deal with an \neconomy that's transforming itself as ours is today.\n\n  But is it enough? Is it enough to train workers after they lose their \njobs or do we need to start before it's too late? With public/private \npartnerships, we can train America's workforce for the jobs of the 21st \nCentury, the hi-tech jobs, the nursing jobs, the educator jobs. It's \nour responsibility to encourage companies like Caterpillar and Motorola \nand Cargill and others to let local, state, and federal officials know \nwhat types of workers they must have to meet their needs for the \nfuture. We should encourage more Americans to pursue higher education \nand skills training. I'm working for measures like college tuition tax \nincentives that would provide tax deductions or credits for America's \nworking families to give their children the opportunity to prepare for \nthe jobs of this new economy. We also need assistance to help workers \nwith skills training and lifelong learning.\n  Some would argue as Lenin did that a capitalist will sell you the \nrope you will use to hang him, but I think such trade serves a greater \npurpose than profit. Information technology, now a key element in the \nfuture of business, also is a key element in undermining government \ncontrol of thought and appetite. If you can flood a nation with modems \npeople use to learn and trade, no government can bridle the expansion \nof thought and diversity that will follow.\n  Chinese leaders, recognizing the transformative nature of the free \nflow\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\nof ideas, have tried recently to clamp down on Internet usage by its \ncitizens. This will never work as the authorities in Beijing will \nlearn. China must either give up its desire to build a modern, high-\ntech economy or allow the free exchange of information that a modern \neconomy requires. I accept the American premise that if you give people \na little freedom and enough information, the desire for freedom, \ndemocracy and the chance to work hard and succeed will prevail.\n  You can station Chinese tanks on Tiananmen Square on a full-time \nbasis, but if you let the open exchange of ideas and business \ntransactions flow through those glowing modems, China will change for \nthe better.\n  Let's grant PNTR to China and begin a new chapter in the book of \nU.S.-China relations. Bringing down trade barriers; Opening up new \nmarkets; Giving American workers a chance to compete; And giving \nAmerica's customers a chance to enjoy the best our country can produce: \nIt's a formula for success. It's a challenge America has never shirked.\n  Our workers, our farmers and businesses are counting on us to trust \ntheir ability to rise to the challenge in this new century. We cannot \nfail them.\n  Mr. President, I listened carefully to the debate and statement made \nby my colleague, Senator Wellstone, as well as Senator Hollings of \nSouth Carolina. These two Senators and many others have spoken from the \nheart during the course of this debate. The Senate of the United States \nand the Nation are well served by the element they bring to this \ndebate, their deep-felt convictions, feelings, and values that have \nbeen exhibited not only in their floor statements but in the amendments \nthey have offered over the last several weeks.\n  Though I may disagree in my conclusion on this treaty, I can tell you \nI have the greatest respect and admiration for their leadership and for \nstanding up on these issues of human rights.\n  I would like to put this in perspective. If we believe the vote we \ntake this afternoon will give China some new benefit, then one could \nargue that we should ask for something in return. One could argue that \nif we are going to give China something, we should ask them to make \nchanges in China in their human rights policy, which is reprehensible--\nthe way they treat the press, the way they treat religions in that \ncountry, their forced family planning policies, the coercive attitude \nthey have towards families and their future in China, the terrible \nthings which we have heard about, proliferation--all of these should be \non the table and part of the agenda as we negotiate, if the agreement \nwe are voting on is, in fact, a benefit given to China. But let me \nsuggest to you it is not. We are receiving the benefit from this \nagreement. Let me explain.\n  The World Trade Organization is a group of over 130 nations which \nhave come together and said we are going to do away with the old school \nof thinking where every country would put up tariffs and barriers to \ntrade with other countries. We are going to try a new approach. We are \ngoing to try to drop those tariffs and barriers and see what free trade \nwill do. Let each country make a product and a service the best and \nsell it around the world. That is what the World Trade Organization is \nabout. Over 130 nations have agreed that those are the rules by which \nwe will play.\n  Today in the Senate this will be a historic vote to decide whether or \nnot we bring China into the World Trade Organization and compete with \nU.S. trade policy--in other words, the relationship between the United \nStates and China. China, in order to be part of this World Trade \nOrganization, has said they will agree to drop our tariffs and barriers \nsubstantially so that American companies and farmers and others can \nexport to China. In other words, this is a win-win situation for \nAmerica's economy. It is China that is making all the decisions to drop \nthe tariffs and drop the barriers and give us a chance to compete--give \nus a chance to sell to 1.2 billion people; give us a chance to sell to \none-fifth of the world's population. We win; they drop the barriers; \nAmerica gets a chance to sell overseas. That is what is at stake here.\n  If this benefit comes to the U.S. economy to be able to finally get \ninto this market and compete, then it is kind of hard to argue that we \nought to be holding off and conditioning this benefit on all sorts of \nchanges in China.\n  I have seen the amendments that have been offered by many of my \ncolleagues on the floor over the last several weeks. Many of these are \ngood faith amendments. Many of these I agree with totally in principle. \nI voted against every single one of them. How can that be? Because, \nfrankly, they don't belong on this bill. This is a trade bill. Let us \naddress the issues of human rights, workers, environmental concerns, \nand proliferation by China through a variety of other approaches. But \nto use this trade bill is a mistake.\n\n  This trade bill gives us a chance to say to workers across America \nthat we are going to give them a new market; we are going to give them \na new chance. If my colleagues believe as I do that globalization and \nglobal competition really are the future of this country, we in America \nneed markets in which to sell. That is what this is about.\n  I have a lot of confidence that American workers and businesses and \nfarmers, given a chance to compete by fair rules, can succeed. If you \nbelieve that, you have to vote for this bill; you have to open this \nmarket. You have to give us a chance to sell in what is one of the \nlargest markets in the world. That is what it comes down to.\n  There is also a provision that was added to the House bill which I \nsupport completely. It is known as the Levin/Bereuter amendment. It is \na bipartisan amendment by Sandy Levin, a Democrat of Michigan, and Doug \nBereuter, Republican of Nebraska. They come together and say China has \nto play by the rules. And we will watch them carefully with an \nexecutive commission to make sure they are not only playing by the \ntrade rules but treating their people fairly.\n  I think that is the right way to proceed. I think it covers many of \nthe issues raised during the course of this debate. But, frankly, we \ncannot hold up the expansion of trade opportunities waiting for China \nto become a democratic nation. In fact, I think expanding trade in \nexchange will lead China into democracy, into freedom, closer to what \nwe value as principles in this country. Why do I believe that? I saw \nTiananmen Square on television. I saw these tanks that were mowing down \ncommon citizens standing up for freedom. It was reprehensible. It was \ndisgusting. But we saw it on television. There was a time not that long \nago we would have never seen it. We would have heard about it months \nlater. The world is opening up. We are seeing things in real time from \naround the world, in China and other nations, and as a result the court \nof world judgment says it is wrong and you have to change it, and the \npressure starts building.\n  Think about expanded economic exchange with China, expanded trade, \nmore foreign visitors, American businesses, American farmers, and \neducators going into China, becoming part of their economy. Think about \nthis information technology as the Internet opens up China to new \nthinking and ideas around the world.\n  Do you know what we believe in this country? We believe if people are \ngiven the opportunity to hear diverse opinions, if they are given the \nopportunity to see what the rest of the world looks like, they will \nmove closer to our model, closer to democracy, closer to freedom, \ncloser to open markets. I believe that, too. I do not believe the \nChinese leadership, even their hidebound old thinking, can turn that \ntide. This bill opens those markets, opens this exchange of ideas and \ngoods, and gives us a chance to not only provide for workers and \nfarmers and businesses in America the chance to succeed in a new market \nbut a chance to change China for the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nit not be charged against the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the debate before the United States Senate \non our granting China permanent normal trade relations status has been \na tremendous debate for the country. We have heard strong arguments for \nand against enhancing our engagement and expanding trade with China. \nThis debate has implications for our economy, national security, and \nfor the future of China.\n  This vote has enormous implications for every American and people \naround the world. I am pleased that the Senate is proceeding toward a \nvote on final passage. It will be an honor to support legislation that \nhas such important implications for the people of my state and for our \ncountry.\n  Let me say, that is not only desirable from a U.S. standpoint to have \nChina as a full member of the WTO, I think it is essential. China \nentering the WTO will create unprecedented opportunities for American \nbusinesses and farmers, it will encourage the new entrepreneurial \nforces pushing china toward more liberal political, economic and social \npolicies and it will certainly contribute, if not ultimately lead, to \nthe further stabilization of Asia and the world.\n  From the standpoint of economic growth, increasing our economic \nrelationship with China is imperative. Increased trade has played an \nindispensable role in the economic growth this country has experienced \nin recent decades. The leadership and the growth of American companies \nhas been fueled by American companies winning access to new markets. As \nmany U.S. markets continue to mature, market access will play a more \nimportant role for the expansion of our businesses.\n  At this time, the U.S. has very limited access to a market \nrepresenting the largest number of consumers in the world. China is a \nnation of 1.2 billion people, one-fifth of the world's consumers. Over \nthe next 5 years, it is projected that 200 million of those Chinese \nwill enter the middle class. On a massive scale, these are people who \nwill be acquiring for the first time products that we in the United \nStates take for granted. We owe it to our workers and investors to give \nour companies an equal opportunity to fight for those sales.\n  Increasing our relationship with a country of this size is also \nimportant for maintaining our world leadership in the science, \naerospace, advanced technology, and medicine, and most important in all \nthose areas, the well-paying, advanced jobs of the future.\n  Trade is part of the process by which capital, resources and manpower \nflow to the areas in which we perform best. Reducing restrictions on \ncapital flows has allowed American entrepreneurs to pursue opportunity, \ncreate the best, most advanced products in the world, and in these \nareas, lead the world.\n  Our world leadership in the industries of tomorrow did not happen by \naccident. In addition to the spirit and ingenuity of the American \npeople, enough policy makers in this country have had the foresight to \ncreate an atmosphere where this genius and industry can thrive. \nExpanding our economic relationship and breaking down barriers to trade \nwith the largest block of consumers in the world is another huge step \nin that process.\n\n  To continue to promote that environment where Americans can thrive on \na large scale, we need to pass this legislation.\n  But for me, the best reason to support this relationship is that it \nis good for my state. Whether it is Missouri's farmers, our workers, or \nour businesses, Missourians will benefit if China is a member of the \nWTO.\n  Reviewing the numbers for American farmers alone gives a picture as \nto the staggering opportunities in this market. China is currently our \nfourth largest agricultural market. The U.S. Department of Agriculture \nestimates that this market will account for 37 percent of the future \ngrowth of agricultural exports. And the Chinese have agreed to slash \ntariffs and eliminate the quotas on several products important to \neconomy of my state--soybeans, corn, cotton, beef, and pork.\n  As China eliminates their legal requirements for self-sufficiency in \nagricultural products, if they remain only 95 percent self-sufficient \nin corn and wheat, they will instantly become the second biggest \nimporter of those products in the world, second only to Japan. Missouri \nfarmers are ready to compete for those markets.\n  This is a tremendous opportunity to help our pork producers and \ncattlemen, both areas in which China has agreed to cut tariffs. Unlike \nthe Europeans, the Chinese are ready for their people to enjoy American \nbeef. They are prepared to eat American beef openly and enjoy it in \npublic. In Europe, only the diplomats who come to the U.S. get to enjoy \na good piece of U.S. steak.\n  The Chinese are going to learn quickly what we know and the European \ndiplomats know, American beef is the best. As those 200 million Chinese \nenter the middle class, I am confident they will enjoy American beef \nand want more of it.\n  The projected increase for demand of pork in China is simply \nstaggering. Rather than go into the numbers, the pork producers \nestimate that $5 will be added to the price of a hog when we expand our \ntrade relationship with China. That would be the difference between \nsuccess and failure for small pork producers.\n  On another issue of great importance to my state and to my farmers, \nthe Chinese have agreed to settle sanitary and phyto-sanitary disputes \nbased on science. What a novel idea. This is essential to avoiding non-\ntariff trade barriers as our farmers continue to employ biotechnology \nand advanced agricultural practices.\n  The benefits are not limited to agriculture, despite what has been \nargued, benefits do extend to manufacturing and other sectors.\n  For example, one company in my state, Copeland, a division of Emerson \nElectric, manufactures air conditioner compressors in the wonderful \ntown of Ava, MO. Those compressors are sent to China where they are \nincorporated in units sold all over Asia. As the market for air \nconditioners in Asia has expanded, the number of manufacturing jobs in \nAva have grown. Those jobs will not go to China and if this agreement \nis passed the manufacturing jobs in the Ava facility are expected to \ndouble.\n\n  This agreement opens competitive opportunities for businesses of all \nsizes. Under the market opening agreement, the Chinese will eliminate \nsignificant market barriers to entry blocking the competitiveness of \nAmerican companies.\n  For instance, currently, if a product can even be imported into the \ncountry, the Chinese control every aspect of movement, right down to \nwho can handle and repair an item. Those requirements will be \neliminated as will the state-controlled trading companies. Quotas and \ntariffs must be published.\n  These are major steps in the direction of a market-based economy. The \nelimination of these wide-spread and draconian barriers will give \nAmerican entrepreneurs and small businesses that want to take on the \nChinese market a real chance to penetrate and compete. For the first \ntime, American businesses, large and small, will have the chance to \ncompete on a level playing field.\n  It is also worth nothing, that without the benefit of the WTO, to \nensure adherence to our trade agreements, we must rely on our federal \nagencies to oversee and enforce agreements. Frustration with the \nChinese regarding their respect for and adherence to past agreements \nhas been expressed. We will receive the benefit of a rules-based \ntrading regime and the weight of enforcement on a multi-lateral basis \nonce China is a member of the body.\n  Some of the opponents argue that this measure is a ``blank check'' \nfor China and that it ``rewards'' China despite the past abuses of its \npeople. The complaints of the human rights activists against China are \nlegitimate. The abuses and repression of religion are deplorable and \ntheir gestures toward a free Taiwan are totally unacceptable.\n  I reemphasize that point. We should not tolerate their abuses and \ntheir threats toward a free Taiwan.\n  The arguments that we are giving them a pass despite these abuses \nmisses the point and the argument that profits are taking precedence \nover American values is wrong. This vote is of significant importance \nin promoting free enterprise in China and creating a increasingly \nprosperous and reform-minded middle class.\n  For all the backwardness of China on the issue of religious freedom \nand human rights, positive changes are underway on the economic front--\nwe\n\n[[Page S8681]]\n\nshould recognize that the changes are a direct threat to the communist \nestablishment in China. As the Chinese people become more aware of the \nopportunities that exist for improving one's life that are inherent in \na free society, they will demand more rights from their government and \nwill demand that the government become more responsive to the will of \nthe people.\n  I have seen that on my visits to China. I am convinced the people of \nChina, as they see these opportunities, will increase their demand for \nand their insistence on the basic principles that have made our country \nstrong.\n  Senators have come to the floor this week to tell troubling stories \nabout life in China and made arguments as to why it would be a mistake \nat this time to grant China PNTR. By not supporting their amendments, \nthey have argued, we are betraying our values as a people and we are \nabandoning support for the principles that make ours a great country.\n  For all their good arguments, passing PNTR and enhancing our economic \nengagement with China is a concrete opportunity to promote change in \nmany of the areas raised. It is important to discuss these issues and \nreiterate time and again in the strongest possible terms that we \ncondemn the practices of the Chinese. However, it does not follow that \ndefeating PNTR is the way to force the Chinese to change their \nbehavior. The exact opposite is true. Exposing China to more freedom \nand opportunities is the way to bring about change.\n  One of the early amendments was in the area of the environment. The \nargument has been made that we cannot grant the Chinese PNTR because \nthey have been poor stewards of their environment.\n  I remind my colleagues that with every extremely poor country in the \nworld, the struggle to employ their people and raise the standard of \nliving of its citizens is preeminent. People under such circumstances \nmust struggle to feed their families. They are not watching NOVA \nenvironmental specials or reading National Geographic. They simply do \nnot have the luxury to worry about the environment.\n  The same applies to the government, creating economic growth to \nemploy the poor citizens is its goal. What China needs is wealth \ncreation, jobs, and enterprise apart from the state. When the \ndesperation and the poverty begin to subside the government is likely \nto be far more open and responsive to managing the environment. But \ncalling for the denial based on their environmental policies while \nwithholding the best means for the country to raise their standard of \nliving does not offer a solution.\n  The same applies to labor practices. My support for PNTR does not \nmean that I condone labor conditions in China. In fact I think they are \nterrible. But is defeating PNTR in order to make a statement about \nlabor practices in China going to improve worker's rights. Absolutely \nnot.\n  The way to improve workers rights in China is allow foreign \nenterprises into the country, create more private sector jobs and more \nopportunity. The world buying from the Chinese will create private \nsector employment and reduce dependence on the government. It creates \nmore choice and opportunity.\n  I share the concerns of my colleagues about Chinese crackdown on \nreligious practices. It is an appalling and unacceptable government \npractice that we must continue to speak out against.\n  But forcing loyalty to the state and the crushing of all beliefs and \nvalues that compete with loyalty to the state is a practice that is \ncommon among communist dictatorships. This is the way that leaders in \ncommunist countries avoid having the people's loyalty to the state and \nthe question of their purpose in life cluttered by outside influences.\n  Again, will supporting PNTR empower the reform movement? Can \npromoting free enterprise in China undermine the grip of the \ngovernment? I think it can.\n  By joining the WTO and pursuing economic engagement and integration \nwith the world, the Chinese communist leadership are taking a risk.\n  They are taking the risk that foreign entities can enter the country \nand form relationships with Chinese people but the people will still \nmaintain their loyalty to the state.\n  They are taking the risk that their citizens are going to be exposed \nto the outside world and the freedoms those in American and other \ncountries enjoy but that the Chinese people will not want a piece of \nthat freedom for themselves.\n  They are taking the risk that Chinese people can go to work for \nprivate enterprises, with the freedom to pursue better opportunities \nand with the freedom to innovate, make their own decisions and enrich \nthemselves, but at the end of the day, still maintain the belief that \nthe communist lifestyle, with its per capita income of $790 a year and \nblind loyalty to the omnipotence of the state is the superior way of \nlife.\n  The Chinese are taking a risk that their people will bear witness to \nentrepreneurship, capitalism, an improved standard of living, middle \nclass lifestyle and freedom of association, and not recognize that \nfreedom is the better and more rewarding way of life.\n  That is an enormous risk for the Chinese communist leadership to \ntake--I think it is a bet they will lose.\n  Some of my colleagues do not possess this belief. They chose to \nmaintain the most dire outlook on the circumstances. I believe in the \nvirtue and the power of freedom.\n  Some of my colleagues have chosen to shout at the Chinese leaders \nabout freedom, but to most of the Chinese leaders freedom means a loss \nof power. Much of this rhetoric, as part of a quest for meaningful \nchange, will not do much to advance the ball. The Chinese leadership is \nnot interested in hearing it.\n  Change in China, for the reasons I stated, is not going to come from \nthe top down, at least until there are a lot of high-class funerals in \nthat state, from the actuarial numbers that are about to apply. It is \ngoing to come from the bottom up. We must seize any opportunities \navailable to make meaningful change happen.\n  The path to take is the one we are taking and that is to encourage \nthe infiltration of free enterprise, freedom of thought and freedom of \nassociation into the current society. It may not happen over night, it \nmay never happen and if it does, it is likely to be messy. But there \nare signs of movement in a positive direction--we have an opportunity \nto grease the skids. We would be missing a historic opportunity if we \ndid not seize this chance. My colleagues that oppose this bill are \nwrong to think otherwise.\n  Not supporting this bill will also hurt the effort to promote the \nrule of law. There is a reason why a number of dissidents have come out \nin support of this legislation. The WTO is a rules-based organization \nthat cannot exist if members do not adhere to the rule of law. As a \nmember, China will have both rights and obligations and will have to \ndeal with other nations as equals. Indeed, as a member of a growing \nnumber of international organizations, China will continually be \nsubject to the rule of law and continually confronted with the \nchallenge of accepting international norms and, hopefully, standards of \nfreedom.\n  Finally, admission to the WTO is not a substitute for a strong, \nconsistent foreign policy toward China. Certainly one reason why this \ndebate has been difficult is because the administration has lack of a \nclear foreign policy toward China and the resolve to act on important \nissues as they arise. In my observation of this administration, it \nappears to me that they place much hope that admission to the WTO will \nerase their abysmal record in dealing firmly with China on important \nissues.\n  We as a nation must reiterate our support for the security of a \ndemocratic Taiwan and stand by that country as they negotiate the terms \nof their relationship with Taiwan. We must support the entry of Taiwan \ninto the WTO and not let China dictate the terms by which this valuable \nfriend and trading partner is admitted to the world trade body. We must \nprovide Taiwan the means by which they can provide for their own \nsecurity.\n  We must speak out for the freedom of the Chinese people to practice \nreligion. We must speak in favor of increased freedom for the Chinese \npeople.\n  China must be told that we will not tolerate their continued export \nof weapons technology that can lead to the destabilization of several \nregions around the world. We must push the Chinese to improve the \nexport controls\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\nand we must be forceful when we discover violations in international \nantiproliferation agreements.\n  These are not objectives that will be accomplished by defeating PNTR. \nThese are challenges that the current administration has failed to \nmeet. We have not had the adult supervision we need in foreign affairs, \nin military affairs, and in relations with a critical, large member of \nthe world organizations, and that is China. We have to have an \nadministration which understands foreign policy, which speaks with a \nclear voice, annunciates our principles, and stands up for them.\n  Defeating PNTR will not give us a strong foreign policy. That will \ndepend upon the next administration. I fervently hope and pray that we \nwill get some decent leadership in foreign affairs beginning next year. \nWe have lacked it. We have been sorrowfully observant of the failures \nand shortcomings throughout the last 7\\1/2\\ years. Defeating PNTR will \nnot help the next administration in their foreign policy towards China. \nApproving PNTR will. We must be firm in charting our course in the \ndefense of national security.\n  This is an important step to take for the strength of our economy and \nfor our workers and farmers. It is also an important step to take to \nmove China toward a freer society. We must cast this vote with open \neyes. It does not answer the questions surrounding China that have been \nraised during this debate. That is for the foreign policy of the next \nadministration. By adopting PNTR and voting favorably, we can take the \nfirst step in giving the next administration the tools to develop a \nstrong foreign policy with respect to China.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting permanent normal \ntrade relations with China. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe that the Senate is about to make a \ngrave mistake. It is hard for me to believe that after a year which has \nseen the Chinese Government rattling sabers at Taiwan, continuing to \nbrutally repress religion, and, generally, behaving like the ``Bobby \nKnight'' of the international community--after a year like that--the \nSenate is still determined to hand the Chinese a huge early Christmas \npresent called permanent normal trade relations. We are running a $70 \nbillion deficit with China. China's string of broken promises on trade \nand nonproliferation matters is longer than the Great Wall of China. \nYet, a majority in this Senate has agreed to put all of its eggs into \none basket and rush to pass PNTR. ``Don't worry. Be happy,'' says the \nadministration. We have the bilateral trade and investment pact to \nprotect us.\n  The bilateral trade and investment pact negotiated between the U.S. \nTrade Representative and China is one of a series of agreements which \nChina is negotiating with members of WTO in order to join the body. The \nagreement has been used to assuage the many concerns of some Members of \nthis body about granting PNTR to China. But I believe that PNTR and the \nnew U.S.-China trade pact, that panacea of all good things, will \nencourage mainly one phenomenon--one phenomenon; namely, more U.S. \ncorporations will move operations to China to capitalize on low-wage \nproduction for export back here to the United States.\n  Now if Senators don't believe it, just look at recent history. Look \nat NAFTA. Clear evidence is right there--NAFTA, the Holy Grail of \nNAFTA. The North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to right \nevery wrong, cure every evil, and make us all healthy, wealthy and \nwise. NAFTA's proponents convinced Congress in 1993 that NAFTA meant \nlarge net benefits to the U.S. economy, and nothing more. There were no \ndown sides. The line went that the U.S. could only gain from expanded \ntrade with Mexico because Mexico was reducing its trade barriers more \nthan the United States. Moreover--and this will sound very familiar--\nproponents were positive that reducing trade barriers with Mexico would \nencourage ``reform'' politicians in Mexico to privatize the economy. \nNow, where have we heard that before?\n  A new, vast middle-class would emerge, creating a new, vast middle \nclass market in Mexico, just waiting with baited breath to gobble up \nAmerican-made goods. The Clinton administration confidently predicted a \ngiant boom in U.S.-made autos sold to Mexico.\n  Well, my fellow Senators, what happened when we found the Holy Grail \ncalled NAFTA? Exactly the opposite happened, that's what. A 180-degree \nturn happened. NAFTA encouraged large U.S. investors to move production \nand capital and jobs south of the border to exploit cheap labor and lax \nenvironmental standards. These new factories then exported their \nproducts back to the United States. By 1999, the United States was \nrunning a trade deficit with Mexico of $23 billion.\n\n  Automobiles were major contributors to the deficit. So were auto \nparts, computers, televisions, and telecommunications equipment. What \nhappened to the large new Mexican middle class, salivating to buy \nAmerican goods, which NAFTA was supposed to create? Instead of raising \nliving standards in Mexico, NAFTA reinforced ``reform'' government \npolicies in Mexico that reduced real wages for workers by 25 percent \nand increased to 38 percent the share of the Mexican population \nsubsisting on $2.80 a day.\n  Does all this sound familiar, I ask my colleagues? It should. It \ncertainly should. Once again the administration is playing that same \nold tune to Congress and to the American people. The administration \nargues that U.S. exports to China will rise because tariffs will be \nlowered on goods like automobiles and auto parts. Sounds familiar, \ndoesn't it?\n  Additionally, unlike the Japanese yen or the Euro, or the Mexican \npeso, the exchange value of the Chinese currency does not float in the \ninternational market. It is largely determined by the Chinese \nGovernment, itself. In 1994, the Chinese devalued their currency in \norder to expand their exports and reduce their imports. Nothing in the \nbilateral agreement we have negotiated with China prevents the Chinese \nfrom such manipulation again.\n  In 1992, the Chinese and U.S. Governments signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding in which China agreed to provide access to U.S. goods in \nits markets, and to enforce U.S. intellectual property rights. \nPresident George Bush hailed this agreement as a breakthrough. The USTR \nunder President Bush claimed that the 1992 agreement would provide \n``American businesses, farmers, and workers with unprecedented access \nto a rapidly growing Chinese market with 1.2 billion people.'' Well, \nsince that much-touted 1992 agreement, U.S. exports to China have risen \nby about $7 billion. But look at this. Imports from China to the United \nStates have risen by $56 billion. Now, who won that round?\n  Yet, the Clinton administration continues to claim that this new \nagreement will ensure the political triumph of democracy-loving, U.S.-\nfriendly, free-market leaders in China, who can be trusted to live up \nto their end of the bargain. Someone downtown must be popping \n``gullible'' pills. That claim gives new meaning to the word ``naive''.\n  China's successful growth and modernization absolutely depend upon \nits ability to export to foreign markets in order to earn the hard \ncurrency needed to import new technology. China is currently running a \n$70 billion annual trade surplus with Uncle Sam, with the United \nStates. But China is running a trade deficit with the other major hard \ncurrency blocs--the European Monetary Union and Japan--a trend that \nwill continue into the foreseeable future. In order to pursue its own \nself-interests, China has to exploit the U.S. market to the maximum.\n\n  Given this agenda, in a totalitarian state, one can be sure that the \nfull force of the power of that state will be focused on protecting its \nmanufacturing, technological, and agricultural markets. No faction of \nChinese leaders can possibly deliver a more open economy to the United \nStates or to the WTO. It is fool's gold to make that claim--fool's \ngold. It is the economic and political reality of the Chinese situation \nand agenda that makes it all but certain that China will violate any \ntrade agreement, if it serves the national interests of China to do so.\n  We have not yet in this Senate or in this Nation or in this \nadministration come to grips with that fundamental reality. It will not \nbe different this\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\ntime. It will not be any different this time. The Chinese behave the \nway they do in matters of trade because they have to, to survive. They \ncannot and will not change. The Chinese Government is not some eager \npuppy, like my little dog Billy Byrd, panting to please the United \nStates or anybody else. The Chinese are committed to their own goals \nand their own interests and they will do whatever it takes to further \ntheir agenda.\n  The Clinton administration claims that China has agreed in the \nbilateral trade agreement to eliminate health-related barriers to U.S. \nmeat imports that were not based on scientific evidence. But, let's \nlisten to the words of Chinese trade negotiator, Long Yongtu. Let's \nhear what he said:\n\n       Diplomatic negotiations involve finding new expressions. If \n     you find a new expression, this means you have achieved a \n     diplomatic result. In terms of meat imports, we have not \n     actually made any material concessions.\n  And there is even more interesting commentary from China's chief \nnegotiator, Long Yongtu, in an article he authored on the impacts of \nWTO entry, as reported by the BBC. On the issue of a Chinese compromise \nwith the United States on the import of U.S. meat products he said, ``. \n. . in the United States people there think that China has opened its \ndoor wide for the import of meat. In fact, this is only a theoretical \nmarket opportunity. During diplomatic negotiations, it is imperative to \nuse beautiful words--for this will lead to success.''\n  We need to take note of the words of these Chinese officials. We need \nto listen more carefully. Beautiful words do not mean promises kept. \nSometimes when we in the United States hear ``yes'' the Chinese are \nonly saying ``maybe.''\n  The USTR asserts that ``China will establish large and increasing \ntariff-rate quotas for wheat--with a substantial share reserved for \nprivate trade.'' Yet again, Chinese negotiator Long Yongtu sees it \ndifferently. He has publicly stated that, although Beijing had agreed, \non paper, to allow 7.3 million tons of wheat from the United States to \nbe exported to the China mainland each year, it is a ``complete \nmisunderstanding'' to expect this grain to actually enter the country. \nThe Chinese negotiator said that in its agreement with the United \nStates, Beijing only conceded ``a theoretical opportunity for the \nexport of grain from the United States.'' We are suckers.\n\n  And yet, in the face of all of this contradiction by the Chinese, the \nClinton Administration actually expects us all to believe that the \nbilateral agreement, PNTR and the WTO will magically force the Chinese \ngovernment to shred its own national agenda, disregard its own needs \nand interests, even risk its own viability, in order to live up to an \nagreement with the United States. How naive can we be?\n  If anyone actually believes that, then let me introduce you to the \ntooth fairy; Tinkerbell; Mr. Ed, the talking horse; Snow White; the \nseven dwarfs; and Harvey, the invisible six foot rabbit.\n  This Senate and the administration--by all means, this \nadministration--should pay a little more attention to history.\n  Let us look again for a moment at the history of NAFTA. From the time \nof the North America Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994 through \n1998, the net export deficit with Mexico and Canada has grown. Over \n440,000 American jobs have been destroyed as a result of this growth.\n  Although gross U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada have shown a \ndramatic increase--with real growth of 92.1 percent with Mexico and \n56.9 percent to Canada, that is only half the picture. Let us turn the \ncorner. It is like knowing only one team's score or looking at only one \nside of the coin. We have to look at the other side of the coin to know \nwho is winning; namely, what are we importing from Mexico?\n  The increases in U.S. exports have been overwhelmed by what we import \nfrom Mexico. Those imports have shot up 139.3 percent from Mexico and \n58.8 percent from Canada. In 1993, before NAFTA was in effect, we had a \nnet export deficit with our NAFTA partners of $18.2 billion. From 1993 \nto 1998 that same net deficit increased by 160 percent to $47.3 \nbillion, resulting in job losses to American workers The first year \nNAFTA took effect, foreign direct investment in Mexico increased by 150 \npercent. Foreign direct investment in Canada has more than doubled \nsince 1993.\n  Those are American workers' jobs that are flying like geese--we have \nheard the wild geese flit across the sky on their way south--across the \nborders. Factories move over the border to take advantage of cheap \nlabor costs, and they take good-paying American jobs with them.\n\n  But, Senator Byrd, you may say, unemployment in the United States is \nat 4.1 percent. Our people have jobs. Our unemployment is very low. The \nanswer to that question lies in a closer scrutiny of the composition of \nU.S. employment. Good paying jobs with good benefits, largely in the \nmanufacturing sector, are leaving our shores and being replaced by low \nskill, low wage jobs in the services sector. There is a hidden agenda \nthat becomes apparent if one remembers the lessons of NAFTA and then \nponders PNTR with China. You heard them say at the convention: You \nain't seen nothing yet? Well, you ain't see nothing yet. Against that \nbackdrop, it becomes more than clear where we are headed. We have been \nhere before.\n  The objective for U.S. business is not access to the Chinese domestic \nconsumer market. Forget it. They cannot afford our goods. The objective \nis the business-friendly, pollution-friendly climate in China, which is \nadvantageous for moving production off U.S. shores and then selling \ngoods, now made in China, back to the United States--selling goods made \nby American manufacturers that move overseas back to the United States.\n  Are we really going to expect anything different from a deal with the \nChinese? Our trade deficit reached $340 billion in 1999. China accounts \nfor 20 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit. A U.S. International \nTrade Commission report stresses that China's WTO entry would \nsignificantly increase investment by U.S. multinationals inside China. \nAdditionally, the composition of Chinese imports has changed over the \nlast 10 years. In 1989, only 30 percent of what we imported from China \ncompeted with our high-wage, high-skilled industries here in the U.S. \nBy 1999, that percentage had risen to 50 percent.\n  The unvarnished, unmitigated, ungussied up truth is that American \ncompanies are eagerly eyeing China as an important production base for \nhigh-tech products. And these made-in-China goods are displacing goods \nmade in the good ole USA, Additionally, most U.S. manufacturing in \nChina is produced in conjunction with Chinese government agencies and \nstate-owned companies. So much for the claim that U.S. corporate \nactivity in China benefits Chinese entrepreneurs, and will lead to \nprivatization and, lo and behold, the emergence of a democratic China. \nGet it? The emergence of a democratic China.\n  If all this were not enough, a Senate report, made public last week, \ncharged the Chinese government with consistently failing ``to adhere to \nits nonproliferation commitments.'' In addition to outlining numerous \ninstances of Chinese weapons sales to Iran, Libya, and North Korea, the \nreport states, ``In many instances, Beijing merely mouths promises as a \nmeans of evading sanctions.''\n  Yet Senator Thompson only got 32 votes in favor of his amendment, \nwhich would have given the Congress a role in monitoring China's \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Senators, I could go on and on and on, but I believe there is more \nthan ample evidence that to grant PNTR to China at this time is very \nunwise. The signal we send by granting PNTR now is a signal of abject \nweakness. It is a signal of greed. It is a signal of ambivalence on the \nissue of nonproliferation. It is a signal of total disregard for the \noverwhelming evidence that the Chinese Government will not keep its \nword.\n  I fear that the benefits claimed to be derived from PNTR are really \nonly PR from the White House. They are selling us soap and we are \nlathering up. We are risking a lot on the unfulfilled promises \ncontained in the so-called bilateral trade agreement with China. Of \ncourse, the price for that deal was the administration's commitment to \nChina that they could get PNTR through the Congress this year. It is a \npackage deal--a\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\nnice little wagonload of a Chinese signature on the bilateral trade \nagreement and an unencumbered PNTR present from the Congress. The only \nproblem is that the wagon might be riding on Firestone tires. Shouldn't \nwe Senators use a little caution and put off climbing in that wagon? I \nam not getting on that wagon. Wouldn't it be more prudent to stay off \nthat wagon? Wouldn't that be the right choice for our Nation's people, \nthe right thing for our national security?\n  This legislation--PNTR--can wait and it ought to wait. As far as this \nSenator's vote is concerned, it will wait.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I sat here and listened to my good friend \nfrom West Virginia on trade. I believe I should speak from a position \nof representing a State that has benefited immensely from the trade \nagreements that we have passed recently--the North American Free Trade \nAgreement and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.\n  Exports from the State of Colorado, which I represent, have increased \ndramatically. In fact, we have experienced the greatest growth in \nexports of any State in the Nation on a percentage basis. The economy \nof the State of Colorado is based greatly on agriculture. My friend \nfrom West Virginia talked about agriculture to a certain degree. We \ngrow a lot of wheat. We raise a lot of livestock, and we do make an \nattempt to expand our markets to the Pacific rim countries, which \nincludes China.\n  We have a very modern economic base in the State. We work a lot on \nexporting high tech. Many high-tech companies do business in the State \nof Colorado. On a concentration basis, we have the highest \nconcentration of high-tech employees of any State in the country. So we \nbenefit from exporting goods, and the North American Free Trade \nAgreement has helped the State of Colorado, and GATT has also.\n  I happen to think that an agreement with China for normal trade \nrelations will help agriculture, and it will help States such as \nColorado because these are markets where we can compete and have been \ncompeting.\n  My colleague from West Virginia talked a considerable amount about \nthe trade deficits we are experiencing in this country. I come at the \ntrade deficit issue from a different perspective than my colleague from \nWest Virginia. I have looked at what happened historically with trade \ndeficits. If we look at the time of the Great Depression in this \ncountry, the trade deficits were low. If we look at the time when we \nwere suffering, when we had the misery index--and this is at the latter \npart of the 1970s, during the Carter administration--the trade deficit \nwas low. We had high double-digit unemployment. We had high double-\ndigit inflation, and we had high double-digit unemployment. But our \ntrade deficit was low. I happen to believe when we look at the trade \ndeficit, it is more of a reflection of what is happening economically \nin this country. Our country has experienced high trade deficits when \nour economy has been doing well, just like during the period of time we \nare in today.\n  So the figures he presents to you on trade deficits, in reality, they \ndo happen. What is the significance to the economy? I happen to believe \nit has the opposite impact. Many times, when people are evaluating the \nimpact of the trade deficit, they look at it only from the perspective \nof one industry. If you look at the total economy, the total growth of \njobs within this country, we benefit, in many cases, by importing \nproducts.\n  How does that work? Let's take an automobile, for example. Some State \nmay have a company--maybe in Michigan, for example--that could be \nimpacted by trade policies. But does that have a net impact on jobs in \nthe United States? Many times, when you take it into total \nconsideration, there is a net gain because there are jobs--union jobs--\ncreated when you have to unload those cars at our ports. There are jobs \ncreated when you have to clean up the cars when they come into the \ncountry. There are jobs created when you have to transport those cars \nacross the country to get them to a point of sale. Somebody has to sell \nthe cars. Jobs are created there. Somebody has to buy the cars. There \nis insurance sold in relation to the purchase of the car. Goods and \nservices relating to that go into the marketplace. Those cars have to \nbe maintained and operated and fixed. Many times, they go into a resale \nmarket at some point in their lifetime.\n\n  These are all jobs that are created as a result of having imported \nthat product. So I am convinced that our best policy is to work in a \nfree market environment, and the problem we have right now is not that \nwe don't place a lot of the tariffs and restrictions on Chinese goods \ncoming into this country, but China is the one that is placing \nrestrictions on our goods going into their country--particularly \nagricultural products and goods related to the high-tech industry. That \nis why I think this particular effort to create normal trade relations \nis beneficial. Isolationism doesn't work. Isolating a country and \nsaying that is going to help human rights--I don't think that works. \nThat is one reason why Taiwan, for example, supports our efforts to try \nto establish permanent normal trade relations with China.\n  So I think that in order to prevent human abuse, to protect human \nrights, we need to open up China. When our business people go into \nChina, they expect a certain standard. They just won't do business with \nChinese companies without those standards. They will have to abide by \ntheir contracts. If somebody doesn't honor the contract, there has to \nbe a court system of some type that will help enforce those contracts. \nAnd these all carry with them democratic principles.\n  When Chinese businessmen interact with American businessmen, they \nwill understand how the free enterprise system works, how democracy \nworks. I think we export democracy when we enter into a free market \nagreement where we take down trade barriers and increase the \ninteraction between countries--particularly when we are talking about a \ndemocratic county as opposed to a Communist one. They see there is a \ndifferent way of doing things and prospering that yields benefits far \nand above what they have been told in a country where the leaders \nrestrict information and restrict freedoms.\n  I think it is important we pass this piece of legislation that says \nwe will have permanent normal trade relations with China.\n  I see my colleague from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would be glad to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia. But I also know that I have a colleague from North Carolina \nwho would like to be recognized for some comments. I yield to my \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator mentioned my name. That is why I am asking him \nto yield.\n  I appreciate the fact that he has given us his viewpoint. My remarks \nwere largely based on research that has been done by the Economic \nPolicy Institute. It is dated November 1999. I am reading from a paper \nissued by the institute. It is headed with these words:\n\n       NAFTA's pain deepens. Job destruction accelerates from 1999 \n     with losses in every State.\n\n  It shows Colorado as having a net NAFTA job loss of 3,625 jobs. It \ndoesn't show as much for West Virginia as Colorado. West Virginia has a \nnet NAFTA loss of 1,183 jobs.\n  Let me say this to the Senator. I have been in Congress now 48 years. \nI have seen Democratic administrations, and I have seen Republican \nadministrations. The kind of talk we just heard from this Senator--I \nrespect him as a colleague, but I have to say this--is the same kind of \ntalk I have been hearing from these administrations for 48 years. That \nis State Department talk. It is the same old State Department talk.\n  I will say to this Senator, we are going to get taken to the \ncleaners. We have been taken to the cleaners all these 48 years by \nother countries. In these ventured agreements, our negotiators for some \nreason or other always come out second. We have been taken to the \ncleaners. We will be taken again.\n  The Senator stated his opinion. That is this Senator's opinion, and \nit is based on 48 years of hearing this same line that emanates from--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has the floor.\n\n[[Page S8685]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask the Senator to let me reclaim my time. I appreciate \nhis comments. We have a Senator from North Carolina who would like to \nhave an opportunity to speak. I think we are working under some time \nguidelines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would like to briefly respond. I am speaking from the \nexperience of a Senator who represents a State that has benefited from \nfree trade policy. It is not State Department talk, it is what we have \nseen economically. I wanted to respond, and I would like to yield my \ntime to the Senator from North Carolina to be recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time did I use on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used 22 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator from North Carolina need? I \nwill yield him half of my time. I ask that time that has been absorbed \nin this colloquy come out of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 25 minutes of his 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I reserve my 5 minutes.\n  We will be taken to the cleaners again. Mark my word.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a chart prepared by \nthe Economic Policy Institute on ``NAFTA job loss by State, 1993-98.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               TABLE 3.--NAFTA JOB LOSS BY STATE, 1993-98\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Net NAFTA\n                                                             job loss.--\n                           State                             No. of jobs\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama....................................................      -11,594\nAlaska.....................................................         -395\nArizona....................................................       -3,296\nArkansas...................................................       -6,663\nCalifornia.................................................      -44,132\nColorado...................................................       -3,625\nConnecticut................................................       -4,616\nDelaware...................................................         -866\nDistrict of Columbia.......................................         -798\nFlorida....................................................      -13,841\nGeorgia....................................................      -15,784\nHawaii.....................................................         -907\nIdaho......................................................       -1,397\nIllinois...................................................      -16,980\nIndiana....................................................      -21,063\nIowa.......................................................       -4,850\nKansas.....................................................       -3,452\nKentucky...................................................       -8,917\nLouisiana..................................................       -3,245\nMaine......................................................       -1,877\nMaryland...................................................       -3,981\nMassachusetts..............................................       -8,362\nMichigan...................................................      -31,851\nMinnesota..................................................       -6,345\nMississippi................................................       -8,245\nMissouri...................................................      -10,758\nMontana....................................................       -1,139\nNebraska...................................................       -1,751\nNevada.....................................................       -2,342\nNew Hampshire..............................................       -1,265\nNew Jersey.................................................      -11,045\nNew Mexico.................................................       -1,268\nNew York...................................................      -27,844\nNorth Carolina.............................................      -24,118\nNorth Dakota...............................................         -732\nOhio.......................................................      -19,098\nOklahoma...................................................       -3,018\nOregon.....................................................       -5,359\nPennsylvania...............................................      -20,918\nRhode Island...............................................       -4,234\nSouth Carolina.............................................       -7,305\nSouth Dakota...............................................       -1,217\nTennessee..................................................      -18,332\nTexas......................................................      -18,752\nUtah.......................................................       -2,973\nVermont....................................................         -597\nVirginia...................................................       -9,797\nWashington.................................................       -8,331\nWest Virginia..............................................       -1,183\nWisconsin..................................................       -9,314\nWyoming....................................................         -402\n    U.S. total.............................................     -440,172\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \\1\\Excluding effects on wholesale and retail trade and advertising.\n \n \\2\\Source: EPI analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau\n  data.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair for recognizing me. In a moment, I hope \nthe Chair will allow me the privilege of making my remarks seated at my \ndesk. But I want to say that Senator Byrd says he has been here 38 \nyears.\n  Mr. BYRD. Forty-eight years.\n  Mr. HELMS. Forty-eight years. I have only been here 28 years, and I \nhave the same opinion the Senator does about the State Department. I \nhave said many times how proud I am that the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia is a native of North Carolina because he was born there. \nHe moved at a very early age to West Virginia, a State which he has \nrepresented ably. But I admire the Senator for many reasons. We don't \nalways agree. But I will tell you one thing. This Senator is dedicated. \nWhen I say ``this Senator,'' I mean Senator Robert C. Byrd of West \nVirginia. He is dedicated to the proposition that this Senate shall \noperate in an orderly way. He made some remarks today about the unusual \ncharacter of the way the voting time on this measure was arranged, and \nI objected to it as he did. I think it ill becomes the Senate. I hope \nit never happens again.\n  Mr. President, if I may take my seat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wishes to know who yields time.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today the Senate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend for a moment, the \nChair needs to know whose time this time is coming from.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield my 5 remaining minutes to the Senator from North \nCarolina. I don't have control of the time other than that.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thought I had gained the floor in my own right. But I \nappreciate that very much. I will not take long in any case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time comes from Senator Lott's \ntime.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will reach the \nend of the debate on H.R. 4444, a bill to legislate permanent normal \ntrade relations to and with the People's Republic of China.\n  The debate, yes, will end this afternoon. But I can assure you that \njust now beginning is a debate about the future of United States and \nChina relations.\n  The outcome of today's vote was well known long before the first \nsyllable of debate resulted. I recall the objection stated by Senator \nByrd, and I objected to the procedure as well because it was a pro \nforma action about how the consideration of H.R. 4444 was going to be \nconducted and the concluding result was to be final passage without \neven one amendment to be added.\n  I don't think that is becoming of the Senate, but I shall not refer \nto the Senate's posture as a conspiracy, but it is a first cousin to \none, and I remain exceedingly troubled by what has transpired. I \nfervently hope it never happens to the Senate again.\n  The outcome of this debate was decided before any Senator even sought \nto be recognized by the Presiding Officer to make his or her case for \nor against PNTR. But all that aside, the Senate will shortly vote, and \nI trust that all Senators' votes will be cast with the courage of their \nreal convictions and not convictions determined by others for them.\n  I commend my friend, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth, and the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, for their defense of ``their'' \nbill. Both Bill Roth and Pat Moynihan have been exceedingly \naccommodating to me and to other Senators.\n  But there was a stacked deck that guaranteed approval of H.R. 4444. \nIt was evident from the start. I shall always be grateful to Senators \nwho endeavored to ensure a serious debate, and for their courage and \nresolve.\n  I express my admiration to, among others, Senator Byrd and Senator \nThompson, Senators Bob Smith, John Kyl, Paul Wellstone. These Senators \nwere Churchillian in their efforts. Sir Winston Churchill demonstrated \nseven or eight decades ago that there would be no stacked deck when he \ncourageously called for a principled confrontation against the \ndespotism of Nazi Germany.\n  In the course of the Senate's debate, we did succeed in making an \nindisputable record concerning the deplorable state of human rights in \nChina. And we did succeed in exposing the heinous practice of forced \nabortion. And we did succeed in focusing the attention of our Nation, \nand I think of the world, on the peril of China's proliferation.\n  If I may again mention Mr. Churchill, the press paid him scant \nattention when he cast his warnings about the trip of the Prime \nMinister of Great Britain to Munich where he met with Adolph Hitler, \nand then came back to London for a big press conference proclaiming \n``Peace in our time.'' Mr. Chamberlain proclaimed that that fellow \nHitler was someone the British people could live with.\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\n  Mr. President, I sincerely fear that this bill will have serious \nconsequences because of its profound implications for the future of \nU.S.-China relations, relations totally unlike the happy ones described \nby the bill's advocates.\n  The interests of various American businesses will, no doubt, be \nserved, but to those of us who have worked in the Senate Chamber during \nthis debate, it is highly questionable whether the national interests \nof either the United States or the interests of the people of China--\nthe people of China--will be served.\n  As I mention ever so often, when I was a little boy I was interested \nin the Chinese people and their culture. That interst grew as the years \nwent by. During my 28 years as a U.S. Senator, I have met with and \nworked with hundreds of Chinese students, delightful young people, \nbright and without exception having expressed profound hopes and \nprayers that their homeland can one day enjoy the freedom that the \nAmerican people have by inheritance.\n  So clearly and without a trace of equivocation, I have the deepest \nadmiration for the Chinese people--I repeat that for emphasis--and it \nis my fervent hope and my prayer that one day they will be freed from \nthe brutal dictatorship that now controls their lives.\n  I sincerely believe that the majority of the American people share \nthat feeling. I have had people stop me in the corridors. Just a few \nmoments ago, I had the Commander of the American Legion from my State \nstopped me to say that he agreed with my position. I hear it over and \nover--in the mail we receive, in the e-mail, the faxes and letters.\n  Mr. President, there is unquestionably an enormous potential for a \ndeep and lasting relationship of respect between the people of our \ncountry and the people of China. I have long been convinced that what \nseparates us is not animosity between our peoples.\n  It is the Communist dictatorship in Beijing which neither speaks for, \nnor rules by, the consent of the Chinese people.\n  Today in China, millions of courageous people struggle for democracy \nand for religious freedom and for basic human rights. Because when they \ndare to do so, they are beaten and they are jailed; they are tortured \nand often murdered. It is for these freedom-seeking Chinese that I \nstand here today.\n  Their interests, not the interests of corporate America, are my \npriority. And that is why I have not been able to support H.R. 4444. \nMr. President, there are many bureaucratic contacts and exchanges \nbetween the U.S. and the Chinese Government. Some of my good friends, \nand friends of many of us in this Senate, have traveled to China time \nand time again, exchanged toasts with Chinese Communist leaders, \nclinked glasses of wine; but the attitude of the Communist Government \nhas never changed.\n  It still throws decent Chinese citizens in jail. It still denies the \nChinese people the most basic political liberties. So giving permanent \nnormal trade relations to the Government of China will indeed destroy \nan important lever that we now have, and have had, to influence Chinese \nbehavior. We are tossing it aside.\n  The advocates of PNTR have repeatedly declared that this enactment \nwill help the cause of democracy and human rights in China. Those \ndeclarations will now be put to the test and the ball will be in the \ncourt of Beijing. With today's vote, the Chinese Government is being \ngiven an historic opportunity to change the course of U.S.-Chinese \nrelations for the good.\n  The Chinese Government has not confronted such a challenge since \nBeijing's tragic decision--remember--in Tiananmen Square, when a tank \ncrushed a peaceful student protest, crushed that young man into paste. \nThat was 11 years ago and nothing has changed since.\n  To seize upon this moment and make me be proven wrong, China must act \nquickly, not merely to open its markets as required under the agreement \nwith the United States but open its society as well, to demonstrate a \ncommitment to humane treatment of its people at home, and a more benign \nand peaceful approach to its relationship with its neighboring \ncountries. The Chinese Government must cease the suppression of \nreligious liberties.\n\n  Even the Washington Post commented on that this morning in a well-\nwritten, well-thought-out editorial. The Chinese Government must put an \nend to the abhorrent practice of forced abortion. And with regard to \nthe democratic Government of Taiwan, China must demonstrate that it is \ncommitted to peaceful dialog as being the only option for resolving \ndifferences between Taiwan and the Communist mainland.\n  Mr. President, I would be less than honest if I did not confess my \ngreat apprehension that there will be little if any real change by the \nChinese Government as a result of our passing this measure. But if real \nchange is to take place, the United States must more aggressively \nsupport the aspirations of the hundreds of millions of Chinese people \nwho want their homeland to become a nation that is both great and good.\n  We must reach out to those people who are struggling for a freer, \nmore open and more democratic China, and make clear to them that the \nAmerican people stand with them. We must make clear to the Chinese \nGovernment that it will not be in their interests to continue their \noppression of their own people, that in the long run totalitarian \ndictatorship cannot be tolerated.\n  So if the advocates of PNTR prove to be wrong, and if nothing changes \nin China in the wake of the Senate's final approval of PNTR this \nafternoon, I will devote whatever strength and influence I may possess \nto limit any and all conceivable benefits that this legislation may \nhold for the Chinese Communist Government.\n  I am nearly through, but I want to emphasize that, like many others \nin the Senate, I am a father and a grandfather. I am a grandfather who \nyearns for a peaceful world for my family and for all Americans.\n  Better relations with China are an important hope of a peaceful \nworld, but not better relations at any price. Too often in history, \nsome of the world's great democracies have sought to coexist with, even \nto appease, dangerous and tyrannical regimes.\n  I mentioned at the outset Winston Churchill, who took his stand \nagainst his country's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who had \nvisited with Adolf Hitler in Munich, then returning to London \nproclaiming there would be ``peace in our time'' and that Britain need \nnot fear Nazi Germany.\n  There was that one man who stood up and said no, Winston Churchill, \nwho was to lead the free world into combat in one of the worst \ntyrannies history has ever known.\n  We must not repeat the mistake of Britain's Prime Minister seven \ndecades ago. I have absolutely nothing against American business men \nand women making a profit. I want them to make a profit. I believe in \nthe free enterprise system. I believe I have demonstrated that in all \nof my career.\n  But the safety and security of the American people must come first \nthrough the principles of this country which were laid down by our \nFounding Fathers. That safety and security will be assured ultimately \nnot by appeasement, not by the hope of trade at any cost, but by \ndealing with Communist China without selling out the very moral and \nspiritual principles that made America great in the first place.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased we are about to complete \nthe debate on PNTR and are about to take the final vote. It has been a \ngood debate. It has been a time when the American people have had an \nopportunity to learn more about what PNTR for China actually will be.\n  There are good arguments on all sides, but I am quite happy, frankly, \nthat now we are at the end of this long process, finally the United \nStates will grant permanent normal trade relations to China. We are \nfinally putting that issue to bed, and some side issues, too, have been \nput off to the side, as important as they are.\n  Many of the issues raised on the Senate floor not directly relevant \nto PNTR have been very good ones. Proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, human rights, religion freedom, environment, prison labor, \nTaiwan-PRC relationship are very important matters that, in some cases, \ngo to the heart of American policy. They are clearly issues that need \nto be debated and resolved. The United States has a very important \nstake in all of them.\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\n  Some of the amendments that have been proposed to PNTR in these last \nfew weeks have been good ones; others, not so good. Fortunately, a \nmajority of my colleagues opposed all amendments to the PNTR bill, even \nwhen we agreed with the underlying concerns. Why? Basically because any \namendment that would be part of PNTR would be killer amendments due to \nthe very short number of remaining days in this session. Because of \nPresidential politics, which is engulfing us to some degree, it is much \nmore prudent not to adopt amendments at this time. In the next \nCongress, we will have an opportunity to deal with these issues. I hope \nwe can deal with them, particularly based on the merits.\n\n  I want to take a moment to discuss what will happen after the PNTR \nvote. It is more to remind ourselves that despite the successful \nconclusion of the debate, when the votes are counted later today, they \nwill not create a single job. Our votes will not sell a single bushel \nof wheat. Rather, PNTR is an enabler. It is a vital enabler. It enables \nAmerican businesses and American people to do much more than they can \nnow do.\n  The immediate next step of completion of PNTR is completion of \nnegotiations in Geneva on the Protocol of Accession and the Working \nParty Report to the WTO General Council. Once China formally accedes--\nthat is, becomes a member of WTO--we Americans will remove China from \nthe restrictions of the Jackson-Vanik legislation. That is when it \nhappens. At that point, the American private sector has to take \nadvantage of the immense new opportunities afforded by China's \nmembership in the WTO.\n  Passage of PNTR will be one for the history books with profound \nimplications for the United States. Once it passes, we Americans have \nto put our shoulders to the wheel. We have to follow up. American \nindustry has to follow up. The American Government has to follow up in \na way that we enable ourselves to maximize potential benefits to our \nservice providers and to our manufacturers. We have to take matters in \nour own hands. We have to take advantage of this. The same is true for \nthe U.S. Government at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the executive \nbranch as well as the legislative branch. We need to watch China and \nmonitor China's compliance to make sure this agreement is implemented.\n  I am reminded of another agreement we had earlier with China --that \nis the intellectual property rights agreement--because some Chinese \nfirms were pirating America's films, CDs, cassettes, and other \nintellectual property created in the United States. We finally urged \nChina to pass a law making the pirating of intellectual property \nillegal in China. China passed the law. The problem is they did not \nimplement it. We had to go back and encourage implementation. We may \nface the same problems here. I hope not. It is possible.\n  As we move ahead, we must never forget how multifaceted our \nrelationship with China is. That means we must aggressively address the \nmany important issues raised in the PNTR debate. As important as those \nissues are, they should not be on the bill, but they still indicate the \nmultifaceted nature of our relationship with China.\n  One major area is focusing on our strategic architecture in Asia. \nAssuring stability in the region, helping maintain peace and \nprosperity, and a presence of American troops are vital factors, as are \nother major strategic questions. They are extremely important. All \nparts of our relationship with China and passage of PNTR raise the \nprobability we will be more successful in that area.\n  We must also take measures to help incorporate China positively into \nthe region, and we must encourage China into the role of a responsible \nactor, both in the Asian region and globally.\n  The growth in commercial and economic activity now developing between \nus and China should form a pillar on which we can build a stable \nrelationship. There are no guarantees. There never are guarantees in \nlife. One has to do the best with what one has, with the resources one \nhas available. Passage of PNTR gives us more resources. It is an \nenabler to help us increase the probability of a stronger commercial \nand economic relationship to help form that pillar. Again, there is no \nguarantee.\n  We must also try to avoid the constant ups and downs that have \ncharacterized the bilateral relationship over the past 30 years.\n  I am not going to stand here and chronicle the volatility of the ups \nand downs, but I do think it is important for us to lop off the peaks \nand the valleys in this somewhat volatile relationship with China as \nbest we can, recognizing that we are only one side of the equation and \nChina, of course, is the other.\n  But the more we try and the more we engage them at lots of different \nlevels--whether it is trade, artistic exchanges, cultural exchanges, or \nmilitary exchanges--the more likely it is we will not have to be so \ninvolved in this volatile activity. That means a stronger economic \nrelationship between our two countries, which I think will be a major \nconsequence of the passage of this bill.\n  I thank all my colleagues. This is going to be a good, solid vote. It \nis going to indicate that the United States is a player in the world \ncommunity, that the United States is not retrenching itself, but moving \nforward, and that the United States is living up to its \nresponsibilities as the leader, frankly, of the world in a way that is \npositive, constructive, and exercising its constructive roles. I am \nvery proud of the action the Senate is about to take.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am prepared to support PNTR for China, \nbut I still have reservations about China's willingness to fulfill its \nprevious trade commitments particularly as it pertains to insurance.\n  First, I want to express my appreciation to President Clinton and \nAmbassador Barshevsky who have been forceful advocates in ensuring that \nChina keeps its end of the bargain and fully implements the 1999 \nbilateral agreement between our two nations. Last week, President \nClinton and President Jiang Zemin held a frank and detailed discussion \nabout China keeping its commitment to allow U.S. insurers to expand in \nChina under the grandfathered right to operate through their current \nbranch structure.\n  In response, President Jiang pledged that China will ``honor its \ncommitments to further opening its domestic market'' to grandfathered \ninsurance companies. This is a positive, but still ambiguous statement \nwhich I hope the Chinese president will clarify. And in clarifying his \nposition, I hope President Jiang understands that should U.S. insurers \nbe denied the grandfathered rights to branch in China, it would result \nin a serious degradation of the ``terms and conditions'' for insurance \nthat were negotiated by USTR last November.\n  The problem extends beyond insurance to the heart of the PNTR \nagreement. Should PNTR become law, the President must certify:\n\n       . . . that the terms and conditions for the accession of \n     the People's Republic of China to the World Trade \n     Organization are at least equivalent to those agreed between \n     the United States and People's Republic of China on November \n     15, 1999.\n\n  Anything less than full compliance in honoring China's commitment to \ngrandfather U.S. insurers' branching rights will inhibit the \nPresident's ability to certify that the equivalent requirement has been \nmet.\n  Every business that trades with China is looking to see how this \nmatter is resolved because they need to know that trade agreements will \ntruly be followed. If China wants to engage in the free market, its \nleaders must know that trade agreements are not arbitrary documents but \nironclad commitments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in expressing \nsupport for passage of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. \nThis is the right thing to do for the country, and it is the right \nthing to do for my state of North Dakota.\n  I think it is important at the outset to make it clear what this vote \nis about--and what it is not about. This vote is about making sure that \nU.S. farmers, businesses, and workers receive the benefits of China's \naccession to the World Trade Organization. The agreement on China's \naccession is a clear win for the United States. China has made \nconcession after concession, lowering tariffs and removing other \nbarriers to U.S. exports. The U.S. has made no such concessions. But if \nwe\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\nfail to pass Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, we will not be \nable to take full advantage of these opportunities but will instead \ncede them to our competitors.\n  There has been a lot of misleading talk and innuendo about what PNTR \nreally means. PNTR is not a special privilege, and it does not signify \nour approval of China's domestic or foreign policies. In fact, we \ncontinue to have many differences with China that we can and should \nwork vigorously to resolve. PNTR would simply grant China the same \ntrading status that the United States has with more than 130 other \ncountries around the world: nothing more, nothing less. And it would \ngrant China the same status going forward that it has had continuously \nfor the last twenty years. The only change is that the Congress no \nlonger would hold an annual vote on China's trade status, a vote that \nhas never denied China Normal Trade Relations but that has set back our \nefforts to engage China on human rights and other issues.\n  The PNTR debate is primarily about trade, so let me start by talking \nabout the trade benefits for our country. As my colleagues know, this \nvote is not about whether China should be part of the WTO. There is no \nquestion that China will join the WTO. The only question is whether the \nUnited States will reap the benefits of the many concessions China has \nmade, or whether our farmers, businesses and workers will be left out. \nThat would be a profound mistake.\n  China has the world's largest population: 1.3 billion potential \ncustomers for American products. For years, our market has been open to \nChinese imports, but China's market has largely been closed to our \nproducts. This agreement will open China's market to our exports. And \nthis is a market that has terrific growth potential. China's economy is \nthe fastest growing in the world, and China's expanding middle class \nwill demand more and more imports of American consumer goods.\n  The agreement reached last November allows us unprecedented access to \nthis huge and growing market. On manufactured goods, tariffs will fall \nfrom a current average of nearly 25 percent to less than ten percent. \nOn services, China has agreed to phase out a broad array of laws \nregulations and policies that have blocked U.S. firms from competing in \nthis growing market.\n  But I am especially pleased at the prospects for increased \nagricultural exports. Around the world, average tariffs on U.S. \nagricultural exports are more than 40 percent. China is slashing its \ntariffs to far below this average: 17.5 percent. And on U.S. priority \nproducts--the products that we produce for export--the average Chinese \ntariff will fall to just 14 percent. For bulk commodities the agreement \nestablishes generous tariff rate quotas. For example, on wheat, a major \nexport product for North Dakota, China will allow imports of 7.3 \nmillion metric tons initially (growing to 9.6 million tons by 2004) \nsubject to a tariff of just 1 percent. In addition, China has agreed to \nchanges in its administration of tariff rate quotas that will prevent \nstate trading monopolies from blocking imports if there is private \nsector demand for wheat.\n\n  For my State of North Dakota, the agreement provides new export \nopportunities for wheat, for oilseeds, including canola, and for beef \nand pork products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated \nthat this agreement could add $1.6 billion annually to U.S. exports of \ngrains, oilseeds and cotton in just five years. Additional growth \nopportunities for North Dakota agricultural exports will come as China \nreduces its tariffs on beef (from 45 percent today to 12 percent by \n2004) and pork (from 20 percent to 12 percent). Finally, the China \nagreement provides additional leverage for U.S. goals in the ongoing \nWTO negotiations on agriculture. China has agreed to eliminate export \nsubsidies, to cap and reduce domestic subsidies, and to provide the \nright to import and distribute products without going through state \ntrading enterprises.\n  There can be no question that this agreement will create expanded \nexport opportunities for American workers, farmers and businesses. But \nthe key word here is ``opportunities.'' This agreement creates \nwonderful opportunities for North Dakota agriculture, but it is not a \nsilver bullet. This agreement will not solve all of our trade problems \nwith China. Nor will the results come overnight. We will need to work \naggressively year after year to take advantage of these opportunities \nand turn them into results. And we will need to closely monitor China's \nimplementation of its commitments.\n  In that vein, I am very pleased that the legislation we are \nconsidering includes provisions I strongly supported to ensure that the \nFederal government monitors and enforces China's WTO accession \nagreement. And I am hopeful that the WTO's multilateral dispute \nresolution system will be more successful than our past unilateral \nefforts to hold China to its commitments. The simple fact is that the \ncurrent system has not worked well. There has been no neutral \narbitrator to resolve disputes. As a result, U.S. firms have been very \nreluctant for the U.S. to take action against China because of Chinese \nthreats to retaliate against American business. With China in the WTO, \nwe will have the advantage of a neutral dispute resolution system and \nrules to guard against Chinese retaliation.\n  In my view, the trade benefits alone are enough to conclude that we \nshould support PNTR for China. But this debate is about more than just \ntrade. It is about human rights and national security as well. I \nbelieve bringing China into the WTO and passing PNTR is the best way to \nimprove human rights in China. Clearly, our current annual debate over \nNormal Trade Relations has had little effect on human rights in China. \nBringing China into the WTO, though, will increase the openness of \nChinese society. It will increase the presence of American and other \nWestern firms in China. It will open China to the InterNet and other \nadvanced telecommunications technologies that, over time, will expose \naverage Chinese to our thoughts, values, and ideals on human rights, \nworkers' rights and democracy.\n  This is not just my view. It is a view shared by numerous prominent \nChinese dissidents and religious and democratic leaders. They believe \nthat rejecting PNTR will only strengthen the iron hand of the hard-\nliners in the Chinese leadership. For example, Bao Tong, a prominent \ndissident, was quoted in the Washington Post saying that attempts to \nuse trade sanctions on human rights simply do not work: ``I appreciate \nthe efforts of friends and colleagues to help our human rights \nsituation, but it doesn't make sense to use trade as a lever. It just \ndoesn't work,'' Mr. Bao said. Similarly, Dai Qing, a leading Chinese \nenvironmentalist, argues that passing PNTR ``would put enormous \npressure on both the government and the general public to meet the \ninternational standard not only on trade, but on other issues including \nhuman rights and environmental protection.'' Finally, the Dalai Lama \nhas said that ``joining the World Trade Organization, I think, is one \nway to change in the right direction. . . . In the long run, certainly \nit will be positive for Tibet. Forces of democracy in China get more \nencouragement through that way.''\n  Finally, I believe that passing PNTR will promote our national \nsecurity interests. History teaches us that conflicts among trading \npartners are less likely than conflicts between countries that do not \nhave strong economic ties. In contrast, rejecting PNTR could send a \nstrong signal to China that the U.S. wants to isolate China. A hostile \nChina is not in our national interest. A China integrated into the \ninternational system, obeying international rules and norms, is.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the arguments in favor of PNTR for \nChina are very strong. Passing PNTR advances America's interests in \nAsia and the world. It is good for our national economy, and it is \nparticularly good for my state's agricultural economy. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in sending a strong bipartisan message of \nsupport for China's accession to the WTO.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this has been a very difficult debate for \nall of us in the Senate who care about labor rights, about human \nrights, and about the environment in China.\n  These issues are important, and we can't ignore them. I especially \ncommend the many leaders throughout the country on labor issues, human \nrights issues, and environmental issues for\n\n[[Page S8689]]\n\nstating their case and their concerns on these challenges so eloquently \nand effectively. It's clear that we must do more than this agreement \ndoes to make sure that free trade is also fair--that it improves the \nquality of life of people everywhere, and creates good jobs here at \nhome.\n  The demonstrations at last year's WTO negotiations in Seattle and in \nother cities since then show that we must pay much greater attention to \nthese concerns. Too often the current system of trade enriches multi-\nnational corporations at the expense of working families, leaving \nworkers without jobs and without voices in the new global economy. Too \nmany companies export high-wage, full-benefit jobs from our country and \nreplace them with lower-paying jobs in the third world countries with \nfew, if any, benefits.\n  For too many families across America, globalization has become a \n``race to the bottom'' in wages, benefits, and living standards. In \nrecent years, corporate stock prices have often increased in almost \ndirect proportion to employee layoffs, benefit reductions, and job \nexports. This growing inequality threatens our own economic growth and \nprosperity, and we must do all we can to end it.\n  I am also very concerned about a trade deficit that continues to grow \nat an alarming pace. In this historic time of economic prosperity, the \ntrade deficit remains one of the most stubborn challenges we face. \nWhile the current trade deficit is clearly a sign that the U.S. economy \nis the strongest economy in the world, we cannot sustain this enormous \nnegative balance of trade for the long term. We risk losing even more \nof our industrial and manufacturing base to foreign countries with \nlower labor standards.\n  Similarly, all of us who care about human rights and environmental \nrights must find more effective ways to address these concerns. The \nflagrant violations of human rights that continue to take place in \nChina are unacceptable. And so is the callous disregard of the \nenvironment by that nation as its economy advances.\n  The answer to these festering problems is to give these fundamental \nissues a fair place at international bargaining tables. Clearly, we do \nnot do enough for labor rights, human rights, and the environment when \nwe negotiate trade agreements.\n  I intend to vote for this agreement, however--as flawed as it is--\nbecause I am concerned that the alternative would be even less \nsatisfactory. But I welcome the Administration's commitment to give \nthese other issues higher priority in future trade negotiations, and I \nlook forward to working to achieve these essential goals.\n  The global marketplace is a reality, and the United States stands to \ngain much more by participating in it than by rejecting it. I'm hopeful \nthat we will be able to work together in the future on these basic \nissues in ways that bring us together, not divide us.\n  It is especially significant that all of the economic concessions \nmade in this agreement are made by China. It will not change our own \nmarket access policies at all. The concessions that China has made are \nsubstantial, and President Clinton and his Administration deserve \ncredit for this success. In particular, US Trade Representative \nCharlene Barshefsky did a excellent job negotiating this agreement for \nthe United States.\n  By approving PNTR, Congress is not deciding to accept China into the \nWorld Trade Organization. China will join the WTO regardless of our \nvote in Congress. What Congress is deciding is whether to accept or \nreject the extraordinary economic concessions that China has offered to \nthe United States. If we reject PNTR, we reject the bulk of the \nconcessions that China reluctantly made. We would be allowing China to \nkeep its barriers up--and we might well be inviting the WTO to impose \nsanctions against us for not playing by the rules we agreed to.\n  Within five years, under this agreement, China will completely end \nits tariffs on information technology. It will eliminate its \ngeographical limitations on the sale of financial services and \ninsurance. It will do away with quotas on products such as fiber-optic \ncable. And it will end the requirement to hire a Chinese government \n``middle-man'' to sell and distribute products and services in China. \nThese are major concessions that no one could have predicted even two \nyears ago.\n  China has also agreed to eliminate export subsidies. The inefficient, \nstate-owned industries in China will no longer be able to rely on \ngovernment support to stay afloat. They will be required to compete on \na level playing field. China has agreed that its state-owned industries \nwill make decisions on purely commercial terms, and will allow US \ncompanies to operate on the same terms.\n  The agreement also contains strong provisions against unfair trade \nand import surges. We will have at our disposal effective measures to \nprevent the dumping of subsidized products into American markets for \nyears to come. The agreement contains strong and immediate protections \nfor intellectual property rights, which will benefit important US \nindustries such as software, medical technology, and publishing. Strong \nprotections are also included against forced technology transfer from \nprivate companies to the Chinese government--a provision that has \nbenefits for both commercial enterprises and national security.\n  All of these protections and concessions will be lost if Congress \nfails to pass PNTR. Rejection of this agreement would put American \nbusinesses and workers at a major disadvantage with our competitors in \nEurope and in many other nations in securing access to the largest \nmarket in the world.\n  One out of every ten jobs in Massachusetts is dependent upon exports, \nand that number is increasing. If we accept the concessions that China \nhas given us, companies in cities and towns across the state will be \nmore competitive. More exports will be stimulated, and more jobs will \nbe created here at home.\n  It is clear that many of our businesses will reap significant \nbenefits from this trade agreement. But it is also clear that some \nbusinesses and workers will be hurt by it as well. It is our \nresponsibility to do everything we can to reduce the harm that free \ntrade creates. We must strengthen trade adjustment assistance and \nworker training programs. As we open our doors wider to the global \neconomy, we must do much more to ensure that American workers are ready \nto compete. We must make the education and training of our workforce a \nhigher priority as we ask our citizens to compete with workers across \nthe globe. Importing skilled foreign labor is no substitute for fully \ndeveloping the potential of our domestic workforce. The growth in the \nglobal marketplace makes education and training more important than \never.\n  We need to create high-tech training opportunities on a much larger \nscale for American workers who currently hold relatively low-paying \njobs and wish to obtain new skills to enhance their employability and \nimprove their earning potential. As the economy becomes more global and \nmore competitive, it would be irresponsible to open the doors to new \nforeign competition, without giving our own workers the skills they \nneed to compete and excel. I'm very hopeful that passage of this \nagreement will provide a strong new incentive for more effective action \nby Congress on all these important issues.\n  The issue of PNTR also involves major foreign policy and national \nsecurity considerations. When China joins the World Trade Organization, \nit will be required to abide by the rules and regulations of the \ninternational community. The Chinese government will be obligated to \npublish laws and regulations and to submit important decisions to \ninternational review. By integrating China into this global, rules-\nbased system, the international community will have procedures never \navailable in the past to hold the government of China accountable for \nits actions, and to promote the development of the rule of law in \nChina.\n  The WTO agreement will encourage China to continue its market reforms \nand support new economic freedoms. Already, 30 percent of the Chinese \neconomy is privatized. Hard-line Chinese leaders fear that as China \nbecomes more exposed to Western ideas, their grip on power will be \nweakened, along with their control over individual citizens.\n  As the economic situation improves, China will be able to carry out \nbroader\n\n[[Page S8690]]\n\nand deeper reforms. While economic reforms are unlikely to result \nimmediately and directly in political reforms, they are likely to \nproduce conditions that will be more conducive to democracy in China in \nthe years ahead.\n  All of us deplore China's abysmal record on human rights and labor \nrights and the environment, and we have watched with dismay as these \nabuses have continued. It is unlikely that approving PNTR will lead to \nan immediate and dramatic improvement in China's record on these \nfundamental issues. But after many years of debate, the pressure \ncreated by the annual vote on China's trade status has not solved those \nproblems either.\n  Approving PNTR leaves much to be desired on all of these essential \nissues. But on balance, I believe that it can be a realistic step \ntoward achieving the long-sought freedoms that will benefit all the \npeople of China. The last thing we need is a new Cold War with China.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the legislation \npending before the Senate on Permanent Normal Trade Relations with \nChina. I support this bill not only because it is in the best interest \nof American farmers, businesses, and consumers; but also because \npassage of PNTR is the best way for America to have a positive \ninfluence on China's domestic policies, including policies affecting \nbasic human rights.\n  I believe that this bill has been characterized by many of my \nesteemed colleagues as something that it is not--a reward to China \ndespite its poor human rights record. Surely, we do not agree with the \ntreatment of China's citizens, just as surely as we do not agree with \nso many other practices of the Chinese government. However, it is \nimportant to remember that China will become a member of the WTO no \nmatter how we vote. If the Congress were to vote against Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations, many of our trading partners will receive the \nmyriad benefits of trading with China, while our farmers, our \nbusinesses, . . . our citizens would be excluded.\n  Furthermore, the interest we have in promoting human rights \nprotection in China is not defeated with the passing of this bill. The \nCongress has used its annual review of Normal Trade Relations to push \nChina to become more democratic, to treat its citizens with basic \ndecency, and to discourage Chinese participation in the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. We now have the opportunity to assist \nour allies in bringing China into the world trading community. And by \nbringing China further into the global community, the real \nbeneficiaries of PNTR, and eventual membership in the WTO, will be the \nChinese people. The Chinese people will benefit from the new economic \nopportunities created by increased trade. The Chinese people will \nbenefit from the spread of the rule of law, from increased governmental \ntransparency, and from the economic freedom which will come as a \nconsequence of China's membership in the WTO. Finally, passage of PNTR \nwill make it much more likely that the Chinese people will have the \nopportunity to do what so many Chinese-Americans have done in the \nUnited States. By harnessing the power of individual innovation and by \nstarting businesses, the Chinese people will be able to generate new \nwealth and new opportunities for themselves and their children.\n  While the rewards of membership are evident, let us not overlook the \nresponsibilities that come with membership in that community--\nparticularly the responsibilities that come with membership in the WTO. \nWhat better way to promote democracy in China, a nation that has long \nlacked a strong rule of law, than to encourage its participation in \ninstitutions, like the WTO, with strong dispute resolution mechanisms. \nMembership in the WTO will cause China to reexamine its legal \ninfrastructure. Violating WTO agreements brings real consequences--the \nimposition of trade sanctions.\n  This is a historic opportunity. We will soon be voting on one of the \nmost important bills ever debated in this body. I will support \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations for China and I hope that my \ncolleagues will recognize this bill's importance, and give it their \nsupport.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that granting PNTR is not a reward for \nChina, it is a reward for US farmers, businesses, and consumers. \nPassage of PNTR would allow the US to take advantage of the concessions \nagreed to by China in the bilateral agreement during its accession \nprocess. Tariffs for US goods will be drastically reduced.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4444, the \nU.S.-China Relations Act of 2000. This long-overdue legislation is an \nessential prerequisite to the advancement of U.S. interests in the Asia \nPacific region, and I urge its prompt passage.\n  The preceding two weeks have witnessed considerable debate on the \nfloor of the Senate with respect to U.S.-China relations and the wisdom \nof granting permanent Normal Trade Relations status to the government \nin Beijing. Clearly, there are extraordinarily serious issues dividing \nthe United States and China. Issues central to our national security \nand moral values continue to preclude the development of the kind of \nrelationship many of us would have liked to have enjoyed with the \nworld's most populous country. As long as China continues to engage in \nsuch abhorrent practices as forced abortions, the harvesting of human \norgans, repressive measures against people of faith and pro-democracy \nmovements, and the proliferation of ballistic missiles and technology, \nthere will continue to be considerable tension in our relationship.\n  No one should attempt to minimize the significance of these \nactivities. Their termination must be among our highest foreign policy \npriorities. Opponents of extending permanent normal trade relations \nstatus to China, however, are wrong to suggest that such a policy \nweakens our ability to address important issues that insult our values \nas a nation and impose tremendous suffering on many Chinese citizens. \nOn the contrary, the economic relationship between the United States \nand China is a powerful tool for moving China in the direction we \ndesire.\n  There is considerable room for improvement in the human rights \nsituation in China, and efforts at ending Chinese transfers of \nballistic missile technology to other countries have been frustratingly \nineffective. Denying permanent normal trade status for China, however, \nis not the answer. China does in fact represent a case for economic \nengagement as a mechanism for affecting political change. China's \nhistory, which cannot be divorced from discussions of contemporary \nChinese developments, is quite illuminating in this respect. One of the \nworld's oldest and proudest civilizations, China has nevertheless never \nknown true democracy. Go back 3,000 years and trace its history to the \npresent. It is only in the last quarter-century that the window has \ntruly opened for those aspiring to a freer China.\n  The economic reforms initiated by the late Premier Deng Xiao-ping \nbegan a process that has benefited millions of ordinary Chinese and has \nheld out the greatest hope for prosperity and, ultimately, political \nfreedom that country has ever known. The Chinese government, in fact, \nis struggling with the dichotomy between economic liberalization and \npolitical repression and is discovering to its dismay that it has \nirreconcilable interests. The United States, by maximizing its presence \nin China through commercial investment and trade, can be of \nimmeasurable assistance to the Chinese population in ensuring that that \nconflict between economic growth and political repression is resolved \nin the direction of liberalization.\n  Objective analysis strongly supports this assertion. Since the \nbeginning of economic reform in 1979, China's economy has emerged as \none of the fastest growing in the world. The World Bank calculates that \nas many as 200 million Chinese have been lifted out of poverty as a \nresult of the government's economic reforms. A recent Congressional \nResearch Service study noted that China will have more than 230 million \nmiddle-income consumers by 2005. Clearly, economic reform, fueled in \nlarge part by trade, is benefitting the average Chinese citizen. It is \nimportant that we enable American businesses to develop a presence in \nthese markets now, so that they can both take advantage of future \ndevelopments and so that American values and practices can better take \nhold and flourish.\n  We should not be ashamed of the fact that our economy benefits by \ntrade\n\n[[Page S8691]]\n\nwith China. China's accession to the World Trade Organization, an \ninevitability given its importance as a market, will allow American \ncompanies to sell to Chinese consumers without the current arbitrary \nregulations. China will be forced to take steps to open its markets to \nU.S. goods and services that it has been reluctant to take in the past. \nThese steps include major reductions in industrial tariffs from an \naverage of 24 percent to an average of 9.4 percent; reductions in the \ntariffs on agricultural goods from an average of 31 percent to 14 \npercent, as well as elimination of non-tariff barriers in agricultural \nimports; major openings in industries where China has been extremely \nreluctant to permit foreign investment, including telecommunications \nand financial services; and unprecedented levels of protection for \nintellectual property rights. In addition, the United States will be \nable to use the dispute resolution mechanism of the WTO to force China \nto meet its obligations and open its markets to American goods.\n  Opponents of engaging China in trade should be aware that membership \nin the World Trade Organization carries with it responsibilities that \nare at variance with Communist Party practice. That is why Martin Lee, \nchairman of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, noted that China's \nparticipation in the WTO would ``bolster those in China who understand \nthat the country must embrace the rule of law.'' Similarly, Wang Shan, \na liberal political scientist, stated that ``undoubtedly [the China WTO \nagreement] will push political reform.'' And the former editor of the \ndemocratic journal Fangfa has written that ``if economic monopolies can \nbe broken, controls in other areas can have breakthroughs as well . . . \nIn the minds of ordinary people, it will show that breakthroughs that \nwere impossible in the past are indeed possible.''\n  Yes, we have serious concerns with Chinese behavior in a number of \nareas. As General Brent Scowcroft stated in a hearing before the \nCommerce Committee last April, however, the essential point is what is \ngained by denying China permanent normal trade relations status. We \nwould not accomplish our foreign policy objectives in the Asia Pacific \nregion, or within the realm of missile proliferation, by impeding trade \nwith China. I supported the measure offered by Senator Thompson \nintended to address the issue of Chinese missile proliferation because \nof that issue's importance to our national security, but also because \nit was not intended as an anti-trade measure, as is the case with the \nother amendments offered to this bill.\n  It is past time that the Senate passes permanent normal trade \nrelations status for China. It is in America's interest, and in the \ninterest of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  I thank the President for this opportunity to address the Senate, and \nurge passage of the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senate is debating an important \nquestion with tremendous ramifications for our relationship with China \nand the American economy: whether to extend Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations status to China (PNTR).\n  The opponents of PNTR argue that China is not worthy of receiving \nPNTR. They offer a laundry list of reasons. Its track record on human \nrights has not only not improved but has gotten worse. It continues to \nignore commitments made in the nonproliferation area, particularly with \nrespect to the spread of missile technology. Its intimidation of Taiwan \ncontinues, with little indication that Chinese leaders are prepared to \navail themselves of Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian's offers to \nbegin negotiations. Its compliance with existing agreements leave a lot \nto be desired. They speak passionately about those concerns. And these \nissues should never be overlooked in any thoughtful analysis of our \nrelationship with China. They must productively be incorporated into a \npolicy of engagement; but make no mistake: we must have a policy of \nengagement.\n  I support PNTR and I intend to vote for it. I will admit to you that \nwhen I read recent press accounts of yet another crackdown on religious \npractitioners in China--this time members of a Christian sect called \nthe China Fang-Cheng Church--and of the deaths of three Falung Gong \nmembers who have been imprisoned--I understood once more the temptation \nto reverse my position and vote against PNTR. But I am not going to do \nthat Mr. President, because PNTR is not an effective tool for changing \nChina's behavior at home or abroad--and as much as we detest the \nbehavior in China with regard to religious freedom, it is not symbolic \nprotest that will bring about change, but thoughtful approaches and a \nnew and different kind of engagement--economic as well as diplomatic--\nthat will leverage real change in China in the years ahead .\n  So let me say once more, there is no question that the issues raised \nby the opponents of PNTR are serious and real. We are all outraged by \nthe repression of Chinese citizens who simply want to practice their \nspiritual beliefs or exercise political rights. But denying China PNTR \nwill not force the Chinese leadership to cease its crackdown on \nreligious believers or political dissidents. It will not force China to \nabide by the principles of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) \nor slow down its nuclear or military modernization, or reverse its \nposition on Taiwan. Denying PNTR will NOT keep China out of the WTO. \nBut I am certain that denying China PNTR will set back the broad range \nof U.S. interests at stake in our relationship with China and undermine \nour ability to promote those interests through engagement.\n  China has the capacity to hinder or help us to advance our interests \non a broad range of issues, including: nonproliferation, open markets \nand free trade, environmental protection, the promotion of human rights \nand democratic freedoms, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, Asian \neconomic recovery, peace on the Korean peninsula and ultimately peace \nand stability in the Asia-Pacific region. It is only by engaging with \nChina on all of these issues that we will make positive progress on any \nand thereby advance those interests and our security. Engagement does \nnot guarantee that China will be a friend. But by integrating China \ninto the international community through engagement, we minimize the \npossibility of China becoming an enemy.\n  Over the last three decades, U.S. engagement with China, and China's \ngrowing desire to reap the benefits of membership in the global \ncommunity have already produced real--if limited--progress on issues of \ndeep concern to Americans, including the question of change in China.\n  There are two faces of life in China today:\n  The first face is the disturbing crackdown on the Falon Gong and the \nChina Fang-Cheng Church, the increase of repressive, destructive \nactivities in Tibet, the restraints placed on key democracy advocates \nand the harassment of the underground churches. The second face is that \nof the average citizen who has more economic mobility and freedom of \nemployment than ever before and a better standard of living.\n  More information is coming in to China than ever before via the \nInternet, cable TV, satellite dishes, and western publications. \nAcademics and government officials openly debate politically sensitive \nissues such as political reform and democratization. Efforts have begun \nto reform the judicial system, to expand citizen participation and \nincrease choices at the grass roots level.\n  While China's leaders remain intent on controlling political \nactivity, undeniably there are indications that the limits of the \nsystem are slowly fading, encouraging political activists to take \npreviously unimaginable steps including the formation of an alternative \nDemocracy Party. On the whole, Chinese society is more open and most \nChinese citizens have more personal freedom than ever before. Of \ncourse, we must press for further change, but we should not ignore the \nremarkable changes that have taken place.\n  China's track record on weapons proliferation is another issue of \nserious concern. Senator Thompson has introduced sanctions legislation \ntargeted at China's proliferation policies, and I understand he will be \noffering that as an amendment to PNTR. With this legislation, Senator \nThompson has done the Senate and this Nation a great service, by \nforcing us to take a hard look at the reality of China's commitment to \ninternational proliferation norms. And that reality, particularly over \nthe last\n\n[[Page S8692]]\n\neighteen months, is disturbing. But I do not believe that a China-\nspecific sanctions bill is an effective response to the challenge of \nweapons proliferation. And we should not scuttle PNTR just to make a \npoint--however valid--about China's continuing export of missile-\nrelated technology.\n  Our concern about recent Chinese activities related to the transfer \nof missile technology should not lead us to overlook the totality of \nChina's performance in the arms control area. The fact is China has \ntaken steps, particularly in the last decade, to bring its \nnonproliferation and arms export control policies more in line with \ninternational norms. China acceded to the Biological Weapons Convention \nin 1984. In 1992, China acceded to the Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT. \nChina signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, CTBT, and the \nnext year promulgated new nuclear export controls identical to the \ndual-use list used by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In 1997 China joined \nthe Zangger Committee, which coordinates nuclear export policies among \nNPT members. The same year it ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention \nand began to enforce export controls on dual-use chemical technology. \nIn 1998 China published detail export control regulations for dual-use \nnuclear items. These developments have also been accompanied by various \npledges, for example not to export complete missile systems falling \nwithin MTCR payload and range and not to provide assistance to Iran's \nnuclear energy program. China's commitment to these pledges has been \nspotty but the fact is, China's record today is dramatically different \nfrom what it was in the 1980s or the three decades before. Then we were \nfaced with a China exporting a broad range of military technology to an \narray of would-be nuclear states including Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq, \nPakistan and North Korea. Today, our principal concern is Chinese \nexports in the area of missile-related technology--not complete missile \nsystems--and to two countries: Pakistan and Iran. That, it seems to me, \nis progress, and progress made during a period of growing engagement \nbetween China and the international community.\n\n  Some in this body, frustrated that our current engagement with China \nhas born little fruit, are offering amendments in an attempt to use the \npresumed leverage in PNTR as a means of changing China's policies. I \nbelieve that engagement offers the best prospects for promoting our \ninterests with China but I understand and share their frustration over \nthe way in which the current administration has engaged China. The next \nadministration must engage with greater clarity of message, consistency \nof policy, pragmatism about what can be achieved and over what time \nframe, and determination to hold China accountable when it misbehaves \nor ignores commitments made.\n  However, we should not let our frustration with the benefits of \nengagement lead us to undermine that policy by delaying or denying PNTR \nin a vain quest to change China overnight. PNTR is not a ``reward'', as \nthe opponents of PNTR suggest. It is a key element in our economic \nengagement with China and an affirmation of our intention to have a \nnormal trading relationship with China, as we do with the overwhelming \nmajority of our other trading partners. Many of China's most outspoken \ncritics including Martin Lee, the head of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, \nBao Tong, one of China's most prominent dissidents; and Dai Qing, an \nengaging writer and environmental activist who was jailed in the wake \nof Tiananmen Square for her pro-democracy activities and writings, want \nus to give PNTR to China. They want it because they know that drawing \nChina deeper into the international community's institutions and norms \nwill promote more change in China over time. As Dai Qing told U.S. when \nshe testified before the Foreign Relations Committee in July: \n``Firstly, PNTR will help to reduce governmental control over economy \nand society; secondly, PNTR will help to promote the rule of law; and \nthirdly, PNTR will help to nourish independent political and social \nforces in China.''\n  The opponents of PNTR have argued that we are giving up leverage over \nChina because we are abandoning our annual review of U.S.-China \nrelations. This argument ignores two critical points: first, there has \nbeen little leverage in the MFN review because China can simply do \nbusiness with others; and second, Congress has never revoked the status \nin the last 12 years. So how meaningful is this review in reality? \nThere is nothing in the action we are contemplating here that prevents \nCongress from acting in the future, if it so desires. In fact, the \npending legislation sets up a commission to review China's performance \non key issues including human rights and labor rights and trade \ncompliance so that if Congress wants to act, we will be better informed \nat the outset.\n  This vote on extending PNTR is not a referendum on the China of \ntoday. It is a vote on how best to pursue all of our interests with \nChina including our economic interests. Extending PNTR will allow the \nUnited States to enjoy economic benefits stemming from the bilateral \nagreement negotiated between the United States and China. I am \nconcerned that critical labor, human rights and environmental \nprotections were left out of the agreement. However, I believe the \nagreement undeniably forces China to open its doors to more trade, and \nif we fail to vote in favor of PNTR, we risk forfeiting increased trade \nwith the largest emerging market in the world to other countries in \nEurope and Asia.\n  This would be no small loss for the United States. Just consider the \nfacts which underscore the importance of trade with China. By granting \nPNTR status to China, the U.S. will be able to avail itself to China--\nto make American goods and services available to one-fifth of the \nworld's population. China is the world's second largest economy in \nterms of domestic purchasing power. It is the world's seventh largest \neconomy in terms of Gross Domestic Product and is one of the fastest \ngrowing economies in the world. Simply put, China's economy is simply \ntoo large to ignore.\n  It is of course true that there has been sharp growth in the U.S. \ntrade deficit with China, which surged from $6.2 billion in 1989 to \nmore than $68 billion in 1999. But it is also true that the deficit is \nin large part due to the fact that China has closed its doors to U.S. \nproducts.\n  I believe that only by granting PNTR to China will U.S. businesses be \nable to open those doors and export goods and services to China, so \nthat our economy can continue to grow and our workers be fully \nemployed. U.S. exports to China and Hong Kong now support 400,000 \nAmerican jobs. Trade with China is of increasing importance in my home \nstate. China is Massachusetts' eighth largest export market. The \nMassachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research at the \nUniversity of Massachusetts calculated that in 1999, Massachusetts \nexported goods worth a total of nearly $366 million to China. That \nrepresents an increase in total exports to China of more than 15 \npercent from the previous year and translates into more jobs and a \nstronger economy in my state.\n  The bilateral trade agreement between the U.S. and China will give \nbusinesses in every state the chance to increase their exports to \nChina, ultimately leading to more growth here at home. Under the \nagreement, China is committed to reducing tariffs and removing non-\ntariff barriers in many sectors important to the U.S. economy. China \nhas agreed, for instance, to cut overall agricultural tariffs for U.S. \npriority products--beef, grapes, wine, cheese, poultry, and pork--from \n31.5 percent to 14.5 percent by 2004. Overall industrial tariffs will \nfall from an average of 24.6 percent to 9.4 percent by 2005. Tariffs on \ninformation technology products--which have been driving the tremendous \neconomic prosperity our country is currently enjoying--would be reduced \nfrom an average level of 13.3 percent to zero by the year 2005. China \nmust also phase out quotas within five years. The U.S. market, on the \nother hand, is already open to Chinese products. We have conceded \nnothing to China in terms of market access, while China must now open \nits doors to increased exports. This is a one-way trade agreement \nfavoring the United States of America.\n\n  China has made other concessions that are likely to be extremely \nbeneficial to the U.S. economy. It has agreed to open service sectors, \nsuch as distribution, telecommunications, insurance, banking, \nsecurities, and professional services to foreign firms.\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\nChina has agreed to reduce restrictions on auto trade. Tariffs on autos \nwill fall from 80-100 percent to 25 percent by 2006, and auto quotas \nwill be eliminated by 2005. Perhaps most importantly, the agreement and \nthis legislation provide that China must accept the use by the United \nStates of safeguard, countervailing, and antidumping provisions to \nrespond to surges in U.S. imports from China that might harm a U.S. \nindustry.\n  A favorable vote on PNTR will also benefit the agriculture industry. \nChina is already the United States' sixth largest agricultural export \nmarket, and that market is expected to grow tremendously in the 21st \ncentury. China is a major purchaser of U.S. grain, meat, chicken, pork, \ncotton and soybeans. In the next century, USDA projects China will \naccount for almost 40 percent of the growth in U.S. farm exports.\n  We must recognize that the U.S. will not be able to sell its wheat, \nprovide its financial services, or market its computer software in \nChina unless we grant China PNTR status. Let there be no mistake, China \nwill become a member of the WTO whether or not we pass PNTR. Under the \nJackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, the United States can \nand does extend Normal Trade Relations treatment to China annually. If \nCongress fails to amend its laws to provide permanent, rather than \nannual, normal trade relations, we will not be able to satisfy the \nrequirement that normal trade relations be unconditional. The U.S.-\nChina agreements could therefore not be enforced and the U.S. would not \nbe able to avail itself to the dispute resolution procedures of the \nWTO.\n  The benefits of the WTO agreement extend beyond more open Chinese \nmarkets to the application of a rules-based system to China, a country \nthat has historically acted outside the world's regulations and norms. \nUnder the terms of this agreement, the Chinese government is obliged to \npublish laws and regulations subjecting some of China's most important \ndecisions to the review of an international body for the first time. \nWTO membership will force China to accelerate market-oriented economic \nreforms. This will be a difficult and challenging task for China, but \nan important one that will result in freer and fairer trade with China.\n  Despite the likely benefits that the United States will reap if it \ngrants PNTR to China, we must pay attention to the concerns expressed \nby those in the labor, environmental and human rights communities about \nthe impact of this vote. We must hear their voices and heed their \nwarnings so that we are on alert in our dealings with China. In China, \nworkers cannot form or join unions and strikes are prohibited. There \nare no meaningful environmental standards and the prevalent use of \nforced labor make production in China extremely inexpensive. Because \nthey cannot bargain collectively, Chinese workers are paid extremely \nlow wages and are subject to unsafe working conditions.\n  No one on either side of the aisle, not even the most ardent \nsupporter of PNTR, supports these most undemocratic, morally \nreprehensible conditions in China, and we have a duty and a \nresponsibility to pay attention to the conditions there. It is my hope \nand belief that as U.S. firms move into China, they will bring with \ninternationally-accepted business practices that may actually raise \nlabor and environmental standards in China. I also hope that they will \nprovide opportunities for Chinese workers to move from state-owned to \nprivately-owned companies, or from one private company to another, \nwhere the conditions are better. These steps are small, but important. \nNevertheless, the international community in general and the United \nStates in particular must remain vigilant in order to ensure that \nstandards are rising in China and it is simply not the case where the \nonly benefit to come from freer trade with China is that the corporate \ncoffers of large companies are being lined with money saved on the \nbacks of Chinese laborers.\n  We must also be vigilant in ensuring that once China becomes a member \nof the WTO, it complies with the rules of the WTO and lives up to its \ncommitments under trade agreements. There are many critics of PNTR with \nChina who rightly point out that China has an extremely poor record of \ncompliance with current trade agreements with the U.S., and that it \n``can't be trusted'' to live up to commitments once it is in the WTO. \nChina's trading partners worldwide must cooperate to police China so as \nto ensure its adherence to the trade concessions it has made.\n  The environment is another area in which we must be vigilant in our \nefforts to encourage the Chinese government to begin to promulgate and \nenforce environmental standards. Right now, levels of air pollution \nfrom energy and industrial production in Shanghai and Shenyang are the \nhighest in the world. Water pollution in regions such as Huai River \nValley is also among the worst in the world. In 1995, more than one \nhalf of the 88 Chinese cities monitored for sulfur dioxide were above \nthe World Health Organization guidelines. It is estimated that nearly \n178,000 deaths in urban areas could be prevented each year by cleaner \nair. We simply cannot allow this complete degradation of the \nenvironment in China to continue unabated.\n  Denying PNTR to China won't stop its unfair labor practices or its \nenvironmental devastation. So while I would have liked to see these \nissues addressed in this legislation or in the bilateral agreement, I \nbelieve that, on balance, the risk of not engaging China at this time \nfar outweighs any value we would gain by signaling to China that we \nstill do not approve of its practices and policies. That symbolic \nsignal would only strip U.S. of the leverage that WTO membership brings \nwith it to hold China accountable and effect real progress. If the U.S. \nfails to support PNTR, and thus fails to take advantage of the benefits \nof China's inevitable membership in the WTO, U.S. companies stand to \nlose market share and U.S. workers may lose jobs to European and Asian \ncompanies that gain a strong foothold in China. We would also lose the \nopportunity to engage China and advance our positions on all of our \ninterests including human rights and security. And that would be far \ntoo high a price to pay in this new global economy for the short term \nrewards of merely sending a message with far more negative consequences \nfor U.S. than for China.\n  Engagement, is the course we must pursue--intelligently, with \nstrength and a commitment to accountability. Engagement is a course \nbest pursued by granting China Permanent Normal Trade Relations and \nbringing it into the WTO. It is in the best interests of our economy \nand it is in the best interests of our foreign policy, and I hope we \ncan all join together in moving the United States Senate and our Nation \nin that direction.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the amendments \nthat have been voted on in relation to H.R. 4444, a bill that \nauthorizes permanent normal trade relations with China. Over the last \ntwo weeks or so, several of my colleagues have introduced very \nthoughtful legislation specifically designed to address problems that \nexist at this time in China. Taken alone and at face value, many of \nthese amendments--from human and labor rights to technology transfer to \nreligious freedom to weapons proliferation to clean energy--have been \nworthy and deserving of my support. At any other time, I would have in \nfact voted for many of these amendments. I personally am of the view \nthat Chinese officials must continue to make significant and tangible \nefforts in the future to transform their country's policies to coincide \nwith international rules and norms. Although China is indeed making a \nvery difficult and gradual transition to a more democratic society and \na market-based economy, much remains to be done. Chinese officials must \nreinvigorate their commitment to change, and they will inevitably be \nopen to criticism from both the United States and the international \ncommunity until they do so.\n  But this said, it is clear that any amendment attached to H.R. 4444 \nat this time will force the bill into conference, and at this late \nstage in the session, that means that the bill would effectively be \ndead. In my mind, this bill is far too important to have this outcome. \nI believe that H.R. 4444 is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we will consider this year, for two reasons.\n  First, it creates new opportunities for American workers, farmers, \nand businesses in the Chinese market. This\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nbill is not about Chinese access to the U.S. market as this already \nexists. The bill is about U.S. access to the Chinese market, because if \nthis bill is passed we will see a significant change in the way China \nhas to conduct business. As a result of this bill, we will over time \nsee a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers, liberalization in \ndomestic regulatory regimes, and protections against import surges, \nunfair pricing, and illegal investment practices. If we do not take \naction on this bill this year, we will be at a tremendous competitive \ndisadvantage in the Chinese market relative to companies from other \ncountries.\n  We cannot let this happen to American workers. In my state of New \nMexico alone we have seen dramatic results from increased trade with \nChina. Our exports to China totaled $147 million in 1998, up from \n$366,000 in 1993. China was New Mexico's 35th largest export \ndestination in 1993, but now it ranks fourth in this regard. In 1993 \nonly six product groups from New Mexico were heading to China as \nexports, but in 1998 there were sixteen product groups flowing in that \ndirection, from electrical equipment and components to chemicals to \nagriculture to furniture. In short, increased trade opportunities with \nChina translates directly to increased economic welfare for New Mexico, \nand all of the United States.\n  A second reason this legislation is so important relates to U.S. \nnational security. From where I stand, China is playing an increasingly \nactive role in Asia and the world, and it is in our national interest \nto engage them in discussions concerning these activities on an ongoing \nand intensive basis. There is simply no benefit to be gained from \nattempting to isolate or ignore China at this time. It has not worked \nin the past, and it will not work in the future. I am convinced that \nour failure to pass this bill will limit our country's ability to \ninfluence the direction and quality of change in China. I have visited \nChina, and I can tell you that the China of today looks dramatically \ndifferent than the China of five years ago. This change is at least in \npart a direct result of our interaction with the Chinese people. As the \nPNTR debate moves forward, Congress must decide how it would like China \nto look five, ten, fifteen, twenty years from now. Do we want China to \nbe a competitor, or an enemy? In my view, PNTR will place us in a \nparticularly strong position to promote positive change in China and \nincrease our capacity to pursue our long-term national interest.\n  Although I am certainly sympathetic to the objectives of many of the \namendments offered by my colleagues, I feel the issue of trade with \nChina deserves to be debated on its own merits. For this reason, I have \nchosen to vote against the amendments offered by my colleagues. But I \nwould like to emphasize at this time that I look forward to the \nopportunity to address them in the future.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, several months ago, the House of \nRepresentatives voted 237 to 197 to grant Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations to China. Before passing that legislation, however, the House \nadded provisions that will require this and future Administrations to \nstep up efforts to enforce China's compliance with its trade agreements \nand with internationally-recognized human rights norms.\n  Today the Senate will vote on whether we too will approve granting \nPNTR to China. That vote is on the limited question of whether to make \npermanent the favorable trade treatment that the United States has \nafforded to China one year at a time for the past 20 years--just that, \nand only that. The only difference in this upcoming vote and past votes \non normal trade relations for China is: Shall normal trade relations be \npermanent, as they are with virtually every one of our other trading \npartners?\n  I have voted for normal trade relations in the past because China is \na country of 1.3 billion people that is certain to play an important \nrole in our future. The question is, will that role be a positive or \nnegative one?\n  I happen to think that involvement with China is preferable to non-\ninvolvement. And I think on balance that the movement of China towards \nmore freedom for its citizens and a market-based economy is much more \nlikely to occur through normal trade relations than through \nestrangement.\n  While it is a close call, I have concluded that it is in our best \ninterests to accord China Permanent Normal Trade Relations, because the \nlegislation also establishes a commission to monitor human rights and \nlabor issues in China and includes provisions that will ensure better \nenforcement of our trade agreements.\n  I would like to explain my reasoning.\n  I am mindful that there are some actions by China that give us pause. \nThreats directed at Taiwan, the transfer of missile technology to rogue \nstates, and the abuse of human rights inside China are all reasons for \nconcern. But I have seen almost no evidence that there has been any \nconnection between Chinese behavior and Congress' annual review of \nChina's trade status. On the other hand, there is evidence that the \nengagement with China by Western democracies has led to some \nimprovement in a number of areas. It is my hope that those improvements \nwill continue and be enhanced with Permanent Normal Trade Relations and \nChina's accession to the WTO.\n  I am under no illusion that granting PNTR to China and allowing it to \njoin the WTO will lead China inexorably toward democratization, better \nhuman rights and economic liberalization. However, I find it notable \nthat China's security services, and conservative members of the \nmilitary and Communist Party feel threatened by those developments. \nThey are leading the opposition to President Zhang Zhemin and Premier \nZhu Rongji's efforts to restructure China's economy and join the WTO \nprecisely because they fear it will weaken the Communist Party's \nabsolute hold on power.\n  The Dalai Lama and many of China's leading democracy and human rights \nadvocates support Permanent Normal Trade Relations. They believe that \nthe closer the economic relationship between the U.S. and China, the \nbetter the U.S. will be able to monitor human rights conditions in \nChina and the more effectively the U.S. will be able to push for \npolitical reforms. However, other human rights advocates, including \nHarry Wu, believe granting China PNTR will weaken America's ability to \ninfluence China's human rights. That is why it is so important that the \nPNTR legislation establish a commission to monitor the human rights and \nlabor situation in China and suggest ways we can intensify human-rights \npressure on Beijing.\n  Most of the farm groups and business groups from my state believe \nPNTR and the implementation of the U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement \nwill result in a significant rise in U.S. exports to China. I hope that \nis true. But I fear they will be disappointed. Most impartial studies \nhave concluded that the gains are likely to be modest. Furthermore, I \nam concerned by comments which were made by China's lead trade \nnegotiator that China has conceded only a ``theoretical'' opportunity \nfor the U.S. to export grain or meat to China. This makes me wonder \nwhether China has any real intention of opening its markets as \ncontemplated in the bilateral agreement. That is why it is so important \nthat the PNTR bill includes provisions that will require the \nadministration to step up its efforts to ensure that China complies \nwith its trade agreements.\n  The systemic trade problems we are experiencing with China and many \nother countries, including Japan, Europe, and Canada, have little to do \nwith this debate about Normal Trade Relations and a lot to do with our \nwillingness to give concessional trade advantages to shrewd, tough, \ninternational competitors at the expense of American producers. \nFrankly, I am tired of it.\n  The recent U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement was hailed as a giant \nstep forward. In fact, it comes up far short of what our producers \nought to be expecting in such agreements. If we were given a vote on \nthat agreement, I would likely vote no, and tell our negotiators to go \nback and try again.\n  Our negotiators should have done better. It is outrageous that they \nsigned an agreement that allows China, which already has a $70 billion \nmerchandise trade surplus with the United States, to protect its \nproducers with tariffs on American goods that are two to ten times \nhigher than the tariffs we charge on Chinese goods. There is no excuse \nfor that. But that circumstance\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\nis not unique to China. It exists in our trade relations with Japan, \nwith the European Union, with Canada, and others. We now have a \nmushrooming merchandise trade deficit that is running at an annual $400 \nbillion-plus level. It is unsustainable and dangerous for our country.\n  We must begin to negotiate trade agreements with our trading partners \nthat are tough, no nonsense agreements. We should develop rules of fair \ntrade that give American workers and American businesses a fair \nopportunity to compete.\n  Regrettably most of our trade policies reward those corporations that \nwant to produce where it's cheap and sell back into our marketplace. \nThat is a recipe for weakening our economy and it must stop.\n  So, I voted for Normal Trade Relations with China previously, and I \nintend to vote to make it permanent, provided that we also require this \nand future Administrations to dramatically step up efforts to enforce \nChina's compliance with its trade agreements and with internationally-\nrecognized human rights norms.\n  However, I want it to be clear that, if we accord Permanent Normal \nTrade Relations to China and we discover that they are not in fact \ncomplying with the terms of the bilateral agreement we negotiated with \nthem or that they are retreating rather than progressing on the issue \nof human rights for Chinese citizens, then I believe we must reserve \nthe right to revoke China's Normal Trade Relations status.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth, a brief question. Mr. Chairman, there \nare a number of important initiatives and oversight capabilities \ncreated in this legislation on PNTR. Not only do we make permanent our \ntrading relationship with China, but we have included monitoring \ncapabilities to ensure that the commitments agreed to in the WTO \naccession agreements are, in fact, lived up to by the Chinese \ngovernment.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator from Indiana is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would like to then clarify that the bill before us \nshould not only provide means to review WTO trade compliance, but also \npast agreements affecting trade between our countries, whether they are \ntreaties or memorandum of agreements between the United States and \nChina. Is this correct, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like then to state here \nthat it is the intent of the bill that there be a review of the \nimplementation of the 1992 Memorandum of Agreement between the United \nStates and China on the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights. As \nyou know, this agreement was reached so that American pharmaceutical \ncompound patents issued between 1986 and 1993 would enjoy protection in \nChina. As a number of disputes have arisen from this agreement, I think \nit is important that we have an independent and objective look at this \nagreement and then we can determine if additional efforts in this area \nare warranted.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator. It is my intent, as his, that the 1992 \nMOU shall also be reviewed.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the distinguished Chairman.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the bill to \nextend permanent normal trade relations to China. I have taken a great \ndeal of time to study both the positive and negative aspects of \ngranting PNTR to China. I was undecided on which way to vote for quite \nsome time. I met with and talked to those on both sides of the issue.\n  Although I had several concerns, my biggest were about the reports of \nreligious persecution and other human rights violations that continue \nto occur in China. It certainly is not fair that anyone--let alone 20 \npercent of the world's population--live under this kind of injustice. \nWe in America, a great land of freedom and liberty, find these abuses \nintolerable and inexcusable. Although human rights have improved over \nthe past 20 years since China has opened up its market to the world, it \nhas a great deal of progress to make.\n  I care deeply about many of the issues that have been raised \nthroughout this debate. And I pledge to continue working to ensure that \nthese issues are not forgotten. The evils that the communist government \nof China perpetuates, such as forced abortion, organ harvesting, \nreligious persecution, weapons proliferation, and the like, should \nstill be addressed. We must do everything we can to not only bring \nChina into the world trading system, but also into the system of \ninternational norms, which recognizes the value of human life and \nrights.\n  After carefully weighing the issues I decided to support passage of \nthis bill. I also decided it was such an important bill for American \nand Chinese citizens that it should be passed this year.\n  This caused me to be in the position of voting against several \namendments that in any other situation I would have supported. I know \nseveral of my other good friends and colleagues did the same.\n  Now I want to explain some of the conclusions I have reached.\n  First, the recently signed U.S.-China trade agreement does not \nrequire the U.S. to make any concessions. It does not lower tariffs or \nother trade barriers for Chinese products coming into America. Instead, \nit forces China to open its market to U.S. goods and services provided \nthe Congress extends PNTR to China. Passage or failure of this bill \ndoes not determine whether or not China becomes a member of the WTO. \nHowever, since the WTO requires that members treat each other in a non-\ndiscriminatory manner, each member country must grant other members \npermanent normal trade relations. Therefore, if China is not granted \nPNTR, it is not obligated to live by its WTO trade and market-opening \ncommitments made to the United States.\n  As I mentioned earlier, China's regime has a poor track record when \nit comes to the human rights of its more than 1 billion citizens. It \nstill has a long way to go to become acceptable. But the United States \nshould not isolate the people of China from the exchange of information \nand products. We should not impede the efforts of Chinese citizens to \ntrade and exchange property, which is an essential aspect of a free \nsociety.\n  The gradual opening of the Chinese market in recent years has been \naccompanied by very slow, yet positive advancements for religious \nfreedoms in China. For example, consider the comments of Nelson Graham, \nson of the Reverend Billy Graham and President of East Gates \nInternational, a Christian non-profit organization. In his testimony at \nthe Senate Finance Committee earlier this year he said, ``I believe \nthat granting China PNTR will not only benefit U.S. businesses and \nU.S.-based religious organizations but will be one step further toward \nbettering the relationship between our countries.''\n  He went on to add that the impact of China's increased trade \nrelations with the West has already caused a ``proliferation of \ninformation exchange [that] has allowed us to be much more effective in \ndeveloping and organizing our work in the [People's Republic of \nChina].''\n  These and similar comments by other religious leaders have led me to \nbelieve that increased trade will help the work of these religious \norganizations and help promote greater freedoms in China. Prior to the \ngradual market opening of China, religious organizations like Nelson \nGraham's East Gates International, had little or no way of reaching the \nspiritually-starved Chinese people.\n  I also want to emphasize that this bill in no way ignores the \nimportance of religious and human rights. It sets up a permanent \nCommission to monitor human and religious rights and the development of \nrule of law and democracy-building in China. This Commission will have \nsimilar responsibilities as the existing Commission on Security and \nCooperation in Europe established in 1976, which has proven effective \nin monitoring and encouraging respect for human rights in Eastern \nEurope.\n  Mr. President, at the conclusion of my remarks I will ask unanimous \nconsent that four letters and one op-ed piece I have be inserted into \nthe Record. Three of the letters are written by the Reverend Billy \nGraham, Joe Volk of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, and \nPat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\nThe other letter is from thirty-two religious leaders representing a \nbroad range of religious organizations. the op-ed was written by Randy \nTate, former Executive Direction of the Christian Coalition, and was \npublished in the Washington Times last year. Each communication makes \nthe point that PNTR will benefit U.S. religious organizations with \noperations in China.\n  I do not pretend that improvements in religious and human rights in \nChina will happen overnight. Progress in liberty will not be immediate \nin a country where the government owns most of the property and has \nstrict limits on political and religious association. Not one of us in \nthis body would create a political regime such as that currently \noperating in China if we were cutting from whole cloth. Unfortunately, \nhistory rarely presents such ideal circumstances. Instead, we must \naddress the world as we find it with all its imperfections.\n  I believe the question each of us must ask ourselves is whether human \nand religious rights will be improved by refusing China permanent \nnormal trade relations. I see no evidence this would be the case. \nRather, I believe that the increase in economic freedom that comes \nthrough increased trade relations will, in turn, bring about greater \nreligious freedom and a better environment for human rights as well.\n  Randy Tate probably summed up this issue best. He said:\n\n       Our case for greater trade . . . is less about money and \n     more about morality. It is about ensuring that one-fifth of \n     the world's population is not shut off from businesses \n     spreading the message of freedom--and ministries spreading \n     the love of God . . . [I]s it any surprise that some of our \n     nation's most respected religious leaders, from Billy Graham \n     to Pat Robertson, have called for keeping the door to China \n     open?\n\n  I also want to briefly discuss another serious issue which was raised \nduring the PNTR debate--the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction by China. While I recognize the sometimes delinquent \nbehavior of China in this area, I believe the amendment which failed \nused a flawed unilateral and inflexible approach. I want to see the \nelimination of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. But \nthe President currently has ample authority to sanction foreign \nentities for proliferation under numerous statutes. Therefore, the \nproblem we now have is a failure by this Administration to effectively \ndeal with the Chinese government to eliminate this proliferation. Some \nvery targeted sanctions were probably in order for some of the Chinese \nproliferation activity.\n  But the amendment that was offered would have prescribed a very rigid \none-size-fits-all solution. And we must remember that the most \neffective sanctions are those that are multilateral and those that have \ngeneral agreement among our allies. The amendment would have required \nunilateral sanctions which history has shown to be ineffective tools in \nachieving desired behavior.\n  I do not believe that trade will cure all of the problems we have \nwith China. Moreover, PNTR should not be considered a gift to China, \nbut rather a challenge for China. The U.S. market is already open to \ncountless Chinese goods. This will not change even if we were to refuse \nPNTR to China. Instead, if Congress extends PNTR to China it must open \nits market to the United States. At the same time China must play by \nthe rules of the international trading system, subjecting itself to the \nWTO's dispute settlement process.\n  Without PNTR, China can remain closed to U.S. products yet increase \nits exports to the U.S., further exacerbating our trade deficit with \nChina. This bill is about getting our products into China. By \ncooperating with them, they will lower tariffs to get into the WTO and \nthen we have a court to adjudicate their violations. PNTR simply allows \nfair treatment of U.S. products and services going to China once China \nenters the WTO.\n  Change will not happen instantly. But I do believe increased trade \nwill help advance the cause of freedom in China. The policy of \nengagement through trade must be backed up by strong U.S. leadership \nthat vigorously challenges China, on a bilateral basis and through \ninternational organizations, about its human rights, weapons \nproliferation and other obvious shortcomings. But a vote against PNTR \ndoesn't hurt the hard-line communists in China nor does it help the \ncause of human rights in China. The best way to end these evils is to \ntransform China into a politically and socially free country. And that \ntransformation will begin with economic freedom. Approving PNTR for \nChina is the next and most important step toward a freer China and a \nsafer world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have additional material \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Opening China's Economy\n\n\n                    wto membership will benefit all\n\n                            (By Randy Tate)\n\n       When trade ministers of World Trade Organization member \n     nations gather in Seattle this week, they will comprise the \n     largest gathering of trade officials on U.S. soil since the \n     Bretton Woods conference at the conclusion of World War II.\n       The world has dramatically changed in the intervening half-\n     century Astounding technological advances since then have \n     made us not only comfortable but nonchalant toward \n     international communication. But not so when it comes to \n     trade. Here some still see an insoluble dilemma; choosing \n     between American interests and American ideals. By this \n     argument, we must either engage in commerce with emerging \n     economic giants like China, or forsake trade in standing up \n     for democratic values and human rights.\n       Fortunately, many conservative and religious leaders are \n     rejecting this false choice and are now charting a third \n     course. They recognize that trade and cultural exchange does \n     not hinder but rather advances the value of free minds and \n     hearts.\n       All Americans of good faith can start from this point of \n     agreement. We must stand firm in our support of democracy and \n     the inalienable rights to liberty. We all condemn abhorrent \n     acts such as the bloody suppression of freedom in the \n     Tiananmen Square massacre. And there are many ways of \n     expressing that condemnation: tough diplomacy military \n     containment, and hard-headed realism are among them. But \n     isolation and protectionism would be misguided, and \n     ultimately counterproductive.\n       A fifth of the planet's population lives in China. It makes \n     no sense to isolate 1.3 billion people from the rest of us. \n     That will only encourage irresponsible commercial and \n     political behavior, at home and abroad. Our goals should \n     be to open Chinese markets to our products and services \n     while opening up Chinese society to freedom. That is the \n     way to give its citizens the real opportunity to breathe \n     the liberating air of faith and democracy.\n       It would be nice of course, if the Chinese leadership did \n     that on its own initiative. But that is a fantasy. An \n     isolated China will resist change at home and be likely to \n     behave more aggressively towards its regional neighbors. None \n     of that serves American interests. Admitting China into the \n     WTO may not cause it to shed dictatorship for democracy. But \n     it's the right step towards realizing that goal.\n       Nothing unites a nation and diverts the attention of the \n     people from abuses by its leader like a common enemy. Do we \n     slam the door on 1.3 billion people and let Chinese leaders \n     turn America into the villain? Economic adversaries too often \n     evolve into military enemies, as the origins of World War II \n     amply demonstrated. The hatred of 1.3 billion people is \n     surely something to incur with great caution.\n       The bottom line is that America needs to have a seat at the \n     negotiating table to push for further democratic and \n     religious reforms in countries such as China. Shutting our \n     doors and abandoning all that we've helped the Chinese people \n     accomplish would make us part of the problem. Moreover, we \n     have to recognize that even a U.S. embargo is not going put \n     the Chinese out of business. Bringing China into the WTO \n     makes them play by the same trade rules as the rest of the \n     world, and this policy decision makes up part of the \n     solution.\n       While moving forcefully to strengthen a trading partnership \n     with China, America needs to send a strong signal that it \n     will stand by historic allies and functioning democracies \n     like Taiwan. We have strong moral obligations to preserve \n     democracies. Admitting Taiwan to the WTO as well accomplishes \n     that. This leaves open political issues for the future, such \n     as finding ways to ensure that freedom and democracy survive \n     and prosper in Taiwan while forging a stable environment \n     as it works out its future relations with China.\n       Our case for greater trade, therefore, is less about money \n     and much more about morality. It is about ensuring that one-\n     fifth of the world's population is not shut off from \n     businesses spreading the message of freedom--and ministries \n     spreading the love of God.\n       Obviously our key commitment is to helping American working \n     families. That provides the most powerful argument for \n     strengthening commercial ties with China by admitting China \n     into the WTO. The agreement negotiated has its imperfections, \n     but there is no question that it makes dramatic improvements \n     in opening up domestic Chinese markets.\n       For example, China will now reduce subsidies on \n     agricultural products, which allows opportunities for \n     American-grown products\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\n     such as wheat and apples to reach a gargantuan market to a \n     degree never considered possible before. Especially in the \n     framing communities of my home state of Washington, the \n     prospect of increased access to a market of this magnitude \n     has sparked new hope in households struggling to make ends \n     meet.\n       Working families dependent upon manufacturing jobs also \n     benefit. Thanks to last week's agreement China will be forced \n     to cut tariffs on American goods an average of 23 percent and \n     to protect, and to protect the excellence and innovation of \n     U.S. software manufacturers against technological piracy.\n       Is it any surprise that hundreds of working families will \n     gather next week in Seattle to show their support for \n     strengthening international trade? Not at all. Nor is it any \n     surprise that some of our nation's most respected religious \n     leaders, from Billy Graham to Pat Robertson, have called for \n     keeping the door to China open. For when the Chinese trade \n     with Americans, they are also exposed to the values of \n     freedom and the healing message of the Gospel. And nothing is \n     more important than that.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Statement by Religious Leaders in Support of Permanent Normal Trade \n                          Relations with China\n\n                                                September 5, 2000.\n       Dear Senator, Soon you will be asked to vote on an issue \n     that will set the course for U.S.-China relations for years \n     to come: enacting Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) \n     with China. Your vote will also have an impact on how human \n     rights and religious freedom will advance for the people of \n     China in the years ahead. We are writing to urge you to vote \n     for PNTR for China because we believe that this is the best \n     way to advance these concerns over the long term.\n       We share your concern for advancing human rights and \n     religious freedom for the people of China. The findings of \n     the recent report from the U.S. International Religious \n     Freedom Committee are disturbing to us. Clearly, the Chinese \n     government still has a long way to go.\n       The question for us all is: What can the U.S. government do \n     that will best advance human rights and religious freedom for \n     the people of China? Are conditions more likely to improve \n     through isolation and containment or through opening trade, \n     investment, and exchange between peoples?\n       Let us look first at what has already occurred within China \n     over the past twenty years. The gradual opening of trade, \n     investment, travel, and exchange between China and the rest \n     of the world has led to significant, positive changes for \n     human rights and religious freedom in China. We observe the \n     following:\n       The number of international religious missions operating \n     openly in China has grown rapidly in recent years. Today \n     these groups provide educational, humanitarian, medical, and \n     development assistance in communities across China.\n       Despite continued, documented acts of government \n     oppression, people in China nonetheless can worship, \n     participate in communities of faith, and move about the \n     country much more freely today than was even imaginable \n     twenty years ago.\n       Today, people can communicate with each other and the \n     outside world much more easily and with much less \n     governmental interference through the tools of business and \n     trade: telephones, cell phones, faxes, and e-mail.\n       On balance, foreign investment has introduced positive new \n     labor practices into the Chinese workplace, stimulating \n     growing aspirations for labor and human rights among Chinese \n     workers.\n       These positive developments have come about gradually in \n     large part as a result of economic reforms by the Chinese \n     government and the accompanying normalization of trade, \n     investment, and exchange with the outside world. The \n     developing relationships between Chinese government \n     officials, business managers, workers, professors, students, \n     and people of faith and their foreign counterparts are \n     reflected in the development of new laws, government \n     policies, business and labor practices, personal freedom, and \n     spiritual seeking. Further, the Chinese government is much \n     more likely to develop the rule of law and observe \n     international norms of behavior if it is recognized by the \n     U.S. government as an equal, responsible partner within the \n     community of nations.\n       The U.S. government and governments around the world have a \n     continuing, important role to play in challenging one another \n     through international forums to fully observe standards for \n     human rights and religious freedom. However, we do not \n     believe that the annual debate in the U.S. Congress, linking \n     justifiable concern for human rights and religious freedom in \n     China to the threat of unilateral U.S. trade sanctions, has \n     been productive toward that end.\n       Change will not occur overnight in China. Nor can it be \n     imposed from outside. Rather, change will occur gradually, \n     and it will be inspired and shaped by the aspirations, \n     culture, and history of the Chinese people. We on the outside \n     can help advance religious freedom and human rights best \n     through policies of normal trade, exchange and engagement for \n     the mutual benefit of peoples of faith, scholars, workers, \n     and businesses. Enacting permanent normal trade relations \n     with China is the next, most important legislative step that \n     Congress can take to help in this process.\n           Sincerely,\n\n         Organizations listed for identification purposes only.\n\n       Dr. Donald Argue, (Former President, National Association \n     of Evangelicals, representing 27 million Christians in the \n     United States of America).\n       John A.

David Dreier,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Dreier: Thank you for contacting me \n     concerning the People's Republic of China. I have great \n     respect for China's long and rich heritage, and I am grateful \n     for the opportunities I have had to visit that great country. \n     It has been a tremendous privilege to get to know many of its \n     leaders and also to become familiar with the actual situation \n     of religious believers in the P.R.C.\n       The current debate about establishing Permanent Normal \n     Trade Relations with China raises many complex and difficult \n     questions. I do not want to become involved in the political \n     aspects of this issue. However, I continue to be in favor of \n     strengthening our relationship with China. I believe it is \n     far better for us to thoughtfully strengthen positive aspects \n     of our relationship with China than to treat it as an \n     adversary. In my experience, nations can respond to \n     friendship just as much as people do.\n       While I will not be releasing a formal public statement on \n     the PNTR debate, please feel free to share my views with your \n     colleagues. May God give you and all of your colleagues His \n     wisdom as you debate this important issue.\n           Cordially yours,\n     Billy Graham.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     The Christian\n\n\n                                    Broadcasting Network Inc.,\n\n                                 Virginia Beach, VA, May 10, 2000.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Pitts,\n     Congress of the United States, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Pitts: My experience in dealing with \n     Mainland China goes back to my first visit to that nation in \n     1979. Since that time, I have learned on subsequent visits \n     that the progress of Mainland China in regard to economic \n     development and the amelioration of the civil rights of its \n     citizens has been dramatic.\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\n       I do not minimize the human rights abuses which take place \n     in the People's Republic of China, but I must say on first-\n     hand observation that significant progress in regard to \n     religious freedom and other civil freedoms has been made over \n     thepast twenty-one years.\n       The population of China is the largest in the world. My \n     sources indicate that there are at least 80 million Chinese \n     who are Christian believes, and tens of millions of Chinese \n     are either practicing Buddhists or practicing Muslims.\n       Although the Chinese government may not comport itself in \n     the same fashion as we in America would desire, nevertheless, \n     I believe that the economic and structural reforms begun by \n     Chairman Deng Xiaoping are irreversible and that little by \n     little this vast land is moving toward a more prosperous \n     society and more individual freedom.\n       If the US refuses to grant normal trading relations with \n     the People's Republic of China, and if we significantly \n     curtail the broad-based economic, education, social, and \n     religious contacts that are being made between the US and \n     China, we will damage ourselves and set back the cause of \n     those in China who are struggling toward increased freedom \n     for their fellow citizens.\n       Therefore, I would urge the Congress to pass legislation \n     which would normalize the trading relations with the People's \n     Republic of China without, in any way, diminishing the desire \n     of the US to encourage the sanctity of human rights and the \n     rule of law in that nation.\n       With best wishes, I remain . . .\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Pat Robertson,\n\n                                         Chairman of the Board and\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Friends Committee\n\n\n                                      on National Legislation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2000.\n\n     Re Support permanent normal trade relations with China \n         without amendment\n\n       Dear Senator: Soon you will be asked to decide whether the \n     enact Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China. We \n     at the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) \n     recommend that you vote for enacting PNTR with China (HR \n     4444) without amendment.\n       While we do not claim to represent all Friends (Quakers) on \n     this challenging and complex issue, the governing body of \n     FCNL is clear in its support for PNTR with china. This policy \n     is fully consistent with FCNL's historic advocacy in \n     opposition to Cold War policies of containment and in support \n     of policies that further interdependence, cooperation, and \n     the pacific resolution of disputes between countries through \n     diplomacy between governments, and free trade, travel and \n     exchange between peoples.\n       We share your concern for advancing human rights, religious \n     freedom, labor rights, and environmental protection for the \n     people of china. We are concerned about the impact of \n     economic globalization on the standard of living and quality \n     of life for workers both at home and abroad. We are also \n     concerned about future cooperation and progress with the \n     government of China in arms control, regional security, \n     negotiations concerning the future of Taiwan, and the pacific \n     settlement of disputes.\n       We believe that normalization of trade relations with china \n     is an important step toward advancing all of these basic \n     human security concerns over the long term. China experts \n     note that dramatic changes have already occurred within China \n     over the past two decades as a result of more open exchange \n     between China and the rest of the world. Interactions between \n     government officials businesses, universities, and \n     individuals have led to a growing harmonization between \n     Chinese institutions and their Western counterparts. This is \n     reflected in the development of new laws, government \n     policies, democratic institutions, business and labor \n     practices, standards of behavior, and popular expectations.\n       This engagement has also helped indirectly to nurture \n     movements for social change. The student movement behind the \n     Tiananmen Square demonstrations, the growing house church and \n     democracy movements, and the recent widespread nonviolent \n     demonstrations by the Falun Gong reflect growing movements \n     within Chinese society that are challenging the political \n     status quo and expressing popular aspirations for human \n     rights. These movements likely would not have developed or \n     spread as quickly were it not for the opening of Chinese \n     society to the outside world that has occurred over the past \n     twenty years. Despite the oppressive government responses, it \n     is unlikely that the Chinese government will be able to \n     repress popular movements such as these for long--especially \n     if china continues along the path of economic reform, \n     development, and integration into the global economy.\n       Such engagement has led to progress with the Chinese \n     government on several important international security \n     issues, as well. Over the same twenty years, the Chinese \n     government has signed and ratified the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention. It \n     signed and awaits U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty, and, since then, it has observed a nuclear \n     testing moratorium. It has participated in the Asian-Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation Forum in ways that have built confidence \n     and diminished regional tensions.\n       It is far more likely that the Chinese government will \n     cooperate in these areas in the future and observe \n     international norms of behavior if it is recognized by the \n     U.S. as an equal partner within the community of nations than \n     if it is isolated or excluded. Granting PNTR would encourage \n     continued progress and cooperation in all of these areas of \n     concern. Conversely, denying PNTR and further isolating China \n     would likely close many of these opportunities, lead to \n     increased oppression within China, and undermine regional and \n     international security.\n       Please vote to enact PNTR with China without amendment. \n     This is the next, most important legislative step that you \n     can take to further positive relations between the peoples \n     and governments of the U.S. and China.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Joe Volk,\n                                              Executive Secretary.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the past eight years, the \nresponsibility to extend annual trade status to the People's Republic \nof China, PRC, has been shouldered entirely by the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. Even though the United States Senate has eluded the \nduty of debating and deciding upon this significant issue, not one year \nhas gone by when the subject matter hasn't weighed heavily on my mind.\n  If one year ago you had questioned any number of business or trade \nentities in Washington state my position on the prospect of extending \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, to China, I can almost \nguarantee you would have received a non-committal response. For years I \nhave questioned China's commitment to free trade with the United \nStates, and have been critical of the notion that the U.S. continue a \nrelationship of ``engagement'' with the PRC. Couple these concerns with \nallegations of espionage, nuclear non-proliferation, questionable \ncampaign contributions and influence, human rights abuses, persecution \nof religious freedom, and the treatment of the one true Chinese \ndemocracy, Taiwan, and one might challenge the notion that China \nreceive such significant trading status from the United States. Mr. \nPresident, these issues have played a significant role in my criticism \nof our relationship with China, and therefore maintained an elevated \nstatus as I reviewed the prospect of voting on PNTR.\n  When I made my final decision regarding China's trade status, the \nmere simplicity of the issue suggested a rationale and consideration \nbased solely on trade ramifications and WTO accession procedures alone. \nChina's accession to the World Trade Organization is forthcoming, it's \na fact, it's a reality, and it will happen. If the United States does \nnot grant PNTR to China, the PRC will gain its ambitiously sought seat \nin the WTO, and the United States will lose all the benefits of trade \nwith the more than 1.2 billion inhabitants of China. If Congress does \nnot pass PNTR, the U.S-China trade deal that was 14 years in the making \nwill be considered null and void, and every other member of the World \nTrade Organization will have access to the world's third largest \neconomy. The potential loss of trade to the United States, and to the \nState of Washington, is too significant to ignore.\n  If the simplicity of the PRC's accession to the WTO was not enough to \nforce me to reconsider my stance on trade with China, the details of \nthe bilateral U.S.-China trade agreement helped secure my final \ndecision to support PNTR. While I have long been critical of the \nClinton-Gore Administration's policy with respect to China, the \nagreement brokered and finalized by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene \nBarshefsky is uncomparable.\n  By granting PNTR to China, the U.S. stands to benefit from a wide \narray of trade issues. While the United States retains our valuable \ntrading leverage in the bilateral agreement and will gain access to a \nonce heavily guarded market, China is forced to amend its market \nstrategy and alter its trading exercises in favor of practices that \nembrace free market principles. When and if China alters its trading \npractices, it's clear the U.S. has everything to gain.\n  When formulating my decision to support PNTR, it was necessary that I \nreview and concur with those terms stated in the bilateral agreement. \nIf the terms were ever called into question by U.S. industry, \nmanufacturers, agriculture, the service sector, or the high tech \nindustry, I would seriously reconsider my position.\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\n  However, not one of the aforementioned industries in the State of \nWashington outlined an objection to trade with China. According to the \nWorld Bank, China will have to expand infrastructure by $750 billion in \nthe next 10 years. Washington companies like Boeing, Paacar, and \nMircosoft are prepared to fill their needs. Service sector companies \nlike Eddie Bauer, Starbucks, and Nordstrom will step up to fill \nconsumer demands. Not to mention, agriculture can finally attempt to \npenetrate the Chinese market that has for so long eluded our \ncommodities. From the lush orchards of Central Washington to the \nrolling wheat fields of the Palouse, agriculture in Washington state is \nprepared and stands ready to benefit from the access to the 1.2 billion \nconsumers in China.\n  While it was fascinating to me that so many varying industries and \nretail companies support PNTR and trade with China, the mere numbers \nand degree of tariff reduction contained in the bilateral agreement \npersuaded me most.\n\n  For example, the U.S. agriculture products that once faced enormous \ntrade barriers and sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions, will \nreceive a reduction of tariffs on average from 31.5 percent to 14.5 \npercent. Access for bulk commodities will be expanded, and for the \nfirst time ever China will permit agriculture trade between private \nparties.\n  What does this mean for Washington state agriculture? For the first \ntime in over 20 years, China has finally agreed to lift the ominous and \nridiculous phytosanitary trade barrier Washington wheat growers have \nlearned to hate--TCK smut. As a result of this trade agreement, Chinese \nofficials traveled to Washington state this spring and secured a tender \nfor 50,000 metric tons of Pacific Northwest wheat. While this purchase \nis nominal, and represents a figure that I will press to increase, the \nelimination of export subsidies on wheat has already enhanced the \nexpansion of markets wheat growers desire.\n  For some of our most precious and high value commodities such as \napples and pears, tariffs will be reduced from 30 percent to 10 \npercent. Frozen hash browns, the pride of the Columbia Basin, will \nreceive tariff reductions from 25 percent to 13 percent. Tariffs on \ncheese will plummet by 38 percent; grapes by 27 percent; cherries and \npeaches by 20 percent; potato chips by 10 percent; and beef by 33 \npercent. All of these commodities represent a significant portion of \nthe Washington state agriculture industry, and at a time when new \nmarkets are difficult to come by, news of China's tariff reduction \npromises resulted in waves of support for PNTR by farmers.\n  Washington state agriculture is not the only sector to gain access to \nChina's market. As a matter of fact in 1998, direct exports from \nWashington to China totaled $3.6 billion, more than double the exports \nin 1996. Of that figure, 91 percent represented transportation \nequipment, namely aircraft and aircraft parts.\n  The Boeing Company maintains 67 percent of China's market for \ncommercial aircraft. Boeing anticipates that over the next 20 years, \nnearly one million jobs will be related to Boeing sales to China. Over \nthe next 10 years, China is expected to purchase 700 airplanes worth \n$45 billion. Recognizing Boeing's significant contribution to the Puget \nSound region and the State of Washington, it's no wonder one of the \nmajor labor unions that builds these airplanes supports PNTR.\n  So many people automatically equate transportation jobs directly with \nBoeing, but the aerospace and commercial airline industry is also \nsupported by thousands of additional employees that contract and \nsubcontract with the nation's only airline supplier. These contractors \nin Washington and all across the nation also stand to benefit from \ntrade with China.\n  While the agriculture and manufacturing industries in Washington \nstand to gain, the high-tech, service sector and forest product \nindustries also will benefit from liberalized market access. China has \nagreed to zero tariffs on computers and equipment, telecommunications \nequipment, and information technology. Tariffs on wood will decrease 7 \npercent, and paper by 17 percent. In addition, fish products tariffs \nwill drop by 10 percent.\n  Washington's geographic proximity to China automatically benefits the \nservice sector, the ports, and transportation infrastructure. Banking, \nsecurities, insurance, travel, tourism, and professional services such \nas accounting, engineering, and medical needs will all gain access to \nChina's market. Knowing the ambitious and adventurous nature of many \nWashingtonians in these fields, I can imagine many State of Washington \nsubsidiaries could find a home in China.\n  While all these tariff reductions and trade liberalization efforts \nlook good on paper, there are also several mechanisms built into the \nbilateral agreement to address trade and import concerns. Two of the \nmost significant items negotiated by the United States were the import \nsurge mechanism and the anti-dumping provisions. Both these provisions \nwere considered ``deal breakers'' by American negotiators. Had they not \nbeen included, the U.S. would have walked away from the negotiating \ntable.\n  The import surge mechanism will remain in place for 12 years \nfollowing China's accession to the WTO, and can be used in response to \npotential import disruptions by China. The anti-dumping provision will \nremain for 15 years and will be used by the U.S. should an influx of \nChinese products flood our market.\n  The efficacy of the anti-dumping mechanism is evidenced by the case \nthe U.S. apple industry filed and won against China. Citing an \nexcessive increase of apple juice concentrate, the U.S. industry filed \nan anti-dumping case with the International Trade Commission, ITC, just \nlast year. After the U.S. Department of Commerce and the ITC agreed \nthat the U.S. industry had been harmed, the price for juice apples in \nthe U.S. increased from $10 per ton back to the normal $130 per ton. \nThis case was significant as it exemplified the United States' ability \nto appropriately deal with Chinese dumping practices, and it concluded \nthat the U.S. has an appropriate and workable mechanism to address the \nissue of import surges.\n  While the aforementioned specifics about the bilateral trade \nagreement speak volumes to our trade dependent friends at home in \nWashington, when all is said and done, when all the tariffs are reduced \nand markets are liberalized, major questions will still remain. Will \nChina become the trading partner that the U.S. hopes and desires? Will \nthe PRC adhere to those details so cautiously and ambitiously sought? \nWill the U.S. market benefit from the buying power of China's 1.2 \nbillion consumers? While I might not remain as optimistic about trade \nwith China as some of my counterparts or those in the U.S. trade \nindustry, one fact will remain constant. With the passage of PNTR and \nChina's eventual accession to the World Trade Organization, leaders in \nBeijing will have to begin complying by international trade rules and \nrestrictions or face the wrath of its new trading partners. These \npartners will include the United States and all of our allies.\n  Of the other questions that still remain regarding human rights, \nreligious freedom, non-proliferation, allegations of espionage, and the \ntreatment of Taiwan, one can only hope that the eventual promises and \nattractiveness of democracy and free market principles will be embraced \nby those who encounter it for the first time. One hopes that \neventually, Falun Gong practitioners will be able to practice their \nfaith in public. One hopes that eventually the weight of \ninternationalism, globalization and trade will move Beijing away from \ntheories and military practices that could bring harm to their trading \npartners. One hopes that eventually workers will perform in a less \noppressive regime. One hopes that China will one day accept Taiwan as \nan independent nation. One hopes.\n  Because I have remained vigilant about my criticism of China, I \nendure to continue my close watch over United States interests and \nnational security. Because I unconditionally support Taiwan and that \ncountry's efforts to embrace freedom and democracy, I will forevermore \nremain their champion. While I believe that democracy will eventually \nreign true, I will continue to raise concerns regarding human rights, \nreligious freedom, and the United States relationship with China on all \nfronts.\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\n  I will vote for PNTR not because I am comfortable with the thought \nthat China will adhere to all the details in the bilateral agreement, \nor the prospect that they will become exceptional trading partners \novernight, but I support the men and women from the most trade \ndependent state in the nation who have urged its successful passage.\n  Whatever the course of our relationship with China takes over the \ncoming years, I assure Washingtonians that I will be scrutinizing the \nreactions of Beijing very closely. I will continue to engage in a \ndialogue with all interested parties to ensure that Washington benefits \nfrom these new trade practices. I will work to ensure that American \ninterests and national security weigh heavy on the minds of our \nnegotiators and the next Administration. Because this vote is \nunmistakably one of the most significant trade votes the Senate has \ncast in recent years, I assure my constituents that I will keep their \ninterests at heart.\n  Whatever it takes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have decided to vote in favor of China \nPNTR because I believe this action will continue our policy of \nengagement with the Chinese government and increase the likelihood that \nour nation will have better relations with China in the years to come. \nThe other option was to act on the assumption that China will become \nmore hostile to the United States and that we must try to seal it off, \nwhich will not work.\n  This decision is a further step down the road that was begun by \nPresident Nixon in 1972 when he concluded it was better to have \nrelations with China than to shut it off. Since then there have been \nmany difficulties, but on the whole, I believe the relationship has \nbeen better than it would have been otherwise.\n  We now maintain military superiority over China and it is critical \nthat it continue. I do not believe that it is inevitable that our \nfuture will be shaped by hostile relations with China. If we are strong \nand maintain our military, the chance of avoiding potential future \nhostilities will be improved. Such a vision is what wise leadership is \nall about.\n  I am not certain how best to improve the conditions of Christians and \nother religious people in China. I do recall, however, that when Rome \nchanged from persecuting the early Christians to making Christianity \nthe official religion of the empire, the change came about because of a \nchange of heart and not as a result of a threat from an outside \nmilitary power.\n  I was very impressed with the testimony of Ned Graham, son of the \nRev. Billy Graham, who aids Christians in China and who has visited the \ncountry over forty times and distributed over two million Bibles to \nunlicensed Christians. He testified before the Senate Finance \nCommittee. In his summation he stated that a vote for PNTR would \nencourage China's engagement with the world, increase the availability \nof computer technology to its citizens, accelerate its development of a \nrule of law, allow for increased contact between U.S. and Chinese \ncitizens, and ultimately lead to positive changes in its religious \npolicy. He concluded that most importantly ``this action will help \ndiminish the negative perceptions that exist between our two great \ncountries.'' While we, as humans, can never know the future, I am \npersuaded by his remarks. Generosity of spirit and forbearance founded \non strength are the qualities of a great nation.\n  On the level of trade, I believe that my state of Alabama will be \nable to sell more products in China because of the significant \nreductions in the tariffs China has imposed on imported American goods. \nThis increased trade will benefit Alabama's farmers, timber industry \nand much of our manufacturing. It can benefit our transportation \nsystem, including the Port of Mobile.\n  While I think it will increase our exports, I cannot conclude that \nthis agreement is going to help our overall balance of trade deficit, \nat least not in the short run. While China has a significant wage \nadvantage in its manufacturing, it has a shortage of many natural \nresources, lacks technology, has a very poor infrastructure and is \nburdened by corruption and a lack of a rule of law which protects \nliberties and property interests. In addition, it continues to hold on \nto the form of communism, an ideology of incalculable destructive \npower. These problems will burden them for years to come and will take \nmany generations to eliminate.\n  The key to the success of this agreement will be vigorous, determined \nand sustained leadership by the United States to ensure that China \ncomplies with this agreement and the WTO rules. China's tendency has \nbeen to cut corners and not live up to its obligations under \nagreements. In my view, China must come to see that its interests and \nthose of its trading partners will be advanced by following these \ntrading rules. Unfortunately, China seems to be obsessed with exporting \nand not importing. The truth is China and her people will benefit from \nhaving the opportunity to buy quality food and products from around the \nworld. They must come to recognize that fact.\n  This issue is very complex and no one can see into the future with a \ncrystal ball, but my analysis and judgement tells me it is time to step \nout in a positive way, and to take the lead in reducing some of the \nsuspicions and misperceptions that have grown in recent years between \nour two nations.\n  Since I believe that increased economic activity between our two \ncountries is not likely to assist China in strengthening its military \nin any substantial way, regardless of legislation, I see the positive \naspects of this legislation outweighing the negative. We must, however, \nmake clear to China that we intend to defend our just interests and \nthose of our allies around the world, and that we will not abandon our \nally and friend, the Democratically elected government of Taiwan. We \nalso need to remain especially vigilant to protect our military secrets \nand technological advantage. I was therefore disappointed that the \namendment offered by Senator Fred Thompson did not pass. We must make \ncrystal clear to our business community that we will not tolerate \ntransfer of our military technology to China. While I favored a number \nof the amendments that have been offered to this legislation, and was \ndisappointed they did not pass, I am appreciative of the quality of the \ndebate that has surrounded this issue.\n  China has 1.2 billion people, the most populous country on this \nglobe. Their people are talented and hardworking. Our vote today should \nenhance our economic and political relationships.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President I rise today in support of H.R. 4444, \nwhich would grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China. I do so \nonly after long and careful consideration of this proposal.\n  I believe that granting permanent normal trade relations with China \nis the right thing to do. It will significantly alter our nation's \nrelations with China. Trade between U.S. companies and the Chinese will \nlikely explode in the coming years--generating jobs and revenues in \nthis country. It could easily be the keystone in the continuing \nprosperity of this nation. And it could be the vital catalyst for \ndemocracy and a free-market system in China.\n  During the last few months as I have traveled through North Carolina \nand met with my constituents, I have heard from hundreds of men and \nwomen who believe that their future prosperity and their jobs turn upon \nthis vote. Many of them eagerly support this legislation.\n  I believe that North Carolina workers can compete with anyone and \nwin. This bill opens a world of opportunity to North Carolina \nbusinesses and workers. The farmer, the high- tech worker, the \nfurniture manufacturer, the factory worker, and the banker all will get \na real chance to capture a part of the Chinese market.\n  The farmer who is working so hard and struggling believes that \nChina's agricultural market will be opened. For example, China already \nimports 12 percent of its poultry meat. If China joins the WTO, it will \ncut its poultry tariffs in half and accept all poultry meat that is \ncertified wholesome by the USDA. A similar situation holds for pork and \ntobacco products. China's agreement to lower its tariffs, to eliminate \nquotas, and to defer to U.S. health standards provides North Carolina \nfarmers with real opportunity.\n  The high- tech worker who is producing software or fiber optics cable \nwill also benefit. China has agreed to eliminate its duties on these \nproducts in the next few years and has agreed to eliminate many of its \npurchase and distribution rules that inhibit sales of U.S. products.\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\n  Meanwhile, tariffs on furniture will be eliminated. Tariffs on heavy \nmachinery will be reduced by nearly one half. Banks and insurance \ncompanies will be able to do business with the Chinese people without \narbitrary restrictions. The list goes on.\n  As U.S. goods and services flow into China and as our engagement \ngrows, the opportunity for real change in China grows. We are all aware \nthat China has a long way to go in improving its record on human \nrights, religious liberty, environmental protection and labor rights. \nThe abuses in that nation are serious. And I am committed to continued \nefforts to end those abuses. As American ideas, goods, and businesses \nsurge into China, I believe China's record will improve.\n  But I am mindful that globalization and this bill in particular may \nhave a real downside. As a Senator from North Carolina, I am well-\npositioned to see both the enormous benefits and the large costs of \nthis measure.\n  Textile and apparel workers, many of whom live in North Carolina, \nface real challenges as a result of this measure. While in almost every \nrespect the agreement with China benefits our country, textiles is the \nmajor exception. As a result of joining WTO, quotas on Chinese textiles \nand apparel will be eliminated in 2005. As a result, Chinese apparel \nwill flow into the United States. By and large, the Chinese imports \nwill likely displace imports from other countries. However, there is no \ndoubt that an additional burden will be placed on the textile industry. \nTo be sure, the industry can try to protect itself through the anti-\nsurge mechanism put in place by this legislation. Yet it does us no \ngood to pretend that these remedies are perfect and that people will \nnot be hurt. I know that textile workers will work their hearts out \ncompeting with the Chinese. I know these people; I grew up with them. \nWhen I was in college, I worked a summer job in a textile mill. My \nfather spent his life working in mills. The impact of PNTR on them is \npersonal to me. Dealing with the impact of this bill on them will \nalways be a top priority for me. And I will fight throughout my career \nto protect them.\n\n  Mr. President, China's entry into the World Trade Organization and \nits attainment of permanent normal trade relations with America is not \nwithout its risks. No one can predict with certainty that China will \nlive up to its commitments. I vote for this bill because I believe that \nwe must turn our face toward the future. But we must be mindful of the \nrisks. So I warn that I will monitor China's compliance with its \nagreements like a hawk. If they renege, I will lead the charge to force \nthem to live up to their obligations.\n  But to vote against this measure--to deny PNTR--not only fails to \naccomplish anything productive but also denies us enormous \nopportunities. We cannot hide our heads in the sand. China will join \nthe WTO. The Senate has no impact on that decision. The only question \nwe face is whether the U.S. will grant China permanent normal trade \nrelations or whether it will fall out of compliance with its WTO \nobligations. If we fall out of compliance, the U.S. will be denied the \nChinese tariff reductions and rule changes, while every other country \nin the world takes advantage of the Chinese concessions. We must decide \nwhether the U.S. will be able to compete with other countries--Germany, \nFrance, Japan--as they enter the Chinese market. American companies and \nworkers deserve the right to enter those markets. On balance, I believe \nthat China's admission into the World Trade Organization and its \nattainment of permanent normal trading relations is for the good.\n  And so I vote for this legislation, mindful of the risks, prepared to \nwatch the results carefully and optimistic about the future.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senate is completing a historic vote \non the U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000, H.R. 4444, which grants \npermanent normal trade relations, PNTR, status to the People's Republic \nof China. Realizing that many Pennsylvanians have expressed very strong \nfeelings on both sides of this issue, I would like to take a moment to \ndiscuss my reasons for supporting this measure.\n  First, it is important to understand what normal trade relations, \nNTR, is. Since 1980, the United States has granted China NTR status \nevery year, subject to an annual review. ``Normal trade relations'', \nNTR, is the tariff treatment the U.S. grants to its trading partners. \nAll but a select few countries receive this trade status. NTR simply \nmeans that products from a foreign country receive the same relatively \nlower tariff rates as our other trading partners enjoy. The lower \ntariff rates result from years of negotiations and various trade \nagreements in which the U.S. reduces its duties on imports, in exchange \nfor reduced rates on its own products. NTR lowers tariff rates, but \ndoes not eliminate them altogether. In this way, NTR substantially \ndiffers from a free trade agreement. Free trade agreements, such as \nNAFTA, set dates by which all tariffs among the member countries will \nbe eliminated. I would also note that certain countries receive even \nlower tariffs than NTR affords through ``preferential'' tariff status.\n  The U.S.-China Relations Act ends the annual renewal process for \nChina's trade status by extending permanent normal trade relations, \nPNTR, to China. The Act becomes effective when China is officially \naccepted as a member of the World Trade Organization, WTO. Upon China's \naccession to the WTO, a trade agreement negotiated between the Clinton \nAdministration and China will also become effective. In exchange for \nPNTR, China has agreed to unprecedented tariff reductions and market-\noriented reforms. The U.S. is not required to reduce our tariffs or to \nmake any commitments, other than extension of PNTR. We also preserve \nthe right to withdraw market access for China in a national security \nemergency. China, however, has committed to specific trade concessions \nby certain dates. Thus, the terms of this agreement are clear and \nenforceable. If China violates its agreements, the U.S. will be able to \nrespond quickly and definitively.\n  I supported H.R. 4444 because without Congressional approval of PNTR \nstatus for China, the U.S. would not benefit from the concessions China \nagreed to in the bilateral trade deal. These concessions, which open \nthe Chinese market to American goods and services, will benefit \nPennsylvania's farmers, industries and workers. Likewise, I believe \nthat engagement in a rules-based system of trade will help foster \npolitical and personal freedom, as well as economic opportunity, for \nChina's citizens.\n  Mr. President, China is now the third largest economy in the world. \nThe bilateral trade agreement pries open this historically closed \nmarket for Pennsylvania's products and services, especially in the \nagriculture, technology, banking, insurance, and manufacturing sectors. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania exports a \nwide range of products to China. Pennsylvania, as a major exporter of \nbeef, pork, poultry, feed grains, and dairy products, will see average \nagriculture tariffs cut by more than half by January 2004. China \nmust also eliminate its agriculture export subsidies and reduce \ndomestic subsidies. Industrial tariffs on U.S. exports to China will be \ncut by more than half by 2005. Furthermore, China must eliminate \nquotas. Within three years, Pennsylvania companies and farmers will \nhave full trading rights to import, export, and distribute their \nproducts directly to Chinese customers. Tariffs on chemical products, \nautomobiles, and steel exported to China will also be cut from their \npresent rates. And of course, it is important to note the strength of \nPennsylvania's workers in these industries. The bilateral agreement \ntakes the first steps in leveling the playing field for Pennsylvanians \nto compete in an emerging international market.\n\n  I am also pleased to say that small and medium sized businesses will \nbenefit under the bilateral agreement. Most companies that are \ncurrently exporting to China are small and medium sized enterprises, \nSMEs. Nationally, 82 percent of all firms exporting to China were SMEs. \nOf all Pennsylvania's companies exporting products to China, 63 percent \nare SMEs.\n  Despite the benefits of our trade agreement, I am mindful of sincere \nopposition to granting PNTR to China on the basis of its human rights \nrecord. Under H.R. 4444, the United States will no longer condition \nChina's trade status upon an annual review of ``freedom of emigration'' \npractices. This does not mean that the U.S. will stop pressuring\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\nChina to allow its citizens to leave the country, if they choose to do \nso, nor does it mean that the U.S. will stop monitoring the widespread \nhuman rights violations in China. Rather, H.R. 4444 establishes a \nspecial Congressional-Executive Commission to monitor human rights \nabuses in China and to recommend appropriate remedies to the President \nand Congress. I realize that the Commission, PNTR, and even eventual \nWTO accession will not immediately bring about change in China; \nhowever, I believe that further engagement and economic reforms will \nlead to greater political and personal freedom for Chinese citizens. \nIsolating China serves only to strengthen the hand of hard-line \ncommunists who would continue to oppress the Chinese people. Many \nreligious leaders share this view, including some pastors of Chinese \nhouse churches who have been jailed for their beliefs.\n  Another concern that I have taken very seriously is the potential \nimpact on American workers. I have studied both the bilateral trade \nagreement and this legislation very carefully. Basically, the Chinese \nreceive the same NTR tariff rates they have received for the past 20 \nyears. In return, we get lower tariffs for our exports to China, new \nmarket access in distributing our products within China, and \nelimination of trade barriers for U.S. goods and services in the \nChinese market. In other words, China essentially gets the status quo, \nwhile we get new benefits and substantial concessions from the Chinese. \nThe U.S. fully preserves its anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, \nwhich protect our industries and workers against unfairly traded \nChinese imports. I would also note that H.R. 4444 provides even \nstronger protection from harmful Chinese import surges than current \nU.S. trade law allows. Furthermore, H.R. 4444 creates a government task \nforce to prevent products made from Chinese prison labor from being \nimported into the U.S. With these protections in place and with \neffective enforcement, I believe that American workers can compete \nagainst anyone else in the world. American workers are, after all, the \nworld's most productive.\n  I would also like to address the difference between granting PNTR to \nChina and WTO accession. Congress has voted to extend PNTR to China; \nhowever, Congress has no vote on China's accession to the WTO. WTO \naccession is a four-step process. First, the applicant must present its \ntrade and economic policies to a Working Party of all interested WTO \ncountries. While these general multilateral negotiations take place, \nseparate negotiations take place between the applicant and individual \nWTO countries, including the United States. These bilateral \nnegotiations establish specific market access commitments and tariff \nrates. When both of these steps are completed, the Working Party drafts \nthe terms of membership. Finally, the complete package is presented to \nthe WTO Ministerial Conference for approval. The result of not \nextending PNTR would have been to deny U.S. farmers, manufacturers, \nbanks, insurance firms, and their employees access to the Chinese \nmarket as promised in the bilateral trade agreement. Also, the U.S. \nwould have been unable to avail itself of multilateral dispute \nsettlement procedures in the WTO if further trade disputes with China \narise.\n\n  Finally, I would like to assure Pennsylvanians that my vote on PNTR \ndoes not lessen my resolve to fight for fair trade in any way. Even \nafter China joins the WTO, I will continue to monitor their adherence \nto the bilateral trade agreement. H.R. 4444 requires the United States \nTrade Representative, USTR, to issue a yearly report on China's \ncompliance with its WTO obligations. I will follow these reports \nclosely. In the meantime, I will continue to vigorously fight for \nstronger trade laws to protect U.S. workers and producers from unfairly \ntraded foreign imports. For example, just last Friday, I testified at \nthe International Trade Commission to oppose revocation of the \nantidumping and countervailing duty orders on various foreign steel \nimports.\n  I hope this clarifies the reasons I am supporting the U.S.-China \nRelations Act of 2000.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, many of us have struggled for months \nto decide what is the right vote on China PNTR--the right vote for our \nindividual states, the right vote for the Nation. I certainly have, as \nI have tried to grasp what effect PNTR with China might have on my \nstate of West Virginia.\n  Over the last few months I've taken some time to listen and to talk \nwith people in my state, to review where we are in West Virginia under \nthe current trading system. I've tried to assess if West Virginia will \nbe helped or disadvantaged if the Congress rejects PNTR. That is what I \ncare about more than anything.\n  It is well known that West Virginia is a long way from enjoying the \nfull benefits of the economic boom that we hear so much about. \nUnemployment remains over 5 percent, stuck stubbornly far above the \nnational average. Our per capita income is $19,362, 49th among the \nstates. Far too many of our working poor require food stamps, and far \ntoo many remain uninsured. And while I will fight every day to bring \nmore and better jobs to West Virginia, the fact remains that we are a \nlong way from providing the economic opportunities for the thousands of \nWest Virginians who want to improve their lives, or are just struggling \nto survive from day to day.\n  There are many complex reasons that my state lags behind the nation \neconomically. But one significant reason-- which I believe with all of \nmy heart and which I cannot ignore--is the simple fact that our current \ninternational trading system is simply not working for the people of \nWest Virginia. The status quo is not working for West Virginia, neither \nfor its workers nor for its industries.\n  We are just not being fairly treated under the current rules. Witness \nthe struggle we have faced to protect our critical steel industry. \nCheap and illegal imports began flooding the U.S. market in late 1997. \nA full two years passed before the first trade cases were resolved and \nthe domestic industry got any relief and remedy. In those two years, \nsix steel producers went bankrupt. Thousands were laid off. The impact \non those companies, their employees, and the steel communities was \ndevastating. And that is why I introduced fair trade legislation that \nwould give our steel industry a fairer chance to prevent illegal steel \ndumping in the future. The status quo, our current unfair trade laws, \nwere not working for West Virginia.\n  We in West Virginia are not being protected by the current trading \nrules. They are causing us to lose ground, lose jobs, and lose \nindustries. I love my state too much to allow this to continue without \nfighting in every way I know to make it better. I will not vote to \ncontinue the current rules. I will not vote to maintain the status quo.\n  A vote in favor of PNTR for China will allow us to deal specifically \nwith China on steel. For example, under today's unfair trade laws, the \nPresident must take uniform action against all countries that are \ndumping their imports on our market. Under current law and the status \nquo, the United States cannot single out one country for a tough \nremedy. Under the bilateral's antisurge provisions, we could address an \ninflux of imports from China specifically. That is just one example, \nthere are a few other provisions of the bilateral that could also work \nto, in essence, strengthen our ability to guard against Chinese steel \ndisrupting our market.\n  West Virginia's chemical industry will benefit greatly from the \ntariff reduction that will come from passing PNTR legislation. The \nchemical industry is the largest industrial employer in West Virginia \nwith an average salary of $51,000. During this debate, I heard from all \nof our chemical companies about the potential they have to increase \ntheir exports to China once this agreement goes into effect. Companies \nlike DuPont who wrote me recently with the following: ``DuPont \ncurrently exports to China almost $16 million of products from our \nplants in West Virginia, and we see those exports increasing as the \nChinese economy grows. West Virginia is, in fact, the second leading \nexporter to China, surpassed only by Texas, among DuPont operations \nnationwide. West Virginia exports will drop to zero, however, if \nCongress does not enact PNTR legislation--because China will keep its \ntariffs high for U.S. exporters while lowering its tariffs for all \nother members'\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\nnations of WTO. Enactment of this legislation is, therefore, extremely \nimportant to DuPont and to our 3500 employees in West Virginia.''\n  It also means that as a part of the international trading regime, \nChina will have to deal with 131 other trading partners who all will be \nincredibly vigilant to ensure that China is playing by the rules. It \nwill not be a perfect system, but it will be a much better system.\n  So I say, Mr. President, when you have the opportunity to do trade \nand business with 1.2 billion people, to engage them with the world as \nwe do today, to change the status quo that is not working for West \nVirginia, then you must do what is right. It's even more important when \nyour state ranks 4th among all 50 states in percentage of products made \nthat are exported abroad. That is why I will vote today to approve \nPermanent Normal Trade Relations with China.\n  To be clear, the vote we take today is not about China entering the \nWTO. Others have said this, but it bears repeating over and over. The \nAmerican people must understand this: China will enter the WTO no \nmatter what the Congress does.\n  So, the sole question we must answer is, what will the impact be if \nthe Congress rejects PNTR? Has this annual review of our trading \nrelationship with China had the impact we had hoped it would, and what \nwill be the effect of rejecting PNTR on West Virginia and all the \nUnited States?\n  First, as to the impact on China.\n  I do not accept, indeed, I abhor, the unfair and sometimes inhumane \nconditions faced by the people of that largest of the world's \ncountries. I have spent a considerable amount of time in that part of \nthe world and I know conditions there are unacceptable. All people who \nlove freedom decry the violations of people's rights in China. As the \nleader of the free world, America must acknowledge its responsibility \nto do all in our power to better China's treatment of its people.\n\n  I also believe we should encourage nations like China, where fast-\ngrowing economies will increase both energy demand and greenhouse gas \nemissions, to use the cleanest technologies available. In fact, I view \nPNTR as the best means of introducing these mostly-American \ntechnologies, some of the most cutting-edge of which were developed in \nWest Virginia, to the Chinese energy sector.\n  At the same time, I cannot say that the Congress' annual review of \nChina has had any impact on China whatsoever--and we are just kidding \nourselves if we think denying China PNTR now will improve labor or \nhuman rights. The annual PNTR review was supposed to provide us with \nsome leverage to improve the conditions in China. But in reality, it \nhas become mostly a feel-good, rubber stamp process here in the \nCongress that has no impact. Neither wages nor working conditions nor \nenvironmental safeguards have been advanced because we go through the \nannual charade of PNTR. I wish this were not true; the world experience \nsays it is.\n  What will improve labor and human rights in China, in my view, is our \nworking to bring China into a world living under law, acting to bring \nChina into a fairer trading system without its restrictive tariffs and \nother barriers, and fighting to force China to deal in the world of \nnations under fairer rules, not just its own rules. Fighting to make \nChina play by the rules--that's a fight I'm willing to make!\n  So I turn then to my second question: Will our country and my state \nbe disadvantaged if we reject PNTR?\n  To that there is only one answer--I am convinced we, my state, my \ncountry, will be harmed if PNTR is rejected. No one else.\n  Remember, China will enter the WTO no matter how the Congress votes \non PNTR. When that happens, and if we reject PNTR, all other WTO \nnations will have the upper hand, and all of our trading partners will \nbenefit from lower tariffs and greater access to the world's largest \nmarket. Other nations will have all of the advantages in doing business \nthere. Our workers, our industries, our farmers--all will have lost \nthis new opportunity to gain fairer access to the largest of the \nworld's untapped economies. Why would we want to squander that \nopportunity?\n  Rejecting PNTR means we lose--America loses--the many important \nconcessions that were won last year in our government's negotiations \nwith China. All will be lost, including unprecedented concessions that \nwill give U.S. industries the upper hand in cases where the fairness of \nChina's trading practices is in question. The bilateral agreement \nprovides a twelve year product specific safeguard that ensures that the \nU.S. can take action on China if imports from that country cause market \ndisruptions here in America. China has also agreed to grant U.S. \nindustries the right to apply non-market methodology in anti-dumping \ncases for the next 15 years. This is a major boon for U.S. industries \nsuffering from injury caused by unfair and illegal imports. China makes \nother concessions as well, which make it easier for businesses in this \ncountry to prove countervailing duty cases against China.\n  These new provisions could be used to help companies, like Portec \nRail, in Huntington, West Virginia, who may have been harmed from \ndumping of Chinese steel rail joints. It seems to me that companies \nlike Portec Rail might be early beneficiaries of these stronger import \nsurge provisions.\n  Let me be clear, these provisions improve the status quo. They are \nstronger than our current unfair trade laws. Under the new agreement, \nChina will finally be required to greatly lower its barriers to our \ntrade there. China makes all the concessions. We have nothing to gain--\nand everything to lose--by rejecting PNTR.\n  And lose we will. What would be the likelihood of Chinese retaliation \nif we reject PNTR? There is little doubt in my mind that China would \nretaliate against U.S. economic interests. On a purely political level, \nit would bolster China's hardline forces of party control and state \nenterprise. And this could destabilize an area of the world that I care \ndeeply about, the Taiwan Straits. I have spent a large part of my time \nworking on the cross Straits issue between China and Taiwan. I want to \nsee peace in that region. I want to see Taiwan join the WTO. But, \nrejection of this deal could have real dangerous consequences for \nTaiwan. China is simply too unpredictable, and could paralyze our \nefforts to promote peace and economic stability in Asia and around the \nglobe.\n  Mr. President, of course we need to be vigilant and tough with China \nas we take advantage of this new economic opportunity. I fully realize \nthat China has generally gone about its trading business however it saw \nfit, doing whatever it wanted and barring most competition. That cannot \ncontinue, and that is exactly why I believe we must bring China into \nand under the scrutiny of the WTO. We must make China play by a fairer \nset of rules, which means bringing them into a trading system governed \nby rules that we have helped create. And rules that we can enforce.\n  Mr. President, this is an opportunity for America that I am willing \nto fight for.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has been able \nto pass, after extended debate, H.R. 4444 which will make Normal Trade \nRelations with China permanent. After over twenty years of yearly \nextensions of Most Favored Nation trading status, we are now going to \nstabilize our trading relations with the Chinese. This is a step \nforward for the United States, China, and our citizens.\n  I believe in trade as a liberalizing force. A country cannot accept \nour goods and services and not be exposed to our ideas and values. One \nhas only to look around the Pacific to see countries that have made the \nmove from dictatorship to democracy and see their focus on trade to \nunderstand the connection. South Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia have all \nmade steps toward greater democracy and all three have been engines for \neconomic growth in the region. As capitalism penetrates Chinese \nsociety, the push for greater democracy will inexorably follow.\n  Increased trade and investment between our countries will separate \nChinese workers from dependence on state owned enterprises. Currently \nChinese workers depend on the state for almost everything including \ntheir jobs and paychecks. Once workers have a choice between working \nfor the government and for private business, and can break their \ndependency on the state, the push for greater democracy will only \nincrease.\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\n  Trade will also serve as a valuable tool for exchanges between our \ncountries as a more personal form of diplomacy. As business people \ntravel back and forth, as workers meet Americans, as the Chinese people \nhave more exposure to our country through the media and the internet, \nthe people of China will develop there own attitudes about Westerners, \ncapitalism, and democracy.\n  The World Trade Organization will bring China the prestige and \nrespect it craves, but at a price. As a member, China will be treated \nlike any other member of the international community, and not like an \noutcast or rogue. The members of the WTO, however, will not let \nthemselves be taken advantage of in trade matters. During this debate I \nhave heard many members talk about the advantage of multilateral \nsanctions over unilateral ones. The WTO offers members an excellent \nmechanism to propound and enforce multilateral sanctions, forcing \nChina's compliance on trade issues.\n  While the agreement that the Administration negotiated in the fall of \n1999 is not perfect, it significantly equalizes the terms of trade \nbetween our countries. Not only did we convince the Chinese to \ndrastically reduce their tariffs on everything from auto parts to ice \ncream, we also negotiated to keep our anti-dumping and import surge \nlaws. On our side, we gave up nothing in exchange. We did not allow any \nadditional access to our markets or lower our tariffs. It was a one way \ndeal--a deal that U.S. farmers and workers benefit from. People may be \nconcerned about Chinese imports into the United States, but this \nagreement does not alter China's access to our markets one bit. On our \nside of the Pacific, nothing will change.\n  Some of my colleagues were disappointed that workers' rights \nprovisions were not provided for in this agreement. I share their \nconcern that China does not share our belief in the importance of \nrespecting working people. I believe that Senator Helms had an \nexcellent proposal for raising the working conditions in China, while \nprotecting the reputations of U.S. businesses that operate in China. \nHis amendment to create a voluntary Code of Conduct for U.S. businesses \nin China would go a long way in protecting Chinese workers. By agreeing \nto respect certain rights to organize, to earn a decent wage, and to \nwork in a safe environment, Chinese workers would learn the benefits of \nAmerican style capitalism. This would also protect U.S. companies from \nbeing accused of abusing foreign workers for economic gain. We all know \nthe public relations albatross around the neck of companies that moved \nto third world countries and thought they did not have a responsibility \nto meet Western standards of worker protection. We all know the names \nof companies who have operations in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Central \nAmerica that have been brought under harsh scrutiny when the public \nfinds out what the conditions are in these factories. Senator Helms's \namendment provided an opportunity for companies to avoid this negative \npublicity by agreeing openly that certain principals will always be \nrespected, regardless of whether the factory is in China or the United \nStates.\n  As we focus on expanding economic ties with China, we must consider \nour decision to grant PNTR in the context of our broader foreign policy \nrelationship with China. I count myself among those who support PNTR in \nthe hope that expanded trade with China will result in a more open \nChinese society. To that end, we must be persistent in pressing the \nChinese to demonstrate respect for human rights. Since the May 1999 \nsuspension of the bilateral dialogue on Chinese human rights we have \ncontinued to convey our concerns to the Chinese about their repressive \npolicies. Their unwillingness to engage with us on these issues puts \nmore pressure on us to use the trade and economic contacts we have to \npress them on human rights and other matters.\n  Although I chose not to support the Wellstone amendment which would \nhave conditioned PNTR on specific steps to improve religious freedom in \nChina because I do not believe we should be adding last minute \nconditions to PNTR, I am deeply concerned about the most recent State \nDepartment reports on human rights and religious freedom in China. The \nChinese government's respect for religious freedom and human rights has \ndeteriorated considerably in recent years. Reports of severe violations \ncontinue unabated, including harsh crackdowns against religious and \nminority groups, the imprisonment of religious and minority leaders, \nincluding Catholic bishops, the complete repression of political \nfreedom, and violence against women, including forced abortions, \nsterilizations, and prostitution.\n  There are those who say that we are losing our leverage with the \nChinese on human rights by giving up our annual review of their human \nrights practices before we grant them normal trade relations status. In \npractice, however, this review had become a formality. We have never \ndenied the Chinese normal trade relations status, even in recent years, \nsince the Tianneman Square uprising, when their human rights record has \nbeen so egregious. I have believed that trade can be used as an \neffective bargaining tool in pressuring governments to improve their \nrecords on human rights. In the case of China, PNTR will not only \nprovide us with the opportunity to press the Chinese at the highest \nlevels, expanded trade will expose the Chinese people to the many \nfreedoms we hold so dear, creating pressure from within.\n\n  We will also not be losing our opportunity to monitor Chinese human \nrights practices in a public way. The legislation before us creates a \nHelsinki-style commission which is designed to keep human rights on the \nfront burner of US-Chinese relations. We must monitor Chinese behavior, \nspeak plainly to the Chinese, and take action when necessary to \ncommunicate our objections to China's human rights record. And, we must \ncontinue our support for U.S. government and non-government efforts to \neffect change in China, including the development of the rule of law.\n  We must also use our growing access to China to do all we can to stem \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery \nsystems. The proliferation of these weapons and the ballistic missiles \ndesigned to deliver them pose the greatest threat to our security in \nthe post-Cold War era. One of the consequences of the end of the Cold \nWar has been looser controls on the technology, materials, and \nexpertise to develop weapons of mass destruction. We must do all we can \nto prevent terrorists or radical states from acquiring these weapons \nand the means to deliver them. To that end, we have been a leader in \nsetting up international regimes to prevent the spread of nuclear, \nchemical and biological weapons, and ballistic missiles. Unfortunately, \nthere is much evidence that the Chinese have been heavily involved in \nproliferation activities.\n  Although some would argue that the Chinese have made progress in this \narea, pointing to their 1992 promise to abide by the Missile Technology \nControl Regime, MTCR, their accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty, NPT, their signing and subsequent ratification of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, CWC, and the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, there are still grave concerns about Chinese proliferation \nactivities. At the same time that China was making commitments to \nadhere to international regimes to prevent the spread of nuclear and \nchemical weapons and ballistic missiles, Chinese companies continued to \ntransfer sensitive technology to a number of countries. These \ntechnologies were instrumental in the development of weapons programs. \nMissile technology sales to Pakistan, nuclear technology sales to Iran, \nchemical sales to Iran, and missile technology sales to North Korea \nhave all been attributed to the Chinese. China has played a major role \nin Pakistan's nuclear program, selling Pakistan 5,000 ring magnets, \nwhich can be used in gas centrifuges to enrich uranium, and other \nequipment for their nuclear facilities. As recently as August 9, the \nCIA reported that China is still a ``key supplier'' of weapons \ntechnology, confirming for the first time missile technology sales to \nLibya.\n  The few advances China has made, at least in its formal commitments, \ncan be attributed to U.S. pressure. The key to preventing the further \nspread of sensitive weapons technology and know how is to continue to \npress the Chinese to honor the spirit of these commitments. We must not \nbe afraid to be\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\ntough with them in this area and we must be willing to use all tools--\nincluding sanctions--to bring this message home. Global security is at \nrisk if we allow rogue states to develop the capability to build \nweapons of mass destruction. And, our own national security is directly \nat stake if they develop delivery systems, that is long-range ballistic \nmissiles, to bring these weapons to our shores.\n  That is why I chose to support the Thompson-Torricelli amendment to \nrequire annual reviews of Chinese proliferation activities. If the \nreview identifies persons or other entities engaging in these \nactivities then sanctions would be imposed. I have been a long-time \nsupporter of economic sanctions against companies and governments which \nengage in proliferation activities. I recognize that sanctions may not \nalways be appropriate, and that is why Thompson-Torricelli had waiver \nprovisions. However, sanctions have not been imposed in many cases that \nbegged for a stronger response from our government. The reluctance to \nuse sanctions sends a signal to the Chinese and others involved in \nproliferation activities that there are rarely consequences for bad \nactions. We must have teeth in our non-proliferation policy or in the \nend we will suffer the consequences.\n  I had no desire to delay PNTR in my support of the Thompson \namendment, and I can say the same for all the amendments which I chose \nto support during our consideration of PNTR. Our trade ties can benefit \nus in all our dealings with the Chinese, but we must not permit trade \nto overshadow the broad range of interests which we have with them.\n  I have no illusions about the potential impact of what we have done. \nPNTR will not change the balance of trade overnight. This agreement \nwill take time to have a liberalizing effect on the Chinese government. \nChina is thousands of years old, we will not change their minds in a \ncouple of years, regardless of whether we use carrots or sticks to \npersuade them. We need to continue working to reduce subsidies below \ntheir current levels, and continue to eliminate tariffs. The U.S. will \nalso need to continue to work on human rights as well. The bill \nprovides some of the tools for the work on human rights to carry on, \nbut we must be diligent and stay focused on the task ahead.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a significant \nvote I will cast--a vote in favor of permanent normal trade relations \nfor China. It is significant, but difficult. Difficult because the \nChinese have shown--in everything from predatory trade practices, to \nthreatening our national security, to total disregard for religious \nfreedom and human rights--a disturbing lack of trustworthiness. And \nfurthermore, the current administration seems trapped in a cycle of \nfailed policy. I deeply regret that our President, on behalf of the \nUnited States, has squandered multiple opportunities to protect U.S. \ninterests and to promote American values in trade matters.\n  The vote is significant because about one-fourth of the people in the \nworld live in China. When we talk of China, we need to remember that we \nare talking about people, many of whom seek to embrace the same values \nthat made America great, such as religious freedom, freedom of \nexpression, and capitalism. They want to live free, while many of their \nleaders want only to amass power and rule with a heavy hand.\n  I do not argue, as some do, that dropping the annual review of \nChina's trading status will usher in all of these freedoms. Nor will it \nfurther protect U.S. security interests. That argument is tenuous, at \nbest.\n  The only thing that will usher in the freedom to express religious or \npolitical beliefs, to organize, to obtain a fair trial, and to be free \nfrom governmental intrusion, will be a transformation among China's \nhighest government officials. This will not happen in the absence of a \nwell-formulated policy underpinned by moral leadership on the part of \nthe U.S. Presidency. The leader of the free world must lead the world \ntoward freedom. For the sake of the Chinese people, it is my hope that \nthe next President of the United States will take the initiative in a \ncalculated and consistent manner to be a leader in this area, without \nthe need to be prodded by Congress at every turn.\n  Furthermore, the key to U.S. security interests lies in the hands of \nthe Commander in Chief. If China joins the World Trade Organization, \nthe United States does not alter its ability, or its responsibility, to \nprotect our interests at home and to promote security abroad. While the \nWTO agreement has an explicit exception that states that WTO trade \nobligations do not supercede national security decisions, the fact is \nthat the United States does not need the exception. The most \nfundamental role of the U.S. government is to protect the security \ninterests of its people, period. We can count on other countries to \nattempt to steal our national secrets and to violate our security \ninterests. It is the way of history, the conflict of powers. The \nbreakdown in U.S. security with the Chinese has occurred because this \nAdministration has not been vigilant to protect our interests. It did \nnot and does not have to be that way in the future.\n  Granting permanent normal trade relations to China does not alter the \nPresident's responsibility to promote American values or to protect \nU.S. security interests. However, granting PNTR to China does have a \nsubstantial impact on our ability to enforce our trade agreements. I \nwould like to discuss this issue fully today because I believe it is \ncentral to the ability of American farmers and companies to crack open \nthe Chinese market--on which Chinese officials, at times, appear to \nhave a death grip.\n  As we all know, China has been trying to accede to the WTO for over a \ndecade. In order for this process to be complete, China has to \nnegotiate the terms of the trade agreement that are satisfactory to the \nUnited States and other WTO members and must receive a favorable vote \nfrom the WTO members. Also, for the United States to benefit from those \nnew terms, Congress has to grant to China what is known as ``permanent \nnormal trade relations'' status. The Administration has concluded a \ntrade agreement with China, and the President, Vice President, and \nentire Administration are now asking Congress to support PNTR.\n  A fair trade relationship with China has the potential to give \nMissouri workers and farmers the ability to sell goods in a new market \nof more than one billion people. However, a relationship is not built \non commitments alone. It must include accountability. In China's case, \nwe have a new and improved trade agreement, but we must also be able to \nenforce those commitments.\n  On the first issue--a solid agreement--there has been substantial \nprogress made. China should open its market on equal terms to the \nUnited States. The U.S. market has been fully open to China for years. \nAlthough I would like to see complete reciprocity, I have reviewed the \nproposed agreement for China's WTO accession, and I believe it is a \nforward step toward opening China's market for U.S. products and \nservices. This is a good deal for American jobs and Missouri's long-\nterm economic growth.\n  On everything from automobiles to agriculture, Missourians are \nprepared to embrace the opportunities the agreement could provide: \noverall average tariffs will go from 24 percent to 9 percent by 2005; \nagricultural tariffs will be cut nearly in half (31 percent to 17 \npercent); businesses will be able to bypass state-trading ``middle-\nmen''; import standards for U.S. food goods will be based on sound \nscience; competition will increase in all of the service sectors, like \ntelecom, insurance, banking; the Internet will be open to U.S. \ninvestment; and the list goes on.\n  The Missouri economy at large is poised to benefit substantially from \nfurther opening of the Chinese market. From the early to late 1990s, \nMissouri's exports increased by about 120 percent, going from about $65 \nmillion in 1993, to about $145 million in 1998. Most recently, China \nranked in the top 10 countries for Missouri exports, up from the 16th \nposition in 1993.\n  Agriculture is the largest employer in my home state, and in fact, \nMissouri ranks 2nd in the nation in its number of farms. As I've \ntraveled around the state, stopping in every county over the last few \nmonths, Missouri farmers and ranchers have expressed to me the \nimportance of approving the agreement that has been reached on \nagriculture.\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\n Those I met at the Missouri State Fair and at Delta Days told me that \ntrade is becoming the number one issue for farmers.\n  Soybean farmers, for instance, must export about half of what they \nproduce because there are simply not enough buyers in the United \nStates. As the nation's sixth largest soybean producer, Missouri's \nsoybean and soybean product exports were estimated at $586 million \nworldwide in 1998. China is the world's largest growth market for \nsoybeans and soy products, and it has taken additional steps under the \nWTO agreement to further open its market. Tariffs will be 3 percent on \nsoybeans and 5 percent on soybean meal, with no quota limits. For \nsoybean oil, tariffs will drop to 9 percent, and the quota will be \neliminated by 2006.\n  Examples of how Missouri agriculture stands to benefit are limitless. \nBeef, for instance, could see huge gains. Currently, Missourians are \nnot in any real sense able to export beef to China because of trade \nbarriers. Under the WTO accession agreement, by 2004 China will lower \nits tariff from 45 percent to 12 percent on frozen beef, from 20 to 12 \npercent on variety meats, and from 45 to 25 percent on chilled beef. \nAlso, China has agreed to accept all beef that is accompanied by a USDA \ncertificate of wholesomeness. These are opportunities Missouri \ncattlemen want to embrace. Under the agreement, U.S. cattlemen gain \nparity with those in other countries to compete for a beef market that \ncovers about a quarter of the world's consumers and is virtually wide-\nopen for growth. I know that if Missouri farmers and ranchers are given \nthe opportunity to compete on these fair terms, they will succeed.\n  The WTO agreement could also help Missouri's manufacturing industry. \nMissouri's manufactured exports to China are broadly diversified, with \nalmost every major product category registering exports to the Chinese \nmarket including processed foods, textiles, apparel, wood and paper \nproducts, chemicals, rubber and plastics, metal products, industrial \nmachinery, computers, electronics, and transportation equipment.\n  Missouri's exports to China are from all across the state and include \na variety of small and mid-sized companies. Sales to China from St. \nLouis totaled $93 million in 1998, a 92 percent increase since 1993. \nKansas City posted exports to China of $66 million in 1998, an increase \nof 169 percent since 1993. The exports from the Springfield area grew \nby 42 percent between these years. Clearly, however, these numbers \ncould increase much more if China's market becomes truly open--if China \nkeeps its promises outlined in the WTO agreement.\n  I certainly do not claim to know exactly how changes in trade policy, \nsuch as China's WTO membership, will translate into real changes for \npeople on a day-to-day basis, so I have set up a Missouri Trade Council \nto advise me on issues such as this. I would like to share a few of \ntheir thoughts.\n  Gastineau Log Homes, in New Bloomfield, wants to see if it can tap \ninto China's demand for American-style homes, by providing U.S. \nengineering expertise and the materials with which to make them.\n  In Ava, MO, the Copeland plant (a subsidiary of Emerson Electric) \nexplained how opening markets to one-fourth of the world's population \ncan create jobs and substantially impact local communities. The Ava \nfacility supplies the key components (scroll sets) for air-conditioning \ncompressors. This plant would receive the benefits of the November \nagreement for these scroll sets by a reduction in industrial tariffs \nfrom 25 percent to 10 percent. Also, trading and distribution rights \nwould be phased in over three years, so that Emerson Electric could \ndistribute its scroll sets and compressors broadly, not just to its \nSuzhou plant, but to all distributors in China. And, Emerson Electric \nwill be given the opportunity to service their products and establish \nservice networks. The Copeland management has high expectations about \nsending their products to China. Right now, 40 percent of the plant's \nmanufactured equipment goes to Asia, and the manager is expecting that \npercentage to nearly double. By 2003, exports to Asia well could be \nabout 85 percent, and half of those exports are expected to go to \nSuzhou. Currently, the Ava plant employs about 350 Missourians, and the \nworkforce is expected to double by 2003.\n  After reviewing China's WTO accession agreement and examining its \nprobable impact on Missouri businesses and farmers, I believe that \nwhile the agreement does not give the United States complete \nreciprocity, it does make substantial progress on China's commitment to \nopen its markets. However, the U.S.-China trade relationship must also \nhave accountability. On the second issue--the enforceability of the \nagreement--I have more serious misgivings about the impact of granting \nPNTR to China.\n  The United States government has a responsibility to see that trade \nagreements we enter into are enforceable and enforced. My goal is to \nensure that workers, farmers, and ranchers in Missouri receive the \nbenefits promised to them through our international trade agreements.\n  Unfortunately, there is a combination of factors that I find \ndiscouraging, and that I believe underscores the need to make changes \nto broader U.S. trade policy. These included China's record of \nnoncompliance with its trade commitments, the United States' loss of \nleverage in the WTO to get cases enforced, and China's propensity to be \na protectionist market like the EU which has repeatedly blocked imports \nof American agriculture.\n  China's record of living up to its trade agreements has been dismal. \nChina has frequently opened a door to U.S. companies only to frustrate \ntheir attempts to walk through it. For example, in the early 1990s, \nChina reduced the import tariff on U.S. apples from 40 to 15 percent. \nHowever, by 1996, China had erected new backdoor barriers on apples and \nother agricultural products that U.S. exporters say were even more \npunitive than the original import tariffs.\n  Another example is the 1992 Market Access Agreement in which China \nagreed to eliminate trade barriers to U.S. agriculture, manufactured \nproducts, and automobiles. Not only did China fail to comply with this \nagreement, the Chinese actually made negative changes that put U.S. \nbusinesses in a worse position than they were in prior to the \nagreement. For instance, the U.S. Trade Representative reported that on \n176 items, import restrictions were abolished. However, the Chinese \nreplaced those 176 old restrictions with 400 new restrictions that \nessentially make it harder for U.S. companies to export to China. The \n1999 U.S. Trade Representative report said: ``By 1999, China had \nremoved over 1,000 quotas and licenses. . . . But there are indications \nthat China is erecting new barriers to restrict imports.'' Also, China \nadopted a new auto policy only two years after signing the Market \nAccess Agreement that put auto manufacturers at a severe disadvantage \ncompared to Chinese auto workers.\n  I agree that China's record of noncompliance, considered alone, \nshould not be dispositive of determining how to vote on PNTR. In fact, \nthe Administration says that we have nothing to lose by allowing China \ninto the WTO because by doing so, China agrees to ``deeper and \nbroader'' commitments, and the United States gets the benefits of the \nWTO dispute settlement system to enforce those commitments. However, I \nbelieve the proponents of PNTR have left out an important aspect of \nthis ``deal''--when the United States approves PNTR, we give up our \nability to unilaterally retaliate against China if China doesn't live \nup to its commitments, and must instead rely on the WTO dispute \nresolution system. Unfortunately, the WTO dispute resolution procedures \nhave been inadequate to enforce our rights in past cases where the \nUnited States has successfully challenged unfair trade practices of \nother countries.\n\n  One of my constituents wrote the following:\n\n       Granting PNTR will . . . reduce our ability to use \n     unilateral tools to respond to continued Chinese failure to \n     live up to its commitments. Our ability to take unilateral \n     action is our only leverage against the Chinese government. \n     Proponents of PNTR admit that only by using unilateral \n     actions we were able to make even modest progress on \n     intellectual property rights. The Chinese government has not \n     lived up to the promises they made in every single trade \n     agreement signed with the U.S. in the past ten years.\n\n  This Missourian is absolutely correct. While the process for getting \na WTO Panel Decision issued has become\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nmore favorable to the United States, the ability to enforce Panel \nDecisions has been diminished.\n  In 1994, when the United States negotiated the WTO, the United States \ngave up the right to threaten higher levels of retaliation. The new \nstandard is much more limited. The pre-1994 standard allowed a \nsuccessful party (country) to impose a level of retaliation that was \n``appropriate in the circumstances'' in relation to the violation \nproved. However, now we are bound retaliation levels that the WTO \ndecides is ``equivalent to the nullification or impairment.'' This new \nstandard has impaired our ability to enforce successful decisions, such \nas the one involving the export of U.S. beef to Europe.\n  The detrimental effect of this loss of leverage on our ability to \ndemand implementation of favorable WTO decisions is illustrated by the \nU.S.-EU beef case. The WTO authorized retaliation of only $120 million \nby the United States to address the EU's closed beef market. Compare \nthis figure with the $4.6 billion the United States threatened against \nChina when we were not bound by the WTO retaliation levels. I am not \nsuggesting that the United States should use retaliation levels that \nare disproportionately harsh. I favor multilateral mechanisms to \ndetermine noncompliance with trade agreements. But I believe that once \nthe United States has been successful in challenging another country's \ntrade barriers, retaliation should be authorized to ensure enforcement. \nDenying the U.S. adequate tools to enforce a decision is similar to \ndenying a plaintiff a judgment in a case he won. ``Winning'' just for \nthe sake of being called the winner is not the objective when pursuing \na WTO enforcement decision. U.S. ranchers want to sell beef to the EU \nnot just be told by the WTO that the EU is violating its agreements. \nAnd, if China fails to comply with its commitments in the future, we \nwill need to have the tools to enforce our rights.\n  We need a policy that ensures results, not just paper promises. \nMissourians want some guarantee that inviting China into the WTO will \nresult in enhanced export opportunities, not just never-ending \nlitigation. To address the enforcement issue, I have taken a number of \nsteps including the following.\n  I worked directly with former Commerce Secretary Daley to set up a \n``China Compliance and Enforcement Initiative'' within the Department \nof Commerce. At a Commerce Committee hearing, I told Secretary Daley \nthat this would be my top priority. In response the Enforcement \nInitiative was set up, which does the following:\n  Establishes a Deputy Assistant Secretary for China devoted to \nmonitoring and enforcement of China's trade agreements;\n  Sets up a rapid response team of 12 compliance trade specialists \nbased in Washington, D.C. and in China;\n  Provides U.S. businesses and others with detailed information about \nChina's accession commitments, contact names, and up-to-date \ninformation on China's laws and regulations;\n  Implements an accelerated investigation procedure to encourage \nChina's compliance without having to initiate a WTO case (within 14 \ndays of receiving a complaint about China's noncompliance, the rapid \nresponse team will engage Chinese officials and try to come to a \nresolution of the issue within 90 days);\n  Gives U.S. companies a head start in the Chinese market by launching \na trade promotion campaign, including missions, seminars, and trade \nshows;\n  Closely monitors imports from China to ensure that our trade laws are \nenforced.\n  Second, I am involved in an effort to get the Continued Dumping Act \n(S. 61) passed so that China will be unable to continually flood U.S. \nmarkets with unfair imports. This legislation provides for the \npenalties to be given to the injured industry in the United States if \nChina continues to unfairly dump its products into the U.S. market \nafter a decision has been made and penalties have been imposed. This \nbill would provide a powerful disincentive to foreign producers who \ndump their products in our market because it would give a financial \nbenefit to U.S. manufacturers.\n  Third, I introduced the ``SHOW-ME'' Act (S. 2548), which says that \nthe United States should retain a more liberal standard of retaliation \nin the WTO for China. This is a principle I support for the WTO in \ngeneral. If the United States has completed all of the required steps \nby initiating, arguing, and winning a case in the WTO, we should first \ngive the other country some time to implement this WTO decision. \nHowever, if the country continues to disregard a decision that has been \nmade by a neutral panel in the WTO, the United States should have \ngreater flexibility when setting levels of retaliation. I support a \npolicy that will give the United States more tools for enforcement, as \nopposed to reducing the amount available, which is unfortunately where \nrecent trade negotiations have taken us.\n  Along these same lines, I introduced the WTO Enforcement Act (S. \n1073), which would ensure that U.S. businesses and farm interests are \nwidely represented and heard during every stage of the WTO dispute \nsettlement process, especially when it is necessary to threaten \nretaliation in order to enforce a WTO panel decision in their favor.\n  Fifth, I have worked with newly-appointed Commerce Secretary Mineta \nto make trade enforcement a top priority during the remainder of this \nAdministration. Specifically, I have communicated with Secretary Mineta \nmy goal of attaining added flexibility for the United States in order \nto enforce our rights. Secretary Mineta ensured me in meetings and at a \nCommerce Committee hearing that this would be a priority. I am pleased \nto quote from his most recent statement about the issue:\n\n       As we have recently discussed, I share your concerns about \n     enforcement of dispute resolution cases under the WTO and the \n     available means of retaliation. . . . I will make one of my \n     top priorities enforcement of our trade laws and compliance \n     with our trade agreements, particularly the WTO. Our goal \n     must be to ensure that panel decisions are faithfully \n     implemented. Let me assure you that I will work closely with \n     you and members of the Administration to find effective means \n     of retaliation when decisions are not property implemented.\n\n  These are some of the initiatives I have recently undertaken to \naddress Missourians'--and my own--concerns with China's past \nnoncompliance record and our ability to enforce agreements in the \nfuture. I believe the job of opening markets begins, not ends, with the \nsigning of agreements and the approval of PNTR for China. I know we \nhave a continuing and great responsibility to ensure that America's \nfarmers, ranchers, workers, and businesses receive the full benefit of \nthe agreements that have been negotiated on their behalf. I embrace \nthis responsibility on behalf of the millions of Missourians who are \nimpacted by this vote and this issue. I am committed to monitor China's \ncompliance with our trade agreements and demand action if they fail to \nkeep their promises. In addition, I will continue to encourage this \nAdministration, and the next, to be vigilant about enforcing our \nrights. Missourians deserve the opportunity to export their products \naccording to the terms promised in agreements.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to reiterate the fact that \nthere is, quite frankly, a declining satisfaction in America's \nheartland with our ability--or inability--to open foreign markets. The \nonly way we will rebuild confidence in trade agreements is by real \nenforcement of existing agreements, not by entering into newer, more \nunreliable ones.\n  It is time for U.S. trade policy to be fortified with a strong \nfoundation--that of real enforcement. It is time that our policies lead \nto job creation in practice, not just in theory. It is simply \nunacceptable for the Chinese to repeatedly repackage the same deal with \na new label and not live up to the commitments it makes.\n  I will continue to work with all parties to fashion fair trade \npolicies with China and all our trading partners to increase \nMissourians' access to world markets, which will create more jobs and a \nstronger economy. As a Senator from the Show Me State, I believe China, \nand other WTO members, need to show us that they are serious about \nliving up to trade agreements. I will continue to work toward this \ngoal.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue we have \nbeen debating here in the Senate for the past week--the matter of \npermanent normal trade relations (PNTR) for China.\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\n  Mr. President, my concerns about China are longstanding. They are \nbased in no way on antipathy for the people of China, but rather \nChina's authoritarian government--a government with a human rights \ntrack record that no one in good conscience could even defend. That is \nwhy I opposed the annual renewal of normal trade relations for China \njust last year.\n  At the same time, we are faced with another irrefutable fact--China \nis becoming a member of the global trading community with or without \nthe concurrence of the United States. The fundamental question we are \nfaced with is whether the U.S. will be fully engaged with China during \nthis process.\n  A vote in favor of PNTR for China represents a recognition of \nreality, a recognition that China currently has complete access to our \nmarket while we have very limited access to theirs, a recognition that \nChina is about to burst on to the international trading scene as a full \nfledged member of the World Trade Organization, a recognition that we \nwould be actively choosing to put ourselves at a distinct disadvantage \nrelative to our fellow WTO members should we fail to grant China PNTR.\n  A ``yes'' vote is a recognition that our success in the new century's \nnew global economy--which has arrived whether we care to admit it or \nnot--will only be as great as our willingness to be a part of it, a \nrecognition that we have, rightly or wrongly--and I would argue \nwrongly--already de-linked our trade policy with China from our human \nrights policy, and a recognition that the status quo has done little or \nnothing to help improve the lot of the typical Chinese man or woman.\n  Mr. President, this is an imperfect bill we have before us. \nPersonally, I would have preferred to support a bill improved by a \nnumber of amendments we have considered during our debate. Because I \nbelieve we must do our utmost to impact human rights in china, to \nprotect against the potential impact of their massive cheap labor \nmarket, to preserve our national security and to ensure compliance with \nour trade agreements.\n  For instance, as my colleague, Senator Wellstone, stated on the floor \nduring the debate on his amendment conditioning PNTR on China's \ncompliance with previous U.S.-China prison labor agreements, the 1992 \nagreement allowed on-site inspections by U.S. Customs officials in \nChina to determine whether allegations that forced or prison labor were \nmanufacturing products were true.\n  Yet as soon as Taiwan's then-President Lee visited his alma mater, \nCornell University, In 1992, China demonstrated its displeasure with \nthe U.S. by among other things, suspending its agreement to allow U.S. \ninspections. China still refuses to abide by the terms of this \nagreement.\n  That's why I supported Senator Wellstone's amendment because I \nbelieve it is time for China to start living up to the international \neconomic role it seeks. Even absent that amendment, under the WTO, \nChina is expected to abide by all trade agreements all the time--not \njust when it is in its best interest. And I will be looking to the WTO \nto hold them to that standard.\n  Indeed, as a WTO member, China would be subject to reams of trade \nrules, and any of the organization's 138 members would demand that a \nrule be enforced. I believe that this perhaps, more than anything else, \nwould spur the development of a market economy in china which is based \non full compliance with its trade agreements.\n  Moreover, it is encouraging that the Administration has put forth a \nplan to monitor China's compliance with the establishment of a new \nCommerce Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for China, who would be \ndevoted to monitoring and enforcing China's WTO trade agreements. I am \nalso encouraged by announcements that a ``rapid-response compliance'' \nteam of 12 staff people working in the U.S. and China, and a China-\nspecific subsidy enforcement team, will be established to monitor \nChina's trade compliance.\n  Further, Mr. President, the legislation itself requires an annual \nreport from the USTR on Chinese compliance with WTO obligations and \ninstructs the USTR to work to create a multilateral mechanism at the \nWTO to measure compliance. It also authorizes funding deemed necessary \nfor the U.S. to monitor China's compliance. This is a step in the right \ndirection and a necessary component of this bill.\n  Another issue of utmost importance as we have reviewed PNTR from the \nperspective of what is in the best interests of the United States is \nour ability to maintain our national security.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, one of a president's primary \nresponsibilities under the Constitution is to conduct foreign affairs, \nand in doing so, Americans assume that a president is promoting our \nnational security and interests abroad. As trade among nations is \ninexorably intertwined with political relations among nations, national \nsecurity cannot--and should not--be considered in isolation. Therefore, \nit has been entirely appropriate that China's proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction have been part of this debate.\n  I have long been concerned about transfers of technology by China \nthat contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or \nmissiles that could deliver them. Recent issues have involved China's \nsales to Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, and Libya. On August 9, the CIA \nreported that China remained a ``key supplier'' of weapons technology \nand increased missile-related assistance to Pakistan in the second half \nof 1999.\n  This is why I was a cosponsor of the Thompson-Torricelli bill and a \nsupporter of their amendment. It is vital that the U.S. demonstrates \nthat we will not turn a blind eye to China's proliferation and that we \nwill actively take steps to induce change.\n  The Thompson-Torricelli amendment did not address trade but, in fact, \nwas a crucial part of this debate as China continues to facilitate the \nproliferation of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction, to \nrogue countries. It would have provided an annual review mechanism, \nmandatory penalties, and an escalating scale of responses to Chinese \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, missile technologies, and \nadvanced conventional weapons.\n  Accordingly, I consider the passage and enactment of the Thompson-\nTorricelli proposal in the future not simply to be good policy, but a \ncritical companion to PNTR, and I hope we will revisit this critical \nissue in the 107th Congress.\n  Mr. President, in addition to an in concert with our national \nsecurity responsibilities, one of the most prominent national interests \nof the U.S. is the promotion of human rights around the world. Indeed, \none of the ongoing and essential reasons I have voted against NTR \nstatus for China in the past was due to its infamous human rights \nabuses.\n  During the consideration by the House, provisions were added to the \nPNTR legislation to monitor China's human rights by creating a \nCongressional-Executive Commission. The Commission will submit to \nCongress and the President an annual report of its findings, including \nas appropriate WTO-consistent recommendations for legislative or \nexecutive action.\n  I also recognize that any U.S. trade sanction taken against China \ncould be brought before the WTO for resolution by China. The WTO's \nfocus is international trade law, not human rights.\n  Accordingly, I supported Senator Helms' amendment that would require, \nas a condition of China receiving PNTR, that the President certify that \nChina has taken actions regarding its human rights abuses and religious \npersecution. Just as importantly, I also supported another Helms \namendment that called on U.S. businesses to conduct themselves in a \nmanner that reflects the basic American values of democracy, individual \nliberty and justice--a voluntary code of conduct.\n  While both amendments were clearly defeated on grounds other than the \nmerits of the issue itself, I make a personal appeal to America's \nbusinesses to conduct themselves in a manner that does credit to the \nideas we hold dear as a nation.\n  And I'm certain my colleagues agree that it is clearly in America's \nbest interest--not to mention in keeping with the principles on which \nwe were founded--to keep up the pressure on China to improve human \nrights for its own people and it is my fervent hope that we will do so.\n  Mr. President, economically, U.S. companies have expressed to \nCongress\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nthroughout this debate that our future competitiveness and, ultimately, \nour economic success as a country will be hamstrung without this \nagreement--but with it, all of America will be better off. Again, while \nI would have preferred to vote on a bill strengthened by the amendments \nI have just discussed, I find that I must concur.\n  For the past two decades, the U.S. has granted China low-tariff \naccess to our market. And what have we gotten in return? Any number of \ndifferent trade barriers which have severely limited U.S. access to \nChina's market. To me, Mr. President, this has been far from fair.\n  Under this lopsided arrangement where China maintains nearly complete \naccess to our market while we face stiff barriers, this has contributed \nto the increased trade deficit with China. In 1992, our trade relations \nwith China produced $7.5 billion in U.S. exports and $25.7 billion in \nU.S. imports from China. By last year, our exports rose to $13.1 \nbillion while our imports from China reached an astonishing $81.8 \nbillion--a $68.7 billion deficit.\n  Now, some have argued that by improving the business climate in \nChina, we're opening the floodgates for a massive outflow of U.S. \nbusinesses that will wish to relocate to that country. And certainly, \nChina will be a more attractive place to do business should PNTR be \napproved.\n  But we must keep in mind that, under our current trade arrangement \nwith China, many U.S. businesses have chosen to relocate a degree of \ntheir operations to China because Chinese tariff and non-tariff \nbarriers make it very difficult to export products directly to that \ncountry. In order to gain access to the market, many firms build plants \nin China--however, this strategy has been by no means without is own \nproblems.\n  In fact, businesses currently face a variety of discriminatory \npractices, including technology transfer, domestic content, and export \nperformance requirements--in other words, that firms must export a \ncertain share of their production. Once China becomes a member of the \nWTO--which of course we know is inevitable regardless of how we vote on \nPNTR--it will lower tariffs and eliminate a wide range of non-tariff \nbarriers.\n  What does this all mean for U.S. businesses? It means that many \nfirms--especially small and medium-sized firms, so we're not just \ntalking about large corporations here--might choose instead to export \nproducts directly to China.\n  In other words, a greater investment in China under the provisions of \nthe agreement that has been negotiated could promote an increase in \nU.S. exports to China. And that's not just me talking. According to the \nwell-respected firm of Goldman Sachs, passage of PNTR for China can be \nexpected to increase our exports to China by anywhere from $12.7 to \n$13.9 billion per year by 2005.\n\n  In my home state of Maine, there are a variety of facets of our \neconomy that can expect to benefit. Already, Maine is significantly \nengaged in trade with China--to the tune of $19 million in 1998. From \nagriculture to civil aircraft parts to insurance to wood products to \nhigh-tech industries and fish products, PNTR would allow these vital \nsectors of our economy to continue to complete on an even footing with \nour global competitors, and to do so under WTO enforced rules.\n  For example, there would be zero tariffs on all semiconductors, \ntelecommunications equipment, and other information technology products \nby 2005. Tariffs on wood and paper would be reduced from between 12 to \n25 percent to between 5 and 7.5 percent. And tariffs on fish products \nwould be reduced from 20.5 to 11.4 percent. These are significant \nnumbers for significant industries in Maine.\n  Now, some will argue that PNTR will adversely affect our textile \nindustries. Mr. President, as someone who has long been concerned about \nour trade agreements because of the effect they will have on the \ntextile and apparel industry in the U.S. and in Maine, nobody is more \nsensitive to this issue that I am. Since 1994, Maine has lost 26,500 \ntextile and apparel jobs, so I have scrutinized every trade agreement \nwith this situation in mind.\n  This legislation, however, represents an improvement over past trade \nagreements I have opposed. Again, the fact is, China will become part \nof the WTO. And all WTO members must abide by the Agreement on Textiles \nand Clothing, or ATC, that phases out existing quotas and improves \naccess to the markets of developing countries. In fact, all import \nquotas on textiles and apparels are to cease to exist by January 1, \n2005, and China will reduce its tariffs on U.S. textiles and apparels \nfrom 25.4% to 11.7%.\n  In other words, under the ATC, the U.S. will be required to end \nquotas as will China. I understand that the textile industry wanted a \n10-year phase out period and that opponents have contended that this \nwill allow massive Chinese imports to the U.S., but the U.S. has \nnegotiated specific protections regarding textiles and the PNTR \nlegislation itself contains anti-surge safeguards.\n  Under the bilateral trade deal, the U.S. was able to retain the right \nto impose safeguard measures through 2008 and the PNTR legislation \nauthorizes the president to take action if products from China are \nbeing imported in such increased quantities or under such conditions as \nto cause or threaten to cause market disruptions to the domestic \nproducers.\n  Mr. President, I understand that textiles and apparels are an \ninviting industry for China to utilize its vast labor pool, but I \nbelieve that what we have negotiated and are about to enact into law \naddresses this issue while still allowing us to be full participants in \nthe future.\n  And that is what this is about, Mr. President--the future--for both \nthe United States and China.\n  The fact of the matter is, recent economic development has led to a \nrising standard of living for the average Chinese. Does China have a \nlong way to go? Absolutely. Is this a hopeful beginning? I believe it \nis.\n  We are not going to change China overnight, with or without PNTR. But \nwe must start somewhere. If we are not going to use the annual review \nof NTR for China as leverage for greater human rights in that nation--\nand clearly, as I noted at the beginning, we seem to have long since \nconceded the point, despite my protestations--then it is time to bring \nthe American promise to China through the promise of increased economic \nopportunity for the Chinese people.\n  Change will be incremental at best. The Chinese government has proven \nitself a master of self-perpetuation. They still control the lion's \nshare of finance and the means of production, and they are still a \ngovernment not of the people or for the people.\n  But under this new trade agreement, and as a member of the WTO, the \nChinese government will have a little less control then they had \nbefore. They will be subject to more rules--and rules made by those \noutside of China. And they will know that if they want to be a part of \nthe tremendous promise of the 21st century, this is their only course.\n  Here at home, we have choices to make as well. Will we remain \nglobally competitive? Will we embrace the opportunity to engage \nourselves in a market of 1.3 billion people? Or will we tie oversees to \nthe status quo, where China has access to our market, we don't have \naccess to theirs, and the human rights issue gets no better than it has \nover the past ten years?\n  The bottom line is that the U.S.-China trade agreement--which is \ncontingent on PNTR--represents an unprecedented, albeit imperfect, \nopportunity for the U.S. to gain access to the China market, for the \nU.S. to increase trade and thereby increase innovation and prosperity \nfor ourselves and the generations to come. For these reasons, I will \nsupport PNTR for China.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are weighty arguments that can be \nmade on both sides of the question regarding whether or not to grant \npermanent normal trade relations status, PNTR, to China. But in the end \nthere are two compelling arguments for granting PNTR that, I believe \noutweigh the arguments against it.\n  The first is that our current trade relationship with China is \nunacceptable and the second is that the existing annual review of our \ntrade relationship has failed to improve either that relationship or \nthe human rights situation in China. Granting China PNTR will result in \nconcrete improvements in our trade relationship and offers the promise \nof a significantly more effective\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\ntool for both monitoring and changing the human rights conditions in \nthat country.\n  When I say that our trade relationship with China is unacceptable, I \nam referring to the $69 billion trade deficit with China we ran up last \nyear ($82 billion in imports versus $13 billion in exports). And as bad \nas that deficit is, economists are predicting it will grow. These \nlevels are totally unacceptable. Today, access to China's highly \nregulated and protected market is extremely difficult. China protects \nits domestic market with high tariffs and non-tariff barriers that \nlimit access of foreign companies. There is also inadequate protection \nof intellectual property and trade-distorting government subsidies.\n  There are clearly some advantages to this agreement in terms of \ngaining greater access to Chinese markets. China's current trade \nbarriers, for instance, are especially high in the automotive sector. \nConcessions made by China in the agreement with the United States to \nopen up their automotive sector to our exports are significant, \nincluding tariff reductions. Before the agreement, China's auto tariffs \naverage 80-100 percent. China agreed to lower that to 25 percent by \n2006. Before the agreement China's tariff on auto parts averages 20-35 \npercent. That is reduced to 10 percent by 2006 under the agreement.\n  There are significant tariff reductions in other areas than the auto \nsector. Before the agreement, China's agricultural equipment tariffs \naverage about 11\\1/2\\ percent. China will reduce them to 5.7 percent by \n2002. Before the agreement the Chinese tariff on apples, cherries and \npears is 70 percent. After the agreement, China will reduce that to 10 \npercent, by 2004. China's tariff on chemicals averages 14.75 percent \nnow, and in the agreement China has agreed to reduce it to 6.9 percent \nby 2006. It also agreed to reduce its tariff on filing cabinets from 18 \nto 10.5 percent by 2003. Chinese tariffs on refrigerators would come \ndown from 25 percent to 20 percent by 2002. American farmers and \nexporters have told me they believe they can export to and compete in \nChina with these lower tariffs.\n  China has also agreed to phase out its restrictive import licensing \nrequirements and import quotas for vehicles. China agreed to phase out \nall restrictions on distribution services, such as auto maintenance and \nrepair industries, giving U.S. companies the right to control \ndistribution of their products, which is currently prohibited. In its \nagreement with the European Union, which will apply to all WTO members \nonce China joins the WTO, China agreed to let foreign auto \nmanufacturers, not the Chinese government, as is currently the case, \ndecide what vehicles they wish to produce for the Chinese market. Also, \nas a member of the WTO, China would be required to drop its local \ncontent restrictions. Such changes are significant and long overdue.\n  If the status quo in our trade with China is unacceptable, so too is \nour mechanism for impacting the human rights climate in that country. I \nknow that some have argued that Congress should not grant China PNTR \nstatus because they are reluctant to abandon our annual human rights \nreview process and thus reduce our leverage with China on human rights \npractices. But what real leverage has this annual review and \ncertification process given us when the United States has granted China \nnormal trade relations status every year for 21 years without \ninterruption? Even in 1989, after Tiananmen Square, China's normal \ntrade relations, NTR, status was renewed. If we can certify China even \nafter Tiananmen Square, what is this annual review pressure really \nworth?\n  The human rights situation in China is miserable. That's the current \nsituation, the status quo before the agreement we are considering. \nDescribing the violations of human rights in China now doesn't answer \nthe question of whether we should grant China PNTR any more than \nwhether we should have granted PNTR to Saudi Arabia or other countries \nwhere human rights are violated.\n  In other words, the current situation before this agreement is bad \nregarding human rights as is true with many other countries with whom \nwe have PNTR. I don't see how we are worse off with this agreement in \nterms of getting China to improve their human rights. In fact, the PNTR \nbill we are voting on includes a specific mechanism to monitor and \nreport on China's human rights practices that was proposed by my \nbrother, Congressman Sander Levin. Through the establishment of a \ncongressional-executive commission on human rights, labor market issues \nand the establishment of the rule of law in China we will be keeping \nsome public, visible and ongoing pressure on China to reform in these \nareas. Even the president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney, who was \ncritical of the House vote approving PNTR acknowledged that my \nbrother's provisions,\n\n       . . . marked an historic turning point: a trade bill cannot \n     be passed in Congress anymore unless it addresses human \n     rights and workers' rights.\n\n  In addition to the improved human rights enforcement we gain under \nPNTR, I believe it is at least possible the opening of Chinese markets \nto our products and involving them more and more in the world economy \nwill produce human rights results which the current approach hasn't \nproduced.\n  There may be some truth in the argument that the year-to-year \ncertification creates some uncertainty for American businesses thinking \nof investing in China if they export some of their Chinese production \nback here despite their stated intention not to. This uncertainty, it \nis argued, results in lower levels of US investment in China, and lower \nlevels of job transfers which sometimes accompanies that investment, \nthan would be the case without the tariff uncertainty created by the \nannual review. However, it's unrealistic to expect that investments \nwill not be made in China by companies from other countries even if not \nmade by our companies. European and Asian companies will presumably \nfill any gap. And they could just as easily export their Chinese-made \nproducts to the United States, in which case more US jobs would \nprobably be displaced as a result of those imports than would be \ndisplaced if American companies were the investors.\n  Let's assume you have an American and a German refrigerator \nmanufacturer vying to make refrigerators in China. If both companies \nwere going to ship refrigerators back to the United States, the jobs of \npeople making refrigerators in the United States would seemingly be at \nleast as much jeopardized by the German made-in-China refrigerator as \nthe American made-in-China refrigerator. Actually, the job displacement \nwould probably be less with the American made-in-China refrigerators \nbeing sold back here because the American company is more likely to use \nsome US made components, stimulating at least some US exports. And not \nonly will European and Asian businesses probably be less likely to use \nAmerican made components in items they assemble in China, they will \nprobably have fewer US stockholders gaining from their investments in \nChina than would be the case with an American company's investment.\n  For instance, even though General Motors started production of the \nBuick Regal two years ago in Shanghai, no GM vehicles have come back to \nthe US and $250 million a year worth of American made auto parts were \nused in that production. As a result of General Motors and other US \nvehicle manufacturers' investment in China, in 1999 Chinese imports of \nUS automotive parts grew by 90 percent over the prior year. \nPercentagewise, China's imports of US automotive parts are increasing \nfaster than China's exports of automotive parts to the United States. \nWe are seemingly better off with some US content in Chinese-made \nproducts than with none.\n  It's clear to me that the status quo is failing to improve human \nrights conditions in China and failing to improve our trade \nrelationship with that country. Given that I believe our trade \nrelationship with China is intolerable and China's human rights climate \nis miserable, I do not vote for PNTR to reward China. Far from it. I \nhave no desire to reward China for creating unfair barriers to American \nproducts and maintaining tariffs on our exports while Chinese imports \nflood our marketplace. Nor do I want to reward China for its failure to \ncomply with earlier trade agreements. And I have no desire to reward \nChina for persecuting those who only seek to practice their religious \nbeliefs or to secure their rights as workers. But in the end PNTR is \nnot a reward to China, it is a tool our country\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\nshould use and use aggressively to open China's markets to our goods \nthe way our market has been open to China's goods and to exert \nmeaningful pressure on China to join that community of nations that \nrespects basic human rights. My vote for PNTR is a vote against a \nstatus quo that has failed to advance either of those goals. It is a \nvote for a measure, however imperfect, that can move us closer to a \nfair trading relationship with China and to a day when the people of \nthat country can enjoy their fundamental human rights.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the future of U.S. \ntrade relations with China and the impending vote on China's PNTR \nstatus. The prosperity that this nation has enjoyed for the past 50 \nyears has been a result of our commitment to free trade and opening \nmarkets. Free trade benefits all--it enhances prosperity and develops \nmarkets, essential elements to the spread of freedom, democracy, and \nthe rule of law. China's entry into the World Trade Organization will \nalso enhance American competitiveness, further our national interests, \nand benefit our trading partners. But we must enter into this agreement \nwith our eyes open. China must comply with this agreement for it to \nhave meaning. The United States must vigilantly seek enforcement of all \nagreements with China, including those addressing national security and \nhuman rights.\n  I share the concern of my colleague, Senator Thompson, regarding \nChina's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. On August 9th of \nthis year, the Director of Central Intelligence reported that China \nremained a ``key supplier'' of weapons technology and increased-missile \nrelated assistance to Pakistan as recently as the second half of 1999. \nIn the last year it has been reported that China transferred missile \ntechnology to Libya and North Korea and may still be providing secret \ntechnical assistance to Pakistan's nuclear program. U.S. Intelligence \nhas also provided evidence that the PRC has provided Iran with nuclear \ntechnology, chemical weapons materials, and missile technology that \nwould violate China's commitment to observe the MTCR and U.S. laws. I \ndo not suggest that because of these violations we should cut off trade \nwith China, but we must address the fact that they are supplying rogue \nnations with weapons of mass destruction. This threat to our national \nsecurity has made my decision on this vote a difficult one, and that \nhas been compounded by my concerns with China's repeated human rights \nabuses.\n  I suspect that each of my colleagues has had some opportunity over \nthe years to hear about the human rights abuses taking place in China. \nI think one of the more eloquent spokesmen for the struggle for freedom \nhas been Wei Jingsheng. He reminds us that those of us who live in the \nluxury of freedom should not forget those who are still struggling for \nliberty and freedom.\n  Mr. President, because of these very strong conflicting views, the \nimportance of open and free trade on the one hand, and the importance \nof human dignity and the pursuit of freedom on the other, this has been \na difficult decision for me. But, after due consideration, I conclude \nthat moving toward open and free markets advances freedom in China, so \nlong as China is willing to abide by the rules of the WTO.\n  By exposing China to global competition and the benefits it has to \noffer, Chinese leaders will be both obligated and empowered to more \nquickly move their country toward full economic reform. And by virtue \nof their business relationships, over time the Chinese people will be \nexposed to information, ideas and debate from around the world. This in \nturn will encourage them and their leadership to embrace the virtue and \npromise of individual freedom. The reason I am willing to embrace it \nhas much has to do with the kinds of changes we have seen taking place \nin China over the years. If they were still committed to the ideology \nof the 1950's and 1960's, I do not think we would be here today. But, \nthey have clearly moved toward opening their economy, and we should \ncontinue to push to open the country to freedom.\n  So I think it is time for us to respond to these changes by saying to \nthe Chinese people--we want to be engaged in free trade and competition \nwith you. I think, in the end, humanity will benefit. So I will cast a \nvote in favor of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate votes on whether to \nestablish Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China.\n  This issue has been the subject of longstanding and emotional debate. \nIt is an issue which has divided the Congress, human rights groups and \npolicy experts from across the spectrum. There are strong arguments on \nboth sides--arguments I carefully weighed in deciding how to vote.\n  In the past, I have opposed extending annual Most Favored Nation \nstatus to China because of concerns about China's egregious record on \nhuman rights and labor rights. By many accounts, including the State \nDepartment's, the situation there has deteriorated over the past year. \nRepression of political dissent, restrictions on freedom of religion \nand the persecution of ethnic minorities are realities of everyday \nlife. I witnessed with my own eyes the tragedy that has befallen the \npeople of Tibet, when I traveled there in 1988.\n  For Vermonters, the young Tibetan and former Middlebury College \nstudent, Ngawang Choephel, and his mother, Sonam Dekyi, are the human \nfaces of the hardships and injustices endured under Chinese rule.\n  Ngawang was arrested more than four years ago by Chinese police when \nhe was in Tibet making a film about traditional Tibetan culture. He was \nsentenced to 18 years in prison, despite the fact that the Chinese have \nnever produced a shred of evidence that he committed any crime. \nPresident Clinton and Secretary of State Albright have personally \nsought his release, to no avail. In May 1999, the U.N. Commission on \nHuman Rights declared his detention to be arbitrary. I have taken \ncountless steps in seeking his release, year after year, and so have \nSenator Jeffords and Congressman Sanders.\n  Since 1996, Ngawang's mother sought permission to visit him. Chinese \nlaw permits family members to visit imprisoned relatives, but for four \nyears the Chinese Government ignored her pleas. Finally, last month, \nthe Chinese Government made it possible for her to see him. She found \nthat he is suffering from recurrent, serious health problems, far more \nserious than those of us who have followed his case closely had been \nled to believe.\n  Thirty-two years ago, Ms. Dekyi made the dangerous journey from Tibet \nto India to escape Chinese repression. She lost a child along the way. \nHer remaining son is now paying a terrible price for his brave attempts \nto document Tibetan culture.\n  No one here would disagree that in so many ways the policies and \npractices of the Chinese Government stand in direct opposition to the \ndemocratic principles upon which our country is founded. Mr. Choephel's \ncase is just one of many examples.\n  The question, however, is not whether we approve or disapprove of \nthis reality. It exists. The question is what can we do about it? How \ncan we most effectively encourage China to become a more open, humane \nand democratic society?\n  The unavoidable fact is that our current approach has not worked. Due \nprocess is non-existent. Ngawang Choephel and many other political \nprisoners remain in custody. Many of China's workers are exploited. \nAnyone who publicly expresses support for democracy is silenced. If I \nthought that we could solve these problems by preventing normal trade \nrelations with China, I would support it without hesitation, but I do \nnot believe that course would achieve our long-sought solutions to \nthese many problems.\n  Preventing normal trade with China would not advance the political \nand humanitarian goals that the United States has long worked for in \nChina, nor will it advance the economic goals we have set for ourselves \nhere at home.\n  The fact is, with or without Congress' approval, China will join the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  It will join 135 other countries in an organization which regulates \nglobal trade. It will be part of an international economic system \ncreated by democratic nations and governed by the rule of law. It will \nbe required to further liberalize an economy which is already being \ntransformed by trade and technology, and which has contributed to slow \nbut steady reform.\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\n  So on the one hand, preventing normal trade relations with China \nwould not stop China from enjoying the benefits of WTO. It will join \nWTO regardless. Nor, I believe, would blocking China PNTR result in \nNgawang Choephel's release. But on the other hand, by blocking PNTR we \nwould deny ourselves the significant economic benefits that will result \nfrom China's agreement to reduce tariffs and open its markets to U.S. \nexports in ways that it never has before. And, I believe, we would deny \nourselves the opportunity to build a better relationship with China.\n\n  Some have suggested that this debate is about what is right and what \nis wrong with the WTO. From its history of negotiating trade agreements \nin secret, to inadequate consideration of labor rights, human rights \nand the environment, there are plenty of problems with the WTO. These \nissues are important and they absolutely should be addressed. But they \nare not what this debate is about.\n  I have long spoken out against the lack of basic freedoms in China. I \nstrongly supported the Administration's decision to sponsor a \nresolution condemning China at the U.N. Human Rights Commission. I have \ndone everything I can think of to seek Ngawang Choephel's release, and \nI will continue to do so until he is released. I fervently hope that \nthe Chinese Government will respond to the Congress' vote in favor of \nPNTR by releasing Mr. Choephel, along with others who do not belong in \nprison and who in no way threaten China's security.\n  Until the rule of law is respected and there is an independent \njudiciary that protects people's rights, until Ngawang Choephel and the \nother prisoners of conscience who languish in China's prisons are free, \nChina will never be able to fully join the global community.\n  I am encouraged that the legislation that has come from the House \nwould create a bipartisan Helsinki-type commission to monitor, promote \nand issue annual reports on human rights and worker rights in China. \nThis bill requires hearings on the contents of these reports, including \nthe recommendations of the commission, and it establishes a task force \nto strengthen our ability to prevent the import of goods made with \nprison or forced labor.\n  In the past, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of \nthe yearly review of China's human rights record. However, I believe \nthat it is important to have an annual debate on this issue, and I feel \nthat the Helsinki-type commission and task force will provide useful, \nalbeit limited, mechanisms for the examination of China's record on \nthese issues\n  I have voted for every amendment to this legislation that was \nconsistent with PNTR, and which would have also strengthened human \nrights. I deeply regret that they were not adopted. We can expand our \ntrade with China, we can build a better relationship with China, and we \ncan also stand up for human rights. The amendments offered by Senator \nFeingold, Senator Wellstone, and others were reasonable and fully \nconsistent with our most cherished values.\n  Profound differences over human rights will continue to cast a shadow \non our relationship with China, and that is unfortunate. But it is also \nimportant to recognize that life in China is significantly different \nfrom what it was two decades ago or even two years ago.\n  For the first time, Chinese citizens are starting their own \nbusinesses. More and more Chinese are employed by foreign-owned \ncompanies, where they generally receive higher pay and enjoy better \nworking conditions. State-run industries are gradually being dismantled \nand state-owned houses, health clinics, schools and stores are no \nlonger the rule--reducing the influence that the Chinese Communist \nparty has over its citizens everyday lives.\n  Technology has also weakened the government's ability to control \npeople's lives. In the past year, the number of Internet addresses in \nChina has risen dramatically. This year, the number is expected to \nexceed 20 million. With the Internet comes the exchange of information \nand ideas. And the government's best efforts to stifle this exchange \nare little match for a phenomenon that has transformed the lives of \npeople around the world, from the most open to the most closed \nsocieties. In addition, access to print and broadcast media has \nexpanded rapidly, along with nonprofit and civic organizations.\n  It is impossible to know what path Chinese authorities will \nultimately choose--whether WTO membership and the changes it requires \nwill indeed contribute to real democratic reform. But it would be a \nmistake for us to err on the side of isolation when there is so much \nthat could be gained by engagement.\n  The President's arguments on this issue have been persuasive. So have \nthe arguments of three former Presidents, six former Secretaries of \nState, and nine former Secretaries of the Treasury.\n  I also found persuasive the fact that many Chinese democracy and \nhuman rights activists, who have suffered the most under Chinese rule \nand have the most to gain from change, support PNTR.\n  And so I will vote for PNTR today.\n  Our archaic, counterproductive and ill-conceived approach toward Cuba \nis a perfect model for what we should not do in China. Our isolationist \npolicy, which I have long argued against, has fallen hardest on \neveryday Cubans. Nothing has done more to perpetuate Castro's grip on \npower, and the denial of basic freedoms there, than our embargo.\n\n  Rejecting PNTR would strengthen the same element in China--the hard-\nliners who are afraid that engagement with the outside world will \ndilute their power and influence. These are the same hard-liners who \nare refusing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama on Tibet and who would \nsettle differences with Taiwan by force.\n  Which brings me to the issue of national security. China is an \nemerging military power, with a small but growing capability to deliver \nnuclear arms. It has an increasing influence in Asia, which military \nexperts have identified as the most likely arena for future conflict. \nPassage of PNTR and China's accession to the WTO offer important \nopportunities to increase China's stake in global security and \nstability and to help ensure that over the long term China becomes our \ncompetitor and not our adversary.\n  Moreover, this legislation will not undermine U.S. efforts to use a \nfull range of policy tools--diplomatic, economic and military--to \naddress any potential Chinese noncompliance with American interests or \ninternational norms.\n  In purely commercial terms, Congress concedes nothing to China by \napproving PNTR. We do not open our country to more Chinese products. \nRather, we simply maintain the present access to our economy that China \nalready enjoys. In return, Chinese tariffs--from telecommunications to \nautomobiles to agriculture--will fall by half or more over just five \nyears, paving the way for the export of more American goods and \nservices to the largest market in the world.\n  It is important to remember that if Congress rejects PNTR, other \ncountries will continue to trade with China. They will reap the trade \nbenefits that we have rejected.\n  PNTR will benefit Vermont. In the past year, Vermont exports to China \nhave increased significantly--from $1 million in 1998 to $6.5 million \nin 1999. While this represents only a small fraction of Vermont's total \nexports, lower tariff barriers are likely to help Vermonters export \ntheir products beyond the Green Mountains to a quarter of the world's \npeople. More Vermont exports mean more Vermont jobs.\n  I recognize the concerns of some in the labor community who believe \nthat approving PNTR may cause the loss of some jobs in the United \nStates. I know that many leaders of American labor organizations are \nmotivated by their concern about their workers, and I respect them for \nthat. Behind the statistics are real people with real families who \nsuffer real consequences.\n  Some American workers will be hurt by this agreement. It is likely \nthat some jobs will be lost as some businesses shift operations to \nChina. However, trade experts generally agree that granting China PNTR \nwill ultimately create a more favorable trade balance by increasing \nexports to China. And more American exports means more American jobs at \na time when unemployment is at a historic low.\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\n  I support the strong anti-surge controls that have been included in \nthe legislation, which will help protect American industries from a \nsurge in Chinese imports that disrupt U.S. markets. The bill also \nauthorizes funding to monitor China's compliance with its WTO \ncommitments.\n  Mr. President, as with most trade bills that have come before \nCongress in the last ten years, the debate over granting PNTR for China \nhas become clouded with simple slogans and half-truths.\n  Despite what we may hope for, history has proven time and again that \nthere is no quick fix for the problems facing the Chinese people. And \nas it becomes harder for Chinese authorities to maintain control in the \nface of outside influences, the temptation to crack down on dissent may \nget worse before it gets better.\n  But we need to look beyond next month or next year. Freer trade will \nnot in and of itself improve civil and political rights in China. It \nwill not guarantee U.S. national security. It will not create thousands \nof American jobs overnight. But China's civilization is thousands of \nyears old. It is changing faster today than ever before. With continued \nengagement on all fronts, we can, I believe, advance each of those \nimportant goals. For my part, I personally look forward to a much more \nintensive and regular dialogue with Chinese officials on these and \nother issues of importance to both our countries.\n  At the end of this debate, all of these many issues and arguments \nmust be distilled to answer this one question: Is a vote for permanent \nnormal trade relations with China in the best interests of the United \nStates? The answer to that question is clearly ``yes.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this proposal has engendered one of the \nmost serious and genuine debates we have had recently in the Senate. I \nhave listened carefully to the pros and cons of H.R. 4444 which have \nbeen expressed over the last several months as well as here on the \nSenate floor in the last several weeks.\n  I have not come to a decision lightly and have given a great deal of \nconsideration to all the arguments. There is no question that China is \ntoday a communist police state. There is no question that it has an \nabysmal human rights record.\n  But, the question is not the state of China today. It is what impact \nPNTR will have in the future, both for the United States and for China.\n  On balance, Mr. President, I have concluded that permanent normal \ntrade relations with China and passage of H.R. 4444 will contribute to \nAmerica's commercial prospects, enhance the spread of free market \nprinciples, and further strengthen the social and economic forces in \nChina that will eventually sweep the police state into the dustbin of \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, Asia is the state of Utah's fourth largest market. \nWhile the predominant consumer of Utah exports is Japan, which buys \nnearly $500 million of Utah's products, as China's economy grows, so \nwill the demand for Utah's industrial machinery, processed foods, \nnutritional and health food products, electronic software, and other \nproducts demanded by maturing societies.\n  This trade development cannot occur without PNTR, which will allow \nthe U.S. to take China to court over unfair trading practices.\n  Up to now, Utah's 1,200 informational technology companies have been \nat a disadvantage in the Chinese market. The Chinese steal and \ncounterfeit virtually all software, videos, and other intellectual \nproperty media entering the country. As the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over copyrights and patents, I am \nmost concerned with enforcing intellectual property laws both at home \nand abroad. China's WTO membership will place major restraints on \npirating, the most important of which is our right to take China to the \nWTO dispute settlement panels.\n  It is worthwhile to note, Mr. President, that the U.S., whose economy \nis the most dynamic in the world, and whose producers are the most law-\nabiding, will be the beneficiary of the equal enforcement of the trade \nrules of the WTO, which we played a large role in shaping. This is not \nmerely a prediction: To date, the U.S. has won over 90 percent of the \ncases we have initiated before the WTO.\n  If the U.S denied China PNTR, we would lose the right to go to court \nand would risk surrendering our market access potential in China to our \ncompetitors.\n  Mr. President, job-creating Utah businesses want PNTR. Utah's \nbusiness community understands the prospective value of China's trade \nas well as the benefits of WTO. In meetings with state agricultural \ngroups, community leaders, as well as virtually every other major job-\ncreating business sector with export markets or export-market potential \nin the state, the demands have been consistent: ``Give us access to \nChina.''\n  While this position is strongly held in Utah, it would be unfair to \nsay it is unanimous. Utah's steel worker community, for example, \nopposes PNTR for China. But, with WTO, I believe many of their fears \ncan be addressed, since China's current ability to dump steel products \nin the U.S., and anywhere else, can now be met head-on with a WTO \ndispute settlement judgment that would bring sanctions against the \nChinese, not just from the U.S., but from the entire world.\n  I have worked hard to assure the steel interests in Utah regarding \nthe passage of PNTR. We passed the Steel Trade Enforcement Act of 1999, \nwhich requires the President to consult with steel companies suffering \nfrom dumping and to get their consent as a condition for lifting \ndumping-related sanctions.\n  Finally, a third advantage is afforded the steel industry in the \nU.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement, which has a 12-year restriction \non exports from China that surge into the U.S. causing sudden, often \nirreparable harm to this important sector of our economy.\n  The fact is, the American economy dominates, and has benefitted \nenormously from, the global marketplace. That includes Utah. Today, 5.2 \npercent of Utah's gross state product comes from merchandise exports. \nUtah sent $2.6 billion of exports into the global marketplace in 1999, \nand we expect an increase of about five percent in export volume for \nthe year 2000.\n\n  Trade-related jobs in the state, especially in the manufacturing \nsector, are more stable, pay better, and tend to demand higher skills. \nInternational trade competition is good for Utah.\n  There have been, and will be, job losses, but Utah's economy has \nabsorbed them. But, Utah also provides an excellent system for \nassisting workers make transitions to new positions, including \neducation and training trade-displaced persons for new skills in new \nindustries. I will continue to support these programs.\n  Utah has the right type of industrial base. We have an unmatched \nbusiness climate for export-oriented companies. My state's population \nis sophisticated in terms of linguistic skills, cultural experience and \ntolerance, foreign travel, overseas living experience. Our \ninfrastructure is in place: we have an international airport; our ports \nof entry are modern and automated; our freight forwarding and customs \nbrokerage communities are highly efficient; our merchandise and \ncommercial banking, insurance and other financial institutional base is \ncompetitive with any region in the world. We are poised for another \neconomic take-off, and passage of PNTR so that China and the U.S. can \nactively participate in the WTO is essential.\n  Mr. President, the WTO enhances the free market principles that I \nhave been committed to since I came to the Senate in 1977. I remain a \nconservative who believes that the lessons of the 20th century \nregarding the relationship between the free market and individual \nfreedoms are incontrovertible.\n  I remain convinced of the theses presented by such great thinkers as \nthe Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and the American Nobel Laureate \nMilton Friedman. Capitalism cannot exist without expanding individual \nfreedoms. And the growth of individual freedom is antithetical to \nauthoritarian control.\n  I believe that the opportunities of a free market which have so \nessentially contributed to our own growth and development will also \nbenefit societies all over the world.\n  From this perspective, I have been a little disappointed by the way \nsome members have characterized aspects of this debate, particularly \nwhen they used the term greed in opposition to\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nnational security interests. I do not believe the promotion of \ncapitalism is synonymous with the promotion of greed. It is an excess \nof self-interest that can lead to greed; but greed, of course, is not \nlimited to capitalist societies, and I wish to make clear that I \nbelieve that those who are promoting PNTR for China are doing so for \nhonorable reasons, and not for greed.\n  Moreover, for individual corporations, PNTR is no guarantee of \nsuccess. Companies must still manufacture and market a good product. \nThey must still be competitive.\n  I have spoken at length about the commercial benefits of granting \nPNTR for China for Utah, as numerous other speakers have discussed the \nbenefits to their states. But our duties here as Senators require that \nwe always consider the national interest as well as the local interest. \nAnd, in this debate, we have revisited again, throughout the exchanges \nwe've had on numerous amendments, the broader question of the U.S.-Sino \nbilateral relationship and American national security interests.\n  Let me be clear: I deplore the appalling human rights situation in \nChina today, including the repression of political expression and other \nfundamental expressions of human conscience. I deplore the repugnant \npractices in forced abortion and organ harvesting. All of this is \nevidence of the continuing level of social backwardness and political \nbarbarism that remains in effect in many parts of China.\n  But there is a relationship between barbarism and economic autarky \nthat cannot be denied. The peak of modern China's human rights \natrocities--measured on a grotesque scale in human casualties--occured \nduring a period when China was in self-imposed economic and political \nisolation from the rest of the world. During Mao's reign, through the \nCultural Revolution, and prior to the opening to the rest of the world \norchestrated by President Richard Nixon, over 40 million Chinese were \nmurdered or starved by their government. What a tragic reality that is, \nMr. President, but reality it is.\n  Capitalism corrodes communism, Mr. President. Opportunity crowds out \ntotalitarianism. We have certainly seen that occur since Deng Xiaoping \nrealized that the only way China could develop--could, in fact, recover \nfrom nearly a quarter century of Mao's economic nihilism--was to open \nto the world and to engage the free market.\n  One thing I'm not, Mr. President, is a pollyanna. As I've said, I am \naware of the political and human rights conditions in China today.\n  The fact is that many of the Chinese are also aware of the situation. \nThe abortion policies, for example, are not supported by the Chinese \npeople. Some Chinese are even becoming aware of a growing social \nproblem called by scholars here the ``surplus males phenomena.'' Dr. \nValerie Hudson of Brigham Young University has done excellent work in \nthis area.\n\n  Orwellian population practices in China have had the effect of \ncreating a growing demographic imbalance in Chinese society between men \nand women. As the demographic bulge in men moves into young adulthood, \nChinese society will grapple with a surfeit of unmarried men. The \npotential consequences for internal and external instability should be \nof great concern to the Chinese authorities, as well as for us. These \nare the consequences of the communist control over families for the \npast two generations.\n  China has a huge population with a small percentage of arable land. \nThe Maoist answer was to kill large segments of the population through \nstarvation and promote the most inhumane abortion policies in the \nmodern era. As China has opened up to the rest of the world, however, \nthe Chinese are starting to recognize that the answer to population \npressures is not a totalitarian abortion policy, but economic \ndevelopment that can support families.\n  The best example for them is Hong Kong, which has a large population \non a piece of land that has virtually no natural resources, except a \nharbor. Capitalism provided the economic development that launched Hong \nKong into the developed world, probably beating the PRC to that level \nof economic development by at least a century, if current predictions \nhold.\n  Mr. President, I support PNTR because I want to see an end to the \nbarbarisms, such as the abortion policies, of the Chinese police state. \nCapitalism corrodes communism.\n  We have had a long debate on a number of amendments. Frankly, many of \nthese amendments, all of which have been defeated on this bill, would \npass the Senate as amendments to other legislative vehicles, or as \nstand-alone bills. Certainly the debate over China's deplorable record \non proliferation, and the legislative proposal presented by the \nThompson-Torricelli amendment, are worthy of further discussion and \nreview.\n  While we will end the annual most-favored nation review of the PRC, \nnothing of this PNTR debate proscribes the Senate from future \ninitiatives regarding the bilateral U.S.-Sino relationship.\n  Mr. President, sometime, I believe within my lifetime, there is going \nto be a change in China. There will be a transition from the current \npolice state. I am quite certain of that.\n  I am somewhat less certain--as is any other analyst--about what the \nchange will be. The analysts have parsed out the possibilities for us, \nincluding chaos and disintegration, a new Chinese fascism, or another \nChinese democratic state. I say ``another,'' because Taiwan has \ndemonstrated conclusively that there are no particular Asian values \nthat prevent the Chinese people from developing, nurturing and robustly \npracticing democracy.\n  United States policy cannot guarantee the outcome of the transition \nin mainland China--it would be naive to think otherwise. But we can \ninfluence the evolution toward the most desirable outcome. That means \npromoting economic development and the values of the free market in \nChina. We should plant these seeds, Mr. President.\n  A vote for PNTR is a vote for promoting economic markets for Utah and \nother American companies, for promoting economic development in China, \nand for promoting the rule of law in China. PNTR is a promising means \nof accomplishing these goals, not just for the benefit of U.S. \ncommerce, but also for long-term U.S. strategic interests.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the issue before the Senate today is not a \nmundane redefinition of China's status under our trade laws. Nor does \nit mark a profound shift in our policy toward the most populous nation \non earth.\n  The question before us--neither mundane, nor profound--is nonetheless \nof vital importance to the future or our relationship with China. \nGranting China PNTR and bringing China into the global trading regime \ncontinues a process of careful engagement designed to encourage China's \ndevelopment as a productive, responsible member of the world community. \nIt is a process which has no guarantees, but which is far superior to \nthe alternatives available to us.\n  Our decision on normalizing trade with China is best understood in \nits historical context. The search for a truly modern China is now more \nthan a 100 years old. It arguably began at the turn of the last century \nwith the collapse of the Qing Dynasty and the birth of the Republic of \nChina under Sun Yat-sen. The search has continued through Japanese \ninvasion, a bloody civil war, the unmitigated disaster of the Great \nLeap Backwards), the social and political upheaval of the Cultural \nRevolution, and now through two decades of economic opening to the \noutside world.\n  Viewed in this context, a vote for permanent normal trade relations \nsays that we welcome the emergence of a prosperous, independent, China \non the world stage. It also says we want China to be subject to \nstronger, multilateral rules of economic behavior--rules about \ninternational trade that will influence the structure of their internal \nsocial, economic, and political systems.\n  Granting permanent normal trade status to China is not a new \ndirection in our relationship with China, Mr. President, but it is an \nimportant change in the means we choose to pursue it. We have the \nopportunity to move some, but not all, of our dealings with China into \na new forum; the forum of established, enforceable international trade \nrules. This will take our economic relationship to a new level; a level \ncommensurate with the importance of our two economies to the world.\n  As important as this legislation is to our overall relationship with \nChina and\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nto our aspirations for China, we must keep our expectations in check. \nThe reality is that extending permanent normal trade relations to China \nwill not magically cause China's leaders to protect religious freedom, \nrespect labor rights, or adhere to the terms of every international \nnonproliferation regime.\n  No single piece of legislation could accomplish those objectives: \nindeed, these changes ultimately must come from within China, with such \nencouragement as we can provide from outside.\n  Some of our colleagues disagree on this point. They would have \npreferred that the China trade bill be turned into an omnibus China \nPolicy Act. I understand their objectives and their frustration with \nthe slow pace of reform in China. But amendments offered by Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire--covering such diverse issues as POW/MIA \ncooperation, forced labor, organ harvesting, etc.--and Senator \nWellstone of Minnesota--conditioning PNTR on substantial progress \ntoward the release of all political prisoners in China--pile too much \nonto this legislation. Moreover, those amendments would effectively \nhold the trade legislation hostage to changes in China which passing \nthe trade bill would promote. This seems backwards to me.\n  Other colleagues have such a deep reservations about trading with \nChina that they proposed amendments which would essentially have taken \nthe ``Permanent'' and the ``normal'' out of permanent normal trade \nrelations. Amendments offered by the junior Senator from South \nCarolina, Senator Hollings, and the senior Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd, reflect a deep ambivalence about the benefits to the \nUnited States of trading with China. As I will discuss later, I share \nthe Senators' skepticism about the grandiose claims some have made \nabout the economic benefits which will flow to the United States from \nthis trade agreement. But we are not voting on whether to trade with \nChina. We are voting on whether to lock in concessions by China to open \nits market to the United States. That is why I opposed their \namendments.\n\n  My opposition to efforts to turn this trade bill into an omnibus \nChina Policy Act, and my opposition to efforts to take the ``P'' and \nthe ``N'' out of PNTR, does not mean that I found all the amendments \noffered during the previous two weeks of debate without merit.\n  Indeed, on their own merits, I would have supported a number of the \namendments offered by my colleagues. If we had considered this \nlegislation in May, June, or July, there might have been a realistic \npossibility of resolving differences between the House and the Senate \nversions of this bill. Under those circumstances, some amendments \noffered here in the Senate might well have been appropriate.\n  For instance, Senator Feingold offered an amendment to improve the \nCongressional Executive Commission on China to be established under the \nterms of H.R. 4444. The modest changes in the commission suggested by \nthe Senator from Wisconsin are reasonable, and include making sure that \nthe commission produces concrete recommendations for action and that it \nreports equally to both the House and the Senate. I hope that we might \nrevisit this issue to ensure that the special commission on China is as \neffective as it can be.\n  Another Foreign Relations Committee colleague, Senator Wellstone, \noffered several meritorious amendments, including one endorsing the \nrecommendations of the U.S. Commission on International Religious \nFreedom with respect to China policy, and another requiring the \nPresident to certify that China is in compliance with certain memoranda \nof understanding regarding prohibition on import and export of prison \nlabor products.\n  We should seriously consider the input of the religious freedom \ncommission and we should hold China accountable for its failure to \nimplement agreements with the United States, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on these issues in the future.\n  Finally, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee offered \nseveral amendments, including one expressing the sense of Congress \ncondemning forced abortions in China. No member of Congress condones \nthe practice of coerced abortion in China or anyplace else. Senator \nHelms, who opposes normalizing our trade with China, knows that, which \nis why he offered his amendment.\n  Now I share the revulsion of the senior Senator from North Carolina \ntoward forced abortion. It is beyond the pale. But I'm concerned--as I \nbelieve the Senator well knows--that his amendment would imperil the \nentire bill and risk a major setback in our efforts to achieve the very \ngoals we both seek.\n  Sadly, that is the predicament we find ourselves in now. By delaying \nconsideration of this historic legislation until the last days of this \nCongress, the Republican leadership has effectively denied the Senate \nthe opportunity to debate the merits of various amendments without also \nconsidering the impact that any amendment, no matter how reasonable, \nwould have on the prospects of passing the trade bill during this \nsession of Congress.\n  So, I approach the pending vote on final passage with some \nfrustration at the process, but which considerable confidence that \nextending permanent normal trade relations to China is in the best \ninterests of both the United States and the people of China.\n\n  I have listened carefully and respectfully to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and on both sides of this question. I share with \nmany of my colleagues a feeling of deep dissatisfaction with the many \ndeplorable aspects of China's domestic and foreign policies.\n  But, for reasons I want to make clear today, I do not share the \nbelief that by preserving the status quo in our relations with China we \nwill see progress.\n  This, in a nutshell, is the question before the Senate: shall we \nstick with the status quo? Or shall we join with virtually every other \nadvanced economy in the world, and endorse the membership of China in a \nrule-based organization that will help to encourage many of the changes \nin Chinese behavior that the opponents of permanent normal trade \nrelations say they want to see?\n  While there are few simple answers to the many questions raised by \nChina, one thing seems clear: If we don't like Chinese behavior now, \nwhy vote to preserve the status quo?\n  The answer, say some of my colleagues, is that we must preserve the \nannual review of China's trade status to keep the spotlight turned on \nChina.\n  There are two problems with this answer, in my view. First, we have \nnever, not once in the two decades of annual reviews of China's trade \nstatus, voted against renewal of normal trade relations. Not after the \ntragedy of Tiananmen Square, not after missile launches against Taiwan, \nnot after so many other provocations, broken promises, and \ndisappointments. Annual review of China's trade status is an empty \nthreat--an excuse for a ritual that at one time may have served a \npurpose, but that no one can seriously argue today has an affect on \nChina's behavior.\n  The second problem with this argument lies in the premise that \nextending permanent normal trade relations to China means taking China \nout of the limelight. I submit to you that anyone who thinks China is \ngoing to escape scrutiny by the U.S. Congress and the American people \njust because it enjoys normal trading privileges with us doesn't know \nbeans about politics.\n  As I understand their arguments, those who will vote against \nnormalizing our trade relationship with China believe China's foreign \nand domestic policies remain so objectionable under the system of \nannual review that we should not, as they put it ``reward'' China with \npermanent normal trade relations.\n  But if there has been no improvement in China's human rights record \nover the past two decades, why should we persist in the fiction of \nannual review, repeating the empty threat that we might withdraw normal \ntrade relations? What has the annual review gained us?\n  I see the situation differently, Mr. President, I believe China is \nchanging. China is far from the kind of country that we want it to be, \nor that its own long-suffering citizens are now working to build. But \nno single snapshot of unsafe working conditions, of religious and \npolitical repression, of bellicose pronouncements about Taiwan, will do \njustice to the fundamental shifts that are underway in China.\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\n  An objective assessment of China over the past two decades reveals \nsweeping changes in almost every aspect of life--changes facilitated \nand accelerated by China's opening to the world. These changes are not \nthe result of our annual review of China's trade status. The roots of \nchange reach much deeper than that.\n  China's leaders have consciously undertaken--for their own reasons, \nnot ours--a fundamental transformation of the communist system that so \nlong condemned their great people to isolation, poverty, and misery. \nThey have been forced to acknowledge the failure of communism, and have \nconceded the irrefutable superiority of an open market economy. The \nresult has been a marked improvement in living standards for hundreds \nof million of Chinese citizens.\n\n  This growing prosperity for the Chinese people, in turn, has put \nChina on a path toward ever greater political and economic freedom. The \nChinese people, taking responsibility for their own economic \nlivelihood, are demanding a greater voice in the governance of China.\n  This is not just my analysis.\n  This is also the view of people inside and outside of China who are \nstruggling to deepen China's reforms and to extend them into the \npolitical arena.\n  Dai Qing, a former Chinese rocket scientist turned political \ndissident and environmentalist, testified passionately in support of \npermanent normal trade relations before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee in July. She said, ``PNTR will help reduce governmental \ncontrol over the economy and society; it will help to promote the rule \nof law; and it will help to nourish independent political and social \nforces in China.''\n  Wang Dan, the Beijing University student who helped lead the \nTiananmen Square protests and now lives in exile, says, ``Economic \nchange does influence political change. China's economic development \nwill be good for the East, as well as for the Chinese people.''\n  And Xie Wanjun, the Director of the Overseas Office of the China \nDemocratic Party--a party banned within China--says,\n\n       We support unconditional PNTR with China by the U.S. \n     government. . . . We believe the closer the economic \n     relationship between the United States and China, the more \n     chance for the U.S. to politically influence China, the more \n     chances to monitor human rights conditions in China, and the \n     more effective the U.S. will be to push China to launch \n     political reforms.\n\n  Martin Lee, Chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, supports \nChina's entry into the World Trade Organization and the granting of \npermanent normal trade relations. ``The participation of China in WTO \nwould not only have economic and political benefits, but would also \nserve to bolster those in China who understand that the country must \nembrace the rule of \nlaw. . . .''\n  And Chen Shui-Bian, Taiwan's democratically elected President, said \nlast spring,\n\n       We feel that a democratic China will contribute to \n     permanent peace in this region. Therefore, we support U.S. \n     efforts to improve relations with China. While we seek to \n     normalize the cross-strait relationship, especially in the \n     area of business and trade, we are happy to see the United \n     States and China improve their economic relations. Therefore, \n     I am willing to support the U.S. normalization of trade \n     relations with the PRC.\n\n  It's not must dissidents and leading Chinese democracy advocates who \nsupport PNTR.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to introduce into the Record \nrecent statements by former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, \nformer Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and James Baker, Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Christian \nBroadcasting Network Pat Robertson, former National Security Advisory \nBrent Scowcroft, and yes, even former President of the United Auto \nWorkers and former U.S. Ambassador to China Leonard Woodcock, all of \nwhom support extension of permanent normal trade relations to China.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n    Quotes in Support of Permanent Normal Trade Relations With China\n\n       Former President Gerald Ford: ``the facts are a negative \n     vote in the House and/or the Senate would be catastrophic, \n     disastrous to American agriculture; electronics, \n     telecommunications, autos and countless other products and \n     services. A negative vote in the Congress would greatly \n     assist our foreign competitors from Europe or Asia by giving \n     them privileged access to China markets and at the same time, \n     exclude America's farm and factory production from the vast \n     Chinese market.'' [remarks at distinguished Americans in \n     Support of PNTR event, 5/9/2000]\n       Former President Jimmy Carter: ``China still has not \n     measured up to the human rights and democracy standards and \n     labor standards of America. But there's no doubt in my mind \n     that a negative vote on this issue in the Congress will be a \n     serious setback and impediment for the further \n     democratization, freedom and human rights in China. That \n     should be the major consideration for the Congress and the \n     nation. And I hope the members of Congress will vote \n     accordingly, particularly those who are interested in human \n     rights, as I am; and those who are interested in the well-\n     being of American workers as I am.'' [remarks at \n     Distinguished Americans in Support of PNTR event, 5/9/2000]\n       Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve: ``The \n     outcome of the debate on permanent normal trade relations \n     with China will have profound implications for the free \n     world's trading system and the long-term growth potential of \n     the American economy . . . The addition of the Chinese \n     economy to the global marketplace will result in a more \n     efficient worldwide allocation of resources and will raise \n     standards of living in China and its trading partners . . . \n     As China's citizens experience economic gains, so will the \n     American firms that trade in their expanding markets . . . \n     Further development of China's trading relationships with the \n     United States and other industrial countries will work to \n     strengthen the rule of law within China and to firm its \n     commitment to economic reform . . . I believe extending PNTR \n     to China, and full participation by China in the WTO, is in \n     the interests of the United States.'' [press statement at the \n     White House, 5/18/2000, including quote from Greenspan letter \n     to House of Representatives Banking Committee Chairman James \n     Leach released 5/8/2000]\n       Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: ``The agreement \n     is, of course, in our economic interest, since its grants \n     China what has been approved by the Congress every year for \n     20 years. But we are here together not for economic reasons. \n     We are here because cooperative relations with China are in \n     the American national interest. Every President, for 30 \n     years, has come to that conclusion.'' [remarks at \n     Distinguished Americans in Support of PNTR event, 5/9/2000]\n       Former Secretary of State and Treasury James Baker: ``As a \n     former Secretary of Treasury and of State, I believe that \n     normalized trade with China is good for America on both \n     economic grounds and security grounds. It will help move \n     China in the direction of a more open society, and in time, \n     more responsive government. As such, normalized trade \n     relations with China will advance both our national \n     interests, as well as our national ideals, in our relations \n     with the world's most populous country.'' [remarks at \n     Distinguished Americans in Support of PNTR event, 5/9/2000]\n       Pat Robertson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, The Christian \n     Broadcasting Network, Inc.: ``If the US refuses to grant \n     normal trading relations with the People's Republic of China, \n     and if we significantly curtail the broad-based economic, \n     education, social and religious contacts that are being made \n     between the U.S. and China, we will damage ourselves and set \n     back the cause of those in China who are struggling toward \n     increased freedom for their fellow citizens.'' [letter to \n     Congressman Joseph Pitts, 5/10/2000]\n       Brent Scowcroft, USAF Lt. Gen (ret) and former National \n     Security Advisor: ``I'm strongly in favor of granting \n     permanent normal trade relations to China, not as a favor to \n     China, but because doing so would be very much in the U.S. \n     national interest. This, in my judgment, goes far beyond \n     American business and economic interests, as important as \n     these are, to key U.S. political and security interests . . . \n     This may be one of those rare occasions on an important issue \n     where there's virtually no downside to taking affirmative \n     action. We cannot ourselves determine the ultimate course \n     China will take. And denying permanent normal trade relations \n     will remove none of the blemishes that China's opponents have \n     identified. But we can take steps which will encourage China \n     to evolve in directions compatible with U.S. interests. To \n     me, granting permanent normal trade relations is one of the \n     most important such steps that Congress can take.'' \n     [testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, 4/11/2000]\n       Leonard Woodcock, former president of the United Auto \n     Workers and former U.S. Ambassador to China: ``I have spent \n     much of my life in the labor movement and remain deeply loyal \n     to its goals. But in this instance, I think our labor leaders \n     have got it wrong . . . American labor has a tremendous \n     interest in China's trading on fair terms with the Untied \n     States . . . The agreement we signed with China this past \n     November marks the largest single step ever taken toward \n     achieving that goal.'' [Washington Post, 3/8/2000]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Finally, I would like to point out that my support for \npermanent normal trade relations with China is based not just on an \nassessment of\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\nthe economic benefits to the U.S., not just on the prospects for \npolitical reform in China, but also on the impact on our national \nsecurity. As I discussed during the debate on the Thompson amendment at \nsome length, improving our trade relations with China will help put the \noverall relationship on a sounder footing. We need to cooperate with \nChina to rein in North Korea's nuclear missile ambitions, to prevent a \ndestabilizing nuclear arms race in South Asia, and to combat the \nthreats of international terrorism and narcotics trafficking. We cannot \nwork effectively with China in these areas if we are treating them as \nan enemy in our trade relations.\n  Let me quote General Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff: ``I think from every standpoint--from the strategic \nstandpoint, from the standpoint of our national interests, from the \nstandpoint of our trading interests and our economic interests--it \nserves all of our purposes to grant permanent normal trading \nrelations.''\n  So, with all due respect to my colleagues who have brought before us \nthe images of the worst in China today, we must keep the full picture \nbefore us and keep our eye on the ball. China is changing. We must do \nwhat we can to encourage those changes.\n  Can we control that change? Of course not. We know that not even \nthose who currently hold the reins of power in China are confident that \nthey can control the process that is now underway. What little we know \nof internal debate in China tells us that support for China's entry \ninto the world Trade Organization is far from unanimous there.\n  It is those who are most closely tied to the repressive, reactionary \naspects of the current China who are most opposed to this profound step \naway from China's Communist past. I urge my colleagues who so rightly \nand so passionately seek change in China to pause and reflect on that.\n  While we cannot dictate the future of China, we can--we must--\nencourage China to follow a course that will make it a more \nresponsible, constructive member of the community of nations.\n  That is why I am proud of my sponsorship of legislation which created \nRadio Free Asia, and am pleased that the bill before the Senate \nincludes increased support for the broadcast of independent news and \nanalysis to the people of China. The opening of China--to investment, \nto trade, to travel, and yes, to foreign news sources--is a necessary \ningredient to the process of economic reform and political \nliberalization.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that we must not cast our vote on \nPNTR simply on the promise of increased commercial opportunities for \nAmerican corporations. I agree, Indeed, unlike some of my colleagues--\non both sides of this question, pro and con--I do not see the question \nof China's trade status simply in terms of the economic implications \nfor the United States.\n  I do not anticipate a dramatic explosion in American jobs, suddenly \ncreated to fuel a flood of exports to China. Nor do I see the collapse \nof the American manufacturing economy, as China, a nation with the \nimpact on the world economy about the size of the Netherlands', \nsuddenly becomes our major economic competitor.\n  Both the opponents and proponents of PNTR, I believe, have vastly \noversold the economic impact of this legislation.\n  For the record, let me say a few things about that aspect of this \nissue. First and foremost, this vote will not determine China's entry \ninto the WTO. With or without our vote of support here, China will \nbecome a member of the only international institution--created by and, \nyes, strongly influenced by, the advanced industrial economies of the \nworld--in a position to formulate and enforce rules of fairness and \nopenness in international trade.\n\n  The issue for us is what role will we play in that process--will we \nput the United States on record in support of change in China's \neconomic relations with the rest of the world? Will we put the United \nStates on record in support of China's participation in a rules-based \nsystem whose basic bylaws will require fundamental changes in the \nstate-owned enterprises, in the People's Liberation Army conglomerates \nthat are the last bastions of the failed Chinese system?\n  Or will we put ourselves on the sidelines, and on record in favor of \nthe status quo?\n  Will we accept the deal negotiated between the United States and \nChina last year, in which China made every concession and we made none?\n  Will we accept the deal which opens China's market to products such \nas Delaware's chemical and poultry exports, to Chrysler and General \nMotors exports?\n  Or will we consign ourselves to the sidelines while other nations \ncherry-pick Chinese markets and are first out of the gate in building \ndistribution and sales relationships there?\n  Our course is clear. China's growing participation in the \ninternational community over the past quarter century has been marked \nby growing adherence to international norms in the areas of trade, \nsecurity, and human rights. If you want to know what China looks like \nwhen it is isolated, take a look at the so-called Great Leap Forward \nand the Cultural Revolution. During those periods of modern Chinese \nhistory perhaps 20 million Chinese died of starvation, religious \npractice was almost stamped out entirely, and China supported Communist \ninsurgents in half a dozen African and East Asian countries.\n  I will cast my vote today in favor of change, in favor of closing \nthat sad chapter in China's long history.\n  Mr. President, I will cast my vote with Wang Dan, Dia Qing, Martin \nLee, Chen Shui-bian, and the other courageous advocates for political \nand economic reform in China.\n  Let us continue to seek change in China, to play our role in the \nsearch for a truly modern China.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my concerns and \nviews as the Senate moves toward final passage of the bill extending \npermanent normal trading relations to the People's Republic of China.\n  I have diligently listened to the debate in the Senate and have given \ncareful consideration to all points of view. This has been a valuable \ndebate. It has educated the American people and has provided the \ninternational community with a statement of American values and ideals.\n  The intentions and actions of the Government of the Communist Party \nof China do give me concern. The record of China has been thoroughly \ndiscussed during this debate. There is no question that reforms are \noverdue to improve China's record related to human rights, religious \nliberty, environmental protection, and the conditions of workers. \nFurthermore, China's record on proliferation of weapons technology is \ndangerous both to the region and to the entire world. China's abuses of \ntrade agreements has been well documented. Finally, the belligerence \nshown toward Taiwan has been disconcerting, if not alarming.\n  Many amendments were offered to this legislation to address these and \nother issues. I supported many of those amendments, and am disappointed \nthat the Senate felt it could not amend this bill, strictly for \nprocedural reasons. Nevertheless, I must emphasize to the world \ncommunity in general, and specifically to China, that the rejection of \nthese amendments does not mean the United States is unconcerned about \nthese matters.\n  Given China's record, why should the United States grant permanent \nnormal trade relations? I believe, that in the long term, Americans as \nwell as Chinese will be better off as China joins the international \neconomic system.\n  There is no doubt there will be obstacles and slow progress in the \nshort term. It will take years for the Chinese to fully open up their \neconomy and develop the legal infrastructure that will facilitate trade \nand commerce. I recognize that China has made fundamental internal \neconomic reforms, moving away from a Marxist state run economy and \ncentralized planning. The liberalization of external trade should \nprovide the next step in the process of giving the individual Chinese \nmore choices. The overall effect will be that as the Chinese economy \nimproves, Chinese workers will be lifted from poverty. This, coupled \nwith the development of a legal framework for commerce, will lay the \nfoundation for democracy and religious freedom.\n  It is essential that China follow through on its obligations to the \nChinese people to advance democratic reforms, to promote human rights, \nand\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\nto create greater economic equality for all its citizens. The road to \ndemocracy is paved with free markets. Free trade is the bridge to reach \nout to the Chinese.\n  This opening of Chinese markets will be good for South Carolinians, \nspecifically, and Americans, generally. In the long run, America's \nworkers and farmers will benefit from improved trade with China and \naccess to what is potentially the world's largest market. Passage of \nthis bill will ensure a reduction in tariffs on American products. \nChinese consumers will be able to obtain high-quality U.S. agricultural \nand manufactured goods and business services.\n  With China's permanent normal trade status and eventual membership in \nthe World Trade Organization (WTO), there will be stronger incentives \nfor China to honor its commitments to lowering trade barriers. Finally, \nthe United States will have access to the WTO's dispute resolution \nprocess to arbitrate trade disputes and seek enforcement of agreements. \nIn short, China will be required to ``play by the rules.''\n  Again, I do not expect all of this to go smoothly. But I do \nanticipate that opening economic doors will open other opportunities \nfor prosperity and freedom for the Chinese people. As China develops a \nvibrant free market and a more open and democratic society, the Chinese \npeople will be better off, American security will be strengthened, and \nthe prospects for international peace will be greatly improved.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, despite my many concerns, and realizing \nthis is a long-term process, I support the extension of Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations with the People's Republic of China. I \nappreciate that the bill also establishes a framework for monitoring \ntrade agreements and for reviewing our relations with China. I strongly \nencourage the next administration to be more vigilant in addressing \nnational security issues related to China. Finally, I am hopeful that \nexpanding trade with China will provide opportunities for resolving our \ndifferences in other areas.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, since the House vote, virtually every \nnews account of this trade agreement has called its passage by the \nSenate all but certain. After months of such predictions, some people \nmight conclude that the votes we are about to cast are a mere \nformality. They are not. We are making history here. The votes we cast \ntoday will have consequences. Those consequences will affect our \neconomic interests, and our national security interests, for decades to \ncome.\n  In one sense, the question before us is simple: Should we grant China \nthe same trading status as we grant nearly every other nation in the \nworld? Behind that question, though, is a larger question. China is \nhome to 1.2 billion people--one-fifth of the world's entire population. \nWhat kind of relationship do we want with China? Do we want a China in \nwhich American products can be distributed--and our beliefs can be \ndisseminated? Or do we want a China that continues to erect barriers to \nAmerican goods and American ideals? Which China is better for our \nfuture? That is the question at the heart of this debate.\n  Someone who knew something about China answered that question this \nway. ``Taking the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave China \nforever outside the family of nations, there to nurture its fantasies, \ncherish its hates and threaten its neighbors.'' My friends, it was not \nPresident Clinton who said that. It was not Ambassador Barshefsky, or \nanyone from this Administration. Richard Nixon wrote that--in 1967. \nFive years later, of course, President Nixon made his historic journey \nto China, ending 20 years of stony silence between our two nations.\n  History has shown the wisdom of that journey. Six years after \nPresident Nixon visited, China opened its economy--at least in part--to \nthe outside world. Since then, China's economy has been transformed--\nfrom a 100-percent state-owned economy to an economy in which the state \naccounts for less than one-third of China's output. Along with this \neconomic change has come social and political change. China is now \ntaking the first tentative steps toward democratic local elections. \nPrivate citizens are buying property. People are being given more \nfreedom to choose their schools and careers. You can now find articles \ncritical of the government in the Chinese press, and a wider selection \nof books in Chinese bookstores. Now, China is ready to open its door to \nthe outside world even further. The question is: Are we going to walk \nthrough that door?\n  Several people deserve special thanks for helping us reach this \npoint. First among them is the President. One reason our Nation's \neconomy is so strong today is because this President understands the \nNew Economy. He understand that, to win in the New Economy, we need to \nmaintain our fiscal discipline, invest in our future competitiveness \nand open up new markets for the products Americans produce. Under his \nleadership, we have negotiated more than 300 trade agreements with \nother nations. Among those agreements, none is more significant than \nthis agreement with China. And none holds more potential promise for \nour future.\n  I also want to acknowledge the President's team--particularly \nCharlene Barshefsky--for her extraordinary skill in negotiating this \nagreement. I also want to thank our colleagues in the House, Sandy \nLevin and Doug Bereuter, for their bipartisan efforts to further \nimprove on the Administration's efforts. The Levin-Bereuter \nimprovements--particularly the creation of the human rights \ncommission--are thoughtful solutions to concerns some of my colleagues \nand I had about the original agreement. Representative Levin and I \nspoke frequently about those improvements during that process. I know I \nspeak for many in this chamber when I say we appreciate the great care \nhe took to make sure his improvements addressed our concerns, as well \nas the concerns of our House colleagues.\n  Here in this chamber, I want to thank Senator Moynihan, our ranking \nmember on the Finance Committee, for his tireless efforts to pass this \nagreement. His accomplishment is a fitting conclusion to an historic \ncareer. I also want to thank Senator Baucus, who is a real leader on \ntrade issues; Chairman Roth, for his bipartisan leadership and \ndetermination to pass this agreement; and of course the Majority \nLeader, for his cooperation and leadership as well. Finally, I want to \nthank my colleagues who voted against sending this agreement back to \nthe House. Their decision to focus on our trade relationship with China \nand leave other important questions about that relationship for later \nwas not an easy decision to make. But it was necessary. I thank them \nfor making it.\n  We have heard many eloquent arguments for--and against--this bill. \nThat's as it should be. Critical decisions require careful \ndeliberation. No one who values the freedoms we enjoy as Americans can \npossibly condone what we have heard about human rights, workers' \nrights, and religious freedom in China. None of us approves of China's \nfrequent hostility, in the past, to the rule of law. I certainly do \nnot. I intend to vote for this agreement, however, not to reward China \nfor its past, but to engage China and help it create a different \nfuture.\n  In the 22 years since it re-opened its doors to outside investors, \nChina's economy has grown at a rate of 10 percent a year. Still, China \nremains--by Western standards--a largely poor and underdeveloped \nnation. Reformers there understand that the only way China can build a \nmodern economy is by becoming a full and accountable member of the \ninternational trade community. In exchange for the right to join the \nWorld Trade Organization, they have therefore committed--in this \nagreement--to make a number of extraordinary and fundamental changes.\n  Under this bilateral agreement, China has agreed to cut tariffs on US \nexports drastically. Tariffs on agriculture products will be cut by \nmore than half--from 31 percent to 14 percent Tariffs on industrial \nproducts will be cut by nearly two-thirds--from about 25 percent to 9 \npercent. And tariffs on American computers and other telecommunications \nproducts will be eliminated entirely. On our end, this agreement does \nnot lower a single tariff or quota on Chinese goods exported to the \nU.S. Not one.\n  China has also agreed to lower or eliminate a number of non-tariff \nbarriers that now make doing business in\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\nChina extremely difficult. Under this agreement, American businesses \nwill be able--for the first time--to sell and distribute their own \nproducts in China. The Chinese government will no longer be the \nmonolithic middle man in every business deal. In addition, American \nbusinesses will no longer be forced to include Chinese-made parts in \nproducts they sell in China.\n  To appreciate the magnitude of these concessions, you need to \nunderstand the hold the Chinese government now has on China's economy \nand--by extension--its citizens. Today in China, the state decides what \nproducts may be imported, and by whom. The state decides who may \ndistribute and sell products in China. State-owned banks decide who \ngets capital to invest. For the more than half of China's workers who \nare still employed by state-owned enterprises, the state decides how \nmuch they earn, whether they are promoted, even where they live.\n  But the state's grip on its citizens' lives is starting to weaken and \nwill weaken further with this agreement. Nicholas Lardy, a China \nscholar with the Brookings Institution, notes that ``the authoritarian \nbasis of the Chinese regime is (already) . . . eroding. . . .'' By \nagreeing to let its citizens own their own businesses, and buy products \nand services directly from the outside world, the Chinese government is \nagreeing to further relax its authoritarian grip on its people. That is \nnot just in the interests of Chinese reformers. It is in our interests \nas well.\n  None of us can know, with absolute certainty, the effect these new \neconomic freedoms will have on China. But I had an experience a few \nyears ago that makes me think there is reason to be hopeful. I was with \ntwo other Senators on a bipartisan trip to the republics of the Former \nYugoslavia. We were there to assess what progress was being made under \nthe Dayton peace agreement, and what help the republics might need to \nrebuild politically and economically.\n  One day, in Albania, I was talking to a man in his early 30's. As you \nknow, until 1992, Albania was arguably the most closed society in the \nworld. No one entered or left. And no new information was allowed in \nexcept what the government permitted. The man I talked with said that \nwhen he was a boy, if someone had a satellite dish, and they turned it \nto face the sea, to receive uncensored information from Italy, police \nwould come and turn the dish around. That was for the first offense. If \nthe police had to come a second time, they took you off to jail.\n  Then the communications revolution occurred--the explosion of e-mail \nand Internet. Suddenly, the government couldn't just pull the plug, or \nturn the satellite dish around. Suddenly, Albania was connected to the \nrest of the world.\n  Today, Albania is struggling to create a free society and a free \neconomy. The man I spoke with told me he hopes the Albania of the \nfuture looks like America.\n  Today, fewer than 2.5 percent of China's people own personal \ncomputers. And fewer than 1 million Chinese have access to the \nInternet. By the end of this year, there will be 10 million Internet \nusers in China. By the end of next year, it's expected there will be 20 \nmillion.\n  Recent attempts by China to police the Internet, and punish advocates \nof democratic reform, are troubling to all of us. They are also \ndestined to fail. By eliminating all tariffs on information technology \nin China, liberalizing distribution, and allowing foreign investment in \ntelecommunications services--the infrastructure of the Internet, this \nagreement will accelerate the telecommunications revolution in China. \nThat is not just in the interest of Chinese reformers. It is in our \ninterest as well.\n  Some have expressed concerns about whether China will honor the \ncommitments it makes in this agreement, and whether this agreement is \nenforceable.\n  Their concerns are understandable. China has no history with the rule \nof law, as we know it. The important point is: by entering the WTO, \nChina is agreeing--for the first time--to comply with the rules of the \ninternational trade community. It is agreeing to settle its trade \ndisputes through the WTO, and to honor the WTO's decisions in those \ndisputes. If it does not, it will face sanctions.\n  This is a fundamental change. In previous disputes with China--\nincluding our disagreements over intellectual property rights--we have \nhad to fight alone. But there are 135 members in the WTO. Under this \nagreement, we will be able to work with those other nations, many of \nwhom share our concerns. China's ability to pit its trading partners \nagainst each other will be greatly diminished. By agreeing to these \nterms, China is, in fact, agreeing to live by the rule of law. And \nwhile that agreement may be limited--for now--to trade issues, \neventually it is likely to be extended to other areas as well--\nincluding human rights.\n  Rejecting this agreement, on the other hand, is likely to harm the \ncause of civil rights in China. Former President Jimmy Carter--one of \nthe world's most respected human rights advocates--has said: ``There's \nno doubt in my mind that a negative vote on this issue in the Congress \nwill be a serious setback and impediment for the democratization, \nfreedom and human rights in China.''\n  Respected Chinese democracy advocate Martin Lee agrees. In a letter \nto President Clinton, Lee wrote that this agreement ``represents the \nbest long-term hope for China to become a member in good-standing in \nthe international community.'' Should the agreement fail, he added, `` \nwe fear that . . . any hope for political and legal reform process \nwould also recede.'' Clearly, it is in the interest of Chinese \nreformers to prevent such a failure. But it is in our interest as well.\n  There is another reason this agreement is in our national interest, \nMr. President. It will strengthen peace and stability throughout Asia--\nparticularly in Taiwan. Why? Because the more China trades, the more it \nhas to lose from war. Taiwan's newly elected President, President Chen, \nsupports China's entry into the WTO.\n  By passing this agreement, we would put the United States Congress on \nrecord as saying: ``If China is admitted to the WTO, Taiwan must be \npermitted, too--without delay.'' China has already agreed, as part of \nthis agreement, to accept that condition.\n  As I said, Mr. President, under this agreement, China is lowering its \ntariffs; we are not lowering ours. China is reducing or eliminating its \nnon-tariff barriers; we are not. There is another way to evaluate the \nbenefits of this agreement. That is by comparing China's WTO \ncommitments to those of another huge, largely poor and under-developed \nnation: India.\n  India places a 40 percent tariff on US consumer goods. Under this \nagreement, China will lower its tariffs to 9 percent. India places a 30 \npercent tariff on agriculture products. Under this agreement, China \nwill reduce its agriculture tariffs to an average of 14 percent. In \naddition, China will eliminate all agriculture subsidies to its \nfarmers. That's something not even our closest ally, the European \nUnion, has agreed to do.\n  Four years ago, Congress re-wrote the rules that had governed farming \nin this country for 60 years. Supporters of the new rules said at the \ntime that America's farmers didn't need a safety net any more because \nthey would make so much money selling their products to new markets \naround the world. But that isn't what happened.\n  Instead of prospering in this New Economy, over the last four years, \nfamily farmers and ranchers in South Dakota and across the country have \nsuffered through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. \nObviously, the lack of new market opportunities isn't the only reason \nFarm Country is hurting, Mr. President. But opening new markets for \nAmerican farm products is a necessary part of the solution to the farm \ncrisis.\n  It's time for this Congress to keep its commitment to family farmers \nand ranchers. It's time--at the very least--to provide access to the \nnew markets we said would be available when the rules were re-written \nfour years ago. The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association is right. \n``We have everything to gain by approving PNTR with China, and nothing \nto lose.''\n  One lesson we have learned from past experience is that trade \nagreements must be specific. That is why this agreement is \npainstakingly detailed. Every commitment China is making is clearly \nspelled out, in black and white. We also know from past experience that \nno trade agreement--not even one\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\nwith a nation as large as China--will solve all of our economic \nchallenges.\n  Even if we pass this agreement, we will still have a responsibility \nto fix our federal farm policy--so family farmers and ranchers can get \na fair price for their products. We will still have a responsibility to \nmake sure all American workers can learn the new skills required by \nthis New Economy. And we will also still have a responsibility to \nmonitor how this agreement is enforced.\n  We have heard a great deal of concern during this debate--and rightly \nso--about how China limits the rights of its citizens to organize their \nfellow workers, or pray to their own God. Basic legal safeguards and \ndue process in China are routinely ignored in the name of maintaining \npublic order. News reports just before we started this debate told of \nChinese being jailed because they practice their faith in ``non-\nofficial'' churches. Several key leaders of the China Democracy Party \nhave been jailed because they advocated for democratic change. Workers \nrights are tightly restricted, and forced labor in prison facilities \ncontinues.\n  Let me be very clear: No one should confuse endorsement of this trade \nagreement with endorsement of these and other assaults against basic \nhuman rights. Such practices are abhorrent and deeply troubling to \nAmericans, and to freedom-loving people everywhere.\n  As part of the Levin-Bereuter improvements, this agreement will \ncreate a high-level commission--modeled after the Helsinki Commission--\nthat will monitor human rights in China and report annually to \nCongress. We have a responsibility to support that commission.\n  Finally, this agreement calls on Congress to help the Chinese people \ndevelop the institutions of a civil society that are needed to support \nfair and open trade. We have a responsibility to provide that \nassistance.\n  This is a good agreement. But it is not a panacea. And it is not \nself-enforcing. If we want it to work, we have to keep working at it.\n  In closing, there is another quote I would like to read from \nPresident Nixon. In a toast he made to China's leaders during his 1972 \nvisit, he said, ``It is not our common beliefs that have brought us \ntogether here,'' he said, ``but our common interests and our common \nhopes, the interests that each of us has to maintain our independence \nand the security of our peoples, and the hope that each of us has to \nbuild a new world order in which nations and peoples with different \nsystems and different values can live together in peace--respecting one \nanother while disagreeing with one another, letting history, rather \nthan the battlefield, be the judge of their individual ideas.''\n  We have made progress toward that goal over these last 28 years. This \nagreement will enable us to build on that progress. It is in China's \ninterest. It is in our interest. It is in the world's best interest \nthat we pass it. I urge you to support it.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we have had an excellent debate over PNTR, \ntouching on many aspects of our complex relationship with China.\n  It was, indeed, important we had such an exhaustive discussion \nbecause the vote we are about to cast on PNTR will be a defining moment \nin the history of this Chamber and in the history of our country.\n  That is partly because passage of PNTR will create vast new \nopportunities for our workers, our farmers, and businesses. But it is \nalso because PNTR will serve America's broader national interest in \nmeeting what is likely to be our single greatest foreign policy \nchallenge in the coming decades--managing our relations with a rising \nChina.\n  China's accession to the WTO has been the subject of intense \nnegotiations for the past 14 years. The market access package the U.S. \nTrade Representative reached with Beijing represents, in my judgment, a \nremarkable achievement. From the point of view of every sector of the \nAmerican economy, and from the perspective of every U.S. enterprise, no \nmatter how big or small, the agreement holds the promise of new markets \nand future sales.\n  For the citizens of my own State of Delaware--from poultry farmers to \nauto workers to those in our chemical and services businesses--gaining \naccess to the world's largest country and fastest-growing market, which \nis what PNTR permits, offers extraordinary new opportunities.\n  Passage of PNTR is in our economic interest. I hope our debate has \nmade that clear. But I hope my colleagues and the American people have \ncome to understand why PNTR is also in our national interest.\n  To gain entry to the WTO, China has been compelled to move its \neconomy to a rules-based system and to end most forms of state control \nwithin roughly 5 years. Indeed, in a number of sectors of its economy, \nChina will soon be more open to U.S. products and services than some of \nour developed-country trading partners in Asia and Europe.\n  The results of China implementing its WTO obligations will be \nrevolutionary. But contrary to what occurred in 1949, China will be \ntransforming itself by adopting a fully-realized market economy, \nthereby returning individual property rights and economic freedom to \nthe people of China.\n  Why has China accepted such a capitalist revolution? As Long Yongtu, \nChina's top WTO negotiator and Vice Minister of China's trade ministry, \nsaid earlier this year, what is ``most significant at present [is that] \nWTO entry will speed China's reform and opening up. Reform is the only \noutlet for China.''\n  In other words, China has no choice. Its state-directed policies do \nnot work; free markets and capitalism do.\n  Mr. Long went on to say:\n\n       China's WTO entry would let enterprises make their own \n     business decisions and pursue benefits according to contracts \n     and market principles. Liaison between enterprises and \n     government will only hurt enterprises. Contracts kowtowing to \n     government, though they look rosy on the surface, usually \n     lead to failure. After joining the WTO, the government will \n     be pressed to respect market principles and give up the \n     approval economy.\n\n  I agree with those who say that the rise of China presents the United \nStates with potentially our biggest foreign policy challenge. But I \nalso believe it presents us with enormous opportunities. The single \nmost important step the Senate can take to allow the United States to \nrespond to that challenge adequately and seize those opportunities is \nto pass PNTR.\n  We must, and we will, continue to press Beijing on the range of \nissues where our interests and values diverge, from human rights to \nproliferation to China's aggressive stance on territorial disputes.\n  Yet a China fully immersed in the global trade regime, subject to all \nthe rules and sanctions applicable to WTO members, is far likelier to \nlive under the rule of law and to act in ways that comply with global \nnorms. Indeed, the WTO is exactly the sort of multilateral institution \nthat can act as a reinforcing mechanism to make China's interests more \ncompatible with ours.\n  As that happens, and as China's economic success increasingly comes \nto depend on stable and peaceful relations with its trading partners, \nBeijing will be more apt to play a constructive regional and global \nrole.\n  Finally, if Asia and much of the rest of the world are any guide, \nChina's economic liberalization will accelerate its path toward greater \npolitical freedom. In East Asia alone, South Korea, Taiwan, and \nThailand have amply demonstrated how economic freedom can stimulate \ndemocratic evolution.\n  Ultimately, China's participation in the WTO means the Chinese people \nwill be given the chance to shape their own destiny. As Ren Wanding, \nthe brave leader of China's Democracy Wall Movement said recently, \n``Before the sky was black. Now there is light . . . [China's WTO \naccession] can be a new beginning.''\n  Mr. President, when we pass PNTR, that new beginning will be for the \nAmerican people just as surely as it will be for the people of China.\n  Colleagues, let us begin anew by joining together to pass PNTR \noverwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, throughout the 22 years I have been \nprivileged to be a Member of the Senate, I have worked very closely \nwith our distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, and \nindeed our\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\ncolleague from New York, Senator Moynihan. This has to mark one of \ntheir finest hours in the Senate. Senator Moynihan has spoken with me \nunreservedly on this important issue and it took the strong leadership \nof our chairman and distinguished ranking member to shepherd this key \nlegislation through the Senate in light of the number of challenges \nthey faced.\n  I hope that not only the constituencies in their respective States \nbut the Nation as a whole recognize the skill with which these two very \nseasoned and senior Senators have managed this most critical piece of \nlegislation. Passage of this legislation is in the interest of our \ncountry economically and in terms of our security--I will dwell on the \nsecurity interests in a moment--for today, tomorrow, and the future.\n  As we enter this millennium, China, in my judgment, is our natural \ncompetitor in economics, and perhaps the nation that could pose the \ngreatest challenges in terms of our national security. I was very much \ninvolved, as were other Members of the Senate, indeed our two leaders, \nin the amendment offered by Senator Thompson. I subscribe to so many of \nhis goals. Were it not for a framework of laws which adequately address \nthe concerns of Senator Thompson, I would most certainly have supported \nhis amendment. But as our two managers have pointed out, as drafted, \nthat amendment could have imperiled the passage of this legislation.\n  I am pleased to join colleagues today in supporting PNTR for China. I \njoin all Senators who have spoken so eloquently on the question of \nhuman rights deprivation in China. Indeed, I have traveled there, as \nalmost every Member of this body has at one time, and have witnessed \nwith my own eyes the human rights deprivation of the citizens of that \nnation. However, continued isolation, in my judgment, would strengthen \nthe hands of those who inflict the abrogation of human rights on those \ncitizens by restricting the Chinese people's contact with some of our \nvery finest Ambassadors. I am not just speaking of the diplomatic \ncorps. I am talking about the American people, be they traveling for \nbusiness or to gain knowledge about China. The American people are \namong the best Ambassadors as it relates to human rights.\n  Our citizens, wherever they travel in the world, most particularly to \nChina, whether it is to conduct business or for pleasure or for other \nreasons, bring with them the closely held and dearly valued principles \nof a democratic society, principles of human rights. They are \nunrelenting in trying to share those principles and impress upon the \npeople of China the value of reshaping their society along the \nprinciples of human rights adopted by the major nations of this world, \nparticularly the United States. Therefore, exposing Chinese citizens to \nmany of the ideals that our democratic society is built upon can only \nhelp in the strengthening of human rights in China.\n  It is through such contacts, which will be greatly expanded with the \npassage of PNTR with China, that significant improvements can be made \nin the human rights situation in China. Not providing the PNTR status \nfor China would also have a significant impact on both U.S. businesses \nand consumers.\n  China imports 20 percent of the U.S. wheat and timber exports, and \nthey also are major importers of U.S. cotton, fertilizer, aircraft \nequipment and machinery. China supplies the United States with one-\nthird of those wonderful gifts, particularly at Christmastime, that we \nshare with our children. They have always had a very innovative insight \ninto what the children want and a great deal of what we purchase comes \nfrom that nation. Ten percent of our footwear, 15 percent of our \napparel, and a large percentage of our electronic products are supplied \nby China. Without a PNTR agreement, duties on these products might \ndrastically increase and the costs be borne by the American consumer.\n\n  However, China's accession to the WTO will be a boon to U.S. \nmanufacturers, farmers, and service providers. As a requirement to join \nthe WTO, China has agreed to greatly reduce tariffs across the board. \nThis will in turn open markets in that huge nation, thereby providing \nAmerican business with great opportunities.\n  Let me take a minute to explain how such a reduction in Chinese \ntariffs will beneficially impact my State, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. In 1998, Virginia's worldwide poultry and product exports \nwere estimated at $101 million. China is currently the second leading \nmarket for U.S. poultry exports. Under its WTO accession agreement, by \n2004, China will cut its frozen poultry products tariff in half, from \n20 percent to 10 percent. The beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, \nindeed, along with other regions of the State, are the heartland of our \npoultry export market. They stand to benefit greatly.\n  In 1998, Virginia's worldwide live animal and red meat exports were \nestimated at $87 million. Under its WTO accession agreement, by 2004, \nChina will reduce its tariffs 45 percent to 12 percent on frozen beef \ncuts, from 45 to 25 percent on chilled beef, and from 20 percent to 12 \npercent on frozen pork cuts, definitely benefiting Virginia's exports \nin these areas.\n  Virginia's lumber industry is the 13th largest in the Nation. China \nis the world's third largest lumber importer. Under its WTO accession \nagreement, China will substantially reduce tariffs on this import, \nthereby dramatically opening up the market to the American lumber \nindustry.\n  Those are but a few examples of how China's accession into the WTO \nwill provide numerous opportunities for Virginia business, particularly \nsmall- and medium-size companies which account for 54 percent of all \nexports from Virginia to China.\n  I believe it is in the long-term interest of the United States to \nmaintain a positive trade relationship with China. I believe we can use \nour relationship to foster positive social, civil, and economic changes \nin China. Isolation tactics will only prevent the United States from \nhaving any influence over guiding China towards democratic reform.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nVirginia may require.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I will take but a few \nmore minutes.\n  Therefore, I intend to vote loudly and strongly for this measure.\n  In conclusion, I am privileged to work in the Senate in the area of \nsecurity, military and foreign relations as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  In light of that, I have looked very closely at China. China is \npushing many frontiers, whether it is the export of armaments or being \ninvolved in some of the most complex and fragile relationships the \nworld over. We need only point out Pakistan and India and how Russia is \non one side and China is on the other side. Let's only hope that their \nwork with regard to that tension-filled part of the globe will be \nconstructive and in a way to prevent any significant confrontation \nbetween those two nations.\n  Therefore, I think it is important that our military maintain its \nrelationship with the Chinese. Given the tenuous situation with regard \nto Taiwan, and the strong principles of our Nation in trying to defend \nand support that democracy, I believe such a dialogue will give us a \nbetter opportunity to work on security relationships, whether regarding \nIndia and Pakistan, Taiwan or other regions of the world.\n  Mr. President, I think we are on the verge of a very historic moment. \nI commend the chairman and ranking member for their initiatives and \nlong weeks of hard work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I know Senator Roth will join me in \nexpressing great gratitude and appreciation for Senator Warner's \ncharacteristic generosity. It comes from the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, which is doubly important.\n  Mr. President, we are nearly there. In a short while, the Senate will \ncast an epic vote. At the Finance Committee's final hearing on China \nthis spring, on April 6, 2000, our last witness--Ira Shapiro, former \nChief Negotiator for Japan and Canada at the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative--put it this way:\n\n       . . . [this vote] is one of an historic handful of \n     Congressional votes since the end of World War II. Nothing \n     that members of Congress do this year--or any other year--\n     could be more important.\n\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\n\n  This achievement--for it is a crowning achievement--caps an eventful \nyear. All the more impressive in light of last December's ``global \ndisaster''--as the Economist magazine on December 11, 1999, put it--\nthat was the Seattle World Trade Organization Ministerial.\n  In January, it was thought that our long-standing trade policy was in \nserious jeopardy--the trade policy that, for 66 years--ever since \nCordell Hull created the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program in 1934--\nhas contributed so much to our nation's prosperity.\n  But we have prevailed. And more. In May, the Senate took up and \npassed--the vote was 77 to 19--the conference report on the Trade and \nDevelopment Act of 2000--establishing a long overdue trade policy for \nsub-Saharan Africa and putting in place new trade benefits for the \nCaribbean Basin countries. That measure was the most significant trade \nlegislation passed by the Congress in six years--ever since the Uruguay \nRound Agreements Act of 1994.\n  Now, just four months later, we are about to give our resounding \napproval to H.R. 4444, authorizing the extension of permanent normal \ntrade relations to China. And with this action, we will have passed \nmore trade legislation--important trade legislation--in this session of \nCongress than any session of Congress in more than a decade.\n  It has taken us a long while to reach the point of final passage of \nthe PNTR legislation. We have most certainly not rushed this \nlegislation through the Senate. The House approved the measure nearly \nfour months ago, on May 24, by a vote of 237-197. The Senate, in \neffect, began its consideration before the August recess--on July 27th, \nwhen we invoked cloture on the motion to proceed to the bill. The vote \nwas a decisive 86 to 12.\n  By the time this vote is cast, we will have completed eleven full \ndays of debate. We have taken up and debated 19 amendments. We have \nconsidered every facet of U.S.-China relations, and we are now ready to \ngive this measure our overwhelming approval.\n  And so we ought to do. We are giving up very little--the annual \nreview of China's trade status that has had at best an inconsequential \neffect on China's domestic policies. In return, we are bringing China \nback into the trading system that it helped to establish out of the \nashes of the Second World War.\n  For with its accession to the WTO, China merely resumes the role that \nit played more than half a century ago: China was one of the 44 \nparticipants in the Bretton Woods Conference--July 1-22, 1944. It \nserved on the Preparatory Committee that wrote the charter for the \nInternational Trade Organization that was to complement the \nInternational Monetary Fund and the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development. And China was of course one of the 23 \noriginal Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade--initially designed to be an interim arrangement until the ITO \nCharter would come into force. It did not: the ITO failed in the Senate \nFinance Committee and we were left with the GATT.\n  And in China, revolution intervened. The Republic of China (now on \nTaiwan) notified the GATT on March 8, 1950, that it was terminating \n``China's'' membership. It was not until 1986 that the People's \nRepublic of China officially sought to rejoin the GATT, now the World \nTrade Organization. And now, after 14 years of negotiations, China is \npoised to become the 139th member of the WTO.\n  It is elemental that China belongs in the WTO. It is in the interests \nof all trading nations that a country that harbors one-fifth of \nmankind, a country that is already the world's ninth largest exporter \nand eleventh largest importer, abide by the rules of world trade--rules \nthat were, I would point out, largely written by the United States.\n  We, too, must abide by the WTO's rules. And thus we will approve \ntoday the legislation extending permanent, unconditional normal trade \nrelations to China--fulfilling the most basic of our obligations under \nthe WTO's rules--nondiscriminatory treatment.\n  Let me leave the Senate with the following observations from Joseph \nFewsmith, an associate professor of international relations at Boston \nUniversity and a specialist on the political economy of China. He \nwrites in the National Bureau of Asian Research publication of July 2, \n2000:\n\n       Some historical perspective is necessary when thinking \n     about PNTR. When President Nixon traveled to China in 1972, \n     China was still in the throes of the Cultural Revolution. Mao \n     Zedong was still in command, there were no private markets, \n     intellectuals were still raising pigs on so-called ``May 7 \n     cadre schools,'' and labor camps were filled with political \n     prisoners. Nixon was treated to a performance of ``The Red \n     Detachment of Women,'' one of only eight model operas that \n     were permitted to be performed. Nearly three decades later--\n     not a long period in historical terms--China has changed \n     dramatically. Communes are gone, the planned economy has \n     shrunk to a shadow of its former self, and incomes have \n     increased dramatically. Personal freedoms, while by no means \n     perfect, are greater than at any other time in Chinese \n     history. China's opening to the United States is a major \n     reason for these changes, a dramatic demonstration of the \n     impact of international influence.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cast their votes in support of \nH.R. 4444.\n  I would like to attenuate my remarks simply to take up the question \nof Taiwan and its accession to the WTO. This ought to be explicit and \nperhaps the last thing said in this debate.\n  Just as China ought to be in the WTO--will be in the WTO--so will \nTaiwan. Despite the bluster of senior Chinese officials, \nintermittently, and recently as well, Taiwan is on track to be invited \nto join the WTO at the same General Council session that will consider \nChina's application.\n  Article XII of the Agreement Establishing the WTO provides that:\n\n       . . . any State or separate customs territory possessing \n     full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial \n     relations . . . may accede to the WTO.\n\n  In September 1992, the GATT Council--for the WTO was not yet in \nexistence--established a separate working party to examine Taiwan's \nrequest for accession. The nomenclature was carefully chosen. Taiwan \nwas called the ``Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen \nand Matsu.'' That is the formulation under which Taiwan will enter the \nWTO.\n  The President has confirmed this and confirmed in the strongest \npossible terms that the United States will not accept any other \noutcome. The President was adamant on this point in his letter of \nSeptember 12. A copy was sent to me, and I believe a copy was also sent \nto our distinguished chairman. It says this:\n\n       There should be no question that my administration is \n     firmly committed to Taiwan's accession to the WTO, a point I \n     reiterated in my September 8 meeting with President Jiang \n     Zemin. Based on our New York discussions with the Chinese, I \n     am confident we have a common understanding that both China \n     and Taiwan will be invited to accede to the WTO at the same \n     WTO General Council session, and that Taiwan will join the \n     WTO under the language agreed to in 1992, namely, as the \n     Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and \n     Matsu (referred to as ``Chinese Taipei''). The United States \n     will not accept any other outcome.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President's letter of \nSeptember 12 be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if China should attempt to block \nTaiwan's accession, I suggest to the Senate that there is a remedy. \nH.R. 4444 gives the President the authority to extend permanent normal \ntrade relations status to China upon its accession to the WTO, but he \nneed not do so. Indeed, if Taiwan's membership in the WTO is blocked, I \nwould urge--and I am sure my beloved colleague, Senator Roth, would \nurge, as I see him nodding--the President to simply refrain from \nextending PNTR to China. So we ought to put this matter to rest.\n  I have no doubt that there will continue to be bumps--some serious \ncrises indeed--in our relationship with China. Neither membership in \nthe WTO nor normalized trade relations with the United States will \nmagically impose the rule of law in China or institute deep-seated \nrespect for human rights. But certainly it has the potential to advance \nthose purposes. That is why we are here and why we will shortly make \nthis epic decision.\n  Finally, if I may have the indulgence of the Senate--and I know this \nis shared by the chairman--I want to read a short paragraph.\n  My only regret today is that with the final vote on PNTR for China, \nwe must\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\nbid farewell to our chief trade counsel, Debbie Lamb, who joined the \nFinance Committee staff over 10 years ago, in June 1990. Ms. Lamb has \nplayed an integral part in every major piece of trade legislation over \nthe past decade--from the NAFTA and the Uruguay Round to our attempts \nto renew so-called fast-track negotiating authority to the two pieces \nof trade legislation that we passed this year: The Trade and \nDevelopment Act of 2000, and now, at last, PNTR for China. Her \nknowledge and dedication to our committee's work has been exemplary. \nShe is something that is very rare in Washington--a person with great \nbreadth and great depth. The committee and I will miss her deeply as \nshe leaves today to pursue the next phase of a distinctly distinguished \ncareer.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, September 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I want to commend you for commencing \n     debate on H.R. 4444, which would extend Permanent Normal \n     Trade Relations to the People's Republic of China. This \n     crucial legislation will help ensure our economic prosperity, \n     reinforce our work on human rights, and enhance our national \n     security.\n       Normalizing our trade relationship with China will allow \n     American workers, farmers, and businesspeople to benefit from \n     increased access to the Chinese market. It will also give us \n     added tools to promote increased openness and change in \n     Chinese society, and increase our ability to work with China \n     across the broad range of our mutual interests.\n       I want to address two specific areas that I understand may \n     be the subject of debate in the Senate. One is Taiwan's \n     accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). There should \n     be no question that my Administration is firmly committed to \n     Taiwan's accession to the WTO, a point I reiterated in \n     September 8 meeting with President Jiang Zemin. Based on our \n     New York discussions with the Chinese, I am confident we have \n     a common understanding that both China and Taiwan will be \n     invited to accede to the WTO at the same WTO General Council \n     session, and that Taiwan will join the WTO under the language \n     agreed to in 1992, namely as the Separate Customs Territory \n     of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (referred to as ``Chinese \n     Taipei''). The United States will not accept any other \n     outcome.\n       The other area is nonproliferation, specifically the \n     proposals embodied in an amendment offered by Senator Fred \n     Thompson. Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and the means to deliver them is a key goal of my \n     Administration. However, I believe this amendment is unfair \n     and unnecessary, and would hurt our nonproliferation efforts.\n       Nonproliferation has been a priority in our dealings with \n     China. We have pressed China successfully to join the \n     Nonproliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty, and to cease cooperation with Iran's nuclear program. \n     Today, we are seeking further restraints, but these efforts \n     would be subverted--and existing progress could be reversed \n     by this mandatory sanctions bill which would single out \n     companies based on an unreasonably low standard of suspicion, \n     instead of proof. It would apply a different standard for \n     some countries than others, undermining our global leadership \n     on nonproliferation. Automatic sanctions, such as cutting off \n     dual-use exports to China, would hurt American workers and \n     companies. Other sanctions, such as restricting access to \n     U.S. capital markets, could harm our economy by undermining \n     confidence in our markets. I believe this legislation would \n     do more harm than good.\n       The American people are counting on the Congress to pass \n     H.R. 4444. I urge you and your colleagues to complete action \n     on the bill as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I only want to echo what my friend and \ndistinguished ranking member has said about Debbie. We have \naccomplished a lot in the area of trade in recent years, and so much of \nthe credit should go to the staff who have worked so hard and so long. \nTop among those is Debbie Lamb, who has been available not only to her \nside, but has been most helpful to the majority as well. Sometimes I \nthink people don't recognize the cooperation that often exists between \nMembers of the two parties. But I think what Debbie has done shows that \nbipartisanship is still alive. We would not be here celebrating today's \nvote if not for her splendid contribution.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I say to our chairman, as evidenced by the fact that \nthis measure was reported 19-1 in the Finance Committee.\n  I thank the Chair. We are at a moment of history and the omens are \nexcellent.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in keeping with the words of my \ndistinguished colleague about Debbie, I want to say a few words of \nthanks to all those who worked so hard on this bill.\n  Of course, first, I have to thank my dear friend, our venerable \ncolleague, and always gracious ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nPat Moynihan. It would never have been possible to be here today with \nthe kind of vote I think we are going to enjoy if it had not been for \nPat's leadership, for his knowledge and background, and his ability to \nbring people together. I thank him for his outstanding contributions.\n  I also thank Senators Grassley, Thomas, Hagel, Roberts, and Rod Grams \nfor helping manage the floor. We were on this legislation something \nlike 11 days. There were times when Pat and I were called from the \nfloor for other duties. It was most helpful to have these other \nindividual colleagues helping manage the floor.\n  Again, I thank all of Senator Moynihan's committee staff who are just \nas gracious as the Senator for whom they work. We have already talked \nabout Debbie Lamb. But David Podoff--I want to express my warm thanks \nto you for bringing your expertise to bear on this legislative process. \nI agree with Senator Moynihan. This is probably the most important \npiece of legislation that will be adopted this year, if not this \ndecade. But again, it could not have happened without people such as \nDave.\n  I would also like to thank Linda Menghetti, and Timothy Hogan, as \nwell as Therese Lee, who I think was such a help as a member of the \nSenator's personal staff.\n  Finally, let me thank my own staff. I would like to claim that I have \nthe best staff on the Hill. I certainly have one of the best, if not \nthe very best.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, we have the best staffs.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield to my distinguished Senator on that point. I stand \ncorrected.\n  But, again, I really want to thank my personal staff, and my trade \nstaff, whether it is Frank Polk, who is always there when you need him, \nand Grant Aldonas, Faryar Shirzad, Tim Keeler, J.T. Young, and Carrie \nClark from the Finance Committee. I also particularly want to thank \nJohn Duncan and Dan Bob from my personal office. Dan is really one of \nour great experts on Asia, and on international politics in general. I \nowe him so much for his help during these last 2 weeks. Thank you all \nfor a job well done.\n  Let me say it is an honor and pleasure to work with the ranking \nmember.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. My honor, sir.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to use \nsome of my leader time to conclude discussion on the China PNTR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. First, Mr. President, this is the last day of a very \ncritical and helpful staff member working here with the Senate in the \nFinance Committee. That person is Debbie Lamb on Senator Moynihan's \nstaff. She has been his chief trade counsel and has been very helpful, \nobviously, to Senator Moynihan and, before that, to Senator Bentsen.\n  I remember specifically one night we were negotiating the final \ncontours of a bill between the House and the Senate. I wound up relying \non her counsel as we made the final decisions. People may find it \nsomewhat a surprise that the majority leader, a Republican, would be \nrelying on the counsel on the other side of the aisle, but it does work \nthat way and it attests to her credibility and expertise. She has done \na wonderful job. We wish her the very best.\n  In that connection, too, I want to recognize the outstanding work \nthat has been done by Senator Moynihan and by Chairman Roth. Here he \nis, sitting right behind me. They have been patient; they have been \nwilling to spend hours here in the Senate. They waited weeks to get \ntheir opportunity to have it considered in the Senate. There was no \neffort made to cut off a full debate. I think every Senator believes he \nor she had the opportunity they needed to make their case, state their \npositions, and raise their concerns or why they supported it.\n  Also, we had numerous amendments, and all of them failed. Some of \nthem were very attractive. In fact, I felt very strongly about a couple \nof them, obviously. But they waded through all of this and we are going \nto have a final vote in a moment. I think it is going to be an \noverwhelming vote. I think it is the right thing to do and I commend \nChairman Roth and Senator Moynihan for their leadership.\n  When history is written about this session, one of the things I \nbelieve it will say is that this is a session of Congress that did \nspend time and wound up passing some important trade bills with \nrelation to not only China but the Caribbean and also Africa. A lot of \ncredit goes to the leaders of this committee.\n  Regardless of one's views on the merits, there is no question about \nthe significance of the measure we consider today. Normalizing trade \nrelations with China will not only have profound effects upon our \neconomic well-being, but it will undoubtedly have significant \nimplications for our relations with China and our national security.\n  China accounts for a quarter of the world's population. It has one of \nthe largest economies in the world--an economy that has been growing at \na remarkable rate of nearly 10 percent per year. China unquestionably \nis and will be a major factor in the world, especially economically.\n  There is also no question that China's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization holds great opportunities for the United States. Chief \namong them are the economic benefits that would flow from the \ndismantling of Chinese trade barriers--barriers that deny benefits to \nour workers and businesses.\n  But many people in this country have legitimate questions. They \nquestion whether China will live up to its commitments, whether it will \ntrade fairly in our market, and whether we are ignoring China's human \nrights abuses and its destabilizing behavior in the world.\n  These are not questions to be taken lightly. And that is why I have \ninsisted that the Senate not rush to action on this bill, and that \nthose on both sides have a full opportunity to air their views and \ntheir amendments.\n  The Senate has had ample time to consider the agreements reached with \nChina, has held numerous hearings on its potential accession to the \nWTO, and has engaged in a full and vigorous debate on this issue. That \nis certainly fitting on an issue of this magnitude.\n  I know that many of my colleagues, like myself, have struggled with \nthis issue in light of our larger concerns about China and its behavior \nin the world. We all know that China is a one-party State that denies \nthe most basic rights to its people. We must acknowledge that it \ndeprives its people of religious freedom, that it has flagrantly \nengaged in weapons proliferation, and that it has repeatedly used \nunfair trade practices in our market.\n  Whle some may argue that we should, I do not believe that we can \ntotally separate these broader issues from the question of our trade \nrelationship with China. But I also believe that we cannot allow our \ndesire for reform in China to blind us not only to the benefits we \nreceive from trade with China, but from the positive effects trade may \nhave within that country.\n  On balance, I am convinced that expanding our trading relation with \nChina is not only in our economic self interest, but in our broader \nnational interest as well.\n  There are many misconceptions about the action Congress is taking \nwith this legislation. Chief among them is the view that we are voting \non whether to allow China into the World Trade Organization. The fact \nis that China will almost certainly enter the WTO, regardless of \nwhether the United States approves this legislation.\n  What this legislation will decide is whether the commitments of WTO \nmembership are applied bilaterally between the United States and China.\n  Applying WTO commitments to trade between the United States and China \nis in our economic interest--and for a simple reason. We already grant \nChina the favorable access to our market required by the WTO. China, \nhowever, does not grant similar access to our products. As such, this \nagreement will expand our access to China's market; it will not expand \nChina's access to ours.\n  Many of my colleagues have gone through in detail the market-opening \nconcessions China will be forced to make upon entry into the WTO. Let \nme just highlight some of the major terms that will have a direct \nimpact on our workers and companies:\n  China will be required to cut tariffs from a current average of \nalmost 25 percent to an average of around 9 percent by 2005--with \nparticularly sharp reductions for farm products and information \ntechnology products;\n  China will be required to provide our companies with full trading and \ndistribution rights--eliminating the need to go through trading \ncompanies blessed by the Chinese government;\n  China will be required to greatly expand access to its market for \nagricultural goods, ranging from cotton, wheat, soybeans, rice and farm \nproducts across the spectrum.\n  China will for the first time be required to provide real access to \nfinancial services providers--allowing U.S. banks, insurers and other \nproviders significant new access.\n  Why would we walk away from these new and dramatic benefits--\nparticularly when our market is already open to Chinese imports?\n  Both the farming and manufacturing community in my home state--as in \nstates across the country--have voiced strong support for increased \ntrade with China.\n  They know that we cannot afford to neglect economic ties with a \nnation of more than 1 billion people, and a market that already is the \nsixth largest for U.S. agricultural exports. They know that with \nexpanded trade China is projected to account for more than one third of \nthe growth in U.S. agricultural exports. Whether it is cotton farmers \nin the delta or poultry producers in central Mississippi, our farmers \nneed China's market.\n  We also stand to make huge gains in the high tech sector, where the \nU.S. leads, and where my state is growing in leaps and bounds. Only 2.5 \npercent of China's population has a computer and only 1 percent has \naccess to the Internet--but these numbers are growing rapidly.\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\n  If we do not trade with China, you can bet that our competitors in \nJapan and Europe will. And it will be their workers and industries--not \nours--that reap the benefits of increased access to China's market.\n  If the economic benefits are clear, what is it that we give up by \napproving permanent trade relations with China? Most concretely, we end \nthe automatic annual review of China's trade status under the Jackson-\nVanik amendment. I do not take this lightly. We must acknowledge that \ngaining permanent trading status in our market has been a major \nobjective of China's. And we should not dismiss out of hand the \nsalutary effects that have resulted from a yearly review of China's \nactions and status.\n  But we must also question how much leverage this review continues to \nprovide--particularly given that China's most favored nation status has \nnever been withdrawn in the 20 years since relations with the PRC were \nnormalized in 1979. And we must consider as well what benefits and \nfavorable effects are likely to accompany a closer trading relation \nbetween our countries.\n  Trade will not solve all of our problems with China, and it will not \nchange China's behavior overnight. But economic forces are powerful--\noften beyond anything we can imagine. China's commitments under the WTO \nagreements will require it to loosen its grip--perhaps not dramatically \nat first, but in real and observable ways--over the economic life of \nits people.\n  As wealth grows among China's middle class, as they see the benefits \nof open markets and freedom, as they share in the unbelievable exchange \nof ideas that the new economy and the Internet bring, change will come \nto China. And we must be there, to engage, to influence, and to foster \nideas that will hopefully lead to a new flowering of democracy and \nfreedom--and over the long run to a more peaceful and stable world.\n  I want to stress one thing. The passage of this bill must not--and I \ncan tell you that as long as I have anything to say about it, it will \nnot--mark a lessening of our commitment to scrutinize China's behavior, \nto combat proliferation, and to advance the cause of human and \nreligious rights.\n  Our friends and allies around the world should not misinterpret what \nhappened with our vote on the Thompson amendment--a vote that was \ncaught up in the back and forth of how best to consider the measure. \nThis country is united in its determination to combat weapons \nproliferation in China and around the world. Our commitment has not \nwavered, and we have not seen the last of this issue on the Senate \nfloor.\n  We must recognize the legitimate fears and concerns of many citizens \nregarding trade with China. They know China has abused our market in \nthe past and has failed to live up to its end of the bargain in recent \ntrade agreements.\n  Ensuring Chinese compliance with its commitments will not be easy. \nBut it is essential that we are unwavering in our vigilance to see that \nour workers and our companies get the benefits they are promised. This \nagreement maintains our ability to use our trade laws fully to combat \nChinese unfair trade practices, and to take trade measures necessary to \nprotect our national security. We must respond swiftly and forcefully \nwhere the need arises.\n  This will be one of the most closely scrutinized trade agreements in \nhistory, as it should be. The American people know that we can compete \nand win with fair and open markets, but they will not long tolerate the \nsystematic flouting of our agreements and the abuse of our market. This \nwill be a test--not only of our own resolve to make trade agreements \nwork for our citizens, but of the ability of the WTO and the \ninternational system to deliver on the promises it has made.\n  This has been a remarkable year for trade legislation.\n  I want to congratulate Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan once again \nfor their extraordinary efforts to get our trade agenda back on track--\npassing this year both the Africa-CBI trade enhancement act and now \nthis critical piece of legislation. It is a record of accomplishment \nfor which we can all be proud.\n  But it is not a time to rest or sit back. We saw in Seattle the \nconsequences of indecision, mixed messages and lack of resolve in the \ncause of freer and fairer trade.\n  Making the case for freer trade and open markets will never be easy. \nThe concrete dislocations and challenges that come with increased \nglobal trade are often easier to see and to seize upon than the more \ndiffuse gains from new markets and new economic growth. It is up to us \nas policy makers and public officials to ensure that our workers and \nour businesses see the gains from trade, that they receive the benefits \nof the agreements we make, and that our security and our economic well-\nbeing are enhanced as we seek further engagement in the global economy.\n  I know there are legitimate concerns about this legislation and that \nthere are those having to struggle with whether or not we can trust \nChina's compliance. They are legitimate concerns about human rights \nviolations, religious persecution, and nuclear weapons activities. But \nI also believe it would be a tremendous mistake to ignore the \nadvantages of this trade legislation. There are a billion people in \nChina. These are markets that are not now open to us. Just last night, \nI looked over what would come out of this legislation. The fact is, \nthey will have to open markets. China will be required to cut tariffs \nfrom the current average of almost 25 percent to an average of 9 \npercent by 2005, with a particularly sharp reduction for farm products \nand information technology.\n  China will be required to provide our companies with full trading and \ndistribution rights; it will be required to greatly expand access to \nits markets for agricultural goods, ranging from cotton, wheat, \nsoybeans, rice, and farm products across the spectrum. For the first \ntime, China will be required to provide real access to financial \nservices providers.\n  This is legislation that is good for America, that is good for the \nworking people in our country. It will take a lot of vigilance. I think \nwe need to make sure of its compliance. But it is the right thing to \ndo. I will vote for this legislation and I hope it will be accepted \noverwhelmingly.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today ends an historic debate on permanent \nnormal trade relations with China. The vote we just cast was certainly \nthe most important of this year and likely the most consequential of \nthe past decade.\n  We have had a vigorous debate on PNTR as well as the full range of \nissues my colleagues have raised through amendment.\n  Because of PNTR's significance, however, I opposed all amendments to \nPNTR regardless of merit. And many of the amendments did have merit. \nIndeed, I would have supported some of them under other circumstances.\n  In the case of PNTR, however, a vote for any amendment would have \nforced a conference with the House and additional votes in both the \nHouse and Senate on a conference report. Had we chosen that route, we \nwould likely have run out of time before we could have passed PNTR in \nthis Congress.\n  And had we failed to pass PNTR this year, the only certain effect \nwould have been to punish our workers, farmers, and businesses by \nplacing them at a huge competitive disadvantage to their fiercest \nforeign competitors in gaining access to China's burgeoning market.\n  That is because PNTR does not determine whether China enters the \nWorld Trade Organization. China will enter the WTO regardless of what \nCongress had done on PNTR; and China's entry will definitely take place \nthis year according to Michael Moore, the Director-General of the WTO.\n  What PNTR does is allow American firms equal access to China's market \nwhen China joins the WTO.\n  Let us remember that in joining the WTO, China has committed itself \nto abandoning central control and throwing its market wide open to the \nUnited States an all the other WTO members, all within roughly five \nyears. Let me note here that for our part, the U.S. market will not be \nopened further to China; our market is already open to the Chinese.\n  In keeping with its obligations as a member of the WTO, China will \nhave to extend permanently and unconditionally its greatly lowered \ntariffs and its expansively opened market to every other member of the \nWTO. In other words, China will have to maintain PNTR with all member \neconomies of the WTO. There is only one exception to this rule: when \nanother WTO member chooses not to extend permanent normal trade \nrelations to China, China need not extend PNTR to that country.\n  Of course, there is only one member of the WTO that even considered \ndenying China PNTR--the United States. In part, that's because there \nhas been a belief that in denying the Chinese PNTR we would somehow \nforce them to change their behavior in any number of areas, from human \nrights to Taiwan to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  But would denying China PNTR actually have changed Chinese behavior? \nFrankly, there is little logic to this argument. After all, the only \ncertain result of denying China PNTR is that we would have deprived \nU.S. farmers, workers and businesses access to China's lowered tariffs \nand more open market--access that every other member of the WTO will \nenjoy.\n  How is it that putting Americans at a competitive disadvantage to the \nFrench, the Germans, the Japanese and the Canadians would have \ncompelled Beijing to act in ways the United States would prefer?\n  I submit that in denying PNTR--and thereby undermining American \neconomic access to China--we actually would have lost leverage over \nChina rather than gain it. Only by engaging China economically, by \npermitting Americans to work within China and thereby pressuring her \nfrom the inside to restructure her institutions and advance the rule of \nlaw, do we stand the best chance of making Beijing more cooperative.\n  That's why most of China's human rights dissidents have supported \nChina's entry into the WTO and PNTR. As Wang Dan, a leader of the \ndemonstrations in Tiananmen Square, said, China's entry into the WTO \n``will be beneficial for the long-term future of China because China \nthus will be required to abide by the rules and regulations of the \ninternational community.''\n  Meanwhile, the Taiwanese, the people most threatened by China, \nalso support China's WTO accession and PNTR. Taiwan's current and \nprevious Presidents have both publicly affirmed their support for the \nUnited States fully normalizing trade relations with China. And as \nPresident Clinton stated in a letter he sent in response to an inquiry \nI made last week, the U.S. will make sure that Taiwan gains entry to \nthe WTO just as soon as China does.\n\n  On the question of U.S. national security, the Americans most \nknowledgeable about the matter, including Presidents Ford, Bush and \nCarter, as well as virtually every living former Secretary of State and \nDefense, National Security Advisor and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff agrees that PNTR will advance American interests. They recognize, \nas General Colin Powell put it, that if Congress rejects PNTR, the \nresult will be ``to make [China] more isolated, truculent and more \naggressive . . .''\n  The vote over PNTR was thus about more than just economics. It was \nalso about America's response to China's emergence as a leading power, \na phenomenon which I believe presents us with potentially our most \nserious foreign policy challenge. But it also presents us with enormous \nopportunities. We can only respond to that challenge adequately and \nseize those opportunities through a sensible overall China policy. The \nclear objective of that policy should be to encourage China's \nconstructive and responsible behavior and discourage its aggressiveness \nand irresponsibility.\n  I believe our China policy must have five central elements, and PNTR \nforms the core of the first--that of expanding our economic \nrelationship with Beijing. We should seek such an expanded relationship \nbecause a China integrated into the global economy is more likely to \nbehave in ways compatible with American interests and international \nnorms. Thus, we should encourage China's development and participate in \nits economic growth by supporting China's accession to the World Trade \nOrganization and by passing PNTR, as we have done.\n  The more China is integrated into the international economy, the more \nsubject Beijing is to the harsh realities of the marketplace. Should \nChina choose a path toward blatant aggression and destabilizing \ndomestic repression, foreign investment will dry up and firms will move \nto other countries where the risks are lower and the returns are \nhigher.\n  Moreover, we have a better opportunity to influence China to act in \nways we prefer when we enmesh it in the sort of economic relationships \nfostered by granting China PNTR.\n  In addition, economic growth nurtured by participation in the global \neconomy tends to lead to greater demands for democratic reform. Other \nAsian countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, have amply \ndemonstrated the political evolution that accompanies economic \ndevelopment. By encouraging trade with China, we are also encouraging a \nprocess that is likely to lead to the sort of political liberalization \nthat is in America's interest.\n  The second element of any coherent China policy must include \npreparedness to deal with China if its participation in world affairs \nproves disruptive. Strengthening our current array of bilateral \nsecurity ties in Asia is thus essential. Those ties include not only \nthe full security alliances we have with Japan, Korea, Thailand, the \nPhilippines and Australia, but also the productive security \narrangements we maintain with Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, \nNew Zealand and other Asia Pacific nations.\n  Closer cooperation on security and diplomatic initiatives with \nnations in the Asia Pacific that share our interests on China can serve \nto prod Beijing to accept the moderating influence of global economic \nintegration. It also provides a hedge in the event Beijing instead \nchooses an aggressive path.\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\n  Third, we must enforce current law regarding Chinese actions and be \nwilling to challenge China on issues of concern. That is why we should \ncontinue to work to improve China's human rights policies and convince \nBeijing to abandon its repugnant use of forced abortions and grotesque \npractice of harvesting organs. We can pursue these ends, in part, by \nensuring the success of the Levin-Bereuter Commission on human rights \ncreated by H.R. 4444, further supporting Radio Free Asia and condemning \nChina at the annual human rights conference in Geneva and at other \ninternational fora.\n  We should respond to China when it persecutes Christians, Muslims and \nthose of other faiths by using the authority granted by the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act.\n  We should continue to support Taiwan under the terms of the \nTaiwan Relations Act. The TRA affirms that any effort to determine \nTaiwan's future by other than peaceful means would, ``constitute a \nthreat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and be of grave \nconcern to the United States.'' The TRA also commits the United States \nto making available to Taiwan such defense articles and services in \nsuch quantities as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a \nsufficient self-defense capability.\n\n  We should push China to negotiate with the Dalai Lama regarding \nTibet, supporting the Dalai Lama's call for ``Cultural autonomy'' \nwithin the Chinese system. And we should support the actions of the \nSpecial Coordinator for Tibetan issues within the State Department, a \nposition created as a result of Congressional pressure in 1997.\n  We should investigate credible allegations that Chinese goods have \nbeen produced by prison labor and enforce section 307 of the Tariff Act \nof 1930, which bars imports of prison-made goods into the United \nStates.\n  We should work with the International Labor Organization to make sure \nthat China lives up to its acceptance of the ILO's Declaration of \nFundamental Rights and Principles at Work, which among other things, \naffords the people of signatory countries the right to organize and \nbargain collectively.\n  We should work to counter Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery through strict enforcement of \nthe Arms Export Control Act, Chemical and Biological Weapons Control \nand Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, the Export Administration Act of \n1979, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Nuclear \nProliferation Prevention Act of 1994.\n  And we should use the WTO's robust dispute settlement system to \nensure that China meets its obligations to open its markets and abide \nby the rules of international trade.\n  The fourth element of a coherent China policy is the continuation of \nhigh-level, regular dialogue with Beijing. Mistrust is bound to grow \nwhen we don't meet, particularly when the list of critical bilateral, \nregional and global issues requiring discussion is so long. Keep in \nmind that even in the darkest days of the Cold War, we held a \nconsistent series of summit talks with Soviets.\n  Finally, we must nurture aspects of the relationship where we share \ninterests and can cooperate. China has the potential to play a key role \nin settling the serious threat posed by North Korea to the South, as \nwell as to the 37,000 American troops we have on the ground there. I \ncannot imagine the Chinese playing a constructive role on any matter of \nmutual concern--from controlling transnational crime and narcotics \ntrafficking to protecting the environment--if we only threaten and \nsanction them.\n  In sum, to meet the challenge and reap the opportunities of a rising \nChina, we must encourage economic relations with Beijing based on the \nChina's accession to the WTO and passage of PNTR, strengthen security \nand diplomatic ties with our friends in the rest of the Asian Pacific, \nenforce current law regarding Chinese actions and be willing to \nconfront China when necessary, continue high-level dialogue, and \ncooperate with China on matters of mutual concern.\n  In addition, the Congress should not shy away from criticizing \nChinese actions that run counter to internationally-recognized norms or \nAmerican interests. For my part, I will do everything in my power as \nChairman of the Finance Committee to see that China not only lives up \nto its WTO obligations, but also begins the process of internal change \nthat is essential if Beijing is to meet those obligations.\n  PNTR is not a panacea, and there will be many bumps on the road in \nrelations between the United States and China. But PNTR is a key \ncomponent of a coherent strategy for addressing the complex set of \nissues associated with the rise of China. That is why I am pleased PNTR \npassed overwhelmingly and with bipartisan support.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate has just voted on one of the \nmost significant and controversial bills of this Congress. I would like \nto take this opportunity to share my views on the issues involved and \nexplain the process I went through in making my decision on how to vote \non providing normal trade relations status to China.\n  I thought about this matter a great deal and examined the issues very \ncarefully. I listened to the arguments made by my colleagues in this \nChamber and to the intense public debate over the past months. Just \nthis last month, along with my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, I visited \nChina. It was the first time I had been back since 1981. We were able \nto gain some valuable insights into the questions before us.\n  Having listened to the debate on China PNTR, especially in the media, \none may have gotten the idea that this is a clear-cut question. If you \nlistened to the proponents, you would think PNTR is a magic elixir for \nthe American economy. If you listened to the opponents, you would think \nPNTR spells utter disaster.\n  After thoroughly looking into this matter, I concluded the claims of \nboth sides were exaggerated. Passing PNTR was not a slam-dunk or a no-\nbrainer, but neither was it a sellout or a surrender on the critical \nproblems we face with China. It was a matter of judging how the scales \ntipped: not which side was absolutely correct but which of the \nalternatives seemed, on balance, the best course to take. This was not \nan easy decision for me. However, I believe the balance did tip, \nalthough not overwhelmingly, in favor of passing this legislation \ngranting China normal trade relations status.\n  I would like to discuss briefly what the vote was really about and \nwhy I voted for PNTR.\n  We had a good deal of discussion over the past several days on the \ndetails and implications of this legislation and on the agreement \nbetween the United States and China regarding China joining the WTO. \nThere is no need for me to spend any time going over that again. It is \nimportant, though, to be clear on what the vote was really about.\n  The vote on PNTR was not about whether China is going to join the \nWTO; China will. Nothing Congress can say, one way or the other, will \nmake one bit of difference.\n  This vote on PNTR was really about whether the United States will \nbenefit from the WTO's trade rules and enforcement procedures which \nhold China accountable to negotiated trade agreements. If we did not \ngrant PNTR to China, other nations, our competitors, would be able to \ntake advantage of WTO trade rules and enforcement procedures but we \nwould not.\n  Why is that so? Because the WTO rules state that if we want the WTO \nto help us enforce fair trade rules, then we cannot treat one WTO \nmember differently from another. We have to provide China the same \ncontinuous normal trade status we provide other WTO members. We cannot \nsingle out China for an annual review of normal trade status and still \nhold China to WTO rules and enforcement.\n  So that is what this debate really boiled down to--whether we should \ncontinue our annual review of normal trade relations with China or \ngrant permanent normal trade relations; that is, would we gain more \nfrom a new trade relationship with China than we would lose by ending \nour annual review?\n  I firmly believe that the more we can do to bring China's behavior \nunder the rule of law, the better off we are, the better off the \nChinese people will be, and the better off the rest of the world will \nbe. That includes our ability to use the WTO to settle trade disputes \ninvolving China.\n  Now, to be sure, we have had frustrations in the WTO dispute \nsettlement\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\nprocess. It is far from perfect. But overall it is in our best \ninterests to have a multilateral means to settle trade disputes with \nChina according to the rule of law instead of trying to go it alone. \nThat approach clearly has not been effective.\n  U.S. trade negotiators did obtain substantial concessions from China \nin exchange for WTO membership. These concessions promise to lower \ntariffs, reduce trade barriers, and create new opportunities for \nselling U.S. goods and services in China. At the same time, the United \nStates does not have to provide any new access to our markets. So the \nagreement should benefit U.S. workers, farmers, businesses, and our \neconomy in general.\n  But let's be realistic. The November 1999 agreement is far from \noverwhelmingly. It only requires China to go part of the way toward \nreally opening up its borders and its markets. As my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Dorgan, has repeatedly pointed out, even under \nthe agreement, China's markets will be far less open than ours.\n  For example, according to the Congressional Research Service, the \naverage U.S. tariff on all goods coming into the United States from \nChina is 4.2 percent. That is the average U.S. tariff on all goods \ncoming from China to the United States --4.2 percent. But after this \nagreement goes into effect, China's average tariff on U.S. industrial \ngoods will be 9.4 percent, over twice as much. For agricultural \nproducts, China will only reduce its tariffs from an average of 22 \npercent to 17 percent. U.S. agricultural tariffs are only 6 percent on \naverage, one-third those of China.\n  Or take automobiles. The U.S. tariff on autos is 2.5 percent. Under \nthis agreement, China will have a 25-percent tariff on U.S. autos--10 \ntimes higher than ours.\n  I realize tariff rates are not the whole story and that China agreed \nto substantial opening of its markets. However, I am skeptical that our \nnegotiators obtained as much as they could have. The United States had \na lot of leverage in these negotiations. China needs our consent to \njoin the WTO. And China had a lot at stake. The United States is the \nworld's largest economy. We import nearly $100 billion from China. We \nrun over an $80 billion trade deficit with China.\n  They need access to our market. Our negotiators should have used our \nleverage and China's needs to get a better deal on the core trade \nissues and on other issues involving human rights, workers' rights, and \nthe environment. That our negotiators did not get better tariff \nreductions and better agreements on worker and human rights I believe \nis a deeply regrettable missed opportunity. I believe our negotiators \nwere simply in too much of a rush to get this deal done rather than \naddress those core issues.\n  In particular, let's be realistic about the benefits of PNTR for \nAmerican agriculture. Some of the rhetoric I have heard regarding \nagriculture is wildly optimistic. We have heard that U.S. farmers will \nsoon be feeding over a billion Chinese--a virtually unlimited market. \nThe truth is, these claims are overstated.\n  Farmers are ill served by the myth that China is a boon market just \nwaiting to buy up large quantities of farm commodities and food \nproducts. China is strongly determined to remain largely self-\nsufficient in food production, and it is adopting technology and \nfollowing policies to meet that objective.\n  For example, I visited a hog farm in China in 1981, and I visited one \nagain last month. In 1981, the hogs and their management did not even \ncompare to those here in America. The changes I saw this August were \ndramatic. The hogs I saw in August were every bit as lean as ours. \nTheir sows are having litters of 12 to 14 pigs. They are saving 90 \npercent of them. Their cost of production is low because wages are low. \nAnd the Government owns all the land.\n  I discussed the potential for agricultural trade with the Vice \nMinister of Agriculture and other Chinese officials. They made it clear \nthey do not expect to buy much corn or pork from the United States. In \nfact, they are planning to increase their exports of corn. They \nexported corn last year. But they did believe there would be somewhat \nof an increasing market in China for U.S. beef and citrus as well as \nsome pork organ meats and similar such products.\n  Certainly there will be opportunities for U.S. farmers and U.S. food \nand agribusiness companies, but, again, we have to be realistic.\n  While I strongly believe we should sell as much food to China as we \ncan, it is irresponsible to give farmers false hope that China is going \nto reverse the current depression in commodity prices or bail out the \nfailed Freedom to Farm policy. More than irresponsible, it is just \nplain wrong.\n  That isn't just my own opinion. In Doane's Agricultural Report in \nAugust, Dr. Robert Wisner, a professor of agriculture economics at Iowa \nState University, who spent 3\\1/2\\ weeks in China in June assessed the \nprospects for food and agricultural trade with China. He wrote:\n\n       For the longer term we can be cautiously optimistic about \n     U.S. soybean and soybean product exports to China. But \n     optimism about U.S. corn, wheat and livestock product exports \n     should be more tempered.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       While the jury is still out on the question Who will feed \n     China? the Chinese answer is, ``China will feed China!''\n\n  I will add, in fact, they already do.\n  I now want to discuss the importance of human rights in our \nconsideration of PNTR. As I see it, a key issue in PNTR is whether in \nrelinquishing our annual review, the U.S. will lose important leverage \nthat could be used to change China's behavior on human rights, workers \nrights, and child labor. Let us first be honest about this. China has a \nlong way to go on religious freedom, freedom of movement, freedom of \nexpression and association, political rights and the rights of workers. \nThe China section of the U.S. State Department's annual report on human \nrights for this year and for several years running are absolutely \nappalling. But I don't have to rely on that report. As I said, I \nvisited China last month.\n  True, the human rights situation in many parts of China is not as bad \nas when I first visited in 1981. I could see some improvements, \nespecially in the large cities. But the fact is, the state of human \nrights in China is still unacceptable. While in Hong Kong, we learned \nof a lawyer who was arrested and thrown in jail. His offense: He had \nset up a small table outside a factory to advise workers of their \nrights under Chinese law. To the best of my knowledge, he is still \nlanguishing in prison today.\n  There is also the case of the young man, Ngawang Choepel, who studied \nmusic in the U.S. at Middlebury College in Vermont. He was arrested by \nthe Chinese authorities several years ago while studying music in Tibet \nand charged with espionage and counterrevolutionary sedition. I was \ntold this young man was convicted of spying for the Dalai Lama. He was \nsentenced to 18 years in prison.\n  I responded to the Chinese that this was a ridiculous charge. But \neven if it were true, I asked them, how many tanks does the Dalai Lama \nhave; how many troops does he command; how many ships does he own? To \nme, this was a strong indication of the weak foundation upon which the \nChinese political system rests.\n  We also know that forced labor and prison labor still exist in China. \nI had been told by both Chinese and U.S. Government officials that \nthere are no serious child labor problems in China. But now, after \nmeeting with reputable worker and human rights organizations in Hong \nKong, I know there are certainly serious child labor problems inside \nChina. Estimates indicate China has from 10 to 40 million child \nlaborers. When we left Shanghai and went to Hong Kong, the very next \nday after we were told by both U.S. authorities and Chinese authorities \nthat child labor was not a very serious problem, this was the headline \nin the Sunday Morning Post, August 27, 2000, Hong Kong: ``Children Toil \nin Sweatshop.''\n\n  This was in an area north of Hong Kong, mainland China, where kids as \nyoung as 12 years old were working making toys. This is again a part of \nthe article: ``Childhood Lost to Hard Labor.''\n  Also from the article:\n\n       Lax age checks open door to underage workers at Shenzhen \n     factory producing toys for fast food chain.\n\n  They were producing toys for a company and that company was selling \nits toys to McDonald's. McDonald's gives these toys away, when you buy \na Happy Meal for your kids. It is the kids who are making the toys. Yet \nwe are\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\ntold that there are no serious child labor problems in China. Here was \nphotographic proof, reporting proof that only a few miles across the \nborder from Hong Kong, we had child laborers toiling to make these \ntoys, working 16 hours a day and more.\n  This is a quotation from the story:\n\n       The youngsters admit they lie about their ages to get jobs \n     in the factory, where workers estimate up to 20 percent of \n     the employees are under the legal age of 16. But they say \n     only rudimentary checks are done on their ID cards by the \n     factory to make sure they are old enough to work. Asia \n     Monitor Resource Centre, a labor monitoring body, said it was \n     common for people to use fake ID cards to get work. Child \n     labor is a common problem in China. It exists in rural small \n     farms and big factories run by transnational enterprises.\n\n  Again, we do have the problem of child labor and prison labor, forced \nlabor in China. So, clearly, there are serious human rights problems in \nChina that cannot be denied or swept under the rug. But they raise the \nquestions: What are the best ways to address those problems and to \nbring about real progress on human rights in China? And how should \nhuman rights considerations affect our decision on PNTR?\n  Before I go into these questions, I will take a moment to emphasize \nmy long and strong commitment to human rights. My record speaks for \nitself. I have been working on human rights issues since I first took \noffice in the House of Representatives 25 years ago and as a private \ncitizen before then. In fact, the first legislation I authored in the \nHouse in 1975 resulted in the enactment of section 116(d) prohibiting \nU.S. foreign assistance to the government of any country which engages \nin a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally \nrecognized human rights.\n  I have worked to end child labor and prison labor and religious \npersecution in the former Soviet Union, Haiti, Central America, Chile, \nEast Timor, India, and other nations. I have worked very hard to free \npolitical prisoners and to end political violence.\n  What have I learned from all these years? Frankly, I have learned \nthere is no standard cut-and-dried approach when it comes to advancing \nhuman rights. Of course, there are established minimum standards for \nhuman rights, as outlined in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights, \nwhich China has signed.\n  I am not talking about weakening those standards, never. But there is \nno set formula for achieving observance of the standards. We must \ntailor our methods to the particular situation and the particular \nsociety.\n  In the case of China, I am convinced that granting PNTR will not \nhinder our efforts to improve human rights there. I believe, in fact, \nit will actually help us in that endeavor.\n\n  Some have claimed that passing PNTR will cause us to lose our \nleverage on human rights. The simple fact is, we have never effectively \nused the annual trade status review to influence human rights in China, \nand it is highly unlikely we would do so in the future. Annual renewal \nof normal trade status has become almost perfunctory. Even in the wake \nof Tiananmen Square, President Bush renewed China's normal trade status \nand Congress did not reverse that decision.\n  As I said, I believe passing PNTR and creating a U.S.-China \nrelationship in the WTO should actually help to improve human rights in \nChina. How much? It is far too early to tell. However, based on my \nexamination of the issues and my experience in China, I concluded that \nthe best way to move China forward is to be engaged with China. And in \norder to be fully engaged with China, we had to grant PNTR.\n  The simple fact is, we cannot simply wall China off. When I visited \nthe Great Wall in China this summer, it reminded me how impossible such \nan effort would be. China could not be walled off centuries ago, and it \ncannot be walled off today.\n  Trade and economic ties alone, however, will never magically \ntransform China's human rights policies. But I can tell you, there is a \nbig crack in China's great wall against human rights reform. One day \nbefore long, that wall, too, will come down. Look at recent \ndevelopments in China. There has been a huge influx of new products and \nservices, but more importantly, the people of China are being exposed \nto new ideas and new influences regarding human rights, political \nrights, and religious freedom.\n  Now we have the Internet. I can say one thing I learned in China. The \nChinese Government may be able to censor TV and to censor the radio and \nthe newspapers, but no matter how hard they try, they will not be able \nto control or censor the Internet. Nearly every single person Senator \nLautenberg and I talked with in China told us that we should support \nPNTR. We even met with dissidents and human rights activists in Hong \nKong, people under no coercion from the Chinese Government, who had \nfled China, who can't even go back to China, who urged us to support \nPNTR. They said that anything that helps to open up China, that brings \nin people and ideas, is helpful.\n  Throughout my over 25 years in working on human rights, I have seen \nthat they are right. We must expose countries to the influence of the \nrest of the world if we want them to change their policy on human \nrights.\n  I noticed the editorial in the Washington Post this morning about the \n``Catholic `Criminals' in China.'' I am sure it has been printed in the \nRecord earlier today. It talked about an 81-year-old Catholic bishop \nwho had been thrown in jail--again. We didn't meet with this bishop. We \ntried, but we could not. We met with Bishop Aloysius Jin Luxian, the \nBishop of Shanghai, an 85-year-old Catholic bishop who spent 27 years \nof his life in Chinese prisons. He is a trained Jesuit. He has been to \nAmerica more than once, to Europe several times, and while he would not \npolitically comment on PNTR, he told us in no uncertain terms that \nexposure to the rest of the world would be a positive thing for \nreligious freedom in China.\n  I believe he is right. We must expose countries to the influence of \nthe rest of the world if we want them to change. I also think this is \ntrue of relations with Cuba. Our policy against Cuba, trying \nunilaterally to isolate it, has been counterproductive. If we want \nFidel Castro to change, we have to open the doors and let people trade \nand visit and move around freely. Our official policy is the best thing \nCastro has going for him.\n  So I conclude that PNTR will help move China toward a greater respect \nfor human rights because it will open them up to new ideas and \ninfluences.\n  Even though I concluded that China PNTR offers opportunities for \nbusinesses, workers, and the economy, many people--myself included--\nhave legitimate concerns about the impact of this bill on America's \nworking men and women. Many labor leaders were worried that passing \nPNTR would cause job shifts to China.\n  This is a legitimate concern. It is true that for a number of years \njobs have been shifting to countries--including China--that pay lower \nwages and tolerate poor working conditions, even abuses of worker \nrights. But I cannot see how denying China PNTR would have done \nanything to prevent jobs from moving to other countries. Some 20 years \nof annual reviews of China's trade status have done nothing to reverse \nthis trend. Again, as I said, PNTR will not make the United States any \nmore open than we have been in the past to imported products.\n  Instead of focusing so much just on the issue of extending PNTR to \nChina, we have to take a broader focus and chart a new, bold course to \ncounter the adverse effects of globalization.\n  We first need to look in our own back yard, examine our own laws--\nespecially tax laws--to see whether they discourage businesses from \nstaying and investing in American workers. We have to eliminate any tax \nprovisions that encourage companies to move jobs and production \noverseas.\n  We also should fully utilize U.S. laws that classify unfair labor \npractices as unfair trade practices, which, of course, they are. \nSection 301 of our trade law treats the systematic denial of \ninternationally recognized worker rights as an actionable, \nunreasonable, and unfair trade practice. No case has yet been brought \nunder this provision of section 301. So we do not know exactly how it \nmay apply. But it is time for the United States to enforce this law to \nthe maximum extent possible.\n  I am encouraged by the statements of Vice President Al Gore. I will \nquote from a statement he made at an APEC business summit in Malaysia:\n\n       And as we open the doors to global trade wider than ever \n     before, let us build a trading\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\n     system that lifts the fortunes of more and more people. Let \n     us include strong protections for workers, for health and \n     safety, for a clean environment. For at its heart, global \n     commerce is about strengthening our shared global values. It \n     is about building stronger families and stronger communities, \n     through strong and steady growth around the world.\n\n  On July 9 of last year, before the Washington Council on \nInternational Trade, Vice President Gore said:\n\n       We also must ensure that when it comes to trade, labor \n     rights and environmental protection are not second-class \n     issues any longer.\n\n  He has also said:\n\n       I will insist upon and use authority in those agreements to \n     enforce workers rights, human rights and environmental \n     protections. We need to make the global economy work for \n     all--and that means fighting to make sure that trade \n     agreements contain provisions that will protect the \n     environment and labor standards as well as open market in \n     other countries.\n       We need to use trade to up standards around the world and \n     not drag down standards here at home.\n\n  In future trade negotiations, future trade agreements, labor rights, \nhuman rights, and environmental protections must be an integral part of \nthose agreements.\n  There is no good reason why the WTO doesn't currently protect the \nrights of workers. Some will argue that labor rights are not trade \nrelated. I say nonsense. Intellectual property isn't directly related \nto trade, but the WTO has strong rules protecting intellectual \nproperty. Why should protecting intellectual property be any more \nimportant than protecting children against child labor or guaranteeing \nworkers the right to organize? I don't understand why the WTO protects \nCDs but not child workers.\n  The WTO protects the intellectual property because it is produced by \nhuman effort and it has value. If someone abuses intellectual property \nrights, that decreases or destroys the value of the intellectual \nproperty. That is why the WTO protects it.\n  But what about workers? Work is also produced by human effort and it \nhas value. But let's say an American worker loses a job because that \njob has been shifted to a country where worker protections don't exist, \nwages are a few cents an hour, and there is rampant forced labor and \nchild labor. Hasn't the value of that worker's labor been lessened or \ndestroyed in the exactly same way as intellectual property is devalued \nwhen it is abused? What is the difference between stealing the products \nof someone's creativity and stealing the fruits of someone's labor? \nThere is none.\n  Globalization is the face of the 21st century. We must keep up the \npressure to include enforceable labor rights in future trade agreements \nand particularly in new WTO rules. As the world's leading \nindustrialized Nation, the United States has the responsibility, the \nauthority, and the influence to lead this effort.\n  Again, I firmly believe we need a strong course of action to help \nAmerican workers in the face of globalization. However, that was not \nwhat this bill was about. This bill was just about PNTR for China. It \ndoesn't remove any protections for American workers or further open the \nUnited States to imports. And it should, as far as I can tell, provide \nsome new economic opportunities for American workers.\n  So, on balance, I believe that passing this bill was the right choice \nfor the United States and China. But no one should be under the \nillusion that PNTR and China's joining the WTO will automatically open \nup China's markets or its society. In a sense, passing PNTR is just the \nbeginning of a long, hard journey for the United States.\n  Our work to bring China into the WTO and to pass PNTR won't amount to \na hill of beans if China is not held to its commitments. We simply \ncannot afford to drop the ball by failing to stand up and vigorously \nenforce WTO rules and the agreements China has made. Joining the WTO is \nalso the beginning of a long, hard journey for China.\n  We must never let up in the fight to include enforceable labor rights \nand environmental protections in future trade agreements. And in the \nface of rapid globalization, it is critical that we reform U.S. labor \nand tax laws so America's working men and women don't have the deck \nstacked against them.\n  As I said, trade alone is not enough to improve human rights in China \nor elsewhere. Just last month, I stood in Tiananmen Square, and right \noff of there is a big McDonald's, a symbol of Western economic \ninfluence in China. However, right near the McDonald's on Tiananmen \nSquare, members of the Falun Gong gather each morning to do their \nexercises and meditation. They are not disturbing the peace, being \nviolent; they are simply meditating and doing their exercises right in \nthe shadow of McDonald's. Like clockwork, every morning, the police \ncome by and arrest them. So adding more McDonald's restaurants and \nensuring freer trade doesn't mean China will suddenly respect \nindividual rights.\n  We have to keep up the fight for human rights--and that includes the \nrights of workers--using all the tools available to us.\n  When Senator Lautenberg and I were in China last month we raised the \nissue of prison labor at every level. We hammered away at that issue, \nand repeatedly asked to visit and inspect a prison labor facility. At \nfirst we ran into a brick wall, but eventually we had a breakthrough. \nChinese officers still refused to allow us to visit a prison labor site \nourselves, but they agreed to renew their compliance with the 1992 and \n1994 agreements against sending products of prison labor to the United \nStates. In fact, we got that assurance from Premier Zhu Rongji himself.\n  I am pleased to report that just a week and a half ago, U.S. Customs \nagents were able to visit a prison labor site in China.\n  We must also expect and demand that United States companies that do \nbusiness in China respect human rights and the rights of workers.\n  If I may refer back to this article with the children in the \nsweatshop making toys to supply MacDonald's, when I got back to \nWashington, I immediately arranged to meet with MacDonald's executives \nin my office. They were quick to tell me that they first learned of \nthis child labor scandal when they read about it in the papers, and \nthat the child laborers were not employed by McDonald's, but by a \nsubcontractor of a toy vendor. In fact, McDonald's has a voluntary code \nof conduct and zero tolerance policy prohibiting child labor and \nsubstandard employment practices. McDonald's has since cut off ties \nwith that toy vendor and is responding to this child labor problem. All \nof this underscores the urgent need to rewrite our trade agreements so \nthat exploitative child labor and other abuses of the rights of workers \nare considered unfair trade practices and a basis for trade enforcement \naction in the WTO.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I voted for China PNTR, with the full \nrealization that a tremendous amount of work still remains unfinished. \nThat's why, having cast this vote, we must make a commitment to \nredouble our efforts to include workers' rights and environmental \nprotections in future trade agreements, and strengthen our own laws and \ntax code to encourage greater investment in our American workers, and \nin education and job training.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, though we are in disagreement, I thank \nmy colleague from Iowa for his fine words on the floor of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8730-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8730-S8731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT AMENDMENTS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 4516), and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk reads as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill H.R. \n     4516 making appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 27, 2000.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the floor \nsituation right now? Is the floor open?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the conference \nreport on H.R. 4516 under a time agreement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further parliamentary inquiry: What is the time? I am \nsorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa does not have time under \nthe agreement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The managers have 2 hours equally divided. \nSenator McCain has 1 hour; Senator Thomas has 1 hour; Senator Kennedy \nhas 30 minutes; Senator Wellstone has 30 minutes; Senator Dorgan has 30 \nminutes; and Senator Campbell has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, I still want to understand the \nparliamentary situation confronting the Senate right now. We are on the \nconference report on Treasury-Postal appropriations and legislative \nbranch appropriations; is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There has been a unanimous consent entered into that set \na time limit on this bill and the number of speakers, and their time is \nalso set.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a second? If \nthe Senator needs time, I will give some of my time to the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Again, to clarify the situation, I understand that we are now engaged \nin 6 hours that will lead ultimately to a vote on the conference report \non the legislative branch appropriations bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand that I have 1 hour under my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I hope that hour will not be necessary. I am prepared to \ndeal with it. I am prepared to stay on the floor during the hours that \nare allocated to other Members of this body. But I hope we can move \nthis more rapidly than the 6 hours.\n  This is my fourth year as chairman of the Legislative Branch \nSubcommittee and the second year that I have had the privilege of \nserving with Senator Feinstein as the ranking member.\n  I want to begin this report by thanking Senator Feinstein for her \nassistance in working on the conference report in the House. She, as \nyou know, Mr. President, is a former mayor. That experience gives her a \nunique insight into some of the issues that we face in this \nsubcommittee. So I pay tribute to her and to her staff and to the \nprofessional way in which she has handled her responsibilities.\n  In our final session of the conference, the question was raised by \nMr. Obey in the other body as to whether or not there would be \nadditional legislation added to the conference report. I told him at \nthe time that I knew of no such plan or program. I spoke accurately at \nthe time. However, as things often happen around here, changes did \noccur under the sponsorship of the leadership of both Houses. As a \nconsequence, the conference report is somewhat expanded from that which \nwas negotiated.\n  Division A of H.R. 4516 contains the conference agreement for the \nlegislative branch appropriations for fiscal year 2001, and additional \nfunding for the credit subsidy which supports the FHA multi-family \nhousing insurance programs. Provision B contains the conference \nagreement for the Treasury-general government appropriations and repeal \nof the excise tax on telephones.\n\n  This bill has attracted attention, and the allocation of time that \nhas been set up around this bill is demonstrated by the time under the \ncontrol of Senators who have nothing to do with the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Legislative Branch and who presumably will talk about \nother issues than those that are directly connected with the \nlegislative branch appropriations.\n  I will limit my comments to the conference agreement on the \nlegislative branch and defer to the other subcommittee chairmen and \nother Senators who will address the funding that is contained in this \nbill under their jurisdiction.\n  This conference agreement appropriates $2.53 billion for fiscal year \n2001, which is approximately a 1.6-percent increase over the funding \nfor the fiscal year 2000 level, including the supplemental funding.\n  Both Senator Feinstein and I are proud of the fact that we have kept \nthe increase at such a low level, as we have tried to be as responsible \nas possible in allocating funds for the legislative branch.\n  We spent a great deal of time going over the accounts and the \nincreases that agencies have had over the last 4 years to find where we \ncould best and most fairly cut or hold down expenditures without \nimpacting employees.\n  Our goal was to ensure that funding would be provided for all current \nlegislative branch employees. We have met that goal. No RIFs, or \nreductions in force, will be required under this agreement.\n  Another priority was to make sure that adequate funding is provided \nfor\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nmaintenance projects, particularly the projects that involve health and \nsafety issues. I have long since learned in my business career that one \nof the quickest ways to temporarily show an increase on the bottom line \nis to cut back on maintenance. One of the surest ways to guarantee that \nyou will get into trouble long term is to cut back on maintenance. We \nhave tried to make sure that we didn't make that mistake here in our \ndesire to hold down the total amount that was being spent.\n  We have also spent a great deal of time talking about security. We \nmade sure that the resources were made available to the men and women \nwho protect the Capitol, its visitors, and Members and staff.\n  I think we have accomplished all of our goals within the current \nfunding restraints. The conference agreement on the legislative branch \nis a good agreement. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Before I yield so that Senator Feinstein can make her comments, I \nwould like to thank the staff for their hard work: Christine Ciccone, \nwho acts as the majority clerk; Chip Yost, my legislative director; Jim \nEnglish, who represents the Democratic staff director; Edie Stanley \nwith the Appropriations Committee; and Chris Kerig from Senator \nFeinstein's office, all of whom have performed yeomen service, staying \nup late nights and coming in the early morning to make sure those who \nget the spotlight on the television look better than perhaps we really \nare. I pay them that tribute and extend to them my personal thanks for \nall the work they have done.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I acknowledge the comments made by the \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch and \nindicate my agreement with them. I also thank the staff people he has \nduly mentioned, and I want to speak particularly to the funding of the \nlegislative branch.\n  It is my understanding on our side of the aisle that there is deep \nconcern about the addition of the Treasury-Postal bill on this bill, \nlargely because it contains a measure which would use 25 percent of the \nnon-Social Security surplus. I will leave that to others to discuss.\n  Senator Bennett and I worked in a bipartisan way on the fiscal year \n2001 legislative branch appropriations bill. I believe it is a very \ngood bill. It addresses the critical areas of concern for the \nlegislative branch and is in the best interests of those whom we serve. \nWe worked very hard to ensure that each agency within our legislative \nbranch was treated fairly, and even though we were not able to fully \nfund every agency's request, we made every effort to distribute the \nscarce resources as fairly as possible. In some cases, we were able to \nmake modest increases above last year's level.\n  I particularly note that the $97.1 million which we are providing for \nthe Capitol Police will fund 1,481 full-time equivalents, a level which \nconferees believe will enable the appropriate staffing at building \nentrances to ensure the security of our Capitol campus.\n  Additionally, in order to address some very critical needs, the \nconference agreement provides to the Capitol Police $2.1 million in \nfiscal year 2000 emergency supplemental funds for security \nenhancements, and provides the Architect of the Capitol $9 million in \nfiscal year 2000 emergency supplemental funds to move forward with a \nnumber of urgent building repairs.\n\n  This is my second year as ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Legislative Branch, working alongside our dedicated and \ndistinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator Bennett. Senator Bennett \nis always very open and willing to discuss the various issues that \narise in relation to this bill. He has been very accommodating to my \nconcerns as well as to the concerns of other Members of the Senate. I \nknow that firsthand. In fact, he never ceases to amaze me with his \nextensive knowledge of the various departments and agencies under the \nlegislative branch--not only their basic structure and the function of \nthose agencies but their legislative histories as well. It has been a \ngreat pleasure for me to work with Senator Bennett on this bill.\n  I urge the adoption of the conference agreement.\n  I yield some time, with the approval of Senator Bennett, to Senator \nHarkin.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. With Senator Harkin not currently on the floor, Senator \nBond desires a few moments. Could we ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBond be allowed to proceed with Senator Harkin to follow?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield to Senator Bond.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask my colleague whether, in the proper order, \nI could then follow Senator Harkin, or after you two are done?\n  Mr. BENNETT. If you have the time, fine\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have my own time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is correct, the Senator from Minnesota has his own \ntime. We have no objection to his using the time in that sequence.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Bond such time as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I extend my deepest thanks and appreciation \nto the floor managers of the bill, the chairman and the ranking member.\n  I take the floor today because there is an issue that has been in and \nout of this body and is currently in conference negotiations. It is \nalso going to be the highlight of the news probably tomorrow. I \nunderstand the Vice President is scheduled to talk about the HUB Zone \nProgram. This is a program that I authored in the Committee on Small \nBusiness and this body unanimously accepted 3 years ago. I am concerned \nabout it because HUB zones are another example of this administration's \nrecord of squandered opportunities.\n  To begin at the beginning, in 1997, the Committee on Small Business \nreported out legislation to create the HUB Zone Program--historically \nUnderutilized Business Zones. This program seeks to use Federal \ncontracting, Federal purchasing, to generate business opportunities and \njobs in the areas of high poverty and high unemployment across the \nNation.\n  We created incentives to get small businesses to locate and bring \njobs to the distressed areas, areas that usually would not be \nconsidered good places to locate in general business judgment. These \ndistressed areas lacked established customer bases, trained workforces. \nThey have been out of the economic mainstream. But the HUB Zone Program \nwas designed to bring small businesses into the area.\n  I came up with this idea after talking with a friend who headed up \nthe JOBS Program in Kansas City. I asked him about bringing more job \ntraining programs to the inner city. He said: Stop sending us job \ntraining programs; we have trained people and retrained and retrained. \nHe said: Send us some jobs. I thought: there's a good idea.\n  So we set up a program that was designed to reward small businesses \nlocated in areas of high unemployment. Unfortunately, when we proposed \nthat idea, immediately the Clinton-Gore administration declared its \nopposition. I have a letter from the Administrator of the SBA, \nenclosing a statement of administrative policy:\n\n       . . . the administration remains concerned and opposed to . \n     . . provisions relating to HUB Zones.\n\n  The administration raised a red herring that has dogged the program \never since. The alleged concern was that HUB Zones would somehow harm \nthe 8(a) Minority Business Development Program.\n  I ask unanimous consent the statement of administration policy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Small Business Administration,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1997.\n     Hon. John J. LaFalce,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman LaFalce: The Administration supports \n     reauthorization of the programs of the Small Business \n     Administration and supports House passage of S. 1139. The \n     bill reauthorizes small business loans\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\n     which assist tens of thousands of small businesses each year \n     and contributes to the vitality of our economy. This bill \n     recognizes the importance of women and service disabled \n     veteran entrepreneurs and makes permanent SBA's microloan \n     program which helps those entrepreneurs who need small \n     amounts of credit. While we are not in total agreement on all \n     its provisions, we need this legislation to ensure that we \n     can continue to properly serve our small business customers.\n       The Administration appreciates the improvement made in the \n     version of the bill recently passed by the Senate which \n     maintains the current preference for businesses participating \n     in the 8(a) Business Development Program.\n       For the reasons stated in the attached Statements of \n     Administration Policy, the Administration remains concerned \n     about and opposed to S. 1139's provisions relating to HUB \n     Zones, contract bundling, and the extension of the Small \n     Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The \n     Administration notes that the contract bundling provision is \n     less burdensome than previous versions. Should this \n     legislation be enacted, we will continue to work with the \n     Congress to modify these provisions.\n       The Administration appreciates the opportunity to comment \n     on the bill, and thanks the House and Senate Small Business \n     Committees and their staff for working with us on this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Aida Alvarez,\n                                                    Administrator.\n       Enclosure.\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 1997.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       The Administration strongly supports reauthorization of the \n     programs of the Small Business Administration and supports \n     Senate passage of S. 1139, with the changes described below. \n     The bill reauthorizes small business loan programs which \n     assist tens of thousands of small businesses each year and \n     contribute to the overall vitality of our economy. The \n     Administration also supports the increase in the government-\n     wide small business participation goal in federal contracting \n     from 20 to 23 percent, following a phase-in period and in \n     conjunction with the elimination of the Small Business \n     Competitiveness Demonstration Program.\n       However, the Administration strongly opposes the bill's \n     changes to current law on ``contract bundling,'' as well as \n     extension of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration \n     Program and creation of the ``HUD Zone'' program. The \n     Administration will seek amendments to address these and \n     other concerns as addressed below.\n       Contract Bundling. The Administration is committed to \n     maintaining a strong role for small businesses in Federal \n     contracting, but is concerned that the proposed changes to \n     the current law contract bundling provisions could deny \n     taxpayers the cost savings and improved quality achievable by \n     appropriate consolidation of Federal contract requirements. \n     Therefore, the Administration urges the Senate to maintain \n     current law, which provides sufficient authority and \n     flexibility for the Administration to protect the important \n     interests of small businesses.\n       Small business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The \n     Administration strongly opposes any extension of the Small \n     Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. Small \n     businesses will substantially benefit from discontinuing this \n     program and lifting the unnecessary paperwork and reporting \n     burdens it imposes. Moreover, the Administration believes \n     that if this demonstration program is not allowed to \n     terminate the scheduled, S. 1139's small business \n     participation goal will be extremely difficult to achieve.\n       HUB Zones. The Administration strongly supports new efforts \n     to promote economic development in the Nation's distressed \n     urban and rural communities. The bill's HUB Zones provision, \n     however, could weaken one of the strongest tools for \n     achieving this objective by according the proposed program a \n     contracting priority equal to that of the 8(a) program.\n       The Administration has already proposed regulations and is \n     ready to begin pilots for the Empowerment Contracting Program \n     (ECP), a new contracting program targeted at distressed \n     communities. The Administration believes that these tests \n     should be permitted to proceed, and that they will \n     demonstrate the ECP's ability to accomplish the goals of the \n     HUD Zones provisions at less expense and without affecting \n     the 8(a) program.\n     Other administration concerns\n       The Administration will also seek amendments to:\n       Remove proposed restrictions on the SBA's ability to use \n     Women's Business Center funding to finance the costs of \n     administering the program. Removal of these restrictions is \n     important to ensuring the effective execution of this \n     program.\n       Maintain the ability of Small Business Development Center \n     (SBDCs) to charge appropriate fees for counseling services \n     provided under the program.\n       Authorize sufficient microloan technical assistance funding \n     to support the projected growth in this program.\n       Reauthorize the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) \n     Program for three years, rather than six. The three-year \n     authorization proposed by the Administration is consistent \n     with the authorization period for the companion Small \n     Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, and provides a \n     reasonable period for both achieving and evaluating program \n     results.\n       Delete the proposed pilot program targeting technical \n     assistance to certain States. This provision would divert \n     scarce resources needed to administer the STTR and SBIR \n     programs.\n     Pay-as-you-go scoring\n       S. 1139 would increase direct spending; therefore it is \n     subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring \n     estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. \n     Final scoring of this legislation may differ from these \n     estimates.\n\n\n                        Pay-as-you-go estimates\n\n                        [In million of dollars]\n\nOutlays\n    1998..............................................................1\n    1999..............................................................1\n    2000..............................................................1\n    2001..............................................................1\n    2002..............................................................1\n    1998-2002.........................................................5\n  Mr. BOND. The truth is, the 8(a) program has no reason to fear the \nHUB Zone Program. In fact, they should be able to work nicely together. \nThe 8(a) program helps to seek minority programs own a greater stake in \nthe economy by focusing on ownership and development of small business.\n  The HUB Zone Program, on the other hand, focuses on developing jobs \nand opportunities in distressed areas, many of them still minority \ncommunities. One brings jobs; the other brings ownership. The two \nprograms are two prongs of the same fork. HUB Zones in 8(a) should not \nfight with each other but focus on the common threads, such as contract \nbundling that hurt them and all other small businesses alike.\n  Yesterday, I was pleased to receive a letter from my friends at the \nNational Black Chamber of Commerce in which they recognized how these \ntwo programs must work together. Harry Alford, Chamber president and \nCEO wrote:\n\n       To date, the Small Business Administration and other \n     agencies have not aggressively pursued the utilization of \n     this valuable vehicle--\n\n  Referring to HUB Zones.\n\n       There is a false perception that it is here to replace the \n     8a program. The author has been guilty of that same fear. In \n     further research and reflection, it appears that the anxiety \n     is unjustified. 8a is in the suburbs and nothing is in the \n     inner city. It will be the HUB Zone activity that will spur a \n     renaissance where economic activity is lacking. We must \n     support the HUB zones.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter from Mr. Alford be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    National Black\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 2000.\n     Re 8a and HUB zone programs\n     Hon. Kit S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Senate Small Business Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Small Business Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. James Talent,\n     Chairman, House Small Business Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nydia Velazquez,\n     Ranking Member, House Small Business Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Leaders of the Small Business Committees: The 8a \n     program throughout the years has been a successful program. \n     It has yet to reach maximum levels of utilization but there \n     are few successful Black owned businesses today that have not \n     gone through the 8a program during their developmental years.\n       However, there is something the 8a program has been unable \n     to address and that is turning around the economic plight of \n     our distressed inner cities and underdeveloped rural \n     communities. The vast majority of 8a firms are in suburban \n     and developed neighborhoods. Their employees usually do not \n     come from distressed or underdeveloped communities. The 8a \n     program serves a particular need and should continue in its \n     present form. What is needed is a better spread of activity. \n     That is, most companies certified as 8a do not get contracts \n     from the program. According to the latest GAO report, in 1998 \n     over 50% of 8a contracts went to 209 firms, which is only \n     3.5% of the 6000 firms in the program. This needs to be \n     improved.\n       In addition to keeping the 8a program intact, we must look \n     at rejuvenating our inner cities and depressed rural \n     communities. The key to that quest is the HUB Zone program. \n     The HUB Zone legislation is valuable to the economic future \n     of our targeted communities.\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\n       To date, the Small Business Administration and other \n     agencies have not aggressively pursued the utilization of \n     this valuable vehicle. There is a false perception that it is \n     here to replace the 8a program. This author has been guilty \n     of that same fear. In further research and reflection, it \n     appears that the anxiety is unjustified. 8a is in the suburbs \n     and nothing is in the inner city. It will be the HUB Zone \n     activity that will spur a renaissance where economic activity \n     is lacking. We must support the HUB Zones!\n       Therefore, the National Black Chamber of Commerce will \n     begin a ``roll out'' marketing the HUB Zone program to \n     municipalities throughout the nation. We will identify HUB \n     Zones in these communities and certify HUB Zone companies and \n     recruit companies to relocate in these zones. The HUB Zone \n     program will rise through our infrastructure of 180 \n     affiliated chapters located in 37 states. If the federal \n     government will not hold sufficient workshops and properly \n     market the program, we will. It is too important to hold on a \n     shelf or at bay fearing it will cannibalize the 8a program. \n     The two have different roles.\n       To ensure either program will not adversely affect the \n     other, we propose the following. There should be a bi-annual \n     report from the Federal Procurement Data Center (GSA) that \n     will review the trends in contracting in both the HUB Zone \n     and 8a companies. This review should test the prospect of HUB \n     Zone contracts growing at a cost to 8a companies. If any such \n     trend exists, the Small Business Committees must implement \n     immediate redress. The first review can be due June 30, 2001.\n       We believe the above can be a win-win for both \n     philosophies. We ask your consideration and hope the SBA \n     reauthorization will be resolved in the near future. I will \n     be happy to entertain any queries or participate in any \n     meetings with your staffs. For the sake of small business, it \n     is time to aggressively move on.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harry C. Alford,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. BONDS. Mr. President, we resolved the issue of how 8(a) and HUB \nzones would interact in 1997, by directing that the programs should not \ncompete with each other for contracts. We placed responsibility on the \ncontracting officers to monitor both programs, and to have discretion \nto divert contracts to whichever program might be falling behind at a \ngiven moment. That way both programs can succeed.\n  We incorporated language to that end in our legislation, and included \nclarifying language in our committee report. The other body agreed to \nour revised language, and the President signed the HUB Zone Act into \nlaw on December 2, 1997. Everyone involved agreed to the final \nresolution of this matter.\n  Subsequently, the Clinton/Gore administration decided that the \nprogram they opposed was not so bad after all. In April of 1998, the \nWhite House put out a press release in which the Vice President \nannounced an exciting new program, the HUB zone program, that would \nlikely create 25,000 new jobs. To judge from their press release, the \nHUB Zone Act was a Presidential initiative that ``built upon'' a \nPresidential Executive order. Apparently no legislation was involved, \nwhich was news to those of us who developed it, worked hard, and passed \nit.\n  The Vice President in his statement, however, overlooked one key \nfact, which was that HUB zone small businesses would have to wait \nnearly a full year before the program would start operating. It was not \nuntil late March of 1999 that SBA finally got the program off the \nground and started taking applications. Even that occurred only after \nan exchange of several letters between my committee and the SBA \nAdministrator. When we scheduled a hearing on SBA's budget request, SBA \napparently decided they had better be ready to announce the program, so \nthe Administrator came to the hearing ready to make that announcement.\n  That was exciting, but then more delay occurred. It took yet another \nyear for SBA to process and approve 1,000 applications from HUB zone \nbusinesses. This is not nearly enough to meet the program's needs.\n  The HUB zone program called for 1 percent of Federal contracts to be \nawarded to HUB zone firms in 1999, rising to 1.5 percent in 2000. One \nthousand firms is not nearly enough to provide two to three billion \ndollars in contracting. It just isn't enough.\n  Without enough certified companies, the HUB zone program is doomed to \nfailure. This fact did not go unnoticed by the contracting officers who \nneed to award the contracts, who cited the lack of certified companies \nas an excuse not to do much work on the program.\n  We were puzzled by this failure. After a series of letters and \nmeetings, it appears at least two factors were involved. First, the SBA \nchopped 10 percent of the HUB zone budget out of the program, and \ndiverted it to other SBA activities. SBA cited the need to pay for \nincidental costs that HUB zone program implementation imposed on other \noffices at the agency, but the ten percent whack continued even after \nthe program was finally up-and-running.\n  Second, it became apparent that a regulatory provision was keeping \nsmall businesses from becoming qualified. In an attempt to have the HUB \nzone program work effectively with other SBA programs, SBA included a \nrequirement that HUB zone firms be affiliated only with firms that are \neligible for those SBA contracting programs.\n  This provision was probably well-intended. But it became apparent \nthat this was preventing firms from participating. An otherwise-\nqualified firm that was affiliated with a holding company to manage its \nreal estate (like its headquarters building) would be disqualified if \nthat holding company was not eligible for other SBA programs. Those \nholding companies are typically an administrative or tax convenience, \nso they had never intended to participate in SBA programs, so their \npresence disqualified the firm.\n  SBA informed us that they were concerned about the unintended effects \nof this provision. In February of this year, they sought my committee's \nguidance on whether they sought do away with this unduly restrictive \naffiliation rule. On February 16th, I wrote Administrator Alvarez to \nsay that I agreed with that proposed change, and she wrote back on \nFebruary 25th to say she agreed and that SBA would do away with the \nrestriction.\n  It is now seven months later, and the regulations to implement the \nchange we agreed to have not been published. Another seven months of \ndelay and frustration. As Everett McKinley Dirksen once said, a year \nhere and a year there--pretty soon you're talking about real \nobstructionism.\n  This program is designed to get jobs to people in areas where they \nneed work, the people moving off welfare, the people at the bottom \neconomic rung. I would be delighted if the Vice President backed up his \nrhetoric when he talks about HUB zones by doing something about it. \nThey opposed it from the beginning. They claimed credit for it. They \nhave taken away the budget for it. They have imposed regulatory \nroadblocks. They have not implemented it.\n  They have had their chance and they have not led. We are going to \ncontinue to work with the SBA Administrator. We need SBA to get the \nrevised regulations out, to get the certification process moving. It \ncould have been an island of excellence in the sea of neglect in the \nClinton-Gore administration.\n  When the Vice President goes out tomorrow to claim credit for the \nprogram and talk about it, perhaps somebody will ask him why 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, almost 3 years after the program was passed, how come it is \nstill weighted down in a bureaucratic maze? I think it is a good \nprogram. I think it is a good concept. My colleagues in this body on a \nbipartisan basis unanimously agreed to it. This is a chance for the \nadministration to stop talking and do something.\n  I am from Missouri. Frothy eloquence neither satisfies nor convinces \nme. I want to be shown. I hope, for a change, we will see some \nsignificant action, rather than just talk, out of the administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, a slight change has been worked out in \nthe order of speeches. I now yield to the Senator from Colorado, who \nwill address the Treasury-Postal portion of this bill. That has been \ndone with the understanding and approval of the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank the manager, my friend from \nUtah. I would like to review the Treasury and general government \nsection, which was added to the legislative branch bill in conference.\n  I am going to repeat a few numbers. They are rather dry, but they are \nimportant numbers for my colleagues.\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\nNeedless to say, I think this is an important section and hope they \nsupport it. Budget constraints made it impossible for the committee to \nfund all requests made by the administration and by our colleagues in \nthe Senate, too, but we tried to accommodate all of the requests as far \nas we could.\n  I think, as does my ranking minority member, Senator Dorgan, we would \nprobably have preferred to bring this bill to the floor as a free-\nstanding bill, but time constraints prevented us from doing that. But I \nbelieve it is still a good bill. Let me go over some of the numbers.\n  Mr. President, the Treasury and general government portion of this \nconference report contains a total of $30,371,000 in new budget \nauthority. Of that, $14,679,607,000 is for mandatory programs over \nwhich the Appropriations Committee has no control.\n  This conference report strikes a portion between congressional \npriorities, administration initiatives, and agency requirements. \nPreparation of the Senate committee-reported bill would not have been \npossible without the hard work and cooperation of the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, Senator Dorgan, and his staff.\n  As we consider the Treasury and general government portion of the \nlegislative branch conference report, I would like to highlight some of \nthe provisions before us:\n  We emphasize on the need for the Gang Resistance Education and \nTraining Program--called GREAT--by including $3 million more than the \nadministration request for grants to State and local law enforcement.\n  We provided a total of $93,751,000 for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms to enforce existing gun laws. This includes:\n  $19,078,000 to fully staff and expand the Youth Crime Gun \nInterdiction Initiative, bringing the total to 50 cities. This program \nallows ATF to track and prosecute those who supply guns to our youth.\n  Also, $23,361,000 for expanded ballistics imaging technology, and \n$41,322,000 to significantly expand the Integrated Violence Reduction \nStrategy to support criminal enforcement initiatives such as Project \nExile and Project Ceasefire to combat violent crime.\n  We have also included $13,700,000 for the Southwest Border Customs \nstaffing initiative, $130 million for the Customs automation effort, \ncalled ACE, and $2,572,000 more to combat importation of items produced \nby forced child labor.\n  Speaking of youngsters, Mr. President, I am pleased to note that we \nhave been able to fund the ONDCP anti-drug youth media campaign at $185 \nmillion.\n  We have spent over half a billion dollars in this program in the last \nseveral years.\n  Title II of this section provides $96,093,000 for the U.S. Postal \nService and continues to require free mailing for overseas voters as \nwell as for the blind, as well as a 6-day delivery and prohibit the \nclosing or consolidation of small and rural post offices.\n  Title III contains a total of $691,315,000 for the Executive Office \nof the President. This includes the Office of Management and Budget, \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Federal drug control \nprograms, and the funding for the media campaign to which I alluded.\n  There is $29,053,000 for the Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center \nfor their program to transfer technology to State and local law \nenforcement agencies. This is an ongoing program and has been a huge \nbenefit to both State and local law enforcement groups.\n  There is $206 million for the High Intensity Drug Traffickers Area \nProgram, called the HIDTA Program. This is an existing program, and the \nfunding is continued in this bill under the current level. HIDTA \nPrograms coordinate local, State, and Federal antidrug efforts. It has \nmet with a great deal of approval with local and State law enforcement. \nAs a matter of fact, many Senators requested expansion of this program, \nbut we had to live within our budget constraints.\n  Title IV is independent agencies, such as the Federal Elections \nCommission, the General Services Administration, the National Archives, \nas well as agencies involved in Federal employment issues, such as the \nFederal Labor Relations Authority, the Merit Systems Protection Board, \nthe Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Special Counsel, and the \nOffice of Personnel Management.\n  Also included in this title are mandatory accounts to provide for \nFederal retiree annuities, health benefits, and life insurance. The \nconferees have provided a total of $15,986,378,000 for this title in \nfiscal year 2001.\n  For the first time in 4 years, the administration has requested \nfunding for courthouse construction. Although we have not been able to \nfund the entire list due to limited resources, we have included funding \nfor four courthouse projects in fiscal year 2001, as well as an \nadditional four projects in fiscal year 2002.\n  Again, I thank the ranking member of our subcommittee, Senator \nDorgan, for his hard work and support. Certainly this bill would not \nhave been possible without his assistance. Too often we forget the hard \nwork of staff--for Senator Dorgan, Chip Walgren and Steve Monteiro; for \nthe majority, Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards--who deserve \na great deal of credit for the long hours, nights, and sometimes \nweekends spent in trying to put this section of the bill together. I \nbelieve this conference report deserves the support of the Senate.\n  One last thing, Mr. President. We are still obviously in a state of \nshock and loss at the death of our colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell, \nwho was a tireless worker in trying to reduce youth violence and drug \nuse. His life was a model of what youngsters should aspire to. In his \nhonor, we have named the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's \nnewest dormitory building at Glynco, GA, for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Campbell, in bringing this hybrid bill to the Senate \nfloor. The process by which we have arrived here today is one which I \nhope we will not replicate on other appropriations bills for the \nremainder of the year. I will not belabor the point about the process. \nIt is unfortunate that the Senate was unable to enact its will on this \nlegislation when it initially was reported out of the full \nAppropriations Committee on July 20. This is not a reflection on the \nchairman--he produced a bill in a short period of time acting on the \ninstructions he was given. I cannot fault him for this. In fact, I \ncongratulate him for many of the good decisions which were made on the \nsubstance of this legislation, but the fact remains that the Senate was \nnot well-served by this process.\n  The conference report before us today provides $15.6 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority for high priority law enforcement, trade \nenforcement and good government programs. It is approximately $1.1 \nbillion above the level of funding approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee in July. It is also $1.9 billion above last year's enacted \nlevel. Yet is remains $900 million below the President's request. This \nis one of the main problems with the underlying bill. While funds were \nadded for a number of administration priorities, the bill remains \ndeficient in a few areas, primarily regarding IRS staffing and counter-\nterrorism programs. I have received assurances that additional funds \nwill be provided for a number of these deficiencies in later \nappropriations bills. Former President Reagan used to say, ``Trust, but \nverify.'' I trust my colleagues and look forward to verifying that \nadditional funds will be found.\n  In many ways, however, this conference report is a good bill. \nCompared to the bill that was reported out of the Appropriations \nCommittee, many of the problems with that bill have been resolved. \nObjectionable language regarding guns has been removed. Many agencies \nare fully funded at the requested level. The Customs Service's computer \nmodernization program is well funded at $130 million. A good first step \nhas been made to reduce the court house construction backlog.\n  This bill represents a responsible and balanced piece of legislation. \nI want to note that it has been a pleasure working with Senator \nCampbell on this legislation. He and his staff have been professional \nand diligent in representing our interests and assisting us in \nformulating this legislation. I also want to take this opportunity to \nthank his staff, Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin,\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nand Lula Edwards for their hard work and cooperation in crafting this \nbill. I also wish to note the work of my staff, Chip Walgren, Steve \nMonteiro, and Nicole Kroetsch, on this legislation.\n  As the chairman noted, this bill funds base operations for the \nTreasury Department, its agencies and other general government \noperations. It maintains current operating levels in most instances and \nannualizes the costs of FTE, full time equivalent, increases made in \nlast year's bill. It is designed to limit, as best we can, undue \nimpacts on personnel. We have tried to avoid funding cuts which would \nrequire reductions in FTE after we increased FTE levels in fiscal year \n2000.\n  Within the constraints imposed by our allocation, we have attempted \nto accommodate Members' requests where possible. However, our \nallocation also means that no Member received everything he or she \nrequested. I would note that we received requests from over 75 \nindividual Members to include funding for programs they consider of \nimportance to their State or the Nation.\n  I must note that there were a number of deficiencies in this bill \nwhen it was reported out of the committee. While I did not participate \nin the drafting of the conference report, I am pleased that many of \nthose deficiencies have been addressed in this legislation.\n  One of my major concerns is funding for the Customs Service Automated \nCommercial Environment, known as ACE. The original Senate bill had no \nfunds for Customs' new and crucial computer improvement program. The \nexisting system is the over-worked backbone of our trade flow system. \nIt has been experiencing an ever increasing rate of failures and \nbrownouts. Our trade volume has doubled over the last ten years. Based \non the rate of growth in trade from 1996 to 1999, Customs anticipates \nan increase of over 50 percent in the number of entries by the year \n2005.\n  This is an antiquated system which is becoming increasingly expensive \nto operate. We need to fund ACE now. The House has provided $105 \nmillion for ACE and I am pleased that the conference report includes \n$130 million for this crucial program.\n  Another issue that concerns me, as well as the administration, is \nfunding for the Internal Revenue Service. While this conference report \ndoes better by the IRS than the original House or Senate bills, we are \nstill more than $300 million below the President's budget request. I \nhave spoken with the Commissioner of the IRS, Charles Rossotti, and I \nshare his fears that funding at these levels may result in staff cuts. \nI ask unanimous consent that letters from Commissioner Rossotti dated \nSeptember 8, 2000 and September 15, 2000 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: On July 27, the House and Senate \n     Appropriations Subcommittees on Treasury and General \n     Government agreed to a conference report on the Senate \n     Committee-passed and House-passed fiscal year 2001 spending \n     bill. The conference committees $8.494 billion funding level \n     is a $305 million reduction from the FY2001 request. Although \n     this funding level is an increase from FY2000, please \n     recognize that this level would lead to a further decline in \n     the already low levels of compliance activity, and threaten \n     the modernization of IRS computer systems.\n       Without funding for the Staffing Tax Administration for \n     Balance and Equity (STABLE) initiative, the IRS efforts to \n     provide increased service to taxpayers and reduce the decline \n     in audit coverage are at risk. Specifically, toll-free \n     service will drop from the current unacceptable level of 65 \n     percent to less than 60 percent; similar private sector \n     service is above 90 percent. Even more disturbing, audit \n     coverage will continue to decline. Since FY 1998, that rate \n     has declined 49 percent. Furthermore, audits of taxpayers \n     earning more than $100,000 annually a rapidly expending \n     segment of society have declined almost 33 percent from \n     FY1998 to FY1999. Even our ability to collect taxes on \n     acknowledged overdue accounts is declining significantly.\n       The conference committee also did not fund the requested \n     $72 million for the Information Technology Investment Account \n     (ITIA). The entire $2 trillion of annual tax revenue \n     collected by the IRS is critically dependent on an obsolete \n     computer system developed over 35 years by the IRS. These \n     systems are so deficient they do not allow the IRS to \n     administer the tax system or provide essential service to \n     taxpayers at an acceptable level. Furthermore, because the \n     IRS experiences a 1.5 percent annual workload increase in \n     number of returns processed, either productivity must \n     increase through improved technology or staffing must \n     increase just to remain at the same inadequate service \n     levels. Through the ITIA account provided by Congress, the \n     IRS in the last 15 months has begun the enormous job of \n     modernizing these systems. We must have a consistent funding \n     stream for this program. Lack of funding for the ITIA account \n     will slow or even halt projects currently underway, \n     increasing the time, cost and risk of our systems \n     modernization.\n       In order to fulfill requirements of the IRS Restructuring \n     and Reform Act of 1998 and provide effective tax \n     administration, we must have full funding. I urge you to seek \n     ways to provide this funding. Please contact me if you have \n     any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles O. Rossotti,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2000.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: As we discussed earlier today, I am \n     enclosing a set of talking points and a chart on the IRS' FY \n     2001 budget request and a description of the FTE commitment \n     needed to meet the requirements of the IRS Restructuring and \n     Reform Act of 1998. I cannot thank you enough for your \n     support for full funding of the agency's budget. It is \n     critical to carrying out the Restructuring Act and \n     safeguarding the nation's tax administration system.\n       If I can be of any further assistance or answer any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles O. Rossotti,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n       Enclosures.\n\n                     Talking Points for IRS Budget\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Full funding for the IRS budget is $8.799 billion--the \n     House-passed conference report if $8.494 billion--or $305 \n     million short of the FY 2001 request.\n       This $305 million funds two initiatives that are key to the \n     success of IRS' modernization effort (it also adds $4m for \n     Criminal Investigations and $3m for Electronic Tax \n     Administration):\n       $72 million for technology investments (ITIA) to upgrade \n     the IRS's obsolete and inherently deficient computer systems\n       $225 million for a hiring initiative (called STABLE--\n     Staffing Tax Administration for Balance and Equity) that will \n     restore the IRS staffing level near the level prior to \n     enactment of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 \n     (RRA98).\n\n\n                               key points\n\n       The IRS needs full funding to deliver on RRA98's mandates.\n       In terms of technology, IRS has developed a rigorous \n     management process to ensure that its past mistakes (i.e. \n     TSM) will not be repeated. The ITIA funding request is \n     necessary so that the IRS can continue efforts to make \n     technology investments that will have direct benefits to \n     taxpayers in 2001. GAO has repeatedly reported that ``until \n     IRS' antiquated information systems are replaced, they will \n     continue to hinder efforts to manage agency operations and \n     better serve taxpayers through revamped business practices''. \n     Without this funding, the IRS will have to stretch out many \n     of the projects it has planned to improve the administration \n     of the nation's tax system and service to taxpayers. For \n     example, the IRS plans to significantly improve its \n     communications capabilities with taxpayers--allowing service \n     representatives to answer taxpayer calls much more quickly \n     and accurately. This is just the first of a series of planned \n     upgrades to the decades old IRS technology infrastructure \n     that will dramatically improve service to taxpayers and could \n     be delayed.\n       The staffing initiative (STABLE) is necessary to enable the \n     IRS to stem the precipitous decline in its collection \n     activities and, at the same time, improve assistance to \n     taxpayers. Since 1997, the IRS has experienced an \n     extraordinary increase in demand for its limited staff. (See \n     attached table.) There are two main causes for this increase:\n       RRA98 created numerous new taxpayer rights provisions that \n     require additional time and resources for IRS employees. The \n     IRS estimates that more than 4500 FTEs were devoted to \n     meeting RRA98's demands--an effective reduction of 5.2 \n     percent in FTE since 1997.\n       As the economy grows so does the IRS workload. Each year \n     the IRS experience workload growth of 1.8 percent--that \n     translates to an additional 1800 FTE each year just to keep \n     pace with increased processing and compliance requirements.\n       STABLE is designed to compensate for these increases. Even \n     with STABLE, total IRS staffing will be below the pre-RRA98 \n     level.\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\n\n\n    IRS FTE RESOURCES IN FY 2001 WILL BE LESS THAN BEFORE RRA '98 WAS\n               PASSED, EVEN AT FULL FUNDING OF THE REQUEST\n1997..........................................................   102,622\n1998..........................................................  ........\n1999..........................................................    99,596\n2000..........................................................    97,361\n2001 (IRS request)............................................    99,862\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                  FY 2000 MANDATORY FTE INCREASES FROM RRA '98\n                                                [FTE by Program]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                      Customer            Total\n                          Code section                             EXAM   Collection   service   Other     FTE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1203--Termination of Employment for Misconduct; Incl 1203        .......        107   ........       19      126\n Training......................................................\n1205--Employee Training Program................................      113         71        177        7      368\n3001--Burden of Proof..........................................  .......  ..........         2        3        5\n3201--Innocent Spouse Case Processing & Adjudication...........      421         14        118      178      731\n3301--Global Interest Netting..................................       73         19         10        1      103\n3401--Due Process in Collections...............................  .......        108         78      170      356\n3417--Third Party Notices......................................      150        270        150       17      587\n3462--Offers in Compromise Case Processing.....................  .......      1,536        136        1    1,673\n3501--Explanation of Joint & Several Liability.................  .......         19   ........        1       20\n3705--Spanish language assistance/live assistor option/contact   .......  ..........        36       27       63\n on manually generated notices.................................\n****--All Other Codes..........................................  .......         10        353      166      529\n                                                                ------------------------------------------------\n      Total....................................................      757      2,154      1,060      589    4,560\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1998, we mandated specific goals for the IRS to meet in terms of \ntaxpayer assistance and IRS performance. However, we continue to deny \nthe IRS the resources it needs to meet these mandated goals. This is an \nadministration concern, and it is my concern as well. We must do better \nby the IRS--if not on this bill--then in subsequent legislation. It is \nimportant that we maintain the concept and provision of ``service'' by \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  I am pleased we were able to fund the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \nCampaign at last year's level of $185 million. While this is still $10 \nmillion less than requested by the administration, it represents a \ncontinued commitment to getting the message to our young people that \ndrugs can kill. To date we have appropriated over $500 million for the \nmedia campaign--with mixed results. We had two hearings this year on \nthe campaign where many of these concerns were raised. While it remains \na somewhat controversial program, I will continue to work with the \nchairman and others ensure that the campaign bears identifiable and \nquantifiable results.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the conference report fully funds the \nadministration's requests for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms to enforce existing gun laws. We fully fund the request to \nexpand existing ballistics identification activities and to expand the \nYouth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, YCGII, program into 12 \nadditional cities. Also, the objectionable gun preference provision--\ninserted in the original Senate bill without debate--has been dropped. \nThis was a wise action and I congratulate the chairman and others for \ntaking this step.\n  Again, while I strongly protest the process by which this conference \nreport was drafted, in most respects--this is a responsible bill. It \ngoes far to meeting our commitments to law enforcement and our Federal \nemployees. I am committed to working with Senators Stevens and Byrd and \nthe leadership to find additional funds for the IRS and \ncounterterrorism on subsequent legislation.\n  Mr. President, briefly, the statements made by the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Campbell, are accurate statements. He has done an \noutstanding job. I am very pleased to work with him. We worked closely \ntogether on this legislation.\n  He knows I feel somewhat aggrieved by the process. This bill has not \nfollowed the normal course in coming from the full Appropriations \nCommittee to the floor of the Senate. It was taken in an unusual \ncircumstance. It was put into conference, and now a conference report \ncomes to the floor. There are Senators who perhaps would have offered \namendments on the floor who were precluded from doing so. That really \nshould not be the case.\n  This is not a good process. That is not Senator Campbell's fault. The \nSenator from Colorado is someone who did what was required of him with \nrespect to the leadership decision. I hope we will not have this \napproach used in future bills. I will have more to say about the \nAgriculture appropriations bill which is supposed to be in conference \nnow but on which there is no conference. I will speak more about that \nat a later moment.\n  My sense is much of what is in this bill is on target. We are about \n$900 million below the budget request. We made progress in a whole \nrange of areas. I was very concerned about the program called the ACE \nProgram, the computer modernization program at the Customs Department, \nknown as ACE--Automated Commercial Environment.\n  The fact is the system for keeping track of what is coming in and \ngoing out of this country in trade, the system used by the Customs \nService is simply melting down. We need to modernize that system. This \nprogram designed to do that was not funded in some of the earlier \nversions. The bill that is now on the floor does begin that funding \nwith $130 million, a pretty robust amount of funding. For that I am \nmost appreciative.\n  This legislation is still short with respect to the Internal Revenue \nService needs, with respect to some counterterrorism appropriations, \nwith respect to an account called unanticipated needs. The chairman of \nthe full committee has indicated to me that while this is the \nconference we are dealing with and we have to take action on this \nconference report, he anticipates being able to respond to those \ndeficiencies in another circumstance. We will probably have an omnibus \nappropriations bill. The chairman of the full committee has indicated \nthe deficiencies that exist will be responded to in some omnibus bill \nat the end.\n  We will have to wait and see if that happens, but I expect perhaps \nthis conference report was held for some period of time and certainly \nwould be held at the White House. There is some discussion of a \npotential veto unless the holes are filled, especially with respect to \nenforcement capabilities at the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I say that only because there are more and more sophisticated schemes \nbeing used by some of the largest corporate taxpayers about which the \nSecretary of the Treasury has talked a great deal. They do need \nenforcement capability to penetrate some of those schemes that are used \nto avoid paying a fair share of taxes.\n  Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards on the majority side, and \nChip Walgren, Steve Monteiro, and Nicole Koretsch spent a lot of time \non this bill. As is the case with the legislative branch appropriations \nbill, this bill, the Treasury-general government appropriations bill, \nmuch credit must go to a lot of people who worked a lot of hours to \nmake sure we funded these agencies properly.\n\n  I wanted to make those points and say I do not like this process. It \nhas produced a bill that is pretty good in almost all respects except \nfor a handful of things that need some remedy. The chairman of the full \ncommittee has told me, and I think he has told the White House and \nothers, that he intends to respond to those deficiencies in some other \nvenue as we go along in the appropriations process, and I appreciate \nthat.\n  As we work to finish our remaining appropriations bills, it is my \nfervent hope that we can do this in the regular order. Bills passed by \nthe full Appropriations Committee in the Senate should be brought to \nthe Senate floor for debate and amendment, and then we send them to \nconference. When we have debate and amend a bill in the Senate, as we \ndid with the Agriculture appropriations bill, which is critically \nimportant--it has my amendment that gets rid of sanctions on the \nshipments of agricultural products and stops using food and medicine as \na weapon. The Senate voted for it by a wide margin.\n  It has the amendment Senator Jeffords and I, Senator Gorton and \nothers offered on reimportation of prescription drugs which would force \nthe repricing of prescription drugs in this country. We adopted that.\n  The House passed their bill the early part of July. We passed ours \nmid to late July. I am a conferee, and there has not been a conference. \nMy expectation is there will never be a conference because they do not \nwant to have a conference on something that controversial. Either one \nof those put to a separate vote in the Senate and the House will pass \nby 70 percent. I am worried this process will be used to hijack that \nbill.\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\n  I serve notice that I intend to inquire of the majority leader later \nthis afternoon when he comes to the floor or tomorrow at some great \nlength saying, we lost the issue last year and were hijacked to stop \nusing food and medicine as a weapon. They adjourned the conference and \nnever reconvened. It looks as if they are fixing to not convene a \nconference this year. That is not the way we should expect the Senate \nto do its business. I am sorry to get off on that for a moment.\n  Again, I appreciate the good work of Senator Campbell and look \nforward to not only proceeding with what is in this bill, which I think \nis good work, but also remedying a half dozen or so areas that I think \ncome up short of what we need to do, and I think the chairman of the \nfull committee has said we need to do that.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota.\n  His advice and counsel has been extremely important to me. I \nappreciate his comments very much. As I mentioned in my opening \nstatement, I would have preferred to bring the bill to the floor as a \nself-standing bill, too. We are simply running out of time with only \nless than 3 weeks, I guess, of actual workdays before we adjourn for \nthe year. It just was not possible this year.\n  But I look forward to working with him. If we do bring some emergency \nspending bill to the floor through the full committee, I would ask to \nwork with him to try to fill in some of the holes we have missed in \nthis bill.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n\n       Grand forks federal building and united states courthouse\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are a number of important national \nprovisions contained within the conference report. One provision, \nhowever, is both of national importance as well as of importance to the \npeople of North Dakota. I am especially proud that the bill names the \nFederal Building and United States Courthouse in Grand Forks, ND after \nJudge Ronald N. Davies.\n  The late Judge Davies is one of North Dakota's proudest sons. While \nhe grew up in Grand Forks, he is also claimed by Fargo. It was while \nserving as a judge in Fargo that President Eisenhower appointed him to \nthe Federal bench in 1955. While not a household name, Judge Davies has \ngone down in history as the judge who ordered Arkansas Governor Orval \nFaubus to integrate the Little Rock public schools 43 years ago this \nmonth. It is only fitting that the Federal building in his hometown--\nconstructed the year he was born--bear his name.\n  Some of my colleagues may have had the opportunity to visit the \nNorman Rockwell exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in downtown \nWashington. Among the many examples of Americana is the famous Rockwell \npainting of a little African-American girl, hair in pigtails, head held \nhigh, being escorted to school by U.S. Marshals. The painting puts a \nhuman face on an important turning point in our Nation's history. It \nwas the result of the ruling by this modest and unassuming son of North \nDakota that our Nation took one more step toward expanding the American \ndream to all Americans.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this provision. I ask \nunanimous consent that articles from the Grand Forks Herald and Fargo \nForum regarding Judge Davies be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Grand Forks Herald, Aug. 6, 2000]\n\n                       A Fitting Tribute to Judge\n\n\n federal building will be renamed for judge ronald n. davies--the man \n           who made landmark decision on school desegregation\n\n                          (By Marilyn Hagerty)\n\n       Soon it will be the Ronald N. Davies Federal Building and \n     Courthouse in Grand Forks. The neoclassical building at 102 \n     N. Fourth St. will be renamed to honor the late federal judge \n     from North Dakota who in 1957 made what is considered the \n     landmark decision on racial integration in our nation.\n       Born in Crookston in 1904--the same year work began on the \n     Federal Building--Davies grew up in Grand Forks.\n       The Appropriations Committee of the U.S. Senate last month \n     approved renaming the building in memory of the late Judge \n     Davies.\n       The legislation was proposed by Sen. Byron Dorgan D-N.D., \n     who said: ``I can think of no better way to celebrate his \n     contributions and preserve his legacy for future \n     generations.'' A date for the renaming ceremony will be \n     announced.\n       Davies was appointed to the federal bench by President \n     Dwight Eisenhower in 1955. Two years later, he made history \n     when on a temporary assignment to Arkansas he ruled that \n     Little Rock public schools must allow black students to \n     attend immediately.\n\n\n                              guard called\n\n       The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled three years earlier that \n     segregation was unconstitutional. Before a desegregation plan \n     could take effect in Little Rock, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus \n     called out the National Guard to prevent it.\n       On Sept. 7, 1957, Davies ordered Faubus to stop \n     interfering. The governor called Davies' ruling high-handed \n     and arbitrary, but the National Guard was removed. On Sept. \n     23, nine black children entered the high school, and white \n     mobs rampaged. The children were removed after sporadic \n     battles between police and rioters, according to reports by \n     The Associated Press.\n       Two days later, the ``Little Rock Nine'' entered the school \n     under the protection of 1,200 soldiers sent by Eisenhower.\n       Judge Davies, by then was widely known for his work in \n     Arkansas. He often was referred to as ``the stranger in \n     Little Rock.'' This stemmed from an article in Newsweek in \n     late September in which he was featured as ``This Week's \n     Newsmaker.''\n       When a national television broadcast branded him as ``an \n     obscure federal judge,'' he responded: ``We judges are \n     obscure--and should be. That is want I want--to return \n     quietly to the obscurity from which I sprang.''\n       Before going to Arkansas, Davies said, he never had heard a \n     desegregation case. He insisted he was only trying to do his \n     job.\n       ``I have no delusions about myself,'' he was reported to \n     have said. ``I'm just one of a couple of hundred federal \n     judges all over the country. That all.''\n       Davies was named to senior U.S. U.S. District Judge status \n     in 1971 in Fargo. He died there in 1996 at the age of 91.\n\n\n                               highlights\n\n       Significant honors awarded Judge Ronald N. Davies:\n       North Dakota's highest honor, the Theodore Roosevelt \n     Roughrider Award, was presented to him in 1987. His portrait \n     hangs in the Hall of Fame in the State Capitol.\n       Named outstanding alumnus of Georgetown University Law \n     Center, Washington, D.C., in 1958.\n       Given an honorary doctor of law award by the UND School of \n     Law in 1961.\n       Received Martin Luther King Holiday Award in 1986 by North \n     Dakota Peace Coalition.\n       In 1961, the Davies family attended graduation ceremonies \n     at UND for three rewarding reasons: Son Timothy received a \n     degree from the law school; son Thomas earned a degree in \n     business administration, and Judge Davies delivered the \n     commencement address.\n       In 1966, Judge Davies rendered a decision he considered one \n     of his most important cases--Stromsodt vs. Parke-Davis and \n     Co. The case was tried in Grand Forks and involved a damage \n     suit against Parke-Davis, one of the nation's largest drug \n     manufacturers, for an unsafe vaccine administered to Shane \n     Stromsodt at the age of five months in 1959. The child, who \n     suffered irreparable brain damage, was represented by \n     prominent torts attorney Melvin Belli. On Sept. 29, 1966, \n     Davies awarded $500,000 to the 7-year-old Stromsodt.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Davies, The Man--Who Was Judge Ronald N. Davies?\n\n       He was competitive, ambitious, courageous. He was a \n     lawyer's lawyer and a lawyer's judge. He had a sense of humor \n     that would knock your socks off.\n       That's what children of the late Judge Ronald N. Davies say \n     about him.\n       A daughter, Katherine Olmscheid, of Lafayette, Calif., was \n     a senior in high school at the time her father was making \n     headlines in Little Rock, Ark.\n       She says: ``I knew what was going on, but I was so used to \n     Dad being a take-charge kind of man that I just expected he \n     was being very thoughtful about every decision he made. He \n     did tell me that he well knew that his upholding the law in \n     this case would not bode well for him in appointments to a \n     higher court.\n       ``He was competitive and ambitious, but when it came to the \n     law and the courage to uphold it, there was never any \n     question. He was a father who took time to talk to me and \n     explain what was happening, but he never focused on the drama \n     of it.''\n       Thomas Davies, a son who is a municipal judge in Fargo, \n     says his dad had a favorite saying: ``Better to be silent and \n     thought a fool than to open your mouth and erase all doubt.''\n       Judge Ronald N. Davis was short--only 5 feet, 1 inch. But \n     his son says nobody mentioned his height. If they did, the \n     judge would launch into a good-natured dissertation about \n     people who were too tall for their own good.\n       Thomas Davies says his father knew who he was and what he \n     had to do. ``He respected lawyers, and they respected him. He \n     never lost contact with the average person. He knew and liked \n     the janitors, elevator operators, secretaries, waitresses, \n     labor people and their bosses. He could, in my estimation, \n     have been elected to any office in state, local\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\n     or federal levels; but he had the job he wanted, and he loved \n     it.''\n       Jody Eidler, a daughter who lives in Wheaton, Ill., \n     remembers her father's sense of humor. ``It was the best of \n     anyone we knew. Ask any lawyer who appeared in his courtroom. \n     I used to meet him in Chicago when he came to hear cases. I'd \n     sit back and marvel at how smooth he was with the big-city \n     attorneys. He handled them with kid gloves.''\n       Davies' sons and daughters talk of the ``round table'' the \n     judge held at the Elks Club in Fargo. He would have lunch \n     with different lawyers, and he always would make room for one \n     of his children if they happened to drop by.\n       Olmscheid says: ``Dad was a stickler for his name being \n     Ronald N. Davies. That N. initial thing was important to him, \n     so I sure hope the powers that be take that into \n     consideration when renaming the building.''\n       As an aside, she said: ``Dad was as proud of being a Sigma \n     Nu as he was about just about anything else. He always sang \n     the UND and Sigma Nu songs to us as we drove around Grand \n     Forks on warm summer nights. He loved the University of North \n     Dakota. He got his law degree from Georgetown, but he was a \n     UND man all the way.''\n       Along with Jody, Katharine and Thomas, the children of \n     Judge Davies include Jean Marie Schmith and Timothy Davies, a \n     trial lawyer with the firm of Nilles, Hansen and Davies in \n     Fargo.\n       Judge Ronald N. Davies was born in Crookston on Dec. 11, \n     1904, two years before the completion of the U.S. Post Office \n     and Court-house--now the U.S. Federal Building that will be \n     named after him.\n       He was the son of a former Crookston Times editor and Grand \n     Forks Herald city editor, Norwood Davies, and Minnie Quigley \n     Davies.\n       His interest in the legal world grew as he tagged after his \n     grandfather, who was chief of police in East Grand Forks. The \n     family moved to Grand Forks in 1971, and Davies received a \n     diploma from Central High School in 1922.\n       He went on to UND and worked at a soda fountain and in a \n     clothing store to help with expenses. He graduated in 1927. \n     He earned his law degree from Georgetown University Law \n     Center in Washington, D.C., in 1930. As a student, he worked \n     for the Capitol police force.\n       Davies began his long legal and judicial career in 1932, \n     when he was elected as judge of the Municipal Court in Grand \n     Forks. He served in that capacity until 1940, when he went \n     into private practice. He was called into military service \n     after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. He entered the \n     U.S. Army as a first lieutenant and was discharged in 1946 as \n     a lieutenant colonel.\n       Davies was married in Grand Forks on Oct. 10, 1933, to \n     Mildred Doran, who was born in Arvilla, N.D., and grew up in \n     Grand Forks. She was a graduate of St. John's Hospital School \n     of Nursing in Fargo. She died in 1994.\n       The family includes five children, 20 grandchildren and 37 \n     great grandchildren.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Fargo Forum, Aug. 11, 2000]\n\n               Idea to Honor Judge Davies is Appropriate\n\n                           (By Terry DeVine)\n\n       North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan's introduction of \n     legislation that would rename the federal courthouse in Grand \n     Forks in honor of the late federal judge Ronald Davies of \n     Fargo, who handed down the landmark ruling in the 1957 Little \n     Rock, Ark., school desegregation case, is certainly \n     appropriate.\n       Davies may have been a diminutive man, standing only 5-\n     foot, 1-inch tall, but he was a Paul Bunyan of the law when \n     he sat on the bench. His courtroom was a model of decorum, \n     but never humorless. He had a way of keeping serious matters \n     from becoming too overwhelming.\n       ``If things were too tense, he'd crack a joke in court to \n     lighten up the atmosphere,'' says his son, Fargo Municipal \n     Judge Tom Davies. ``The dad at home was not the judge you saw \n     in court. He was serious in court but had a real good sense \n     of humor.''\n       The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved \n     Dorgan's legislation to change the name of the building to \n     the judge Ronald N. Davies Federal Building and Courthouse. \n     The provision is included in a larger bill that will be voted \n     on by the full Senate when it returns from its recess in \n     September.\n       The elder Davies was a graduate of the University of North \n     Dakota and Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C. While in \n     law school, he worked as a Capitol policeman.\n       ``I'd have loved to see that,'' says his son. ``I'm sure my \n     dad thought that was a hoot. He did think the rest of the \n     world was too tall. His nightstick must have been almost as \n     long as he was tall.''\n       Former North Dakota senator and power broker Bill Langer \n     nominated Davies for the federal bench in 1954, and he was \n     appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955.\n       At the time, Langer reportedly said Ron Davies would be \n     appointed to the federal bench or there would be no federal \n     judges in North Dakota. The Senate obliged Langer.\n       Tom Davies says his father was fully aware of the awesome \n     power a federal judge possesses, but it only made him more \n     careful in the way he wielded it. He never let it go to his \n     head, Davies says.\n       Davies had practiced law for several years in Grand Forks, \n     N.D., before moving to Fargo following his appointment to the \n     federal bench. He was sent to Arkansas to help clear what he \n     thought was a backlog of routine cases.\n       Another federal judge ordered the integration of Little \n     Rock schools, and Judge Davies ordered the integration \n     process be accelerated at Central High School. Arkansas Gov. \n     Orville Faubus called out the Arkansas National Guard to stop \n     the admission of black students. President Eisenhower \n     federalized the National Guard troops and nine black students \n     were admitted to the previously all-white school.\n       It was a scary time, and there were death threats aplenty, \n     but Davies stood his ground. He was the right man at the \n     right time for the nation.\n       Davies paid his dues long before his federal appointment by \n     ``belonging to just about every organization that ever \n     existed, with the exception of the Communist Party.''\n       ``He was as active as any human being could ever be,'' says \n     Tom Davies. ``He was a sparkplug. He never stopped \n     recognizing people. He said hello to everyone. He was never \n     arrogant.''\n       Davies says his father was always available to the media, \n     but never once took advantage of many opportunities to speak \n     or write about the Little Rock ruling for large sums of money \n     in his later years.\n       ``I shouldn't be paid to talk about doing my job,'' he \n     said.\n       His son said his father, who died in 1996 at the age of 91, \n     spoke about Little Rock only once on television when he did a \n     45-minute show with Fargo-Moorhead radio/television host Boyd \n     Christenson.\n       Men like Judge Davies should be remembered. Naming a \n     federal courthouse in his honor is a fine idea.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before the Senator starts, I ask the \nChair: I am in order to follow the Senator from Iowa; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is in order in the \nrequest.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time do I \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 25 minutes \nunder her control but has not yielded a specific amount of time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe Senator Wellstone is speaking under his own \ntime. I will yield such time as he may consume to Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from California for her graciousness \nin yielding me this time.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Harkin are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to say at the very beginning to \nmy colleague from Utah, for whom I have a lot of respect, that none of \nwhat I am about to say is aimed directly at him personally; quite the \nopposite. But I want to come out here and take very serious exception \nwith the process and the result.\n  We finalized the legislative appropriations bill. Rather than having \nthe Treasury and Postal appropriations bill coming directly from the \nfloor of the Senate and having the opportunity to offer amendments, \nthat bill was put into the legislative appropriations conference \nreport. The two bills were basically linked to one another. This is a \nterrible way to legislate.\n  I say to the majority leader and others that we have been at this \nbefore and that I am out here on the floor of the Senate again today \nsaying I take very serious exception to this. I cannot represent the \ninterests of the people in the State of Minnesota very well when there \nis no opportunity to come to this floor and have amendments and try to \nmake a difference.\n  I didn't come to the floor of the Senate to be a potted plant or a \npiece of furniture. In this particular case, I take exception with a \ncouple of different things.\n  First of all, we have raised our salary to $141,300, and there is no \nopportunity for an amendment to be offered on the floor of the Senate \nto block this increase, no opportunity at all, no opportunity for any \ndebate on this with an amendment. I can understand how the majority \nleader or someone on the majority party did not want to have an up-or-\ndown vote. But I will tell you that I find it is very difficult to \nsquare raising our salary to $141,300 at the same time we are not \nwilling to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over a 2-year \nperiod. It is just unbelievable to me.\n\n  I want to be clear about it again. The Congress, by taking the \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill and putting the salary increase \ninto it, then putting it\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\ninto a legislative appropriations conference report, is basically \nraising our pay without even taking a vote on it.\n  I want to tell you that is what gets us in trouble with the people we \nrepresent. This is exactly what gets us in trouble with the people we \nrepresent, and for very good reason.\n  Maybe the majority leader didn't want to have an up-or-down vote. \nMaybe the majority party didn't want to have an up-or-down vote. But I \nwanted an opportunity to come here to the floor of the Senate and say \nno way am I going to support raising our salary to $141,000 a year when \nthis Senate and this conference has not been willing to raise the \nminimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $6.15 an hour.\n  To be very honest with Senators, I might raise another question, \nwhich is: Have we earned the salary increase? Have we passed a \nPatients' Bill of Rights? No. Have we passed prescription drugs \nextended onto Medicare? No. Have we reauthorized the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act? No. Have we reauthorized the Small Business \nAdministration? No.\n  In all due respect, we have done hardly any of the work of the \npeople. We have not done much at all when it comes to the basic issues \nthat affect the lives of the people we represent. Yet we are raising \nour salary to $141,000 a year. We are putting it into an unrelated \nconference report so that there will not be a vote on it. I think that \nis not a very direct way of conducting business.\n  I want to remind my colleagues of the words of Senator Kennedy 4 \nyears ago, when the Senate voted to gut rule XXVIII. That is the Senate \nrule limiting the scope of conference, and we are violating this \nconference report. I quote from Senator Kennedy. This was 4 years ago, \nand it is so true to be prophetic.\n\n       The rule that a conference committee cannot include \n     extraneous matter is central to the way the Senate conducts \n     its business. When we send a bill to a conference we do so \n     knowing that the conference committee work is likely to \n     become law. Conference reports are privileged. Motions to \n     proceed to them cannot be debated, and such reports cannot be \n     amended. So conference committees are already very powerful. \n     But if conference committees are permitted to add completely \n     extraneous matters in conference--that is, if the point of \n     order against such conduct becomes a dead letter--conferees \n     will acquire unprecedented power. They will acquire the power \n     to legislate in a privileged, unrenewable fashion on \n     virtually any subject. They will be able to completely bypass \n     the deliberative process of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a highly dangerous situation. It will make all \nof us less willing to send bills to conference and will leave all of us \nvulnerable to passage of controversial, extraneous legislation any time \na bill goes to conference. I hope the Senate will not go down this \nroad. Today the narrow issue is the status of one corporation under the \nlabor laws, but tomorrow the issue might be civil rights, States \nrights, health care, education, or anything else. It might be a matter \nmuch more sweeping than the labor law issue that is before us today.\n  That is exactly what we have done. What we have here today is a mini-\nomnibus measure, and I think it is exactly the road that Senator \nKennedy was warning we should not go down.\n  I say to colleagues that I think every Senator ought to object to \nwhat we are doing--every Senator, Democrat and Republican alike.\n  We had an opportunity in the later months of this summer when we came \nback to bring this appropriations bill to the floor. We could have \ndealt with the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. If we had, I would \nhave brought an amendment to knock out our salary increase. I would \nhave added an amendment that said we do not raise our salary increase \nto $141,000 a year until we raise the minimum wage. I would like to \nhave had an up-or-down vote. All of us would have been held \naccountable, but that is not the way it was done. The majority party \napparently doesn't want to have any votes any longer on any amendments \nwhereby we will be held accountable.\n\n  Instead, anytime a Member desires--and I hope other Democrats will \nspeak on this--it is true, they can take unrelated issues in matters, \nput it into a conference report, vote to raise our salary to $141,000 a \nyear when we are not willing to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to \n$6.15 over 2 years. They are in the majority. They can put it into an \nunrelated conference report, bulldoze it over us, and pass this \nlegislation.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I am not going to let it happen without \nspeaking about it. There will come a time when they may not be in the \nmajority and there will come a time when they may find provisions that \nare put into conference reports unrelated to the scope of that \nconference report antithetical to the values they believe in, against \nwhat they think is right, against a Member's ability to represent their \nState, and they won't like it one bit. But that is exactly what has \nhappened today. It is not because of the Presiding Officer right now, \nthe Senator from Utah. But I believe this is truly an egregious \nprocess.\n  Again, one more time--just to be clear to those who are following \nthis debate--I want to be on record. As a Senator from the State of \nMinnesota, people did not elect me to vote for a salary increase to \n$141,000 a year, people did not elect me to be here not in a position \nto bring out any amendments on the floor of the Senate to represent \ntheir interests, and people certainly did not elect me to let others \nput a salary increase--we now go up to $141,000 a year--in a conference \nreport so we don't have an up-or-down vote on it without someone \nspeaking out against it.\n  I speak out against it. I am not showboating. I speak out against it \nnot because I don't think Senators should make a decent salary. First \nof all, what bothers me the most is I don't think we have done much. I \nthink this has been a do-nothing Senate. I don't think we have done \nmuch on most of the crucial issues that affect people's lives. I am not \nsure what we have done to earn this increase.\n  Second, and I think even more importantly, I don't know how in the \nworld we can justify raising our salary to $141,000 a year when we are \nnot even willing to raise the minimum wage. There are 10 million people \nin this country who would directly benefit, and many others who would \nindirectly benefit, from the raise of the minimum wage. There are \n119,826 Minnesotans who would benefit from a $1 increase in the minimum \nwage over 2 years, and if we don't do that, the minimum wage increase \nthat we did pass has essentially lost all of its value. It is not even \nkeeping up with inflation.\n  So colleagues understand, we hear a lot about the booming economy. It \nis true, but not all the new jobs that are being created are living \nwage jobs. In 1998, 29 percent of all the workers were in jobs paying \npoverty-level wages. In some of the jobs where we have seen the \ngreatest growth--waiter staff, cashiers, janitors, and retail sales \npeople--people earn less than half of what is called a living wage.\n  A study released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 1998 showed that \nnearly 4 out of 10 Americans visiting soup kitchens for emergency food \nwere working; they were working poor people.\n  I don't think I want to go into the statistics. We have so many \npeople in this country who could benefit. We have people who work 52 \nweeks a year, 40 hours a week, and they are still not out of poverty. \nThe raise in the minimum wage would make a real difference, from $5.15 \nto $6.15 over a 2-year period.\n  What are we doing instead? Instead, we are raising our salary to \n$141,000 a year. We are raising our salary through the worst process, \nwhereby rather than risking someone bringing an amendment out and \nhaving an up-or-down vote, someone has put the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill into the legislative appropriations conference \nreport. Quite clearly, it was done in a very deliberate way so we \nwouldn't have to have an up-or-down vote.\n  In conclusion, I object to this process. I believe one of the worst \nthings we ever did was make it possible for the majority party--and I \npromise the Chair that when we are in the majority I will take the same \nposition--to basically waive the rule and insist measures that are put \nin conference committee be related to the subject material, that we no \nlonger have to deal with the scope of the conference, the worst thing \nwe could have ever done in violation of this constitutional process, \nand certainly in violation of the very notion of accountability.\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\n  We have been down this road before. I have come to the Chamber many \ntimes and objected to this. This time I believe even more strongly in \nit. I say to my colleagues, if you want to raise the salary, go ahead, \nbut don't do it in this way. And don't put one appropriations bill that \nwe should have been able to vote on into an unrelated appropriations \nbill conference report, and then bring it to the floor where there is \nno opportunity for amendments. I can't have an amendment that says we \nshouldn't raise our salary to $141,000, but I will vote against this. \nAnd I am sorry because the Presiding Officer and other Senators have \ndone good work and in both these appropriations bills there is funding \nfor a lot of important work.\n  I am going to vote no for two reasons. A, I am on record objecting to \nthe way we are conducting our business. I am on record in opposition to \nthe way the majority party is bulldozing over the right of the minority \nto come to the floor of the Senate with amendments. Second, I am voting \nagainst this appropriations bill because I think it is an outrageous \nproposition that the Senate should vote to raise our salaries to \n$141,000 a year and we are not willing to vote, to even have a debate \nmuch less a vote, on raising the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to \n$6.15 an hour over a 2-year period so people who work hard all year-\nround and are still poor, who don't earn a decent living and cannot \ntake care of their children, are not even given the opportunity to be \nable to do better for themselves and their children.\n  I think it is egregious. It is absolutely egregious what has \nhappened. I am in opposition to it. I hope other Senators will speak \nout in opposition to the process and in opposition to the Congress \nbeing so generous with our own salary and oh so stingy when it comes to \nlooking out for the interests of many hard-working, working poor people \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 14 minutes of Senator \nDorgan's time be yielded to Senator Graham from Florida and that 6 \nminutes of my time be yielded to Senator Graham of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \ntheir hard work in putting forth this legislation which provides \nfederal funding for numerous vital programs in the Treasury Department \nand the General Government. However, I am sad to say, once again, I \nfind myself in the unpleasant position of speaking before my colleagues \nabout unacceptable levels of parochial projects in another \nappropriations Conference Report.\n  The amount of pork in this bill is a tremendous burden which is \npatently unfair to the millions of hard-working American taxpayers, who \ndo not possess the resources to get a ``pet project'' placed in their \nbackyard.\n  The list of projects which received priority billing is quite long \nand the dollar amounts are staggering. Nevertheless, I will highlight a \nfew of the egregious violations.\n  The conference report contains numerous provisions for millions of \ndollars to construct new courthouses in specific locations such as Los \nAngeles, CA, Richmond, VA, and Seattle, WA. Again, why are these \nparticular sites so deserving of funding, that they receive specific \nearmarks to fund their construction? Unfortunately, this spending \nfrenzy is not limited to courthouses. Somebody in either the other body \nor the Senate has concluded that the SSA National Computer Center in \nWoodlawn, MD deserves $4.3 million, and the Richard Bolling Federal \nBuilding in Kansas City, MO deserves $26 million are so unique that \nthey should receive specific earmarks.\n  Furthermore, this conference report irresponsibly expands the \ndefinition of what constitutes emergency spending to get around the \nspending caps. For example, this report designates $9 million in \nfunding for repairs to the underground garage in the Cannon House \nOffice Building as emergency spending. I do not think this is what the \nAmerican taxpayer would envision as a true emergency.\n  This report also spends nearly $7 million more for salaries and \nexpenses for the Treasury Department than was requested by either the \nHouse or the Senate.\n  The list of spending excesses goes on. This bill provides a \nstaggering $14.8 million for communications infrastructure, including \nradios and related equipment, associated with law enforcement \nresponsibilities for the Salt Lake Winter Olympics. This item is but \none example of the fiscal abuse surrounding the staging of the Olympic \nGames in Salt Lake.\n  This past year, Congressman Dingell and I requested the General \nAccounting Office to conduct an audit into Federal financial support \nfor U.S. cities hosting the Olympics. Specifically, we asked the GAO to \nanswer two questions: (1) the amount of federal funding and support \nprovided to the 1984 and 1996 Summer Olympics, and planned for the 2002 \nWinter Olympics, and the types of projects and activities that were \nfunded and supported, and; (2) the Federal policies, legislative \nauthorizations, and agency controls in place for providing the Federal \nfunds and support to the Olympic Games. What the GAO discovered is \nthat, ``at least 24 Federal agencies reported providing or planning to \nprovide a combined total of almost $2 billion, in 1999 dollars, for \nOlympic-related projects and activities for the 1984 and 1996 Summer \nOlympic Games and the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.''\n  I say to my friends, the number is staggering, but what is more \nshocking, but not too surprising once an egregious practice begins and \ngoes unchecked, is the way in which Federal funds flowing to Olympic \nhost cities has accelerated. The GAO found that the American taxpayers \nprovided about $75 million in funding for the 1984 Los Angeles games, \nby 1996 the bill to the taxpayers had escalated to $609 million, and \nfor the upcoming 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, that bill to \nAmerican taxpayers is estimated to be $1.3 billion.\n  That is outrageous, Mr. President, and it is a disgrace. It is a \ndisgraceful practice to put these pork-barrel projects on this \nappropriations bill. I say to the Senator from Utah who is on the floor \nnow, if another pork-barrel project that is not authorized for the \nOlympic games is put on any appropriations bill, I will filibuster the \nbill until I fail to do so.\n  I wrote a letter to the Senator from Utah on September 19, 1997. In \nit I said:\n\n       I am writing about the recent efforts to add funds--\n\n  This is 1997--\n\n     to appropriations measures for the 2002 Winter Olympics in \n     Salt Lake City.\n\n  I went on to say:\n\n       I recognize that proper preparation for the Olympics is \n     vital. . . . It seems to me, though, the best course of \n     action would be to require the U.S. Olympic Committee, in \n     coordination with the Administration and Congress, to prepare \n     and submit a comprehensive plan detailing, in particular, the \n     funding anticipated to be required from the taxpayers. . . .\n       Please call me so that we can start work immediately to \n     establish some predictability and rationality in the process \n     of preparing for Olympic events in our country.\n\n  That was 1997. In a rather surprising breach of senatorial courtesy, \nthe Senator from Utah never responded to that letter, so I wrote him \nanother letter a year later asking for the same and never got a \nresponse.\n  The GAO now determines that $1.3 billion--and some of those I will \nread: $974,000 for the Utah State Olympic Public Safety Command; $5 \nmillion for the Utah Communications Agency Network; $3 million to \nOlympic Regional Development Authority, upgrades at Mt. Van Hoevenberg \nSports Complex; $2.5 million, Salt Lake City Olympics bus facilities; \n$2.5 million, Salt Lake City Olympics regional park-and-ride lots; \n$500,000, Salt Lake City Olympics transit bus loan, and on and on; \n$925,000 to allow the Utah State Olympic Public Safety Command to \ncontinue to develop and support a public safety program for the 2002 \nWinter Olympics; $1 million for the 2002 Winter Olympics security \ntraining; $2.2 million for the Charleston Water Conservancy District, \nUT, to meet sewer infrastructure needs associated with the 2002 Winter \nOlympic Games.\n  What the Olympic games supposedly hosted and funded by Salt Lake \nCity, which began in corruption and bribery, has now turned into is an \nincredible pork-barrel project for Salt Lake City and its environs.\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\n  Not surprisingly, the GAO found that there was no effective mechanism \nin place for tracking Federal funding and support to host cities, one \nthing I tried to do in the letter to the Senator from Utah in 1997. The \nGAO stated that ``in some cases it was difficult to determine the \namount of federal funding and support because federal agencies \ngenerally did not track or report their funding and support for the \nOlympic Games.'' Congress, in some cases, authorized $690 million of \nthe estimated $2 billion, with some $1.3 billion being approved by \nFederal agencies. However egregious it might be for Congress to approve \n$690 million in taxpayers funds--most of which was done through \nobjectionable legislative pork barreling--it is astounding that federal \nbureaucrats, with absolutely no accountability, have ponied up $1.3 \nbillion as a regular course of business.\n  The Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, named after my good \nfriend and colleague from Alaska, sets out the process by which the \nUnited States Olympic Committee operates, and how the USOC goes about \nselecting a U.S. bid city. Embodied in this act is a uniquely American \ntenet establishing that the United States Olympic movement, including \nthe bid, and host city process, is an entirely independent, private \nsector entity. However, as this report points out, the American \ntaxpayer has now become, by far, the largest single underwriter of the \ncosts of hosting the Olympics. Mind you, this is not about private, \nvoluntary giving to the Olympic movement. Nor is it about corporate \nsponsorships. This is about a cocktail of fiscal irresponsibility, made \nof congressional pork barreling, and unaccountable Federal bureaucrats.\n  As I outlined earlier, taxpayer funding of the Olympics has increased \ndramatically in recent years, as has the purpose of the funding. In the \n1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, $75 million in Federal support--\n$75 million versus $1.3 billion for the Salt Lake City Olympics--was \nprovided. Most notable about this figure, aside from how low it is \nrelative to Atlanta and Salt Lake, is what the money was used for. Of \nthe $75 million in Los Angeles, $68 million, or 91 percent, was used to \nhelp provide safety and security services during the planned staging of \nthe games. Only $7 million was for nonsecurity-related services. \nProviding safety and security support is a proper role for the Federal \nGovernment. No one would dispute that the Federal Government should \nprovide whatever support necessary to ensure that the Games are safe \nfor everyone. However, the American taxpayer should not be burdened \nwith building up the basic infrastructure necessary to a city to be \nable to pull off hosting the Olympic Games.\n  Clearly, by the time we got to Atlanta, such was not the case.\n  Other classic examples include $331,000 to purchase flowers, shrubs \nand grass for venues and parks around Atlanta, $3.5 million to do \nthings like installing of solar electrical systems at the Olympic \nswimming pool.\n  As astounding as the Atlanta numbers are, they absolutely pale in \ncomparison to Salt Lake City. Almost $1.3 billion of Federal funding \nand support is planned or has already been provided to the city of Salt \nLake. And $645 million--51 percent--is for construction of roads and \nhighways; $353 million--28 percent--is for mass transit projects; \napproximately $107 million for miscellaneous other activities, such as \nbuilding temporary parking lots and bus rentals; and $161 million on \nsafety and security.\n  As of April 2000, the Federal Government planned to spend some $77 \nmillion to provide spectator transportation and venue enhancements for \nthe Salt Lake games. This includes $47 million in congressionally \napproved taxpayer funding for transportation systems. Among other \nthings, Salt Lake officials plan to ask the Federal Government for $91 \nmillion to pay for things such as transporting borrowed buses to and \nfrom Salt Lake, additional bus drivers, bus maintenance, and \nconstruction and operation of park-and-ride lots.\n  However, as outlined, most of the money taken from taxpayers to pay \nthe bill for the Salt Lake games is going to develop, build, and \ncomplete major highway and transit improvement projects, ``especially \nthose critical to the success of the Olympic games.'' This last phrase \nis vital to understanding the fleece game being played by cities such \nas Salt Lake City.\n  It works this way. A city decides they want to host an Olympics to \ngenerate tourism and put their hometown on the map. In order to \nsuccessfully manage an Olympics, community leaders know they will have \nto meet certain infrastructure demands. They develop their plans, and \nthen, of course, the pork barreling starts.\n  The GAO makes several recommendations for congressional \nconsideration, including a potential Federal role in the selection of a \nbid city, a tracking system for funds appropriated, and more direct \noversight. Among other things, the GAO also recommends a larger role \nfor OMB in exercising oversight regarding agency activities.\n  However, I believe there are two fundamental reforms that should take \nplace. The first is budget reform. Appropriations for Olympic \nactivities should occur through the regular budget process, subject to \nthe sunshine of public scrutiny and debate within Congress. Second, the \nUSOC should not consider the bids of cities that do not have in place \nthe basic capacity to host the Olympic games.\n  What has happened here is what happens in Congress. We start out with \na little pork barreling; it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. We saw \nthat recently on the Defense appropriations bill--$4 million on the \nDefense appropriations bill to protect the desert tortoise.\n  I want to repeat, I will filibuster and do everything in my power to \ndelay any more appropriations bills that have this pork-barrel spending \nfor Salt Lake City. There is a process. There is a process of \nauthorization for these projects. They are conducted by the authorizing \ncommittees. Some of them may be worthwhile and necessary. Some of them \nmay deserve to be authorized. Instead, they are stuck into an \nappropriations bill without scrutiny or without anyone looking at them.\n  I do not understand how we Republicans call ourselves conservatives \nand then treat the taxpayers' dollars in this fashion. This is terribly \nobjectionable. It is up to $1.3 billion. We still have another year, at \nleast, to go. This has to stop.\n  I am glad we got the GAO study. It is a classic example of what \nhappens with pork-barrel spending in this body. It directly contributes \nto the cynicism and alienation of the American voter. These are my \ntaxpayers' dollars, Mr. President, as well as the citizens' tax dollars \nof Utah. I have an obligation to my constituents in the State of \nArizona who pay their taxes that their tax dollars should not be spent \non this pork-barrel spending.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of \nobjectionable provisions for the legislative branch conference report \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Objectional Provisions for the Legislative Branch Conference Report \n                   106-796 (Includes Treasury/Postal)\n\n                   ITEMS IDENTIFIED in Report 106-796\n\n\n                                Earmarks\n\n                  Title I--Department of the Treasury\n\n       $47,287,000 for development and acquisition of automatic \n     data processing equipment, software, and services for the \n     Department of the Treasury.\n       $31,000,000 for the repair, alteration, and improvement of \n     the Treasury Building and Annex.\n       $29,205,000, for expansion of the Federal Law Enforcement \n     Training Center.\n\n                        Title II--Other Agencies\n\n                          Library of Congress\n\n       $4,300,000 for a high speed data transmission between the \n     Library of Congress and educational facilities, libraries, or \n     networks serving western North Carolina.\n       Russian Leadership Program--$10,000,000.\n       Hands Across America--$5,957,800.\n       Arrearage reduction--$500,000.\n       Mass deacidification--$1,216,000.\n       National Film Preservation Board--$250,000.\n       Digitization pilot with West Point--$404,000.\n\n                             Botanic Garden\n\n       Wayfinding signage--$25,000.\n\n                        Architect of the Capitol\n\n       Replace HVAC variable speed drive motor--$90,000.\n       Room and partition modifications--$165,000.\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\n       Replace partition supports--$200,000.\n       Lightning protection, Madison building--$190,000.\n\n    Title IV--Emergency Fiscal Year 2000 Supplemental Appropriations\n\n                        Architect of the Capitol\n\n       $9,000,000 for urgent repairs to the underground garage in \n     the Cannon House Office Building.\n\n                   Title I--Congressional Operations\n\n       Replacement of Minton title--$100,000.\n\n                     Title IV--Independent Agencies\n\n       $472,176,000 for construction projects at the following \n     locations:\n       California, Los Angeles, U.S. Courthouse;\n       District of Columbia, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms Headquarters;\n       Florida, Saint Petersburg, Combined Law Enforcement \n     Facility;\n       Maryland, Montgomery County, Food and Drug Administration \n     Consolidation;\n       Michigan, Sault St. Marie, Border Station;\n       Mississippi, Biloxi-Gulfport, U.S. Courthouse;\n       Montana, Eureka/Roosville, Border Station;\n       Virginia, Richmond, U.S. Courthouse;\n       Washington, Seattle, U.S. Courthouse.\n       Repairs and alterations:\n       Arizona: Phoenix, Federal Building Courthouse, $26,962,000.\n       California: Santa Ana, Federal Building, $27,864,000.\n       District of Columbia: Internal Revenue Service Headquarters \n     (Phase 1), $31,780,000, Main State Building (Phase 3), \n     $28,775,000.\n       Maryland: Woodlawn, SSA National Computer Center, \n     $4,285,000.\n       Michigan: Detroit, McNamara Federal Building, $26,999,000.\n       Missouri: Kansas City, Richard Bolling Federal Building, \n     $25,882,000; Kansas City, Federal Building, 8930 Ward \n     Parkway, $8,964,000.\n       Nebraska: Omaha, Zorinsky Federal Building, $45,960,000.\n       New York: New York City, 40 Foley Square, $5,037,000.\n       Ohio: Cincinnati, Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse, \n     $18,434,000.\n       Pennsylvania: Pittsburgh, U.S. Post Office-Courthouse, \n     $54,144,000.\n       Utah: Salt Lake City, Bennett Federal Building, \n     $21,199,000.\n       Virginia: Reston, J.W.

The distinguished Senator from Utah has 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. I will use time when the Senator from \nFlorida has finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nallowing me to speak on another matter during the debate on the \nlegislative branch conference report.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Graham are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest when the Senator \nfrom Arizona spoke about the GAO report with respect to the Olympics. I \nbelieve the Senator from Arizona has made a significant contribution \nand is attempting to move the Congress in a direction in which we \nshould go with respect to the Olympic games. I think he has raised \nappropriate concerns. I can be specific about some of them. I will not \nattempt to be specific about them all because they are quite lengthy.\n  For example, the $14.8 million for communications infrastructure to \nwhich he objects in the Department of the Treasury portion of the \nconference report before us was inserted there at the request of the \nSecret Service, which told the Appropriations Committee that was the \namount they required. This was not something that was asked for by the \nSalt Lake organizing committee or the Senator from Utah specifically. \nIt came from the Department of the Treasury.\n  That is true of some of the other items. But rather than getting \nbogged down in a debate over the appropriateness of this amount or that \namount, every one of which has had that debate in one form or another \nin the process of getting to the conference report, I want to address \nthe issue of the GAO report and the comments that the Senator from \nArizona made about it.\n  He said, very accurately, that the Federal role with respect to the \nOlympic games has increased dramatically from the $75 million that was \nappropriated in 1984 for the Olympics in Los Angeles to the amount that \nhas now been appropriated and is going to be appropriated for the \nOlympics in Salt Lake City, showing the step-up from Los Angeles to \nAtlanta to Salt Lake City.\n  Inasmuch as Washington, DC, has announced its intention to bid on the \nOlympic games in either 2008 or 2012, I think now is an appropriate \ntime, as the Senator from Arizona has suggested, to talk about the role \nof the Federal Government with respect to the Olympic games.\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\n  The GAO report makes this comment with which I am sure the Senator \nfrom Arizona would agree and with which I agree. I think it is a very \nappropriate comment. It says:\n\n       Despite the lack of a specifically authorized Government-\n     wide role in the Olympic games, the Federal Government has, \n     in effect, become a significant supporter of the Games when \n     hosted in the United States. Accordingly, Congress may want \n     to consider enacting legislation to establish a formal role \n     for the Federal Government and a Government-wide policy \n     regarding Federal funding and support for the Olympic Games \n     when hosted in the United States.\n\n  I think that is a very sound recommendation on the part of GAO. It \nresonates with the concerns raised by the Senator from Arizona.\n  I lived in Los Angeles in 1984 and watched the Olympic games from the \nstandpoint of a resident. Let me add a little history to the history \nthat has been referred to on the floor this afternoon.\n  In 1984, as I recall--I could be wrong, but my memory tells me--Los \nAngeles was the only city bidding for the Olympic games. The games were \nseen as an economic disaster for any city unfortunate enough to end up \nas the host. There were examples all over the world of cities that had \nhosted the Olympic games and ended up with huge deficits which took \nthem years and years to pay off. Nobody wanted the Olympic games. Los \nAngeles got the Olympic games almost by default. They hired an \nextraordinary individual named Peter Ueberroth to serve as the manager \nof that event, and Peter Ueberroth did something that was both very \ngood and, in retrospect, maybe not so good for the Olympic movement. He \nbrought in for the first time on a serious basis big money sponsors.\n  I remember reading in the Los Angeles Times after the Olympic games \nwere over that there was a surplus in the Olympic account of $30 \nmillion that would be turned over to the city of Los Angeles. There \nwere further newspaper stories that said: No, the surplus is $60 \nmillion. No, we have looked through the books, the surplus is $100 \nmillion. I don't remember now what it ended up being. But it was, for \nthe time, a comparatively staggering amount of money. There were jokes \nmade in Los Angeles about the fact that everything was available as the \nofficial filled in the blanks.\n  I remember going with my family to watch the women's marathon. It was \nthe only event we attended in the Los Angeles 1984 Olympic games \nbecause it was the only one that was free. We couldn't afford to buy \nthe tickets at that time. As the father of six children, I think other \npeople can understand that particular problem. We stood there on the \nsidelines and watched the Olympic runners come down. We cheered for the \nAmericans. We were excited. Then after it was over, in the spirit of \nthe time, one of the officials of the games turned to us and said, Do \nyou want an official Olympic sponge? They had handed sponges filled \nwith water to the runners as they went by, and the runners cast them \noff.\n  Everything was an ``official Olympic'' this or that and had a price \ntag attached to it. I remember Kodak was very concerned because Peter \nUeberroth put the official Olympic film up for bid and Kodak said: You \ncan't possibly have an official Olympic film that isn't an American \nfilm. Ueberroth said: Make your bid. Fuji Film outbid Kodak. We had \nover the Olympics in Los Angeles a large green blimp with ``Fuji Film'' \non it. Fuji Film was the official Olympic film for the 1984 Los Angeles \nOlympics.\n  As I say, the number came out to be ultimately something close to \n$100 million. It transformed the Olympic movement. From that moment \nforward, everybody wanted to be the host city for the Olympic games. \nAnd everybody assumed that if they could somehow get that plum for \ntheir city, they would receive a very substantial economic payoff. But \nonce you start down that road psychologically, a number of interesting \nthings happen. And an interesting thing happened to the Olympic \nmovement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator be good enough to yield \nfor a moment for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I note that we are going to hear from former Vice \nPresident Quayle at 6 p.m., and Senator Stevens wanted to address the \nSenate. Just as a point of information, I welcome the chance to be able \nto address the Senate tomorrow. If the Senator is going to continue for \na while, if he could let us know, because I wanted to have the \nopportunity to hear from Mr. Quayle and also to accommodate Senator \nStevens. The Senator is addressing a very important matter that is \nrelevant to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona. Could he give us \nany indication?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his inquiry. \nSince I have no prepared remarks, I am responding directly to the \nremarks of the Senator from Arizona. I can't put an exact timeframe on \nit. I will try to restrain my enthusiasm for the sound of my own voice \nand finish in maybe 15 or 20 minutes--something in that timeframe. I \nwill do my best to do it faster. I understand the Senator from Alaska \nno longer requires any time. So the Senator from Massachusetts could \nspeak right up to the time we go into the session with the former Vice \nPresident.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I may go back, the reaction out of Los \nAngeles caused the leaders of the Olympic movement to also get dollar \nsigns in their eyes, and the Olympics began to expand. The assumption \nwas, if the costs go up at the International Olympic Committee or the \ncosts go up at the U.S. Olympic Committee, no problem; we will just \nsell a few more sponsorships and be able to pay for it without any \ndifficulty.\n  So one started chasing the other, and the number of sponsorships sold \nkept going higher and the costs kept going higher.\n  One aspect of the cost going up has been the addition of new sports. \nInterestingly enough, the number of sports that will participate in the \nSalt Lake City Olympics in 2002 is significantly higher than the number \nthat participated at Lillehammer in, I believe, 1994. In just that \nshort period of time, the cost of putting on the Olympics has been \nexpanded by a significant percentage--I do not have the number \ncurrently available--by adding additional sports. The organizers of the \nSalt Lake Olympic Committee have told me that even though their budget \nis very close to the budget at Lillehammer, their costs are \nsubstantially higher because of the additional sports that have been \nadded.\n  Somewhere along the line, someone lost track of what happens to all \nof this. Again, the head of the Salt Lake organizing committee, Mit \nRomney, has told me that the budget he was handed from the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee implied more sponsorships for the winter Olympics than \nAtlanta had for the summer Olympics in 1996. He has to go out and sell \nthose sponsorships now because the budget has built into the assumption \nthat money will be there. He is still approximately $40 million or $50 \nmillion shy of being able to cover his budget even though he has \noutsold the sponsorships that went into Atlanta. He has more \nsponsorship money coming from Atlanta for the winter games, which are \nless popular than the summer games, and he is still money short.\n  That is what has happened as everybody, reacting to what happened in \nLos Angeles in 1984, has assumed that the Olympics are a pot of gold. \nThey are clearly not a pot of gold. And we are getting to the point \nwhere we may be back to the Los Angeles games when no city wanted to \nhost it because they would end up with a major deficit.\n  I said to Mit Romney: Will we have a deficit in Salt Lake? He said: \nNo, we will not have a deficit because, if absolutely necessary, we \nwill cut back to whatever amount of money we have.\n  We don't want to have America host Olympics that seem to be second \nclass by comparison to the rest of the world. But financially we have \nno choice if we can't close that gap.\n  I believe Mit Romney will be able to close that gap. I believe he \nwill be able to bring it down so that we will have an exact meeting of \nexpenses and revenues.\n  But in this whole picture comes the question that has been raised by \nthe Senator from Arizona: What is the role of the Federal Government? \nIncreasingly, the Federal Government plays an important role in the \nOlympics because, increasingly, as the Olympics get bigger and bigger, \nwith more and\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\nmore nations, more and more athletes, and more and more opportunities \nfor international terrorism, they become a bigger and bigger problem \nfor the Federal Government.\n  I think the whole question raised by the Senator from Arizona and by \nthe GAO report as to the formalization of the Federal role is a very \nlegitimate question. I think the proposal in the GAO report that was \nendorsed by the Senator from Arizona that there be a formal involvement \nfrom OMB and a formal process within the Congress to track these \nappropriations is a right and proper proposal. We probably should have \ndone it after the Atlanta Olympics when we had the first indication \nthat this was what was going to happen. We didn't.\n  I am perfectly willing to join with the Senator from Arizona to craft \na way to do this once the Salt Lake City Olympics are over. If \nWashington, DC, or some other American city gets the Olympics at some \npoint in the future, this process will be in place. I think it is the \nresponsible thing to do. I applaud the Senator from Arizona in helping \nmove in that direction.\n  I point out, as the GAO report says, with respect to the $2 billion \nfigure used by the Senator from Arizona:\n\n       According to Federal officials, most of these funds would \n     have been awarded to these cities or States even if they had \n     not hosted the Olympic games although the funds could have \n     been provided later if the games were not held.\n\n  Let me talk specifically about the two largest items in that $2 \nbillion figure that relate to Salt Lake City: the mass transit in \ndowntown Salt Lake City and the renovation of I-15, the interstate \nhighway that runs through Salt Lake City. Both projects were properly \nauthorized, properly funded, under established congressional procedures \nwith respect to transportation activities. I-15 was 10 years beyond its \ndesigned life when renovation construction began. The project was \noutlined for 9 years under standard construction procedures.\n  The State of Utah, working with the Federal Highway Administration, \ncame up with a method of doing it which is called design/build; that \nis, you design it while you are building it. Instead of designing it \nall first and then building it, you do it simultaneously. In the \nprocess, they cut the time from 9 years to 4\\1/2\\. They also cut the \ncost by close to $1 billion.\n  Yes, it will be done in time for the Olympics. Yes, it will enhance \nthe Olympics. And GAO has included its total in its calculation of the \ncost of the Olympics. But it had to be done. It was a logical expense \nof the highway trust fund. It was funded in the normal fashion through \nthe highway trust fund, and because of the pressure the Olympics put on \nit in terms of time, we now have a pilot project with design/build that \nis coming in ahead of schedule and under budget. We are saving \ntaxpayers money by virtue of the pressure that the Olympics put on this \nhighway project.\n  There is absolutely no question that the money would have been spent \neven if the Olympics had not come to Salt Lake City. It may not have \nbeen spent as wisely or as prudently as it is being spent if we had not \nhad the pressure of the Olympics.\n\n  The second issue is the mass transit system in Salt Lake City. The \nmass transit system in Salt Lake City, again, stood in queue with all \nof the other mass transit systems that were being reviewed by the \nDepartment of Transportation. It was approved in the Clinton \nadministration as an appropriate transit program for a metropolitan \narea experiencing tremendous growth and congestion. It is interesting \nto me to note that the current construction of mass transit in Salt \nLake City is going forward even though there was no assurance that it \nwould be completed in time for the Olympic games. In other words, the \nDepartment of Transportation approved the full funding grant agreement \nfor that spur of the mass transit system with the full knowledge that \nit might not be available for the Olympics.\n  Now, the contractors who were building it insisted it would be \navailable for the Olympics. It certainly will help the Olympics. But it \nwas not approved as an Olympic project. It was not examined as an \nOlympics project. It was not evaluated by the Department of \nTransportation as an Olympics project. Its cost, however, is included \nin the GAO study as an Olympics project because it occurred in the \nperiod where things were being spent in Utah.\n  I make a footnote with respect to I-15, the interstate highway. It is \nbeing funded largely by State funds. The Federal dollars only became \navailable after TEA-21 passed in 1998 and the State decided we couldn't \nwait. Had we not had the Olympics and waited for full Federal \nparticipation in this portion of the interstate, the State of Utah \nwould be paying less than it is now. So the State of Utah has put up a \nsubstantial sum of money by virtue of this for this infrastructure. We \ndo not complain because we will have the benefit of that infrastructure \nafter the games are over. However, I want to make it clear to any who \nare keeping score that if you take the $2 billion figure to which the \nSenator from Arizona referred that is part of the GAO report and break \nit down, you come up with a much smaller figure for the Federal \nparticipation in the Olympics games that has nothing to do with \nanything else; that is, you have a much smaller figure for Federal \nexpenditures that are solely Olympics expenditures than anything like \nthe $2 billion.\n  Now, back to the earlier point, that we must address the question of \nthe Federal role. Let us look what the Olympics do to any country that \ngets them in today's world. My wife and I went to Nagano, Japan, to see \nthe Olympics put on in Japan. We read the Japanese newspapers. We \ndidn't come up with a firm figure, but the Japanese newspapers \nspeculated that the total amount that Japan as a country spent in order \nto put on the Olympics--the lowest figure I read was $13 billion; the \nhighest figure I read was $18 billion, given the kind of accounting \nsleight of hand that accompanied the Japanese Olympics. I think the \nhigher figure may very well be the accurate one. Even if we take the \nlower figure, Japan decided they could not put on an Olympics worthy of \nworld attention without making such infrastructure improvements as to \nspend ultimately $13 billion. I participated in the benefits of that. I \nrode the bullet train from downtown Tokyo to Nagano where the Olympics \nwere held. They decided they couldn't put on the Olympics without \nputting in a bullet train.\n  We, in the United States, view the Olympics as basically a sporting \nevent. The rest of the world views the Olympics very differently, and \nonce a city in a country in the rest of the world is awarded the \nOlympics, the entire national government of that country becomes \nengaged. We need to think this one through as a nation. If we ever want \nto hold the Olympic games in the United States again and have the games \nbe presented to the world on anything like the level that the world has \ncome to expect for the Olympics, we are going to have to face the fact \nthat the Federal Government must be involved in a formal kind of way.\n  The GAO comments about this just growing upon us are correct and a \nformal examination of the American Federal Government participation in \nthe Olympics is overdue. The fact is, now no city in this country can \nbid for, accept, and put on the Olympic games without significant, \nmaybe even in the view of the Senator from Arizona, massive Federal \nsupport. The Clinton administration has recognized that. I have been a \nlong critic of the Clinton administration in a number of areas, but in \nthis area I must say that the Clinton administration has stepped up to \nthe plate and supported absolutely everything that has to be done to \nsee that the Olympics are put on in an appropriate way.\n  I salute the people in the OMB with whom we have worked, the people \nin the White House staff with whom we have worked in a collaborative \nway to bring this all together to see that we will have a responsible \nOlympic games.\n  The Olympic games in Salt Lake City in 2002 are going to be fabulous. \nWe have the best mountains, the best snow, the best facilities. It is \ngoing to be a fabulous experience for the entire world, and all \nAmericans are going to be very proud of the job that the Salt Lake \nOlympic Organizing Committee will do in putting that on. But the Salt \nLake organizing committee could not do it without the kind of support \nthat has been provided by all of the Federal agencies who have been \ncalled upon in the various appropriations bills that have gone through.\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\n  As we look to the future and anticipate the possibility that at some \npoint some other American city will either gain the summer games, as \nAtlanta did, or the winter games, as Salt Lake City did, we should put \nin place the recommendations of the GAO and recognize right up front \nthat it is a national effort, it is a Federal responsibility, as well \nas a city responsibility, and perform as every other country in the \nworld performs with respect to this particular opportunity.\n  If we decide as a Congress that we do not want Federal participation \nin the Olympic games, make that decision clear, then no American city \nwill ever host the Olympic games again because no American city can \never afford the kinds of things that are required.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for raising this issue, for bringing \nus to an understanding of the importance of the recommendations that \nthe GAO has made, and for giving me the opportunity to give these \nspecifics about the $2 billion figure. The Federal Government, in fact, \nwill spend far less than that figure, far less than $1 billion, far \nless than however many hundreds of millions of dollars. I do not know \nthe number. I do not know anybody who does. I will try to find it out \nand bring it to the floor at some point. It will be less than any other \nfederal government has spent to bring the Olympics to their host \ncountry, but it demonstrates to us that we have to have the kind of \nplanning and coordination for which the Senator from Arizona calls.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his indulgence. I ask how \nmuch time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah has 18 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have nothing further to say. I probably \nshould not have said as much as I did. If there is no Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum and request that it be \ncharged to both sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have had brought to my attention since \nI finished my extemporaneous remarks some information about the funding \nof the Olympics that I would like to now share and put into the Record.\n  This is a draft statement that was prepared for Mit Romney. I do not \nwant to put these words in his mouth until he has had an opportunity to \nreview it. It has come from his staff. I believe it is accurate. I will \nshare some of this information with you.\n  First, Federal spending for activities directly associated with the \ngames is entirely appropriate when it is within traditional areas of \npublic responsibility. Example: Two-thirds of the costs are for public \nsafety activities, such as providing counterterrorism support. Other \nareas where the Government is involved include visas, customs, \ntransportation to the public, and weather information infrastructure--\nall traditional governmental responsibilities.\n\n  The statement says the Olympic games are essentially a mission of \npeace entirely consistent with the objectives of our country and \nrecognizing that the Government spends billions of dollars to maintain \nwartime capability, it is entirely appropriate to invest several \nhundred million to promote peace. That is an editorial comment.\n  With respect to the funding and the GAO report, there are two types \nof unrelated spending combined under the term ``Federal funding.'' \nFirst is spending actually required to host an Olympic games; and, \nsecond, spending on projects the Government would have funded whether \nor not the Olympics occur. I have already talked at great length about \nthe second aspect--funding that would have been spent regardless of \nwhether or not the Olympics have occurred.\n  Direct Olympics spending; that is, spending that occurs solely \nbecause of the Olympics, as accounted in GAO's report, is about $254 \nmillion, not the $1.3 billion that was in the headlines. I repeat that: \nAbout $254 million is the direct spending, and it goes for the items \nthat are referred to up above--visas, customs, transportation, weather \ninformation and, of course, security and counterterrorism, as indicated \nby the $14.8 million to which the Senator from Arizona referred that \nwas requested by the Secret Service.\n  I add one other comment to this. The Senator from Arizona talked \nabout future appropriations. We are pretty much over the hump with this \nyear's appropriations. We cannot spend money in fiscal 2002 for Olympic \ngames that are going to be held in February of 2002. So the 2001 fiscal \nyear budget, which we are involved in here, is the big-ticket item.\n  Once we are past this budget cycle, there will be some additional \nfunds in the next year, but they will be much smaller than the funds \nthat are included this year. I say to my colleagues, I know of no funds \nin the 2001 bills that are yet to come before us that have not, in \nfact, been authorized in the appropriate procedure to which the Senator \nfrom Arizona referred.\n  So, Mr. President, I speculated as to what the number was in my \nextemporaneous remarks. I have now had the number given to me. The \nactual number of Olympics-only Federal spending is in the neighborhood \nof $250, $254 million. I make that additional correction to the Record.\n\n\n        expansion of chicago high-density drug trafficking area\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto engage the Chairman of the Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. My state has an emerging methamphetamine problem, \nwhich is an unmet need of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nprogram. To tackle this problem successfully, Congress should provide \nfunding in fiscal year 2001 to implement the expansion of the Chicago \nHigh Intensity Drug Trafficking Area to the Southern and Central \nDistricts of Illinois.\n  Over the last three years, seizures of methamphetamine laboratories \nin Illinois have increased by 925 percent. In 1999 alone, 246 \nmethamphetamine laboratories were seized in Illinois (more than all \nprevious years combined), and methamphetamine-related crime in the \nstate is at an all-time high, according to the Illinois State Police. \nIf this trend continues, Illinois can expect to see an exponential \ngrowth of methamphetamine activities in the next two or three years, \nsimilar to what has occurred in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Iowa.\n  I recognize that the final version of the Treasury and General \ngovernment Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001 includes an \nadditional $14,500,000 to expand existing HIDTAs or fund newly \ndesignated HIDTAs. I would like to ask the Chairman a question: is it \nyour expectation that a portion of these funds will be used to \nimplement the expansion of the Chicago HIDTA to the Southern and \nCentral Districts of Illinois?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, that is my expectation.\n\n\n                 national drug-free workplace alliance\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask that I be allowed to enter into a \ncolloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Treasury and General \nGovernment Subcommittee, Senator Campbell, regarding the importance of \nthe National Drug-Free Workplace Alliance.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I understand the Senator's interest in this area.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to take a few minutes to describe the \nimportance of the National Drug-Free Workplace Alliance. The goal of \nthe Alliance is to promote and assist the establishment of drug-free \nworkplace programs and provide comprehensive drug-free workplace \nservices to American businesses. As you know, drug abuse is prevalent \nin the American workplace. One in 12 employees uses illegal drugs. \nEqually troubling is that drug and alcohol abusers file about 5 times \nas many workers compensation claims as non-abusers, and 47 percent of \nall industrial accidents in the United States are related to drugs and/\nor alcohol. The Alliance will not only serve as a valuable resource to \nbusinesses, but also to the many organizations across the country\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\ndevoted to drug free workplaces. Two such organizations in my state, \nArizonans for a Drug-Free Workplace and Drugs Don't Work, would greatly \nbenefit from working with the Alliance.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Subcommittee is increasingly aware of the problems \nthat drugs pose in the workplace. Helping businesses to address such a \nproblem will greatly benefit our communities and children. I look \nforward to working with my colleague to address your concerns.\n  Mr. KYL. Once again I would like to thank the distinguished Chairman.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this conference report \non the legislative branch appropriations bill. The reasons for my \nopposition have much to do with the process by which this conference \nreport has come to us. As I said in my statement this May during debate \non the motion to proceed to the foreign operations appropriations bill, \nthe character of the Senate has been changing. This conference report \nis yet another example of that change. And the change has not been for \nthe better.\n  The Senate sent to conference a $2\\1/2\\ billion legislative branch \nappropriations bill. The House majority leadership took that conference \non a relatively modest bill and shoveled into it a $55 billion tax cut \nand a $30 billion appropriations bill for the Treasury Department, the \nPostal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain \nindependent agencies. This is an abuse of the powers of the majority.\n  Mr. President, the Senate may be calloused to the accelerating number \nof abuses that we have witnessed in the past few years. And this \ngrowing indifference may have given some comfort to those who are \nspearheading this particular offensive.\n  But, Mr. President, there is a facet to this latest effort that makes \nit especially worthy of opposition. For adopting this conference \nreport, now shielded from amendment, removes the opportunity to force \nan open debate of a $3,800 pay raise for every Member of the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives.\n  By bringing the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill to the Senate \nfloor for the first time in this conference report, without Senate \nfloor consideration, the majority prevents anyone from offering an \namendment on that bill to block the pay raise. The majority makes it \nimpossible even to put Senators on record in an up-or-down vote \ndirectly for or against the pay raise. The majority has thus perfected \nthe technique of the stealth pay raise.\n  And the majority also makes it impossible to link this congressional \npay raise directly to other pay issues of importance to the American \npeople. With this abuse of the rules, the majority makes it impossible \nto consider, among other things, an amendment that would delay the \ncongressional pay raise until working Americans get a much-needed raise \nin the minimum wage.\n  The majority leadership thus appears to believe that cost-of-living \nadjustments make sense for Senators and Congressmen, but that cost-of-\nliving adjustments do not make sense for working people making the \nminimum wage.\n  The abuse of the process that brings us here today prevents the \nSenate from rectifying this injustice. If the Senate were considering \nthe regular Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, a Senator could offer \nan amendment that would point out inequities like this. And that, in \nthe end, might help explain why the majority is using this procedure \ntoday. That might explain why we are not considering the regular \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill, but are considering an unamenable \nconference report.\n  This unamendable conference report culminates the technique of the \nstealth pay raise. As my colleagues are aware, it is an unusual thing \nto have the power to raise our own pay. Few people have that ability. \nMost of our constituents do not have that power. And that this power is \nso unusual is good reason for the Congress to exercise that power \nopenly, and to exercise it subject to regular procedures that include \ndebate and amendment.\n  The question of how and whether Members of Congress can raise their \nown pay was one that our Founders considered from the beginning of our \nNation. In August of 1789, as part of the package of 12 amendments \nadvocated by James Madison that included what has become our Bill of \nRights, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the \nConstitution providing that Congress could not raise its pay without an \nintervening election. Almost exactly 211 years ago, on September 9, \n1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September of 1789, \nCongress submitted the amendments to the states.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin State Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by three-fourths of the states.\n  The 27th amendment to the constitution now states: ``No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.'' Now, today's action does not violate the letter of the \nConstitution, because it is the result of a 1989 law that provides for \na regular cost-of-living adjustment for congressional pay. But stealth \npay raises like the one that the Senate allows today certainly violate \nthe spirit of that amendment.\n  Mr. President, this practice must end. To address it, I intend to \nintroduce legislation that ends the automatic cost-of-living adjustment \nfor congressional pay.\n  The conference report before us today took its final shape just \nbefore the August recess, during what were reported to be all-night, \nclosed-door meetings. The House majority leadership then tried to \nmuscle this conference report through the House on the day before the \nrecess. The bill survived a procedural vote by just four votes, 214 to \n210. with Representatives anxious to begin their August recess, the \nHouse leadership decided to postpone further action until this month.\n  The conference report before us today includes the Treasury Postal \nbill. The Senate never had a chance to consider the Treasury Postal \nbill that is now part of this conference report. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee ordered the bill reported on July 20. It is \navailable for Senate consideration as a separate bill.\n  This conference report on an appropriations bill also includes a \nrepeal of the telephone excise tax. Now repealing the telephone tax is \nprobably the best tax cut idea that we will get in this Congress. I \nvoted to repeal the telephone tax during consideration of the estate \ntax bill.\n  But that was a tax bill. Today, we are being asked to enact that tax \ncut on an appropriations bill. A tax cut that will cost $55 billion \nover the next decade should not be added in the middle of the night in \na conference on a $2\\1/2\\ billion appropriations bill.\n  As well, the conference report also makes budget process law changes. \nSection 1002 of the conference report changes the limits on outlays set \nin the current budget resolution for defense and non-defense spending. \nIt shifts $2 billion from non-defense spending to defense spending. \nMaking this budget process change violates the rules. Section 306 of \nthe Congressional Budget Act prohibits including budget process changes \nlike this in a bill that is not a budget process bill.\n  Some may argue that if we do not enact this conference report with \nthis abuse of the process, then the leadership will confront us with an \neven greater abuse of process in the form of an even larger omnibus \nappropriations bill. Even were that so, my colleagues, we here cannot \nand must not give the leadership a blank check to include any matter \nthat they choose. And we most certainly can demand that Congress do \nwhat we can to ensure that we get no pay raise until such time as \nCongress has enacted a raise in the minimum wage.\n  This is a matter of principle, because this conference report does \nnot honor the principles of debate and amendment that undergird the \nrules of this Senate.\n  And this is a matter of fairness, because this conference report \nallows a $3,800 pay raise for Senators and Congressmen, before the \nCongress has enacted a $1,000 pay raise for working Americans making \nthe minimum wage.\n  The majority has sought to prevent votes on this pay raise. By \npreventing\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nvotes on amendments, they have made this final vote on this conference \nreport the single vote that will allow the congressional pay raise to \nhappen. A Member who wants to prevent a congressional pay raise before \nwe have a raise in the minimum wage has this one opportunity to vote \nagainst it.\n  It is for these reasons that I will vote against this conference \nreport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8748-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, this is the third in a series of five \nstatements I am making on the issue of providing a prescription drug \nbenefit for senior Americans. This continues the discussion I began \nlast Thursday on the subject of how to modernize the Medicare program \ninto one which will meet the needs of 21st century seniors in America.\n  Last week, we discussed the need to fundamentally reform the Medicare \nprogram by shifting its focus from treating acute illness to promoting \nand maintaining wellness, essentially converting the Medicare program \nfrom one which has an orientation towards dealing with the disease or \nthe results of an accident after they have occurred--a sickness \nsystem--to one that attempts to maintain the highest quality of \nhealth--a wellness system.\n  We discussed the fact that access to affordable prescription \nmedications is crucial to the success of a health care system based on \nkeeping seniors healthy, well, and active. And virtually every modality \nthat is established to maintain the highest state of good health for \nseniors involves access to prescription drugs.\n  Additionally, we discussed that, in the long run, providing seniors \nwith access to those components of an effective wellness system, such \nas preventive screening, medical procedures, and appropriate \nprescription drug therapies, can yield significant savings for the \nMedicare program and thus for the American taxpayer as well as \nproviding the enormous benefits to the senior of good health and the \nactive lifestyle that that will allow.\n  Let's look at the case of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease \ncharacterized by low bone mass, deterioration of bone tissue, leading \nto bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures, \nparticularly of the hip, spine, and wrist.\n  Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for 28 million \nAmericans. Eighty percent of those 28 million Americans are women. \nOsteoporosis is responsible for more than 1.5 million fractures \nannually in the United States. Included in this 1.5 million are 300,000 \nhip fractures, 700,000 vertebra fractures, 250,000 wrist fractures, and \nmore than 300,000 fractures in other parts of the anatomy. Estimated \nnational direct expenditures, including those for hospitals and nursing \nhomes, for osteoporosis and related fractures is $14 billion a year.\n  The National Academy of Sciences and the National Institutes of \nHealth agree that osteoporosis is highly preventable. A combination of \na healthy lifestyle, with no smoking or excessive alcohol use, and bone \ndensity testing and medication and hormone therapies can keep men and \nwomen prone to this disease well and free of the debilitating, \nsometimes fatal, effects of fractures. Seniors and near seniors must \nhave access to screening, counseling, and appropriate medication to \nkeep this ``silent killer'' at bay.\n  One of the most common prescriptions for osteoporosis prevention is a \ntreatment referred to as Fosamax. The annual cost of Fosamax is \napproximately $750. Contrast that with a hip replacement where the \nsurgery and followup therapy will cost the Medicare program and \ntaxpayers over $8,000.\n  It makes both programmatic and economic sense that these preventive \ninterventions be included under the big tent of Medicare. They should \nbe treated as all of the other benefits that 98 percent of those \neligible for Medicare enjoy today.\n  Let me restate the fact that Part B of Medicare--that is the part \nthat, among other things, covers physicians and outpatient services--is \na voluntary program that seniors must elect to get the benefits and to \npay the monthly premiums for participation in Part B. How many seniors \nin America who are eligible for that component of Medicare in fact make \nthat election and pay that monthly fee to get those benefits? The \nanswer: 98 percent of eligible seniors voluntarily elect to participate \nin Part B of Medicare.\n  Seniors trust and rely on Medicare. As a result, virtually all who \nare eligible to join voluntarily elect to do so. When the Federal \nGovernment decides that it should participate in providing a \nprescription drug benefit for American seniors, that benefit is best \nplaced under the same big tent of the Medicare program.\n  Now, this is not a unanimous opinion. Some of my Senate colleagues \nbelieve that a prescription drug benefit should be left outside the \ntent, left to a sideshow status, if you will. In order to determine \nwhich way is truly the best way, the main tent of Medicare or a \nsideshow, it is important to answer some key questions.\n  Question 1 is what do the customers, the seniors and the people who \nlive with disabilities, what do they want? How would they prefer this \nprogram to be organized and administered? We all know the old saying \nthat the customer is always right. This will surely be true for the new \ndrug benefit that we will offer to Medicare beneficiaries. Congress \nmust learn to ask and to listen--in health care terminology, to first \ndiagnose before we proceed to prescribe.\n  This should have been the lesson learned from Congress' ill-\nconsidered decision to add catastrophic coverage to Medicare in the \nlate 1980s. We prescribed before we listened. When we listen, seniors \ntell us they like the Medicare program. Ninety-eight percent of them \nvoluntarily elect to participate. In 1998, the Kaiser Family Foundation \nfound that 74 percent of seniors surveyed believed that Medicare was \ndoing a good job serving their interests.\n  Seniors tell us that while Medicare is not perfect, it is convenient, \naffordable, and dependable. They never worry that the benefits will \nsuddenly disappear or become too expensive. They like the universality \nof the Medicare program. No matter where they are--in Kansas, in Utah, \nor in Florida--the benefits are available and affordable. They don't \nwant to worry, as they would in some plans, that an income of $16,000 a \nyear would make them ``too wealthy'' to qualify for help.\n  Including the prescription drug benefit in Medicare would offer peace \nof mind. But don't take my word for it. Another recent poll conducted \nby the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University showed that when \nseniors are given the choice of having the Federal Government \nadminister a Medicare prescription drug benefit versus the alternative \nof having the Government help to pay for private insurance plans, 36 \npercent chose the private option; 57 percent of the respondents \npreferred to have the benefit as part of an expanded Medicare program.\n  We hear over and over in statements on the Senate floor and \noccasionally even in political ads that Americans will be better off if \nprescription drug benefits are not made part of the Medicare program. \nBut when we listen to the people, not to just political rhetoric, what \nwe find is that Medicare beneficiaries do not complain about Medicare. \nRather, we hear a desire to expand Medicare to include real \nprescription drug benefits. We should listen to these voices of the \ncustomers.\n  Question 2: Will a true Medicare benefit or a program that relies on \nprivate and State insurers be the most reliable? Predictability, \nsustainability, reliability are important qualities for America's \nseniors. The bill I have introduced with Senators Robb, Bryan, Conrad, \nChafee, and Jeffords assures that all beneficiaries, including those in \nunderserved and rural areas, would be guaranteed a defined, accessible, \naffordable, and stable benefit for the same monthly premium nationwide. \nMedicare would subsidize benefits directly and pay for prescription \ndrug costs as any other Medicare benefit.\n  In contrast, the plan that is being proposed by Governor George W. \nBush and by House Republicans and by some\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\nMembers of this body asserts that prescription medications are a \nsideshow act and should not be included under the big tent of Medicare. \nThey have outlined plans and introduced legislation to accomplish that \nobjective.\n  We have heard from our colleagues that seniors do not want big \ngovernment involved in their prescription drug benefit. My colleagues \nhave said that the Vice President's plan and even the plan that has \nbeen introduced by a bipartisan group of our colleagues is a one-size-\nfits-all plan without adequate choice. Governor Bush attacks the Vice \nPresident's plan in his latest television ad entitled ``Compare,'' \nsaying that ``Al Gore's prescription drug plan forces seniors into a \ngovernment-run HMO.''\n  I would like to quote from the New York Times of September 16, which \nanalyzes this latest ad. This is what the New York Times has to say \nunder the category of Accuracy:\n\n       Health maintenance organizations are not popular, so it is \n     not surprising that the commercial links Mr. Gore's \n     prescription drug plans to HMOs. But to do so is to stretch \n     the facts.\n       Mr. Gore does not force the elderly to accept his new \n     prescription drug benefit. It is voluntary. And Medicare \n     recipients can stay in traditional plans where they choose \n     their own doctors.\n       Mr. Gore's plan does rely on private benefit managers to \n     manage the program--just like private insurers do--which \n     encourages use of generic drugs and less expensive brand \n     names. But these are not HMOs.\n\n  Some critics argue that it is Mr. Bush's plan that would increase the \nnumber of older persons enrolling in managed care. Mr. Bush would give \nthe people the ability to choose between the traditional Medicare \nprogram, including a new drug benefit and government-subsidized private \ninsurance packages. A question is whether the premiums would rise for \ntraditional Medicare, causing more people to choose managed care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the New \nYork Times of September 16 be printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let's take another look at what Governor Bush and others \nin the House, as well as some of our colleagues, would offer to \nseniors. They would offer choice in their prescription drug plan, but \nthe choice is not for seniors. It is for the private insurers, the \nStates, and other entities that might choose to participate. HMOs which \nparticipate can choose to offer an affordable benefit or a \nprohibitively expensive one or no prescription drug benefit at all. \nAccording to the Health Care Maintenance Organization, this year some \n900,000 Medicare beneficiaries who had signed up with a Medicare+choice \nHMO have seen those benefits yanked away, as the HMO terminates \ncoverage.\n  Many others have seen their HMOs either eliminate the prescription \ndrug benefit, as have many in my State of Florida, or they have seen \nthat benefit substantially reduced.\n  The House Republicans' plan looks to private insurance to offer \nprescription drug policies to seniors. We have discussed time after \ntime that the private insurance industry has said it doesn't want to \noffer these plans. Maybe a reason for their disinclination to offer \nthese plans can be provided through the window of a type of plan which \nis very similar to the Republican House proposal.\n  Under the current law, there are various types of Medigap plans--\nplans that are provided by private insurers to fill gaps in the \nMedicare program. Three of these Medigap plans cover prescription drug \nbenefits. All three of these have a $250 deductible and a 50/50 cost \nsharing for coinsurance.\n  Plans labeled ``H'' and ``I'' cover drugs up to $1,250 in total \nspending and plan ``J'' covers up to $3,000 in total spending. None of \nthese three plans offer what is referred to as a stop-loss. There is \nnever a point in the process where the beneficiary is not forced to \ncontinue to pay half of the cost of their drugs.\n  Now, what does Medigap charge to get these programs which limit \ncoverage, in two cases, to $1,250, and in a third, $3,000, without a \nstop-loss provision? The average cost of these plans nationwide, per \nmonth, is $136. In my State of Florida, the average cost per month is \n$167. This gives you some idea of what seniors are going to be asked to \npay should we go to a private insurance model as the means of providing \nprescription medication. These costs are well beyond what is affordable \nfor most low-income and many middle-income seniors.\n  With the history of broad variation, high, and unpredictable premiums \nand sub-par benefit packages, it is unclear to me why a Medigap-like \napproach to designing a Medicare prescription drug benefit would be in \nthe best interest of America's seniors.\n  Finally, there is now before us a proposal for an ``immediate fix'' \nfor low-income seniors with incomes up to 150 percent of poverty in the \nform of block grants to States. Not only would this plan cover only a \nfraction of Medicare beneficiaries, it would provide a patchwork quilt \nof coverage for those individuals who did qualify for the benefit.\n  States could offer coverage consistent with their current Medicaid or \nState drug assistance programs, or could punt their programs to the \nFederal Government if they chose not to participate at all.\n  Seniors in some States would have coverage, but when they move to \nanother State, they might have no coverage, or different coverage. It \nwould be like Forrest Gump and his box of chocolates--seniors would \nnever know just what kind of coverage they would get.\n  The reason that 98 percent of Medicare-eligible beneficiaries sign up \nfor the Medicare program is that it provides reliable, quality coverage \nfor everyone equally and everywhere in the United States of America. So \nwhy would we treat a prescription drug benefit differently than we do \nfor the rest of Medicare benefits?\n  A third question is who is eligible under the program and what will \nthey get?\n  There is a great deal of rhetoric about who will be eligible under \nthe prescription drug plans being offered. For Mr. and Mrs. Jones, who \nmake $11,000 a year--100 percent of poverty--both of the plans offered \nin the Senate and by Texas Governor Bush claim that their drug coverage \nwill be completely paid for. But what will that coverage be?\n  In Texas, the Medicaid program only covers three prescription drugs a \nmonth. So Mr. and Mrs. Jones would be out of luck if they required more \nthan that. But if they moved to Illinois, the program might only cover \ndrugs for certain conditions, as is the case with that State's current \ndrug assistance program.\n  A prescription drug benefit within Medicare, such as those proposed \nby my colleagues and myself in the Senate and the Vice President, would \nensure coverage of all medically necessary prescription drugs based on \nneed without a benefit cap. That is the kind of reliability that \nseniors need. And what of my own constituent, Elaine Kett.\n  Elaine Kett is a 77-year-old woman from Vero Beach. She is a widow \nliving on a fixed income of approximately $20,000 a year. Like many of \nmy constituents, Mrs. Kett sent me a list of all the prescription drugs \nthat she takes to keep herself active and well. Every year, Elaine Kett \nmakes sacrifices to ensure that she takes the medications she needs to \nlive a normal active life. There are millions of seniors like Mrs. Kett \nin the United States today. None of them would be covered by a low \nincome block grant to the states.\n  Question Four: The final question, which approach would ensure that \nseniors have access to an affordable drug benefit--one which could be \nmost effective in holding down the escalating prices of prescription \nmedications?\n  Individuals like Mrs. Kett are not alone. We are all witnessing \nprescription drug prices climbing at record levels of over 17 percent \nper year. We are all aware of the fact that buying in bulk yields \ndiscounts. Those seniors without insurance plans that cover drugs are \non their own in the market and are faced with the higher drug prices \nthan those of us who have prescription drug coverage negotiated by a \npharmacy benefit manager.\n  Tomorrow, we will discuss the impact of the high cost of prescription \ndrugs on seniors--and what can and should be done to make prescription \nmedications more affordable for seniors.\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\n  Mr. President, our families should be secure in the fact that \nprescription medications are included in the big tent of Medicare and \nare not treated as the bearded lady outside the big tent at the circus. \nFor many seniors, prescription medications are the main event--and we \nshould treat them as such. A prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nprogram is not ``one size fits all,'' but rather one program for all. I \nlook forward to discussing why a prescription drug benefit must not \nonly be universal and accessible, but truly affordable.\n  Mr. President, when I give my fourth statement on this topic, I will \nelaborate on the question of which of the options that are before us \ninside the ``main tent'' of Medicare or the ``side tent'' of a separate \nnon-Medicare administered prescription drug benefit, and which one will \nhave the best opportunity of assuring affordability for America's \nseniors.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 16, 2000]\n\n                      A Three-Part Attack on Gore\n\n                          (By Alison Mitchell)\n\n       The Republican campaign of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick \n     Cheney has begun broadcasting a commercial, ``Compare,'' in \n     18 states in its effort to take the offensive on the issues. \n     It takes aim at Vice President Al Gore's stands on a \n     prescription drug benefit in Medicare, on education and on \n     tax cuts.\n       Producer Maverick Media.\n       On the screen. The 30-second commercial features statements \n     about Mr. Gore's proposals in black on stark white \n     background, counterposed with color pictures of Mr. Bush. It \n     then shows pictures in color of Americans of different \n     ethnicity, as it speaks of people who will not get a tax cut \n     under Mr. Gore's $500 billion plan for tax relief.\n       The script. A female announcer: ``Al Gore's prescription \n     plan forces seniors into a government-run H.M.O. Governor \n     Bush gives seniors a choice. Gore says he's for school \n     accountability, but requires no real testing. Governor Bush \n     requires tests and holds schools accountable for results. \n     Gore's targeted tax cuts leave out 50 million people--half of \n     all taxpayers. Under Bush, every taxpayer gets a tax cut and \n     no family pays more than a third of their income to \n     Washington. Governor Bush has real plans that work for real \n     people.''\n       Accuracy. Health maintenance organizations are not popular, \n     so it is not surprising that the commercial links Mr. Gore's \n     prescription drug plan to H.M.O.'s. But to do so it has to \n     stretch the facts.\n       Mr. Gore does not force the elderly to accept his new \n     prescription drug benefit. It is voluntary. And Medicare \n     recipients can stay in traditional plans where they choose \n     their own doctors. Mr. Gore's plan does rely on private \n     benefit managers to manage the program--just like private \n     insurers do--which encourages use of generic drugs and less \n     expensive brand names. But these are not H.M.O.'s.\n       Some critics argue that it is Mr. Bush's plan that would \n     increase the number of older people enrolling in managed \n     care. Mr. Bush would give people the ability to choose \n     between the traditional Medicare program including a new drug \n     benefit and government-subsidized private insurance packages. \n     A question is whether the premiums would rise for traditional \n     Medicare, causing more people to choose managed care.\n       On schools, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore both propose testing and \n     different kinds of accountability measures, but Mr. Bush's \n     proposal calls for tests that would cover more grades and be \n     more frequent than does Mr. Gore's.\n       It is true that Mr. Bush's $1.3 trillion 10-year tax-cut \n     plan would give a tax reduction to every income bracket while \n     Mr. Gore's plan for $500 million in targeted tax cuts would \n     give tax breaks only for purposes like college education or \n     child care.\n       Score card. With its tag line, ``Governor Bush has real \n     plans that work for real people,'' the spot suggests that Mr. \n     Gore is not credible and neither are his programs. But Mr. \n     Bush has his work cut out for him. Many polls show that \n     voters trust the Democratic candidate more on health care and \n     education. And while Mr. Bush may have the Republican's \n     traditional advantage when it comes to tax-cutting, right now \n     tax cuts are not one of the top concerns of voters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8750-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN MEMORY OF MURRAY ZWEBEN, FORMER SENATE PARLIAMENTARIAN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, we are fast approaching the end of this \nCongress and we have much unfinished business. While there are many \nitems of importance to the American people that remain undone, I will \nspeak today about a single bill that has been languishing for some time \ndespite the fact that it is wholly uncontroversial. That bill is S. \n671, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act.\n  This bill is important to American businesses, both big and small. As \nthe International Trademark Association explained in a letter to me on \nFebruary 9, 2000 on behalf of its 3,700 member companies and law firms, \n``the practical benefits of the Madrid system, such as ease of applying \nand renewing trademark registrations internationally, will be of \ntremendous benefit to U.S. companies'' and, in particular, the benefits \nto ``small, entrepreneurial companies which do not have the financial \nmeans to seek separate national registrations for their trademarks in \nevery country where they wish to do business.'' The bill and the \nProtocol are also supported by the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation and the Information Technology Association of America.\n  I first introduced this legislation in the 105th Congress as S. 2191 \nand again in this Congress in March, 1999. The Judiciary Committee \nreported S. 671, favorably and unanimously, on February 10, 2000. \nUnfortunately, the legislation has been languishing on the Senate \ncalendar for the past eight months. In the House of Representatives, \nCongressmen Coble and Berman sponsored and passed an identical bill, \nH.R. 769, on April 13, 1999. This marked the third time and the third \nCongress in which the House of Representatives had passed this bill.\n  There is no opposition to S. 671, nor to the substantive portions of \nthe underlying Protocol. The White House recently forwarded the \nProtocol to the Senate for its advise and consent after working to \nresolve differences between the Administration and the European \nCommunity, EC, regarding the voting rights of intergovernmental members \nof the Protocol in the Assembly established by the agreement. These \ndifferences over the voting rights of the European Union and \nparticipation of intergovernmental organizations in this intellectual \nproperty treaty are now resolved in accordance with the U.S. position. \nSpecifically, on February 2, 2000, the Assembly of the Madrid Protocol \nexpressed its intent ``to use their voting rights in such a way as to \nensure that the number of votes cast\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\nby the European Community and its member States does not exceed the \nnumber of the European Community's Member States.''\n  Shortly after this letter was forwarded by the Assembly, I wrote to \nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright requesting information on the \nAdministration's position in light of the resolution of the voting \ndispute. At a hearing of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee on April \n14, 2000, I further inquired of Secretary Albright about the progress \nthe Administration was making on this matter.\n  With the voting rights issue resolved, President Clinton transmitted \nTreaty Document 106-41, the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement \nto the Senate for ratification on September 5, 2000. United States \nmembership in the Protocol would greatly enhance the ability of any \nU.S. business, whether large and small, to protect its trademarks in \nother countries more quickly, cheaply and easily. That, in turn, will \nmake it easier for American businesses to enter foreign markets and to \nprotect their trademarks in those markets.\n  Senators Helms and Biden moved promptly to hold a hearing in the \nForeign Relations Committee on September 13, 2000 to consider the \nProtocol, and I commend them for acting quickly so this treaty may be \nconsidered by the full Senate before we adjourn. Members on both sides \nof the aisle have worked together successfully and productively in the \npast on intellectual property matters, and I am pleased to see these \nefforts again with the Protocol and implementing legislation.\n  Passage of S. 671 would help to ensure timely accession to and \nimplementation of the Madrid Protocol, and it will send a clear signal \nto the international community, U.S. businesses, and trademark owners \nthat Congress is serious about our Nation becoming part of a low-cost, \nefficient system to promote the international registration of marks.\n  The Madrid Protocol Implementation Act is part of my ongoing effort \nto update American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves \nto advance and protect American interests both here and abroad. The \nProtocol would help American businesses, and especially small and \nmedium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they expand into \ninternational markets. Specifically, this legislation will conform \nAmerican trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol \nin anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. \nRatification by the United States of this treaty would help create a \n``one stop'' international trademark registration process, which would \nbe an enormous benefit for American businesses.\n  S. 671 makes no substantive change in American trademark law but sets \nup new procedures for trademark applicants who want to obtain \ninternational trademark protection. This bill would ease the trademark \nregistration burden on small and medium-sized businesses by enabling \nbusinesses to obtain trademark protection in all signatory countries \nwith a single trademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark \nOffice. Currently, in order for American companies to protect their \ntrademarks abroad, they must register their trademarks in each and \nevery country in which protection is sought. Registering in multiple \ncountries is a time-consuming, complicated and expensive process--a \nprocess which places a disproportionate burden on smaller American \ncompanies seeking international trademark protection. The practical \nbenefits of the Madrid Protocol system will be to provide small and \nmedium-sized U.S. businesses with faster, cheaper and easier protection \nfor their trademarks.\n  I again urge the Senate to promptly consider and send to the \nPresident the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8751-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REAUTHORIZATION OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk \nabout an important issue--the critical need for Congress to reauthorize \nthe Violence Against Women Act or VAWA. It has strong bipartisan \nsupport and it should be passed before the end of this session.\n  I was a proud cosponsor of this bill when it passed in 1994 and I am \nan original cosponsor of the reauthorization bill. This is a law that \nhas helped hundreds of thousands of women and children in Iowa and \nacross the nation. It has directed millions of federal dollars in \ngrants to local law enforcement, prosecution and victim services.\n  Iowa has received more than $8 million in grants through VAWA. These \ngrants fund the Iowa Domestic Violence Hotline. They help keep the \ndoors open at domestic violence shelters, like the Family Violence \nCenter in Des Moines.\n  VAWA grants to Iowa have provided services to more than 2,000 sexual \nassault victims just this year. And more than 20,559 Iowa students this \nyear have received information about rape prevention through this \nfederal funding.\n  The numbers show that VAWA is working.

Mr. President, I speak today to make note of the \nanniversary of the signing into law of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. \nTwenty years ago today, the Reg Flex Act, as it is better known, was \nsigned into law after its passage by the 96th Congress. This historic \npiece of legislation explicitly recognized the importance of small \nbusinesses to the economy and their contributions to innovation and \ncompetition.\n  With the Reg Flex Act, Congress intended that no federal action taken \nin\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nthe name of good public policy would undermine the nation's equally \nimportant commitment to preserving competition and to maintaining a \nlevel playing field for small businesses. The law established an \nanalytical framework in which regulatory agencies were directed to \nconsider the impact on small businesses of their regulatory proposals \nand consider alternatives that would have a more equitable impact \nwithout compromising public policy objectives. The Reg Flex Act had \nbipartisan support, as well as the support of the small business \ncommunity.\n  In 1996 the Senate Small Business Committee led the effort to \nstrengthen the Reg Flex Act with the passage of the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. Under SBREFA, for the first time, \nthe courts were given jurisdiction to review agency compliance with the \nlaw and impose remedial action where necessary. This and other changes \nhave truly altered the culture within regulatory agencies. Federal \ngovernment agencies are learning that they must balance diverse public \ninterest concerns when developing regulations and they must ensure that \ntheir actions do not adversely affect small businesses and competition. \nNearly every regulation is now examined for its impact on small \nbusinesses. Although they may never know it, small businesses have \nsaved billions of dollars and countless work hours thanks to agency \ncompliance with the Reg Flex Act.\n  Mr. President, the Reg Flex Act clearly helps small businesses every \nday by compelling agencies to reduce their compliance burdens. The \nSenate should take pride in the innovative Reg Flex Act, which has \nhelped to create the best climate in the world for small business \ngrowth and prosperity. As the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business, I am pleased to have played a key role in strengthening \nthis legislation and ensuring its effective application for the benefit \nof our nation's small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8752-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8752-S8753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES IN THE ASYLUM PROCESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about two \ncritically important immigration issues--expedited removal and the \ntreatment of domestic violence victims in our asylum process. They both \narose in a case recently brought to my attention. Two months ago, Ms. \nNurys Altagracia Michel Dume fled to the United States from the \nDominican Republic. She was fleeing from the man with whom she had \nlived for the past 11 years, a man who had raped her numerous times, \nforbade her even to leave the house, and, shortly before she left, \nbought a gun, held it to her head, and threatened to kill her. This was \nnot the first time he had threatened her life.\n  She arrived here on July 17, and she was subject to expedited removal \nbecause, in her haste to escape from her abusive partner, she traveled \nwithout a valid passport. She expressed her fear of returning to the \nDominican Republic. After three days of confinement, she was accorded a \ncredible fear interview. At this crucial interview, at which she would \nhave to discuss the fact that she had been raped, she was interviewed \nby two male employees and was not represented by counsel. Under their \nnarrow interpretation of what may constitute ``credible fear of \npersecution,'' based on their interpretation of a Board of Immigration \nAppeals decision, Matter of R-A-, the INS took the position initially \nthat Ms. Michel should be sent back to the Dominican Republic. Under \ntheir interpretation any asylum claims based on a fear of domestic \nviolence would be barred. So even though they believed that Ms. \nMichel's partner might kill her if she were forced to return to her \nnative country, they nonetheless made a legal judgment that her claim \nwas invalid.\n  I cannot believe that even those supporters of the expedited removal \nprocess who forced it into law in 1996 could have intended for this \nmatter to be resolved in this way or for questions of law to be \nresolved in INS officers at a credible fear hearing. I brought this \ncase to the attention of the INS by way of a letter on August 28. The \nLawyers' Committee for Human Rights, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, and \nothers wrote, as well. I am glad to report that Ms. Michel was accorded \na second credible fear interview. At this second interview, Ms. Michel \nwas found to have a credible fear of persecution, and will now have the \nchance to raise an asylum claim.\n  Despite this reprieve, however, Ms. Michel's case reveals yet again \nthe serious flaws in expedited removal. A woman who told a compelling \nhistory about the danger she faced if returned to her country was only \nable to receive an asylum hearing after the intervention of highly \ncapable counsel and Members of both Houses of Congress. That it is not \nan effective or just system. If Ms. Michel's case had not come to the \nattention of the Lawyers' Committee, she would likely already be back \nin the Dominican Republic. If she had been forced back, I shudder to \nthink what might have happened to her.\n  People who flee their countries to escape serious danger should be \nable to have asylum hearings in the United States without having to \nnavigate the procedural roadblocks established by expedited removal. I, \nagain, call upon the Senate to consider S. 1940, the Refugee Protection \nAct, a bipartisan bill I introduced last fall with Senator Brownback \nand five other Senators of both parties. This bill would restrict the \nuse of expedited removal to times of immigration emergencies, and \ninclude due process protections in those rare times when it is used.\n\n  Expedited removal was originally instituted in the 1996 Anti-\nTerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Under expedited \nremoval, low-level INS officers with cursory supervision have the \nauthority to ``remove'' people who arrive at our border without proper \ndocumentation, or with facially valid documentation that the officer \nsimply suspects is invalid. No review--administrative or judicial--is \navailable of the INS officer's decision, which is rendered after a so-\ncalled secondary inspection interview. ``Removal'' is an antiseptic way \nof saying thrown out of the country.\n  Expedited removal was widely criticized at the time of its passage as \nignoring the realities of political persecution, since people being \ntortured by their government are quite likely to have difficulties \nobtaining valid travel documents from that government. Its adoption was \nviewed by many--including a majority of this body--as an abandonment of \nour historical commitment to refugees and a misplaced reaction to our \nlegitimate fears of terrorism.\n  When we debated the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act later the same year, I offered an amendment with \nSenator DeWine to restrict the use of expedited removal to times of \nimmigration emergencies, which would be certified by the Attorney \nGeneral. This more limited authority was all that the Administration \nhad requested in the first place, and it was far more in line with our \ninternational and historical commitments. This amendment passed the \nSenate with bipartisan support, but it was removed in one of the most \npartisan conference committees I have ever witnessed. As a result, the \nextreme version of expedited removal contained in AEDPA remained law, \nand was implemented in 1997. Ever since, I have attempted to fix the \nproblems with expedited removal.\n  The Refugee Protection Act is modeled closely on the 1996 amendment \nthat passed the Senate, and I have been optimistic that it too would be \nsupported by a broad coalition of Senators. It allows expedited removal \nonly in times of immigration emergencies, and it provides due process \nrights and elemental fairness for those arriving at our borders without \nsacrificing security concerns. But even as the Refugee Protection act \nhas gained additional cosponsors during this session, it has been \nignored by the Senate leadership. Indeed, despite my requests, the bill \nhas not even received a hearing.\n  Meanwhile, in the three and a half years that expedited removal has \nbeen in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum \nseekers who were thrown out of the country without the opportunity to \nconvince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their \nnative lands. To provide just one example, ``Dem,'' a Kosovar Albanian, \nwas summarily removed from the U.S. after the civil war in Kosovo had \nalready made the front pages of America's newspapers. During\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\nhis interview with the INS inspector who had unreviewable discretion \nover his fate, he was provided with a Serbian translator who did not \nspeak Albanian, rendering the interview a farce. Instead of being \nembraced as a political refugee, he was put on the next plane back to \nwhere his flight had originated. We only know about his story at all \nbecause he was dogged enough to make it back to the United States. On \nthis second trip, he was found to have a credible fear of persecution \nand he is currently in the midst of the asylum process.\n\n  One of the most distressing parts of expedited removal is that there \nis no way for us to know how many deserving refugees have been \nexcluded. Because secondary inspection interviews are conducted in \nsecret, we typically only learn about mistakes when refugees manage to \nmake it back to the United States a second time, like Dem, or when they \nare deported to a third country they passed through on their way to the \nU.S. This uncertainty should lead us to be especially wary of \ncontinuing this failed experiment.\n  And now we must even be concerned about the conduct of credible fear \ninterviews. When aliens subject to expedited removal express a fear of \nreturning to their home country, the law requires that they be referred \nfor a credible fear hearing. If their fear is found to be legitimate, \nthey are then allowed to make a claim for political asylum. These \ninterviews are not designed to make judgments about legal questions, \nbut simply to determine whether a person may have a valid asylum claim. \nThis process failed Ms. Michel, and we must now worry that it is \nfailing other refugees.\n  I am also concerned about the underlying legal issue in the case of \nMs. Michel and other victims of domestic violence. Last year, the Board \nof Immigration Appeals denied the asylum request of a Guatemalan woman \nwho faced likely death at the hands of her husband if she were forced \nto return home. In that decision, Matter of \nR-A-, the BIA decided that victims of domestic violence did not qualify \nas a ``social group'' under our asylum laws. The Attorney General \ncurrently has this very decision under review. It is my hope that she \nwill reverse it.\n  Last year I sent a letter to the INS Commissioner supporting the \nasylum claim of Ms. R-A. In that case, the INS did not dispute her \naccount of horrific abuse, including her claims that her husband raped \nand pistol-whipped her, and beat her unconscious in front of her \nchildren. Nor did the INS dispute that law enforcement authority in her \nnative Guatemala told her that they would not protect her from violent \ncrimes committed against her by her husband. Based on this evidence, an \nimmigration judge determined in 1996 that she was entitled to asylum, \nbut the INS appealed that ruling and convinced the BIA to reverse it. \nThat decision is currently on appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, but that court has stayed its consideration of the matter \npending the Attorney General's own review.\n  Evidence of domestic violence is sadly all too common in our asylum \nsystem. Last year, I also encouraged the INS to grant asylum to a 16-\nyear-old girl from Mexico who sought asylum in the United States after \nfleeing from a father who had beaten her since she was three years old, \nusing whips, tree branches, his fists, and a hose. Apparently, the girl \nattempted to intervene when her father was beating her mother. Again, \nlocal law enforcement failed to protect the girl, and she fled to the \nUnited States. As in R-A-, an immigration judge granted her asylum \nrequest, but the INS appealed, and the BIA reversed it.\n\n  These BIA decisions came only two years after its decision that \nFauziya Kasinga--who faced female genital mutilation if forced to \nreturn to her native Togo--was protected by our asylum laws. In making \nthis decision, the BIA found that potential victims of genital \nmutilation constituted a ``social group.'' I agree with this decision, \nand I believe that women fearing domestic violence must certainly also \nso qualify. This is especially true where--as is the case for Ms. \nMichel and many other women--the asylum applicants come from nations \nwhere law enforcement officials often turn a blind eye to claims of \ndomestic violence.\n  Of course, the problems faced by women around the world go beyond \ndomestic violence. Another stark example of the ways in which women \napplicants may be insufficiently protected by our asylum laws comes \nfrom the case of Ms. A-, a Jordanian woman seeking asylum in the United \nStates after fleeing the prospect of a so-called ``honor killing'' in \nJordan. I wrote the Attorney General in February--along with a \nbipartisan group of six other Senators--to support her asylum \napplication. Ms. A- had fallen in love with a Palestinian man who asked \nher to marry him. Her father forbade the marriage, however, because he \nwas Palestinian and had a low-paying job. Ms. A- was at that point \nfaced with the possibility that she might be pregnant and the certainty \nthat her future husband, whoever he might be, would know that she was \nno longer a virgin, a fact that would bring shame and dishonor upon her \nfamily and potentially justify her murder at her family's hands under a \nwidely-practiced Jordanian custom. She fled to the United States and \nmarried this man.\n  In June 1995, her sister informed her that their father had met with \ntheir nuclear family, uncles and cousins to demand that they kill A- \nwherever they might meet her. The State Department reported that there \nwere more than 20 ``honor killings'' in Jordan in 1998, and speculated \nthat the actual number was probably four times as high. Making matters \neven worse, these killings are typically punishable by only a few \nmonths' imprisonment.\n  Despite the very close resemblance between these facts and the facts \nin Kasinga, both an immigration judge and the BIA found that Ms. A- was \nineligible for asylum. The INS has agreed to stay further proceedings \nin the case while the Attorney General reviews the matter.\n  The existence of these problems in our asylum system shows that there \nis still work to be done, both by this Congress and in the executive \nbranch. I call upon the Senate to use some of the time we have \nremaining to address the problems in our expedited removal system, and \nupon the Attorney General and the INS to be vigilant that victims of \nrape and other forms of serious domestic abuse not be returned to their \ncountries under expedited removal. And I renew my call to the Attorney \nGeneral that we reevaluate our position on asylum eligibility for \nvictims of severe domestic violence from nations that do not take \ndomestic violence seriously. Finally, I encourage all of my colleagues \nto sign on to a letter that Senator Landrieu and I are circulating that \nwould ask the Attorney General to overturn R-A- and reaffirm our \ncommitment to human rights and women's rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8753-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8753-S8754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HUD'S GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on and give \nmy support to a worthy program called National History Day. National \nHistory Day is a year-long, nonprofit program in which children in \ngrades 6-12 research and create historical projects related to a broad \nannual theme. This year's theme was ``Turning points in History: \nPeople, Ideas, Events.'' Using this theme, students research their area \nof interest and create a project, which is then entered in an annual \ncontest. The primary goal of the National History Day program is to \nrevolutionize the techniques implemented in teaching and training our \nyouth.\n  What I want to emphasize today is the tremendous impact this unique \nand valuable program has had in my home state of New Mexico. New \nMexico's involvement with National History Day began three years ago, \nand has continued to grow and enrich the lives of New Mexico's youth. \nThe participants in the first year were few, but to date we have had \nmore than one thousand young New Mexicans participate in the state \ncompetition.\n  New Mexico students that participate in this program are given the \nopportunity to expand upon critical thinking and research skills, which \nin turn help them in all subject areas. The projects they work on give \nthem a greater appreciation of historical events that have helped shape \ntheir own hometowns as well as their nation. This hands on approach to \nhistory is an innovative way to get students excited and genuinely \ninterested in our great nation's history.\n  I know that with our support, the National History Day program will \ncontinue to grow, and I believe that this growth is essential for \ntoday's students. When students do not have an opportunity to \nparticipate in this program, they miss out on a chance to grow and to \nbetter themselves. As Pulitzer Prize winner David McCullough states:\n\n       Knowledge of history is the precondition of political \n     intelligence.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize September \nas National Library Card Sign-up Month and pay tribute to those \ndedicated individuals who, through their passion for books and \nlearning, make our libraries places of great discovery.\n  As school begins for millions of children this month, parents and \nmentors are coming together to promote one of the most important school \nsupplies, one available free to every child: a library card. With the \nsupport of the American Library Association, National Library Card \nSign-up Month spotlights the wealth of resources found at our local \npublic libraries. Libraries not only offer books, magazines, and \nreference materials, but many also provide CDs, videos, and Internet \nconnections to assist children and adults meet their educational goals.\n  There is no better place than our libraries for bringing the world \nand the events that shape it--past and present--to life. Fortunately, a \nchild doesn't need any special gadgets to experience all the library \nhas to offer; they just need their library card. A library card can \nopen the doors to space exploration, put a reader in the front seat \nwith a storm chaser, transport anyone with a good imagination back \nthousands of years in time, and offer every imaginable point of view on \nevery topic of interest.\n  Mr. President, during National Library Card Sign-up Month, I commend \nAmerica's schools and libraries for providing and promoting an \nenvironment that sparks a passion in people of all ages for books and \nlearning. And I urge parents and teachers alike to share their \nknowledge and passion for learning with our children by signing them up \nfor library cards at the local public library.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8754-5", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8754-S8755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FORMER SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR GEORGE CHRISTOPHER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I rise to \ninform my colleagues of the death of former San Francisco Mayor George \nChristopher, who passed away on September 14th at the age of 92. I \nexpress my deepest condolences to Mayor Christopher's family and to his \ncountless friends.\n  The city has lost an extraordinary civic leader--one whose grand \nvision and passion for helping people are vividly remembered by all who \nknew him.\n  Although many residents were not yet born during George Christopher's \ntwo terms as mayor from 1956 to 1964, the citizens of San Francisco \nstill benefit today from his dynamic and no nonsense leadership. People \nlike to say that San Francisco grew up during his tenure, that he made \nit a big league city. Indeed, it was George Christopher who brought the \nthen New York Giants to town.\n  Mayor Christopher changed the way San Francisco looked and the way \nits citizens looked at themselves. He transformed the City's skyline, \nbuilt the Japan Center and Candlestick Park, and he modernized \ndowntown. He built San Francisco into a cosmopolitan, world-class city.\n  The child of Greek immigrants, as mayor he ushered in an era of \nstronger civil rights consciousness and was a particular hero to San \nFrancisco's Greek community. He was a man of international stature who \nnever lost his close connection to everyday people. Mayor Christopher's \nlife was dedicated to public service, and the San\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\nFrancisco of today is in many ways a living testament to his \nachievements both in and out of office.\n  George Christopher was an exceptional leader who will be greatly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8755-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      BYRON CENTER HIGH SCHOOL NAMED 1999-2000 BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States \nDepartment of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In \neach year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the \ncountry which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and \nteacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon \nSchools are recognized because they are the finest public and private \nsecondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that \nset the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report \nthat nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. \nRiley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise \ntoday to recognize Byron Center High School in Byron Center, Michigan, \none of these nine schools.\n  Over the past eight years, Byron Center High School has transformed \nitself from a school rooted in the curriculum of the 1950's to one \nprepared for the constantly changing information age of the 21st \nCentury. A graduate of Byron Center is now technologically, \nacademically, and culturally literate. The key to this transformation \nhas been a shift of focus, as administrators stopped tinkering with \ncurriculum and teaching strategies and rather developed a comprehensive \nrestructuring model, which enabled them to more effectively address the \nentire educational process that Byron Center students are put through.\n  With the new restructuring model, Byron Center faculty and \nadministrators have focused their efforts on four areas: providing \neffective guidance to all students by improving and promoting career \nawareness programs; forming strong partnerships and effective working \nrelationships with local business and community leaders; hiring quality \nteachers and allowing them to be the leaders in the effort to improve; \nand constantly monitoring student performance, not only on state and \nnational tests, but also by conducting one year and five year follow up \nsurveys of Byron Center graduates, and collectively employing this \ninformation to determine where improvements could occur within Byron \nCenter High School to better prepare students find success in a rapidly \nchanging world.\n  The success of the transformation can clearly be seen in the new \nByron Center High School facility, which students and staff moved into \nthe fall of 1998. Dr. Robert Burt, who visited Byron Center to make the \nassessment for the Blue Ribbon Award, said that administrators ``built \nthe school around a structure of technology,'' which provided him a \n``dramatic opportunity to learn about the new age of high schools.'' \nIndeed, the facility was designed to support the curriculum, teaching \nstrategies and information technology systems that have played such a \nvital role in the overwhelmingly successful development of Byron Center \nHigh School.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the students, parents, faculty and \nadministration of Byron Center High School, for I believe this is an \naward which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it \ndoes to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I \nwould like to recognize Dr. William Skilling, the Principal of Byron \nCenter High School, whose dedication to making his school one of the \nfinest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. \nOn behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Byron \nCenter High School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, \nand wish the school continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8755-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF WILLIAM F.

He also served in \nthe Florida National Guard during the Korean Conflict. Bill married \nDoris Dillman in June, 1946, and together they had 9 children. Bill was \nthe founding pastor of Arlington Heights Baptist Church in \nJacksonville, Florida, for 15 years, before moving to Springfield's \nNoble Hill Baptist Church where he pastored for the next 26 years. In \n1995, Bill retired from the pastorate, but continued to touch the lives \nof young people with the love of God by serving as the foundations \nclass teacher at New Life Baptist Church.\n  Bill understood that preaching God's word meant more than speaking \nfrom the pulpit on Sunday; it meant action as well. Bill participated \nin Springfield and area community activities. He served as a longtime \nmember of the Springfield Northside Betterment Association and the \nBreakfast Club of the Ozarks. He served as General Manager of a 100,000 \nwatt Christian Radio Station, KWFC, in Springfield since it first \nopened in 1968.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the \nUnited States Air Force as it celebrates its 53rd anniversary. For more \nthan half a century, the men and women of the Air Force, through their \ndedicated service and sacrifice, have helped to ensure the freedom and \nsecurity of America and the world.\n  Although military aviation in this country had its beginnings in the \nArmy, less than four years after the Wright brothers made their \nhistoric first flight, it was not until 1947 that the Air Force was \nestablished as a separate branch of the armed services.\n  The birth of the Air Force itself can be traced to 1907, when the \nAeronautical Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps was organized. In \n1935, the General Headquarters was established, and the Air Corps \ngained control of tactical units under General Frank Andrews, after \nwhom Andrews Air Force Base was named. Between the years of 1939 and \n1945, this organization was known as the Army Air Force and was led by \nthe legendary General Henry ``Hap'' Arnold. In March 1942, the Army Air \nForce became coequal with the Army ground forces, a major step in the \nevolution of the Air Force.\n  Chief Army officers such as Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower witnessed \nfirsthand the vital role played by air power in World War II, and \nforesaw the increasing importance of air power in future conflicts. \nMilitary leaders recognized that the growing strategic significance of \naircraft made necessary the creation of an additional military branch, \nalongside the Army, Navy, and Marines, and in 1947 the National \nSecurity Act made the Air Force an autonomous military power.\n  Over the course of its illustrious history, the Air Force has taken \non additional responsibilities, extending its reach beyond the \natmosphere into space. In 1956, it was put in charge of all land-based \nballistic missile systems. The first missile under the control of the \nAir Force--the Atlas ballistic missile--was made operational in \nSeptember 1959. By 1965, the Air Force was responsible for the \ndevelopment of satellites, boosters, space probes, and other systems \nused by NASA. According to former Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Ronald \nR. Fogleman, America is safer in a dangerous world because of what the \nAir Force brings to our nation's defense: ``long range lethal combat \npower . . . strategic mobility . . . global awareness that comes from \nspace assets, and . . . theater air dominance.'' This has been made \npossible through a combination of highly trained service members and \nhighly sophisticated technology.\n  Thanks to the Air Force, the lives of American servicemen and women \nin all military branches are safer than ever before during times of \nconflict. Military aircraft are now able to achieve many military \nobjectives that once required ground troops, and American\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\ncasualties are greatly reduced as a result. The amazing performance of \nthe Air Force in the Persian Gulf War, which by all accounts \ndramatically reduced the number of American lives lost in that \nconflict, shows just how much we all owe our brave airmen.\n  In addition to its critical defense role, the Air Force has been \nhighly active in humanitarian and relief efforts over the years. One of \nthe most famous of these undertakings was the Berlin airlift between \nJune 1948 and June 1949. The largest airlift/evacuation in American \nhistory occurred in 1991 when the Air Force moved 52,000 military \npersonnel and dependents from the Philippines to the U.S. following the \neruption of Mt. Pinatubo. An airlift in February of 1992 provided food \nand medicine to Russia in Operation Provide Hope. Operation Provide \nPromise, a relief effort into Sarajevo in 1992, was the longest \nsustained humanitarian airlift in history. The Air Force has also been \ninvolved in hundreds and hundreds of other relief missions all over the \nworld in response to earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural \ndisasters.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to note the contributions made \nby Minnesotans and those men and women serving at Minnesota's Air Force \nbases. These airmen have made a vital contribution to the success of \nthe Air Force over the past 53 years. I would like to thank in \nparticular those serving at Minnesota's Air Force Reserve and Air \nNational Guard facilities, specifically the airmen of the 934th Airlift \nWing and 133rd Airlift Wing in Minneapolis and the 148th Fighter Wing \nin Duluth who keep our C-130s and F-16s flying. These men and women \ndeserve our thanks for making sure that we will always be prepared to \nface with confidence any future threats to our nation's security.\n  On behalf of all Minnesotans, I thank the members of the Air Force \nfor their selfless devotion to our nation's defense. Throughout the \nhistory of the Air Force, its members have made countless sacrifices \nfor their country, from the financial struggles all too often faced by \nservice members and their families, to the high price paid by those who \nhave been wounded, taken prisoner, or killed in battle. A grateful \nnation will always be in their debt.\n  I'm sure my colleagues will join me in recognizing the rich heritage \nand dedicated service of the United States Air Force on its \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8756-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8756-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS PAYMENTS MADE TO CUBA PURSUANT TO TREASURY \n   DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC LICENSES--MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 128\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 1705(e)(6) of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, \n22 U.S.C. 6004(e)(6), as amended by section 102(g) of the Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996, Public Law 104-114, \n110 Stat. 785, I transmit herewith a semiannual report detailing \npayments made to Cuba as a result of the provision of \ntelecommunications services pursuant to Department of the Treasury \nspecific licenses.\n                                                  William J.

The CDA states that licenses may be \n     issued for full or partial payment of amounts due as a result \n     of provision of telecommunications services authorized by \n     this subsection, but shall not require any withdrawal from a \n     blocked account. Following enactment of the CDA on October \n     23, 1992, a number of U.S. telecommunications companies \n     successfully negotiated agreements to provide \n     telecommunications services between the United States and \n     Cuba consistent with policy guidelines developed by the \n     Department of State and the Federal Communications \n     Commission.\n       Subsequent to enactment of the CDA, the Department of the \n     Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (``OFAC'') \n     amended the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part \n     515 (the ``CACR''), to provide for specific licensing on a \n     case-by-case basis for certain transactions incident to the \n     receipt or transmission of telecommunications between the \n     United States and Cuba, 31 C.F.R. 515.542(c), including \n     settlement of charges under traffic agreements.\n       OFAC has issued eight (8) licenses authorizing transactions \n     incident to the receipt of transmission of telecommunications \n     between the United States and Cuba since the enactment of the \n     CDA. None of these licenses permits payments from a blocked \n     account.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to require criminal background checks for nursing facility workers; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   the senior care safety act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Senior \nCare Safety Act of 2000. This bill prohibits nursing homes and other \nlong-term care facilities operating under the Social Security and \nMedicaid systems from employing individuals with a demonstrated history \nof violent, criminal behavior or drug dealing. To that end, it requires \nthese nursing facilities to conduct criminal background checks on all \nof their prospective employees as part of the hiring process. Nursing \nfacilities that fail to conduct a background check prior to hiring an \nemployee are subject to a civil fine of up to $5,000. The reason for \nthese requirements is simple: we must ensure that our most defenseless \nsenior Americans--those in need of long-term nursing care--are attended \nnot by people with a demonstrated history of violent, criminal \nbehavior, but by the most qualified and trustworthy individuals \navailable.\n  The Senior Care Safety Act provides nursing facilities with the tools \nnecessary to accomplish this objective. It requires the Department of \nJustice to open federal databases of criminal background information to \nnursing homes so that they can promptly determine if prospective \nemployees have a criminal record. The act provides that the Department \nof Justice provide this information without charge to the facility or \nthe applicant. Furthermore, it ensures that those who comply with the \nbackground check requirement are insulated from liability for refusing \nto hire someone prohibited from working in a nursing facility by this \nprovision. Finally, it guarantees the privacy of those individuals who \nare denied such employment due to a criminal record by prohibiting the \nuse by a nursing facility of an individual's background information for \nany purpose other than complying with this act.\n  It is tragic that a bill like this is necessary. But, while the \noverwhelming majority of those who care for the more than 40,000 senior \ncitizens receiving 24-hour care in my home state of Missouri, and the \nmore than 1.5 million of such seniors nationwide are dedicated and \ncaring individuals, there are unfortunately too many examples of those \nwho take advantage of this position of trust. There are far too many \nstories of convicted violent felons who have slipped through the cracks \nin the hiring process and have physically or mentally abused our \nfrailest citizens in the very institutions that their families have \nentrusted them for care. This bill will play an important role in \nensuring that when a family entrusts\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\ntheir loved ones to a nursing facility, they can rest assured that \nthose who are looking after them are not violent felons. I look forward \nto working with my fellow Senators to pass this important legislation \nin the time remaining this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3066\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require changes in the bloodborne pathogens \nstandard in effect under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\n\n               THE NEEDLESTICK SAFETY and PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to introduce \ntoday, along with Senators Enzi, Kennedy, and Reid, the Needlestick \nSafety and Prevention Act. This legislation will ensure that our \nnation's health care workers, who tend to our citizens when care is \nurgently needed, will no longer be risking their own health, and, \nperhaps, their own lives, when providing this life giving work.\n  Statistics paint a stark picture of the risks from accidental sharps \ninjuries that health care workers face daily on the job, injuries that \ncan be prevented, and, when Congress passes this legislation, will be \nprevented. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated \nthat as many as 800,000 injuries from contaminated sharps occur \nannually among health care workers. Due to these injuries, numerous \nhealth care workers have contracted fatal or other serious viruses and \ndiseases, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis \nB, and hepatitis C.\n  ``Needlesticks'' refer to the broad category of injuries suffered by \nworkers in health care settings who are exposed to sharps, including \nitems such as disposable syringes with needles, IV catheters, lancets, \nand glass capillary tubes/pipettes. The true shame in these alarming \nstatistics is that accidental needlestick injuries can be prevented. \nTechnological advancements have led to the development of safer medical \ndevices, such as syringes with needle guards or sheaths.\n  The heart of the ``Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act'' is its \nrequirement that employers identify, evaluate, and make use of \neffective safer medical devices. And the legislation emphasizes \ntraining, education, and the participation of those workers exposed to \nsharps injuries in the evaluation and selection of safer devices. The \nAct also creates new record keeping requirements, a ``sharps injury \nlog,'' to aid employers in identifying high risk areas, and in \ndetermining the types of engineering controls and devices most \neffective in reducing or eliminating the risk of exposure. Importantly, \nthe legislation we introduce today will not impede, but will encourage \ntechnological development, as it does not favor the use of a specific \ndevice, but requires an employer to evaluate the effectiveness of \navailable devices.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join us in supporting the ``Needlestick \nSafety and Prevention Act.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Numerous workers who are occupationally exposed to \n     bloodborne pathogens have contracted fatal and other serious \n     viruses and diseases, including the human immunodeficiency \n     virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C from exposure to \n     blood and other potentially infectious materials in their \n     workplace.\n       (2) In 1991 the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration issued a standard regulating occupational \n     exposure to bloodborne pathogens, including the human \n     immunodeficiency virus, (HIV), the hepatitis B virus (HBV), \n     and the hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n       (3) Compliance with the bloodborne pathogens standard has \n     significantly reduced the risk that workers will contract a \n     bloodborne disease in the course of their work.\n       (4) Nevertheless, occupational exposure to bloodborne \n     pathogens from accidental sharps injuries in health care \n     settings continues to be a serious problem. In March 2000, \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that \n     more than 380,000 percutaneous injuries from contaminated \n     sharps occur annually among health care workers in United \n     States hospital settings. Estimates for all health care \n     settings are that 600,000 to 800,000 needlestick and other \n     percutaneous injuries occur among health care workers \n     annually. Such injuries can involve needles or other sharps \n     contaminated with bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV, HBV, or \n     HCV.\n       (5) Since publication of the bloodborne pathogens standard \n     in 1991 there has been a substantial increase in the number \n     and assortment of effective engineering controls available to \n     employers. There is now a large body of research and data \n     concerning the effectiveness of newer engineering controls, \n     including safer medical devices.\n       (6) 396 interested parties responded to a Request for \n     Information (in this section referred to as the ``RFI'') \n     conducted by the Occupational Health and Safety \n     Administration in 1998 on engineering and work practice \n     controls used to eliminate or minimize the risk of \n     occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens due to \n     percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. Comments were \n     provided by health care facilities, groups representing \n     health care workers, researchers, educational institutions, \n     professional and industry associations, and manufacturers of \n     medical devices.\n       (7) Numerous studies have demonstrated that the use of \n     safer medical devices, such as needleless systems and sharps \n     with engineered sharps injury protections, when they are part \n     of an overall bloodborne pathogens risk-reduction program, \n     can be extremely effective in reducing accidental sharps \n     injuries.\n       (8) In March 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention estimated that, depending on the type of device \n     used and the procedure involved, 62 to 88 percent of sharps \n     injuries can potentially be prevented by the use of safer \n     medical devices.\n       (9) The OSHA 200 Log, as it is currently maintained, does \n     not sufficiently reflect injuries that may involve exposure \n     to bloodborne pathogens in health care facilities. More than \n     98 percent of health care facilities responding to the RFI \n     have adopted surveillance systems in addition to the OSHA 200 \n     Log. Information gathered through these surveillance systems \n     is commonly used for hazard identification and evaluation of \n     program and device effectiveness.\n       (10) Training and education in the use of safer medical \n     devices and safer work practices are significant elements in \n     the prevention of percutaneous exposure incidents. Staff \n     involvement in the device selection and evaluation process is \n     also an important element to achieving a reduction in sharps \n     injuries, particularly as new safer devices are introduced \n     into the work setting.\n       (11) Modification of the bloodborne pathogens standard is \n     appropriate to set forth in greater detail its requirement \n     that employers identify, evaluate, and make use of effective \n     safer medical devices.\n\n     SEC. 3. BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS STANDARD.\n\n       The bloodborne pathogens standard published at 29 C.F.R. \n     1910.1030 shall be revised as follows:\n       (1) The definition of ``Engineering Controls'' (at 29 \n     C.F.R. 1930.1030(b)) shall include as additional examples of \n     controls the following: ``safer medical devices, such as \n     sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and \n     needleless systems''.\n       (2) The term ``Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury \n     Protections'' shall be added to the definitions (at 29 C.F.R. \n     1910.1030(b)) and defined as ``a nonneedle sharp or a needle \n     device used for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or \n     artery, or administering medications or other fluids, with a \n     built-in safety feature or mechanism that effectively reduces \n     the risk of an exposure incident''.\n       (3) The term ``Needleless Systems'' shall be added to the \n     definitions (at 29 C.F.R. 1910.1030(b)) and defined as ``a \n     device that does not use needles for (A) the collection of \n     bodily fluids or withdrawal of body fluids after initial \n     venous or arterial access is established, (B) the \n     administration of medication or fluids, or (C) any other \n     procedure involving the potential for occupational exposure \n     to bloodborne pathogens due to percutaneous injuries from \n     contaminated sharps''.\n       (4) In addition to the existing requirements concerning \n     exposure control plans (29 C.F.R. 1910.1030(c)(1)(iv)), the \n     review and update of such plans shall be required to also--\n       (A) ``reflect changes in technology that eliminate or \n     reduce exposure to bloodborne pathogens''; and\n       (B) ``document consideration and implementation of \n     appropriate commercially available and effective safer \n     medical devices designed to eliminate or minimize \n     occupational exposure''.\n       (5) The following additional recordkeeping requirement \n     shall be added to the bloodborne pathogens standard at 29 \n     C.F.R. 1910.1030(h): ``The employer shall establish and \n     maintain a sharps injury log for the recording of \n     percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. The \n     information in the sharps injury log shall be recorded and \n     maintained in such manner as to protect the confidentiality \n     of the injured employee. The sharps injury log shall contain, \n     at a minimum--\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\n       ``(A) the type and brand of device involved in the \n     incident,\n       ``(B) the department or work area where the exposure \n     incident occurred, and\n       ``(C) an explanation of how the incident occurred.''.\n\n     The requirement for such sharps injury log shall not apply to \n     any employer who is not required to maintain a log of \n     occupational injuries and illnesses under 29 C.F.R. 1904 and \n     the sharps injury log shall be maintained for the period \n     required by 29 C.F.R. 1904.6.\n       (6) The following new section shall be added to the \n     bloodborne pathogens standard: ``An employer, who is required \n     to establish an Exposure Control Plan shall solicit input \n     from non-managerial employees responsible for direct patient \n     care who are potentially exposed to injuries from \n     contaminated sharps in the identification, evaluation, and \n     selection of effective engineering and work practice controls \n     and shall document the solicitation in the Exposure Control \n     Plan.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECT OF MODIFICATIONS.\n\n       The modifications under section 3 shall be in force until \n     superseded in whole or in part by regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary of Labor under section 6(b) of the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655(b)) and shall be \n     enforced in the same manner and to the same extent as any \n     rule or regulation promulgated under section 6(b).\n\n     SEC. 5. PROCEDURE AND EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) Procedure.--The modifications of the bloodborne \n     pathogens standard prescribed by section 3 shall take effect \n     without regard to the procedural requirements applicable to \n     regulations promulgated under section 6(b) of the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655(b)) \n     or the procedural requirements of chapter 5 of title 5, \n     United States Code.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The modifications to the bloodborne \n     pathogens standard required by section 3 shall--\n       (1) within 6 months of the date of enactment of this Act, \n     be made and published in the Federal Register by the \n     Secretary of Labor acting through the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration; and\n       (2) take effect on the date that is 90 days after the date \n     of such publication.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be part of the introduction \ntoday of S. 3067, a bipartisan bill to provide protection for our \nnations health care workers against accidental needlesticks and sharps \ninjuries. I want to acknowledge and commend my colleagues Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy and Reed in the Senate and the Honorable Mr. \nBallenger and Honorable Major Owens in the House for their work on this \nimportant safety issue.\n  Since the mid-1980's, injuries to health care workers from needles or \nother ``sharps,'' such as IV catheters or lancets, have presented an \nincreasingly troubling issue. As the spread of bloodborne pathogens \nsuch as HIV and Hepatitis B and C has escalated over the last 15 years, \nso has the danger to health care workers of contracting one of these \ndiseases through sharps contaminated with bloodborne pathogens, such as \nHIV and Hepatitis B and C. Even where the injured worker does not \nultimately contract a bloodborne disease, the uncertainty and fear of \ninfection created by such injuries can be excruciating and destructive \nto the lives of the injured health care workers.\n  In response to this problem, in 1991 the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration, or ``OSHA,'' issued a standard requiring \nworkplace safety measures to be used to protect against occupational \nexposure to bloodborne pathogens. This was a laudable step in the fight \nagainst worker infection, and its implementation brought a reduction in \nthe risk of contracting a bloodborne disease in the workplace. The \nsuccess of this measure, however, was limited by the effectiveness of \nthe safety technology available at the time, and occupational exposure \nto bloodborne pathogens from accidental sharps injuries has continued \nto be a problem. In March 2000, the Centers for Disease Control \nestimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 needlesticks still occur \namong health care workers annually.\n  Fortunately, since the publication of the bloodborne pathogens \nstandard there has been a substantial increase in the number and \nassortment of new medical devices, such as needless systems and \nretractable needles, that protect against needlesticks. Numerous \nstudies have shown that the use of these safer devices, as part of an \noverall bloodborne pathogen risk reduction program, can be extremely \neffective in reducing accidental sharps injuries.\n  The legislation we introduce today will ensure that these safer \ndevices are used, and lives will be saved as a result. The bill \nprovides narrowly tailored instruction to OSHA to amend its bloodborne \npathogen standard to make certain that employers understand they must \nidentify, evaluate, and, where appropriate, make use of these safer \nmedical devices to eliminate or reduce occupational exposure to \nbloodborne pathogens. OSHA issued similar instructions in a compliance \ndirective published December 1998. Because OSHA's directive is merely \nagency guidance and does not have the force of law, however, I felt it \nwas important that both employers and employees be given formal \nregulatory instruction on this vitally important safety issue. This \nlegislation provides this security and improves protection for \nemployees while still allowing employers the necessary flexibility to \ndetermine the best technology to use in the particular circumstances \npresented. This legislation even goes a step further to ensure that \nemployers will have valuable input from the front line employees when \nit makes these determinations.\n  This bill is an important step for safety in the workplace, and I \nhope it will bring some peace of mind to the more than 8 million \nworkers who perform the vitally important service of providing health \ncare in this country. I am extremely proud to be a part of legislation \nwhich will save lives and help stop the spread of bloodborne diseases.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing the Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act. I commend \nSenators Jeffords, Enzi and Reid for their effective work on this bill \nthat is vitally important to health care professionals and all \nAmericans who come in contact with them.\n  The need for needle stick protection is compelling. Last year alone, \nthere were almost 800,000 needle stick injuries to health care \nprofessionals. Over 1,000 health care workers were infected with \nserious diseases, including HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Sadly, \nall of these injuries were preventable. The good news is that through \nthe provisions of this bill, many future needle stick injuries will be \nprevented. In fact, the Center for Disease Prevention estimates that \nneedle stick injuries will be reduced by as much as 88 percent.\n  But as is so often the case, numbers alone cannot convey the full \nstory of human tragedy resulting from these injuries. One of my \nconstituents, Karen Daley of Boston, is the President of the \nMassachusetts Nurses Association and was a registered nurse, a job she \nloved and found very fulfilling. In January 1999, while working in an \nemergency room in Boston, Karen was accidentally stuck by a \ncontaminated needle. Six months later, she tested positive for HIV and \nHepatitis C. Fortunately, Karen is in relative good health, although \nshe will never again be able to practice her chosen profession of \nnursing.\n  The Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act is intended to prevent \ntragic accidents like this. This bill requires employers to implement \nthe use of safety-designed needles and sharps to reduce the potential \ntransmission of disease to health care workers and patients. This bill \nalso provides that employers establish an injury log to record the kind \nof devices, and the location, of all needle stick accidents.\n  Equally important, this bill allows non-managerial employees--those \non the front lines of service delivery--to be involved in determining \nthe appropriate devices used in health care settings.\n  This bill has bipartisan support in the Senate and the House. It also \nis supported by the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses \nAssociation, the Service Employees International Union and the American \nFederation of Federal, State County and Municipal Employees.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to join us \nin supporting this important bill, and I am hopeful that it can be \nenacted into law before this session of Congress ends.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 3070. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to establish \ncriminal penalties for distribution of defective products, to amend \nchapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, relating to protective \norders, sealing of cases, and\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\ndiscovery information in civil actions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     DEFECTIVE PRODUCT PENALTY ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Kohl, to introduce legislation to better protect \nAmerican consumers from irresponsible companies who knowingly allow \ndefective vehicles or vehicle parts to remain on the market.\n  Our bill, the ``Defective Product Penalty Act,'' would significantly \nincrease the responsibility of companies to test products for defects, \nto recall those products when necessary, and to report to authorities \nwhen defects are found.\n  Recent news stories about Firestone tires have grabbed the headlines, \nbut this bill really addresses some long-standing and serious \ndeficiencies within our current laws. The Firestone case has \nhighlighted the need for these overdue proposals, and it is our hope \nthat this legislation receives swift and serious consideration. The \ntime has come to close some loopholes and impose some real \nresponsibility on company executives who ignore public safety.\n  Let me describe specifically what this bill does:\n  First, this legislation will increase civil penalties for failure to \nrecall a defective vehicle or part or withholding information from the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Current \npenalties are $1,000 per violation with a maximum penalty in these \ncases of $925,000. The Defective Product Penalty Act would increase the \npenalty to $10,000 per violation, and would eliminate the maximum \npenalty altogether. A penalty of $925,000 for a multi-billion dollar, \nmultinational business is not even enough to cause the company to think \ntwice about releasing or recalling a defective vehicle. We need to give \nthe NHTSA some real teeth.\n  Second, this legislation will establish criminal penalties for \nknowingly distributing a defective vehicle or part, or for failing to \nrecall or tell authorities about a defective product, if that defect \nresults in death or injuries. If death results, the legislation calls \nfor a penalty of up to 15 years in prison. If serious injury results, \nthe legislation calls for penalties of up to 5 years.\n  Third, this legislation would extend the statute of limitations for \nNHTSA to mandate recalls, from 8 to 10 years for vehicles, and from 3 \nto 5 years for tires.\n\n  Fourth, the bill would require companies to actually test vehicle \nproducts before self-certifying that the product is in compliance with \nNHTSA standards.\n  Next, the legislation clarifies federal law to make it clear that in \ncases involving vehicle products sold in the U.S., a company must send \nthe NHTSA copies of all notices sent to dealers and owners, even if the \nnotices are sent only to owners and dealers in foreign countries.\n  Finally, this legislation includes provisions from Senator Kohl's \n``Sunshine in Litigation Act'' (S. 957), to:\n  Prohibit federal courts from issuing protective orders that prohibit \nindividuals from disclosing potential defects or dangers to regulatory \nagencies; and\n  Prohibit federal courts from enforcing secrecy agreements without \nfirst balancing the need for privacy against the public's need to know \nabout potential health and safety hazards. In other words, no longer \ncan a company put other consumers at risk by forcing a plaintiff to \nkeep quiet about a potential threat to public safety.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will send a clear signal to \nirresponsible companies and individuals who intentionally put the \npublic at risk from defective products--you will now be held \nresponsible for your actions. I urge my colleagues to join us in this \neffort.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nFeinstein in introducing the Defective Product Penalty Act of 2000.\n  As the Firestone/Bridgestone tire controversy sadly demonstrates, \ncurrent consumer protection laws do not provide sufficient incentive \nfor some manufacturers to put the health and safety of consumers at the \nforefront of their business decisions. Although most of us would find \nit very difficult to believe that a company knowingly introduced a \ndefective product into the marketplace, or failed to recall one once a \ndefect was discovered, the families of the Firestone/Bridgestone \ncasualties do not need to be reminded that it does happen. Most \ncompanies are responsible corporate citizens, of course--and for them \nthis legislation will not affect their behavior--but for the others who \nneed to be ``incentivized'' to make consumer health and safety a \nforemost priority, the Defective Product Penalty Act (``DPPA'') should \nserve as sufficient notice.\n  Specifically, the DPPA creates tough criminal penalties for those who \nknowingly introduce defective products into the stream of commerce with \nthe realization that the product may cause death or bodily harm to an \nunsuspecting consumer. Risking the lives of millions of Americans \nbecause a cost-benefit analysis suggests that profits earned from a \nproduct outweigh the potential costs of liability is not only wrong, \nbut also criminal. And it should be treated as such. Indeed, Mr. \nPresident, whenever a company adheres to the bottom line instead of \nrespecting the health and safety of their consumers, they deserve \nsevere, immediate, and strict punishment.\n  This bill also incorporates S. 957, the Sunshine in Litigation Act. \nThis part of the bill ensures that consumers are better informed about \nproduct defects that may affect consumer health and safety. All too \noften our Federal courts allow vital information that is discovered in \nlitigation--and which bears directly upon public health and safety--to \nbe covered up, to be shielded from mothers, fathers and children whose \nlives are potentially at stake, and from the public officials we have \nasked to protect our public health and safety.\n  All this happens because of the use of so-called ``protective \norders''--really gag orders issued by courts--that are designed to keep \ninformation discovered in the course of litigation secret and \nundisclosed. Typically, injured victims agree to a defendant's request \nto keep lawsuit information secret. They agree because defendants \nthreaten that, without secrecy, they will fight every document \nrequested and will refuse to agree to a settlement. Victims cannot \nafford to take such chances. And while courts in these situations \nactually have the legal authority to deny requests for secrecy, \ntypically they do not--because both sides have agreed.\n  The problem of excessive secrecy orders in cases involving public \nhealth and safety has been apparent for many years. The Judiciary \nCommittee first held hearings on this issue in 1990 and again in 1994. \nIn 1990, Arthur Bryant, the executive director of the Trial Lawyers for \nPublic Justice, told us, ``The one thing we learned .  .  . is that \nthis problem is far more egregious than we ever imagined. It goes the \nlength and depth of this country, and the frank truth is that much of \ncivil litigation in this country is taking place in secret.''\n  The Defective Product Penalty Act will go a long way to ensuring that \nthe health and safety of consumers will receive the consideration it \ndeserves in the boardrooms and courtrooms across our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerrey, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Robb, and Mr. Schumer) (by request):\n  S. 3071. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ncircuit and district judges, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      federal judgeship act of 200\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, at the request of the Judicial \nConference of the United States, Senator Leahy and I are introducing \nthe Federal Judgeship Act of 2000. This legislation was drafted by the \nJudicial Conference and is based upon the recently completed biennial \nsurvey of judgeship needs conducted by the Judicial Conference, which \nanalyzed caseload statistics for each federal district court and \ncircuit court of appeals. The legislation sets forth the Judicial \nConference's recommendation that the Congress create 63 new federal \njudgeships throughout the country--10 new circuit court judgeships and \n53 new district court judgeships.\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\n  Perhaps the federalism decisions that have marked the tenure of the \nRehnquist Court ultimately will serve to check the expansion of federal \njurisdiction and the caseload burdens and need for new judges that \nnecessarily follow such expansion. Presently, however, many of our \njudges--especially those in the border states of Texas, New Mexico, \nArizona and California--are overburdened by heavy caseloads. Caseload \nstatistics compiled by the Judicial Conference have convinced me of the \nneed for a debate about new judgeships. In this debate, we must ask \nourselves: How large do we really want our federal judiciary to be?\n  It should be noted that over the past 22 years, the judiciary has \ngrown substantially. Currently, there are 848 judgeships created \npursuant to article III of the Constitution. By contrast, just 23 years \nago, there were only 509 Article III judgeships. this growth in the \nsize of the federal judiciary--a 67 percent increase--has outpaced \ngrowth in the size of the United States. During the same period, the \npopulation of the United States has grown by just 24 percent, from 220 \nmillion to 275 million.\n  Given that there are only a few weeks remaining in this Congress, it \nis going to be difficult to achieve consensus on a comprehensive \njudgeship bill. Nevertheless, it is important that the views of the \nJudicial Conference on the issue of judgeship be brought to the \nattention of the Congress and given the appropriate level of \nconsideration. Still, it is possible that consensus may be reached on \nlegislation authorizing new judgeships. I know that many of my \ncolleagues share my concerns about the expansion of the federal \njudiciary. It is my judgment, however, that the Judicial Conference's \nrecommendation that additional judgeships be created be brought to the \nattention of the Congress. I look forward to a dialogue with my \ncolleagues on this issue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today Senator Hatch and I are introducing \nthe Federal Judgeship Act of 2000. I am pleased that Senators \nFeinstein, Schumer, Boxer, Graham, Reid, Robb, Inouye, Edwards, Murray, \nBingaman, Bayh, Kerrey, and Domenici are joining us as original \ncosponsors of this measure.\n  Our bill creates 70 judgeships across the country to address the \nworkload needs of the federal judiciary. This bill incorporates the \nrecommendations for additional judgeships most recently forwarded to us \nby the Judiciary Conference of the United States. Specifically, our \nlegislation would create 6 additional permanent judgeships and 4 \ntemporary judgeships for the U.S. Courts of Appeal; 30 additional \npermanent judgeships and 23 temporary judgeships for the U.S. District \nCourts; and convert 7 existing temporary district judgeships into \npermanent positions.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States is the nonpartisan \npolicy-making arm of the judicial branch. Federal judges across the \nnation believe that the increasingly heavy caseloads of our courts \nnecessitate these additional judges. The Chief Justice of the United \nStates in his annual year-end reports over the last several years has \ncommented on the serious problems facing our federal courts having too \nmuch work and too few judges and other resources.\n  The Judicial Conference and Chief Justice Rehnquist are right. \nAccording to his 1999 year-end report, the filings in our federal \ncourts have reached record heights. In fact, the numbers of criminal \ncases and defendants have reached their highest levels since the \nProhibition Amendment was repealed in 1933. In 1999, overall growth in \nappellate court caseload included a 349 percent upsurge in original \nproceedings. This sudden expansion resulted from newly implemented \nreporting procedures, which more accurately measure the increased \njudicial workload generated by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act and \nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, both passed in 1996.\n  District court activity was characterized by an increase in criminal \nfilings and a smaller increase in civil filings. Criminal case filings \nrose 4 percent from 57,691 in 1998 to 59,923 in 1999, and the number of \ndefendants grew 2 percent from 79,008 to 80,822. Criminal case filings \nper authorized judgeship went up almost 5 percent. Since the last \nsignificant expansion of the federal judiciary in 1990, felony criminal \ncase filings have increased almost 50 percent, from 31,727 in 1990 to \n46,789 in 1999.\n  Despite these dramatic increases in case filings, Congress has failed \nto authorize new judgeships since 1990, thus endangering the \nadministration of justice in our nation's federal courts. Without the \nextraordinary contributes of our senior judges, the administration of \njustice could well have broken down entirely.\n  Over the last several decades, a 6-year cycle for reviewing the needs \nof the judiciary and authorizing additional judgeships had been \nfollowed by Democrats and Republicans alike. For example, in 1978, \nCongress passed legislation to address the need for additional \njudgeships. Six years later, in 1984, Congress passed legislation \ncreating additional judgeships. Then, again six years later, in 1990, \nDemocratic majorities in both Houses of Congress fulfilled their \nconstitutional responsibilities and enacted the Federal Judgeship Act \nof 1990 because of a sharply increasing caseload, particularly for \ndrug-related crimes. At that time President Bush was in the middle of \nhis first term in office.\n  That type of bipartisan effort broke down in 1996. It has now been 10 \nyears since Congress made a systematic evaluation of the needs of the \nfederal judiciary and acted to meet those needs. For each of the last \ntwo Congresses, the Republican majority has resisted any such action. \nThree years ago, the Judicial Conference requested an additional 55 \njudgeships to address the growing backlog. I introduced the Federal \nJudgeship Act of 1997, S. 678, legislation based on the Judicial \nConference's 1997 recommendations. That legislation languished in the \nJudicial Committee without action during both sessions of the last \nCongress. Again last year, the Judicial Conference updated its request \nand recommended an additional 72 judgeships. I, again, introduced those \nrecommendations in the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999, S. 1145. There \nwas no action on it by the Judiciary Committee.\n  This year, the Judiciary Conference took the unusual step of updating \nlast year's recommendations yet again. Those updated recommendations \naffect 70 judgeships. Today may signal a turning point in our efforts. \nToday Republicans are joining with us. I welcome them to this effort \nand look forward to working with them to pass the Federal Judgeship Act \nof 2000.\n  Included within our bill are the additional judgeships that would be \nauthorized by S. 2730, the Southwest Border Judgeship Act of 2000. \nSenator Feinstein has been tenacious in seeking the resources needed \nthe federal courts of our southwest border States, including southern \nCalifornia. She is right. Those 13 judgeships for California, Arizona, \nNew Mexico and Texas are included in our bill.\n  Implicit in our legislation is acknowledgment that the federal \njudiciary does not just have 64 current vacancies with 9 of the \nhorizon, but that even if all those vacancies were filled, the federal \njudiciary would remain 70 judges short of those it needed to manage its \nworkload, try the cases and provide the individual attention to matters \nthat have set a high standard for the administration of justice in our \nfederal system. In other words, considering vacancies and taking into \naccount the judgeships authorized by our bill, the federal judiciary is \ntoday in need of more than 130 more judges.\n  We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people \naround the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence \nof our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability \nto act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long \nprotected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary \ncheck on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible \nto the gusts of the political winds.\n  Let us act to ensure that justice in our federal courts is not \ndelayed or denied for anyone. I urge the Senate to do in this last \nmonth of this Congress what the Republican majority has so strenuously \nresisted for the last four years: Enact the Federal Judgeship Act \nwithout further delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. GRAMS (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\n  S. 3072.

A bill to amend titles V, XVIII, and XIX of the Social \nSecurity Act to promote smoking cessation under the Medicare Program, \nthe Medicaid Program, and the Maternal and Child Health Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n THE MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND MCH SMOKING CESSATION SERVICES ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nexpands treatment to millions of Americans suffering from a deadly \naddiction: tobacco. I am pleased to have Senator Brownback join me in \nthis effort. The Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion \nAct of 2000 will help make smoking cessation therapy accessible to \nrecipients of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Maternal and Child Health \nProgram.\n  We have long known that cigarette smoking is the largest preventable \ncause of death, accounting for 20 percent of all deaths in this \ncountry. It is well documented that smoking causes virtually all cases \nof lung cancer and a substantial portion of coronary heart disease, \nperipheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and \ncancers of other sites. And the harmful effects of smoking do not end \nwith the smoker. Women who use tobacco during pregnancy are more likely \nto have adverse birth outcomes, including babies with low birth weight, \nwhich is linked with an increased risk of infant death and a variety of \ninfant health disorders.\n  Still, despite enormous health risks, 48 million adults in the United \nStates smoke cigarettes--approximately 22.7 percent of American adults. \nThe rates are higher for our youth--36.4 percent report daily smoking. \nIn Illinois, the adult smoking rate is about 24.2 percent. And perhaps \nmost distressing and surprising, data indicate that about 13 percent of \nmothers in the United States smoke during pregnancy.\n  We have also learned the hard way that in addition to the heavy \nhealth toll of tobacco, the economic costs of smoking are also high. \nThe total cost of smoking in 1993 in the U.S. was about $102 billion, \nwith over $50 billion in health care expenditures directly linked to \nsmoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports \nthat approximately 43 percent of these costs were paid by government \nfunds, primarily Medicaid and Medicare. Smoking costs Medicaid alone \nmore than $12.9 billion per year. According to the Chicago chapter of \nthe American Lung Association, my state of Illinois spends $2.9 billion \neach year in public and private funds to combat smoking-related \ndiseases.\n  Today, however, we also know how to help smokers quit. Advancements \nin treating tobacco use and nicotine addiction have helped millions \nkick the habit. While more than 40 million adults continue to smoke, \nnearly as many persons are former smokers living longer, healthier \nlives. In large part, this is because new tools are available. \nEffective pharmacotherapy and counseling regimens have been tested and \nproven effective. The just-released Surgeon General's Report, Reducing \nTobacco Use, concluded that ``pharmacologic treatment of nicotine \naddiction, combined with behavioral support, will enable 10 to 25 \npercent of users to remain abstinent at one year of posttreatment.''\n  Studies have shown that reducing adult smoking through tobacco use \ntreatment pays immediate dividends, both in terms of health \nimprovements and cost savings. Creating a new nonsmoker reduces \nanticipated medical costs associated with acute myocardial infarction \nand stroke by $47 in the first year and by $853 during the next seven \nyears in 1995 dollars. And within four to five years after tobacco \ncessation, quitters use fewer health care services than continued \nsmokers. In fact, in one study the cost savings from reduced use paid \nfor a moderately priced effective smoking cessation intervention in a \nmatter of three to four years.\n  The health benefits tobacco quitters enjoy are undisputed. They are \nliving longer. After 15 years, the risk of premature death for ex-\nsmokers returns to nearly the level of persons who have never smoked. \nMale smokers who quit between age 35 and 39 add an average of five \nyears to their lives; women can add three years. Even older Americans \nover age 65 can extend their life expectancy by giving up cigarettes.\n  Former smokers are also healthier. They are less likely to die of \nchronic lung diseases. After ten smoke-free\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nyears, their risk of lung cancer drops to as much as one-half that of \nthose who continue to smoke. After five to fifteen years the risk of \nstroke and heart disease for ex-smokers returns to the level of those \nwho have never smoked. They have fewer days of illness, reduced rates \nof bronchitis and pneumonia, and fewer health complaints.\n  New Public Health Service Guidelines released this summer conclude \nthat tobacco dependence treatments are both clinically effective and \ncost-effective relative to other medical and disease prevention \ninterventions. The guideline urges health care insurers and purchasers \nto include the counseling and FDA-approved pharmacotherapeutic \ntreatments as a covered benefit.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government, a major purchaser of health \ncare through Medicare and Medicaid, does not currently adhere to its \nown published guidelines. It is high-time that government-sponsored \nhealth programs catch up with science. As a result, I am introducing, \nalong with my colleague Senator Brownback, legislation to improve \nsmoking cessation benefits in government-sponsored health programs.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion Act of \n2000 improves access to and coverage of smoking cessation treatment \ntherapies in four primary ways.\n  Our bill adds a smoking cessation counseling benefit to Medicare. By \n2020, 17 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 years of age or \nolder. It is estimated that Medicare will pay $800 billion to treat \ntobacco-related diseases over the next twenty years. In a study of \nadults 65 years of age or older who received advice to quit, behavioral \ncounseling and pharmocotherapy, 24.8 percent reported having stopped \nsmoking six months following the intervention. The total economic \nbenefits of quitting after age 65 are notable. Due to a reduction in \nthe risk of lung cancer, coronary heart disease and emphysema, studies \nhave found that heavy smokers over age 65 who quit can avoid up to \n$4,592 in lifelong illness-related costs.\n  Our measure provides coverage for both prescription and non-\nprescription smoking cessation drugs in the Medicaid program. The bill \neliminates the provision in current Federal law that allows states to \nexclude FDA-approved smoking cessation therapies from coverage under \nMedicaid. Ironically, State Medicaid programs are required to cover \nViagra, but not to treat tobacco addiction. Despite the fact that the \nStates are now receiving the full benefit of their federal lawsuit \nagainst the tobacco industry, less than half the States provide \ncoverage for smoking cessation in their Medicaid program. On average, \nstates spend approximately 14.4 percent of their Medicaid budgets on \nmedical care related to smoking.\n\n  Our legislation clarifies that the maternity benefit for pregnant \nwomen in Medicaid covers smoking cessation counseling and services. \nSmoking during pregnancy causes about 5-6 percent of perinatal deaths, \n17-26 percent of low-birth-weight births, and 7-10 percent of preterm \ndeliveries, and increases the risk of miscarriage and fetal growth \nretardation. It may also increase the risk of sudden infant death \nsyndrome (SIDS). The Surgeon General recommends that pregnant women and \nparents with children living at home be counseled on the potentially \nharmful effects of smoking on fetal and child health. A new study shows \nthat, over seven years, reducing smoking prevalence by just one \npercentage point would prevent 57,200 low birth weight births and save \n$572 million in direct medical costs.\n  Our bill ensures that the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Program \nrecognizes that medications used to promote smoking cessation and the \ninclusion of anti-tobacco messages in health promotion are considered \npart of quality maternal and child health services. In addition to the \nwell-documented benefits of smoking cessation for maternity care, the \nSurgeon General's report adds, ``Tobacco use is a pediatric concern. In \nthe United States, more than 6,000 children and adolescents try their \nfirst cigarette each day. More than 3,000 children and adolescents \nbecome daily smokers each day, resulting in approximately 1.23 million \nnew smokers under the age of 18 each year.'' The goal of the MCH \nprogram is to improve the health of all mothers and children. This goal \ncannot be reached without addressing the tobacco epidemic.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me not only in cosponsoring this \nlegislation but also in working with me to see that its provisions are \nadopted before the year is out. As the Surgeon General states in his \nreport: ``Although our knowledge about tobacco control remains \nimperfect, we know more than enough to act now.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S.J.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INDEPENDENT PERFORMANCE \n                   AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS OF WORLD BANK PROGRAMS \n                   AND PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the World Bank should publicly commit to execute within \n     one year performance audits and a complete performance \n     evaluation of the effectiveness of its programs and projects \n     by independent private sector firms;\n       (2) the individual program and project audits and the \n     complete performance evaluation conducted by the World Bank \n     should be published and meet the requirements of subsection \n     (b);\n       (3) the audits and complete performance evaluation of the \n     programs and projects, together with the General Accounting \n     Office\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\n     review of these audits and evaluations, would help bring \n     necessary transparency, accountability, and effectiveness to \n     the World Bank and its programs and projects; and\n       (4) the health and well-being of people around the world \n     would be aided by the World Bank's efforts to ensure that its \n     resources are properly and appropriately directed to those \n     truly in need.\n       (b) Requirements.--The requirements referred to in \n     subsection (a)(2) are the following:\n       (1) One-third of the number of the World Bank's programs \n     and projects should be audited at the location of the program \n     or project between four and six years after the final \n     disbursement of World Bank funds with respect to those \n     programs and projects.\n       (2) Audited programs and projects should be representative, \n     by sector and recipient country, of the World Bank's programs \n     and projects.\n       (3) Results of the individual program and project audits \n     should be compiled into a complete performance evaluation \n     that examines whether the funds loaned by the World Bank are \n     used in a manner that complies with the conditions of the \n     loans and analyzes the direct and indirect costs and benefits \n     of each program or project audited.\n       (4) The individual program and project audits and the \n     complete performance evaluation of programs and projects \n     should be performed every 3 years and should examine those \n     programs and projects that have been completed since the \n     submission of the last evaluation.\n       (5) Not later than six months after the date of completion \n     of the complete performance evaluation, the General \n     Accounting Office should have complete and unfettered access \n     to the auditors, the individual program and project audits, \n     and the complete performance evaluation and should review and \n     report to Congress on the results and methodologies of the \n     audits and the evaluation, the independence and competence of \n     the auditors, and the appropriateness, thoroughness, and \n     quality of the audit and evaluation procedures.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that \nexpresses Congress' views on the importance of bringing transparency, \naccountability, and effectiveness to the World Bank. A necessary step \ntowards achieving these worthwhile objectives is getting the World Bank \nto carefully and properly examine current programs and projects. The \nresolution I am introducing today calls for the World Bank to commit to \nindependent performance audits and evaluations of its programs and \nprojects. It outlines some of the steps the World Bank must take to \nbegin a much-needed overhaul.\n  I share the objectives of the World Bank in reducing poverty in \ndeveloping countries and bolstering their economies. The World Bank \nseeks a ``World Free of Poverty,'' and we can all recognize this as a \ngood aim. We live in a global society and all have a role in improving \nthe health and well-being of people living in all parts of the world.\n  With this said, I fear that the U.S. is sending its taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars to the World Bank with little to show for it. \nCollectively, U.S. taxpayers represent the single largest contributor \nof financial resources to the World Bank. Recent reports by the General \nAccounting Office, the congressionally-mandated and bipartisan \nInternational Financial Institution Advisory Commission as well as the \ntestimony of experts testifying before a hearing I held this summer in \nthe Senate Banking Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance, all \nagree on one thing--we can't even tell with a reasonable level of \ncertainty that funds the World Bank spends on its programs and projects \nare spent efficiently and as intended to be spent.\n  Additionally, right now Congress is being asked to pony up money for \nbilateral debt relief to the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and \nas a contribution to the HIPC Initiative for mulilateral debt relief to \nthese poor countries. This allows the multilateral financial \ninstitutions to forgive debts and make debt service payments that they \nare owed by the HIPCs. In part, HIPC Trust Fund monies are used to \nreimburse the World Bank for debt relief it provides to the HIPCs. We \ndon't want to be sending good money after bad. We don't want to support \nfailed lending and program practices of any international institutions \nbecause that would be money wasted. If Congress is to continue \nsupporting the HIPC Initiative, we need to send a message that we want \nchange.\n  This is why it is essential that Congress take a stand for our \ntaxpayers who contribute so much money and a stand for the people \naround the globe who the Bank's programs and projects are designed to \nbenefit.\n  Adopting this resolution makes this statement. It asks the World Bank \nto carefully examine its current activities and the way it conducts \nbusiness. The resolution calls for the World Bank to publicly commit to \nhaving an independent third party with no vested interest in the \noutcome, conduct a thorough review of the Bank's programs and projects \nthrough performance audits and a complete performance evaluation that \nis made public.\n  A complete and open examination of the Bank's practices, its \nsuccesses and failures, is a win-win for everyone. It's a win for the \nBank who will know whether its programs are best targeted to achieve \nits mission of `A World Free of Poverty,'' a win for member countries \nwho will know whether their monies are being spent as intended, and \nmost importantly, a win for people worldwide whose health and well-\nbeing the Bank strives to improve.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8770-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8770-S8771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 137--RECOGNIZING, APPRECIATING, AND \nREMEMBERING WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT THE NATIVE AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN \n         WHO HAVE SERVED THE UNITED STATES IN MILITARY SERVICE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Indian Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 137\n\n       Whereas it is necessary to recognize, appreciate, assist, \n     and remember the Native American men and women who have \n     served the United States in military service;\n       Whereas Native American men and women have served the \n     United States armed forces in every military campaign since \n     the American Revolutionary War;\n       Whereas some tribes, notably the Ottawa Nation, sent a \n     special company of warriors to serve in the Civil War with \n     the Michigan Sharpshooters and the Ottawa Warriors of Company \n     K were highly decorated for their brave actions in that \n     military action;\n       Whereas some tribes, notably the Ottawa Nation, sent their \n     finest warriors to serve in the Spanish American War and one \n     of their warriors distinguished himself in the calvary with \n     Teddy Roosevelt on San Juan Hill;\n       Whereas some tribes, notably Ottawa, Chippewa, and \n     Potawatomi answered the warrior call from within and served \n     in great numbers in World War I even though they were not \n     accepted as citizens of this country at that time;\n       Whereas the Navajo Code Talkers as well as other tribes, \n     including the Ottawa and Chippewa, used their sacred \n     languages to assist our country in World War II;\n       Whereas these sacred languages were also used to assist the \n     United States efforts in the Korean war and the Vietnam \n     conflict during which Native American veterans distinguished \n     themselves with their bravery;\n       Whereas Native American veterans served in operations \n     Desert Storm and Desert Shield; and\n       Whereas Native Americans have served in the United States \n     military in numbers that far exceed their representation in \n     the United States population: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That the Congress recognizes, appreciates, and \n     remembers with dignity and respect the service to the United \n     States of Native American veterans.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a concurrent \nresolution along with Representative Bart Stupak which recognizes the \nNative American men and women who have served in the United States \nmilitary.\n  This resolution recognizes the contributions of Native Americans in \nthe United States Military service which are indeed impressive. Native \nAmericans have served in the United States military since the American \nRevolution. During the Civil War, there were 3 Confederate units and 1 \nUnion unit primarily made up of Native Americans from the Oklahoma \ntribes. Many Native Americans fought in the Spanish American War. In \nfact, one warrior from Michigan, Jonas Shawandase, fought bravely with \nTeddy Roosevelt on San Juan Hill.\n  In World War I, many Native Americans were so eager to join that they \nwent to Canada to enlist before the United States entered the war. \n6,000 of the more than 8,000 who served during this war were \nvolunteers. This tremendous act of patriotism persuaded Congress to \npass the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924. During World War II, 25,000 \nNative American men and women fought on all fronts in Europe and Asia, \nreceiving more than 71 Air Medals, 51 Silver Stars, 47 Bronze Stars, 34 \nDistinguished Flying Crosses and two Congressional Medals of Honor. In \nfact Ira\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\nHayes, a Pima Indian, was one of the men to raise the flag on Iwo Jima.\n  In the Vietnam War more than 41,500 Native Americans served in the \nUnited States Armed Forces. Of those, 90% were volunteers, giving \nNative Americans the highest record of service of any ethnic group in \nthe country. In 1990, prior to Operation Desert Storm, some 24,000 \nNative American men and women were in the military. Approximately 3,000 \nserved in the Persian Gulf. One of every four Native American males is \na military veteran.\n  Native Americans in Michigan have told me that veterans are greatly \nrespected in Native American societies and this honor is nowhere more \napparent than at powwows. At a powwow celebration, the veterans are \ngiven the honor of carrying the flag and are the first to enter the \npowwow circle.\n  This resolution recognizes those Native Americans who with dignity \nserved in the U.S. military. We note today their service to this \ncountry and honor Native Americans for their military contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/19/senate-section/article/S8771-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     STEM CELL RESEARCH ACT OF 2000\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BROWNBACK AMENDMENTS NOS. 4140-4153\n\n  (Ordered referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK submitted fourteen amendments intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill, H.R. 2015, to amend the Public Health Service Act \nto provide for research with respect to human embryonic stem cells; as \nfollows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 4140\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.
