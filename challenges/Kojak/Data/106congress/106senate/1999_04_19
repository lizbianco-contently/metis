Mr. President, I speak often about the threat that \nillegal drugs pose to our young people. Today, I want to address a \nserious problem from substances common in virtually every home in the \ncountry. There are several trends in substance abuse among young people \nthat are happening literally under our noses. I want to address two \nsubstances that receive little attention but cause much pain and \nsuffering. Most people are not familiar with the harms of either of \nthese substances. However, our familiarity with and attention to these \nlethal substances is well overdue. The subject is: inhalants and GHB.\n  Inhalants are among the scariest substance being abused by teenagers \ntoday. Why? Because, kids have to go no further than their own kitchen \ncabinets to find them. Inhalants are everyday household products such \nas hair spray, cleaning fluids, air-fresheners, and whipped cream. More \nthan 1,000 common household products have the potential to be abused. \nKids are sniffing these easily obtainable household products to get a \ncheap high. In many cases, inhalants are used as an alternative to \nalcohol, clearly because young people don't have to break any laws to \nget them. Some see abuse of inhalants as a childish phase or youthful \nexperimenting, but let me assure you ``inhalant abuse'' is deadly \nserious.\n  Inhalants kill hundreds of children each year. Since July of 1996, \nover 250 children have died from intentionally ingesting toxic fumes. \nInhalants rank fourth among the substances abused by teens ages twelve \nto seventeen. Only alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana rank higher. In \nfact, inhalant abuse has gotten so bad that it is now considered a \ngateway drug. Like other gateway drugs, about one in five teens will \ntry ``sniffing'' before they graduate. What is even more astounding is \nthat inhalant abuse is a problem with children as young as eight; those \nin second grade.\n  Unfortunately, many do not acknowledge the severity of inhalant abuse \nuntil it is too late. A recent tragedy in a Philadelphia suburb \ndemonstrated the lethal effects of inhalants when five sixteen-year-old \ngirls were killed in a car accident. The coroner found that four of the \nfive, including the driver, had ingested significant amounts of \ncomputer keyboard cleaner. Sadly, the girls were out shopping for \ndresses for a prom they will never attend.\n  The problem is that too many of us are unaware of the dangers of \ninhalants. According to a 1997 National Household Survey on Drugs, nine \nout of ten parents don't believe their children have ever abused \ninhalants. But surveys indicate that almost a half-a-million teens \nabuse inhalants every\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nmonth. In fact, of those parents who do talk to their kids about drugs, \nless than half address inhalant abuse. Why aren't we talking about a \nsubstance that starves the brain of oxygen to the point of suffocation? \nWhy aren't we warning our kids that these household products can cause \ndamage to the brain and nervous system? We can't expect a teenager to \nknow the severity of sniffing unless we tell them.\n  We need to alert parents and kids to the dangers of inhalants. This \nis the reason Congress named the week of March 21 through March 27 as \n``National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week''. It is evident to me \nthat this kind of recognition is imperative to reducing inhalant abuse. \nWe cannot lock up our kids. We cannot keep many items with the \npotential for abuse out of the world our young people inhabit. What we \ncan and must do is to exercise more responsibility and pay closer \nattention.\n  Another substance that is consuming our youth is GHB. If you aren't \nfamiliar with this drug, it may be because there is little information \navailable on its fatal effects. In fact, GHB was sold over the counter \nas a dietary supplement in health food stores until 1990. Today, \nadvocates of GHB believe the drug is harmless and should continue to be \nsold over the counter. Unfortunately, a person doing research on the \ndrug will find more information supporting the use of GHB rather than \nreporting the realistic effects of the drug. For this reason, GHB \ncontinues to be sold as a recreational drug and perceived as harmless. \nThese perceptions have proved deadly for many.\n  GHB has become popular at parties known as ``Raves''. These all-night \nparties glamorize the use of drugs and alcohol. ``Ravers'' are taking \nGHB to feel relaxed, to loose their inhibitions, and to increase their \nsexual libidos. However, the truth is that too much GHB or GHB mixed \nwith other drugs can cause seizures, comas, severe vomiting, and \nrespiratory arrests. In addition, GHB causes amnesia. For this reason, \nit has been frequently used as a date rape drug. Unknowing victims are \nslipped GHB and can't remember their attacker the next day.\n  Since GHB is a newly abused drug, there have been few studies done to \nillustrate it's effects. However, the Drug Abuse Warning Network \nreports an increase in GHB-related emergency department episodes from \n20 in 1992 to 629 in 1996. Among these episodes, 91 percent reported \nthat their reason for using GHB was for recreational purposes. Of that \n91 percent, 33 percent claimed they had no idea what GHB would do to \nthem.\n  Based on what we know, there are no safe levels of use. There are no \nknown ways to predict side effects. And there are no ways to anticipate \nhow GHB will react with other substances. Yet, young people are being \ntold this drug is okay. Well, it isn't. And I don't believe parents \nwant their children self-prescribing any drugs, much less one so \ndangerous. We have to let kids know that GHB is a serious drug with \nserious consequences. If we know so little about GHB, we can assume \nkids know even less. It is imperative that we warn kids of the dangers \ninvolved in these substances.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Less than a minute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask permission to have 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3824-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3824-S3825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BRAZILIAN SOY MEAL PURCHASE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address a family farm issue \nand I want to take this opportunity to send a clear message to other \nportions of agriculture that I sense are not supporting the family \nfarmers of America the way they should be, when in reality, the \norganizations I'm finding fault with are in the very same boat as any \nfamily farmer in America. What's even more disturbing to me, some of \nthese really big megapork producers in America refer to themselves as \nfamily farms. It's in the title of their organization.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, family farmers are facing the lowest \nsoybean prices in 23 years. Farmers are currently storing more soybeans \non the farm than at any other point in the 1990's. In addition, the \nAmerican Soybean Association forecasts this year the United States will \nhave a larger number of carry-out stocks than at any other point this \ndecade. Due to the excessive available supply, family farmers marketing \nsoybeans are in a very difficult situation.\n  Soybean prices will not improve until U.S. reserves are diminished. \nBut, believe it or not, the cooperative that I've referred to, composed \nof some of the largest livestock integrators in the Nation, are \nplanning to import soybean meal from Brazil. And, of course, this is \ngoing to have a very significant negative impact on American soybean \nproducers. But, more important, it is demoralizing to the family \nfarmers of America who are producing soybeans to read reports about \nother so-called family farmers importing soybean meal from another \ncountry.\n  The cooperative located in the Southeast United States will bring in \nthree foreign shipments totaling 75,000 metric tons of soybean meal. \nAnd, by the way, for those of you who don't know agriculture, soybean \nmeal is used as a protein supplement in feed, which when combined with \ncorn and other feed grains helps to prepare the hogs for slaughter and \ndomestic consumption.\n  I reported to you that they will be bringing in 75,000 metric tons of \nsoybean meal on three different foreign shipments. It takes \napproximately 52 bushels of soybeans to produce one metric ton of \nsoybean meal. This means that U.S. soybean producers are losing an \nopportunity to market nearly 4 million bushels of soybeans to these six \nproducers of hogs who are part of this cooperative.\n  With the current crisis in the agriculture community, it's an \nunderstatement to say that this purchase has not been well-received by \nsoybean producers. It has already been my impression that when times \nare tough on the farm, the agriculture community, both farm and non-\nfarm, pitches in to help each other. From individual barn raisings to \nemergency hay lifts, family farmers stick together to help each other. \nNow, with soybeans under $5 a bushel, and that's a 23-year low, I would \nhope that this was one of those times when the ag community would come \ntogether in the face of adversity.\n  Maybe I'm wrong, or maybe the livestock integrators which make up the \ncooperative in question don't understand the impact of their actions. \nOne of the entities involved in the cooperative holds itself out to be \na family farm organization. Well, if it's really a family farm, this is \nthe perfect time to show its true colors and support American family \nfarmers.\n  Mr. President, if the entities within this cooperative buying group \nwant to be considered as family farmers, they should support the family \nfarmers, and I'm speaking specifically about Murphys' Family Farms, \nCarroll Foods, Prestage, Smithfield Foods, Goldsboro Farms, and \nNashjohnson and Sons Farms. These are the members of this cooperative \nthat are buying soybean meal from Brazil when we have this oversupply \nin our own country.\n  Now, as I indicated to you, family farmers generally help family \nfarmers. And I have never once complained in America as a matter of \npublic policy about something being too big. These are obviously very \nbig producers of pork in the United States. I have no resentment that \nthey are successful. But some of these operations feed some of their \nlivestock in my State of Iowa. We are the number-one soybean-producing \nState. It seems to me that whether the feed in question that's coming \nfrom Brazil is used in North Carolina or used in Iowa, it still is \nwrong to do this to the people that you consider your neighbors in each \nof these States. I would like to have all these farmers get their heart \ninto American family farm agriculture or get their rear-end out.\n  I urge this cooperative to reassess its position and consider the \nplight of the family farmer. Place American farmers' long-term \ninterests above what may only be a short-term gain and obviously a very \nbad public relations stunt for each of you. I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, during the past recess, the third \nanniversary of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, \nbetter known as the Red Tape Reduction Act, passed on March 29 with \nlittle notice or fanfare.\n  Let me suggest that while the Red Tape Reduction Act is hardly a \nhousehold word, it is well worth commemorating, and it is extremely \nimportant to the small businesses in America who are oppressed by \nexcessive Government regulation and unthinking regulation imposing \nunnecessary burdens on them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters of support \nthat speak to the importance of this law to our Nation's small \nbusinesses.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bond: On behalf of the 600,000 small business \n     owners of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I am writing to join you in commemorating the third \n     anniversary of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \n     Fairness Act.\n       For close to 30 years, NFIB has worked with Congress to \n     secure meaningful regulatory reform for small business. In \n     1980, the groundwork was laid by the Regulatory Flexibility \n     Act that requires agencies to measure the impact of their \n     regulations on small businesses.\n       Together, with you and other leaders in Congress, we worked \n     hard to address recommendations from the 1995 White House \n     Conference on Small Business. In 1996, many of those \n     recommendations were enacted as part of the Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. This ``Red Tape \n     Reduction Act'' gave teeth to the Regulatory Flexibility Act \n     by making agency decisions under the Act judicially \n     reviewable and adding even more small business safeguards to \n     the rulemaking and enforcement functions of government \n     agencies.\n       Since passage of the Red Tape Reduction Act, NFIB has been \n     committed to ensuring successful implementation of the law. \n     Our small business members have testified on regulatory \n     enforcement before Regulatory Fairness Boards across the \n     country. NFIB members also have participated in panels \n     convened by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) \n     to assist in the development of regulatory proposals. \n     Additionally, we have worked closely with small business \n     trade groups and the U.S. Small Business Administration's \n     Office of Advocacy to ensure that agencies consider the \n     impact on small business prior to regulatory action.\n       Small business has benefitted from passage of the Red Tape \n     Reduction Act. For 3 years, small business has been \n     guaranteed a ``seat at the table'' when government agencies \n     make regulatory decisions. However, more needs to be done. \n     Small businesses with 20 to 49 employees continue to spend, \n     on average, 19 cents out of every dollar on regulatory costs. \n     The very smallest businesses, with 1 to 4 employees, spend \n     almost twice as much per employee on regulatory costs than \n     larger businesses.\n       Your observance of the Red Tape Reduction Act's anniversary \n     is timely. Congressional oversight on agency compliance with \n     the Act is needed now more than ever. Small business, the \n     employer of over one-half of the private workforce, is in \n     danger if we rest on our laurels. There continues to be \n     obstacles in the way of American small business' economic \n     potential: high taxes, excessive regulations, rising health-\n     care costs, and frivolous lawsuits.\n       We commend your leadership in ushering the Red Tape \n     Reduction Act through Congress and to the President for \n     signature 3 years ago. Your continued focus on the needs of \n     small business is honorable, and we remain committed to \n     helping you address the challenges faced by small and \n     independent businesses, in America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Small Business Legislative Council,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC) I would like to congratulate you \n     on the third anniversary of your ``red tape reduction'' law, \n     the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \n     (SBREFA). Personally, I believe it is one of the most \n     important small business laws of all time. We cannot say \n     thank you enough.\n       Only now is everybody, including the agencies, beginning to \n     fully appreciate the value of SBREFA. We must continue the \n     momentum created by SBREFA. At your recent roundtable, we \n     offered several suggestions on how we can make a good thing \n     better, such as including the IRS under the Review Panel \n     provisions.\n       The SBLC is a permanent, independent coalition of eighty \n     trade and professional associations that share a common \n     commitment to the future of small business. Our members \n     represent the interests of small businesses in such diverse \n     economic sectors as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional and technical services, construction, \n     transportation, tourism and agriculture. For your \n     information, a list of our members is enclosed.\n       You have built a small business record to be proud of. \n     SBREFA is an important cornerstone.

Vernon, MI, USA.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Three years ago, the SBREFA bill you \n     authored became law. This was a good bill that became good \n     law. The goal was to cause a sea change in how federal \n     regulatory agencies did business. A change from:\n       They being the good guys and small business being the bad \n     guys\n       They being the cops and us the crooks\n       Enforcing compliance by coercion to working together for \n     the safety of our employees.\n       We have made some progress towards that goal. Some agencies \n     are getting the message. And, some are not. Some divisions, \n     districts, and inspectors are trying to move forward. And, \n     others have been doing it the old way so long that one \n     wonders if they are capable of change. Still others appear to \n     possess a bias towards any free market business trying to \n     provide goods and services, jobs for Americans, and a decent \n     profit.\n       The Regulatory Fairness boards, established by SBREFA, have \n     worked very hard to get the word out about small businesses \n     rights to regulatory fairness. We have talked with all the \n     federal regulatory agencies regarding their statutory \n     requirements under this law. Some are seeking to comply. \n     Others are performing heroic contortions of logic beyond all \n     reason to avoid compliance with this law. Even today, some \n     inspectors and small business advocates appear unaware of the \n     rights of small businesses for regulatory fairness.\n       Some agency departments, such as OSHA in the Kansas oil \n     fields and in the Colorado construction trades, are working \n     with small businesses to develop good safety practices where \n     there are clear measurable issues of workers being harmed. \n     Yet, the same agency, OSHA ,seeks to slam dunk repetitive \n     motion regulations, when most such injuries are related to \n     computer games and sports outside of the work place. Thus, \n     creating an expensive and time consuming conflict between \n     employers and employees.\n       The regulatory fairness boards, comprised of small business \n     owners who are quite busy running their own businesses, have \n     worked very hard to communicate with small business owners \n     about their rights to regulatory fairness. We have taken some \n     compelling testimony regarding excessive and over-zealous \n     enforcement of federal regulations. Last year, the most \n     compelling was HHS and HCFA campaign against the Home Health \n     Care Industry. Your good efforts to halt this campaign are \n     greatly appreciated.\n       Other compelling examples have been forwarded to Congress. \n     The regulatory fairness boards, rightly so, have no authority \n     over the federal regulatory agencies. That is left to \n     Congress and the Administration. We have gathered the \n     comments and high-lighted areas of abuse. Our future success \n     greatly depends upon the actions taken by Congress in \n     response to these abuses. I pray for your courage and \n     success.\n       Three years ago, thanks to SBREFA, we began a long marathon \n     to roll back the tide of regulatory burdens on America's \n     small businesses. We are making progress. It's a marathon. \n     Not, a sprint. I ask that you do not lose heart. I pray that \n     we will not.\n       Thank you for your strong support of America's small \n     businesses.\n     Scott George.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Tooling &\n\n\n                                        Machining Association,\n\n                                Ft. Washington, MD, April 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bond: With the anniversary of the Small \n     Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) upon \n     us, now is the appropriate time to say ``Thank You'' once \n     again for all your work on that important law. SBREFA has put \n     the needed teeth into the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, \n     allowing judicial review of agency rules and the new panel \n     process involving small businesses and the agencies that \n     regulate them.\n       NTMA's future Chairman of the Board, Roger Sustar, recently \n     completed his work on a SBREFA panel with OSHA regarding the \n     draft ergonomics program standard. This was NTMA's first \n     experience in the panel process--and it was amazing! Seeing \n     OSHA sit down and listen to the real small business people \n     this standard would affect was something we would not have \n     dreamed of just a couple of short years ago. While there is \n     still a month before the final panel report is printed, it \n     was a terrific experience to have input before a final \n     ergonomics rule was proposed. I am looking forward to the \n     panel report's recommended changes to the proposed standard, \n     based on the input of small business entity representatives.\n       It is also appropriate to say that the SBA's Office of \n     Advocacy played a key role in the panel process, and that \n     their help was invaluable. Jere Glover and his staff, \n     particularly Claudia Rayford and David Schnare, ensured that \n     small business' voice was heard during the process. NTMA is \n     very supportive of the Office of Advocacy and all they do. We \n     actively support, and have asked for, increased funding in \n     the Budget for this vital part of our government.\n       I know there is a possibility that SBREFA will be expanded \n     to cover the Internal Revenue Service. NTMA fully supports \n     that proposal. If there is anything I can do in that \n     endeavor, just call on me.\n       As the chief sponsor of SBREFA, I congratulate you on the \n     anniversary of this law and applaud your efforts to help \n     small businesses across this country get a fair hearing with \n     the federal government. You have always been a true friend to \n     small business.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John A. Cox, Jr.,\n                                      Manager, Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have heard a lot about the need for \noversight to find out what Government agencies are doing with the laws \nwe pass. Today, I am here to report on the oversight of the Small \nBusiness Committee, because we want to make sure that the small \nbusinesses get the fair treatment they are entitled to under the law.\n  Unfortunately, while we have made some progress and offered hope to \nmany small businesses, we have found a number of agencies have failed \nto make the grade. So in a few moments, I am going to announce a new \nseries of awards for small-business-oppressing Government agencies who \ndeserve to have some help in unclogging the regulatory pipelines in \ntheir office.\n  For several decades, small business owners have watched with dismay \nas Federal regulations have proliferated. These regulations are taking \nincreasingly large amounts of time and money to interpret, and \ncompliance costs have soared. Until recently, we were shocked by the \ngeneral assumption that small business owners spend 5 percent of their \nrevenues to prepare their taxes.\n  Last Monday, in a hearing we had in the Small Business Committee, we \nfound it worse than we imagined. The committee heard testimony from \nBrian Gloe, the co-CEO of Rosse Lithographing Company in Kansas City, \nthat his business, for example, pays more than 16 percent of its net \nincome just to figure out how much it owes the IRS. That is even before \nthey write the check to pay the taxes.\n  As my colleagues well know, the IRS is just one Federal agency. Other \nagencies imposing huge burdens on small businesses include the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor, and the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration. Add to that list the \ncountless other agencies a small business must deal with, depending on \nwhat products it sells or services it provides. Each of these agencies \nhas thousands of requirements which must be followed under penalty of \nfines or even prison time.\n  In short, the Red Tape Reduction Act was long overdue. I was very \npleased that this body passed the measure unanimously. It passed the \nHouse on a consent calendar. It was signed into law on March 29, 1996. \nIt was designed to provide tools to small business owners to assure \nregulatory fairness and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens.\n  The new law contains important innovative provisions. One, it gives \nsmall entities the ability to take an agency to court for failing to \nconsider ways to reduce the economic impact of their new regulations.\n  Two, it requires agencies to prepare ``plain English'' compliance \nguides so that small business owners will not have to hire a team of \nlawyers just to interpret the regulations.\n  Three, it makes it easier for small businesses to recover attorney's \nfees when agencies make demands for outrageous fines and penalties that \nare not sustainable in court.\n  And finally, it allows Congress to review and disapprove certain new \nagency regulations that are extreme or are not what Congress intended.\n  Despite the straightforward nature of this law, it seems some \nagencies are ignoring Congress' commonsense mandate to make things \nsimpler for the little guy and other agencies are actively fighting \nagainst it. On March 10, Senator Kerry, the ranking Democrat on the \nSmall Business Committee, joined me in hosting a roundtable with \nrepresentatives of small business on of the Red Tape Reduction Act. We \nlearned that many agencies have failed to fulfill their obligations \nunder the new law and under the Regulatory Flexibility Act which \npreceded it.\n  These important laws apply to all regulations, unless the head of any\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nagency can demonstrate that a new rule will not have a significant \nimpact on a substantial number of small entities. That makes sense to \nme. When new regulations will affect small businesses, the agency \nshould comply with the law so the burdens on small businesses will be \nidentified and reduced.\n\n  You would think that agencies would embrace gladly the opportunity to \nhelp, rather than impose unnecessary burdens on the smallest of \nbusinesses. Regrettably, that just is not the case. A closer look shows \nthat these agencies are using every trick in the book, exploiting every \nknown loophole, and creating new ones not to comply with the law. \nRather than help, they work to exempt the regulations from the law.\n  Here are a couple of examples: No. 1, false and ridiculous claims. \nEPA is infamous for its legalistic dodge, asserting that the national \nambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter would \nnot affect small entities. This flies in the face of our experience, \nwhen they jack the standards up so hard it requires punitive measures \nthat harshly burden small businesses. I have heard from many government \nofficials in towns throughout Missouri who are concerned that their \nconstituents will lose jobs as a result of those standards.\n  Two, raising the bar. Agencies avoid compliance with the law by \nerroneously asserting a rule would not have a significant impact on \nsmall businesses. But data from the affected small businesses clearly \nshow otherwise. They are being affected in large numbers.\n  Three, the artful dodge. Agencies like the EPA and OSHA avoid the law \nby issuing guidance and permits rather than rules subject to notice and \ncomment. I guess they have not heard the old saying: If it walks like a \nduck and it quacks like a duck, it must be a duck--even if they want to \ncall it a permit or guidance.\n  Fourth, the plain old loophole. The Health Care Financing \nAdministration, HCFA, in particular has abused a narrow ``good cause'' \nexception to avoid following these laws.\n  These are just a few examples of ways to get around the law. Instead \nof implementing simple, needed reforms, the agencies thumb their noses \nat Congress and the millions of small business owners. Their sleight of \nhand has not gone unnoticed. I am not going to stand idly by. Too often \nin Washington, when we pass a law in Congress, we move on to something \nelse and forget about it. The agencies write the regulations, implement \nthe laws however they want to, and your unsuspecting constituents find \nout the law they think was passed is something else entirely once the \nregulators write the regulations. That is why we need to change the \nviews of some of the Washington bureaucrats.\n  I am not going to look the other way. I am going to make sure the \nagencies do what the new law requires them to do and what is required \nunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Several months ago, I asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office to assess agency compliance with the \nprovisions of the Reg Flex Act. Today, I am releasing GAO's report and \nfindings.\n  While the Reg Flex Act has been the law for 18 years, GAO found that \nthe agencies' knowledge of the actual requirements is lacking and that \nnoncompliance is widespread. Agencies are failing right and left to \nmeet the basic requirements of the law passed by Congress and enacted \non a bipartisan, unanimous basis by the Congress in 1996.\n  Congress told them to look over the agency's regulations to see if \nthere is any way we can change or eliminate regulations to make life \neasier for small business. That is all--just a review, just a \nrecommendation. But they are not even doing that.\n  The GAO identified seven agencies that have consistently issued \nregulations affecting small business but have failed to conduct the \nperiodic reviews required. What is the holdup? The agencies have \nthousands of employees. It seems the administrators might be able to \nuse one or two of them to look at the regulations and see if any can be \nchanged, particularly in this administration which touts its so-called \n``reinventing Government'' plan.\n  Perhaps this award we are announcing today will remind them. Today I \nam awarding the ``Plumber's Best Friend Award,'' a plunger, to each \nagency which has failed to get the process moving, those agencies which \nneed to unclog their pipelines and review existing rules. I am sending \nthe head of each agency a letter explaining the requirements for \nperiodic review and asking them to outline the steps they will take to \nget the agency in compliance.\n  And now for that moment you all have been waiting for. The winners of \nthe first ``Plumber's Best Friend Award'' are: Department of Commerce, \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Department of the Interior, \nDepartment of the Treasury, Federal Communications Commission, and the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  But the grand prize winner in my book is the Small Business \nAdministration. Believe it or not, the agency whose mission it is to \nsafeguard the interests of and to assist small business owners has \nfailed to follow this small-business-friendly law. Think about it; SBA \nshould be the advocate for small business at the Cabinet table, \nensuring Government-wide compliance, not showing indifference to the \nlaw. I was stunned that the SBA cannot get a passing grade.\n  But it gets even worse. Nine other agencies completely failed to \nreport to Congress by March 29 on their efforts to help small business \nas required in the act. All agencies that regulate small entities were \nto provide informal compliance assistance and penalty reductions for \nthose small businesses seeking to comply in good faith. As we have \nlearned, if we do not require progress reports, no progress is made. So \nwe gave everyone 2 years to figure out how to do the right thing. But \nnine Federal agencies could not even get a report out on time. Ask \nyourself what happens to a small business woman running a business out \nof her home if she does not get an IRS, OSHA, or EPA form filed on \ntime. They do not just overlook it; they come down on and crack hard on \nthe small business.\n  The agencies failing to even report were the Departments of Defense, \nJustice, Veterans Affairs, the General Services Administration, the \nNational Archive and Records Administration, the National Space and \nAeronautics Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and \nthe Architectural and Transportation Barriers Control Board.\n  But, again, most outrageous among the nine agencies that missed the \ndeadline: the Small Business Administration. In fact, when I brought \nthis to the SBA Administrator's attention, the SBA's general counsel \nhad the audacity to claim the SBA was not covered by certain provisions \nof the law because SBA was not a regulatory agency. So today I am \nsending another letter to SBA, explaining why they are covered by the \nRed Tape Reduction Act and calling on the Administrator to take \nimmediate steps to comply with the law.\n  I ask unanimous consent these three letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Small Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC. April 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Aida Alvarez,\n     Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Alvarez: On March 16, I requested an \n     explanation as to why the Small Business Administration (SBA/\n     Agency) failed to report to Congress as required under \n     sections 213 and 223 of the Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Act of SBREFA) (Title II of \n     P.L. 104-121). My letter also asked SBA to report to Congress \n     on its implementation of sections 213 and 223 of SBREFA, \n     which require agencies to provide informal compliance \n     assistance and penalty reductions/waivers to small entities. \n     On March 31, 1999, I received a reply from SBA's General \n     Counsel Michael D. Schattman. Unfortunately, SBA's response \n     was inadequate and raises additional concerns regarding SBA's \n     understanding of and compliance with the Act. In preparing \n     this letter, I consulted with the Congressional Research \n     Service and the Senate Legislative Counsel, and they \n     concurred with my analysis and conclusion that SBA's \n     explanation for its noncompliance is inconistent with the \n     statue on its face, a legal analysis of the statute, and the \n     intent of Congress as documented in the legislative history.\n       In SBA's letter, Mr. Schattman asserts that SBA did not \n     need to report to Congress because SBA is not a regulatory \n     agency or, at least, not the type of regulatory agency SBA \n     believes was covered by sections 213 and 223. The rationale \n     behind this strained, interpretation appears to be that SBA \n     is not covered by sections 213 and 223 because: (1)\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\n     SBA's programs ``aid, counsel and protect small business;'' \n     (2) SBA does not ``impose penalties for regulatory \n     violations''; and (3) SBA allegedly does not ``force small \n     businesses to comply with laws and regulations that require \n     them to conduct their businesses in a certain way.'' I \n     strongly differ with the basis for SBA's rationale.\n       First of all, sections 213 and 223 invoke the definition of \n     ``agency'' found in section 551 of title 5, U.S. Code. SBA is \n     not expressly or implicitly excluded from this definition. \n     SBA's attempt to excuse its noncompliance by claiming not be \n     a ``regulatory agency'' also fails because the term \n     ``regulatory agency'' is again based on the definition of \n     ``agency'' found in section 551 of title 5, U.S. Code, which \n     pertains to administrative procedures and rulemaking.\n       In general, an agency is a regulatory agency if it has \n     statutory authority to issue rules and enforce compliance \n     with them. SBA is, therefore, a regulatory agency. SBA issues \n     regulations that govern the participation of small business, \n     small governments, and small not-for-profits in the programs \n     it administers. For instance, SBA issues regulations that \n     determine which small businesses qualify as a small \n     disadvantaged business (SDB), a HUBZONE small business \n     concern, or a 7(a) lender. SBA audits compliance with and \n     enforces the requirements of these and other regulations. If \n     a small business is not in compliance with the regulations, \n     SBA has the authority to remove a small business from the \n     list of approved SDBs or HUBZONE small business concerns. SBA \n     can disqualify a financial institution from eligibility as a \n     7(a) lender or a certified development company under section \n     504 of the Small Business Investment Act. Consequently, SBA's \n     strained interpretation is not supported in law or fact.\n       The statement that ``SBA does not believe the SBREFA \n     reports were required'' only makes sense if two points are \n     assumed correct: (1) that sections 213 and 223 apply only to \n     agencies that impose monetary penalties or fines; and (2) SBA \n     does not impose monetary penalties or fine. While I might \n     concede that section 223 speaks to penalties and fines, \n     section 213 is not limited to compliance assistance related \n     to regulations that carry penalties or fines. SBA's argument \n     is further flawed because not only does SBA's enforcement \n     authority have financial implications for small businesses, \n     but SBA has the authority to impose monetary penalties and \n     Mr. Schattman's letter lists four such instances. SBA appears \n     to have gotten scarred away with its post hoc analysis of why \n     it did not comply with these sections and their respective \n     reporting requirements. As the Chairman of the Committee that \n     authorizes SBA's programs, I cannot agree with the statement \n     that ``[i]n no circumstances can SBA regulate, control or \n     penalize a small business in the conduct of its enterprise.'' \n     This statement does not square with SBA's statutory \n     authority. For instance, section 687 of title 15, U.S. Code, \n     authorizes SBA ``to prescribe regulations governing the \n     operation of small business investment companies, and to \n     carry out the provisions of this Act. . . .'' SBA's claim is \n     also contradicted by its inclusion in the November 9, 1998-\n     edition of Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory \n     Actions and the publication of SBA's regulatory plan, \n     outlining the Agency's regulatory priorities, and SBA's \n     semiannual regulatory agenda. It is clear that SBA must be \n     enforcing the regulations it promulgates.\n       In addition, Mr. Schattman's letter lists four instances \n     where SBA can impose monetary penalties on Small Business \n     Investment Centers (SBICs) or individuals obtaining disaster \n     loans. This fact alone appears to discredit the assertion \n     that SBA is not covered by section 213 and 223. SBA's \n     argument is further undermined by the fact that many SBICs \n     meet SBA's definition of a small business and a small \n     business concern can be a borrower under the disaster loan \n     program. Consequently, we need look no further than SBA's own \n     letter to identify situations that trigger SBA's obligation \n     to comply with sections 213 and 223. Ironically, SBA's \n     authority to enforce its regulations and impose penalties is \n     by no means limited to these four situations.\n       While I believe SBA's narrow definition of what constitutes \n     a regulatory agency is without merit, even conceding this \n     constrained definition for argument's sake, SBA's letter \n     contradicts itself further. In the letter, the Agency \n     confirms it is covered by section 222, which created the \n     Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement \n     Ombudsman and Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. \n     (emphasis added.) The Ombudsman listed SBA as a covered \n     agency in its reports covering 1997 and 1998, and Mr. \n     Schattman's letter notes that SBA gladly accepts credit given \n     it by the SBA-appointed Ombudsman. This appears to conflict \n     with SBA's assertion that it does not regulate small \n     businesses. In fact, in the Ombudsman's 1997 report, SBA is \n     the subject of two complaints from small businesses that \n     ``involved enforcement or compliance activity undertaken by a \n     federal regulatory agency with regard to a small business.'' \n     When the SBA-appointed Ombudsman provided SBA with a copy of \n     the draft report for review, SBA wrote back stating it had no \n     comment on the report. In its letter regarding the next \n     year's draft report, SBA alleged that it was not a regulatory \n     agency; however, in that same letter, SBA says that it will \n     give small businesses notice of their right to comment to the \n     Ombudsman when ``we engage in enforcement procedures.'' The \n     letter also references SBA's ``enforcement and compliance \n     activities.'' Again, I fail to see how SBA can argue that it \n     is covered under section 222 and not sections 213 and 223.\n       Mr. Schattman's letter failed to mention that numerous \n     small businesses complained to the Ombudsman about SBA's \n     enforcement actions. In fact, the Ombudsman's recent report \n     states that SBA was mentioned in 18 written comments and by \n     16 people that testified before the Enforcement Ombudsman and \n     Fairness Boards. While some of these complaints may not fall \n     within the Ombudsman's authority, they would seem to imply \n     that SBA's rules and regulations do indeed affect the \n     operations of small businesses. As an example, one small \n     business complained about SBA's denial of a guaranteed loan. \n     In response, SBA informed the company why the ``good cause'' \n     waiver of the 7(a) loan program's ``prior loss rule'' did not \n     apply. SBA's own corrective action, informing the District \n     Offices of the procedures to follow, further suggests that \n     the requirements of section 213 and 223 are applicable to \n     SBA.\n       In addition, Mr. Schattman wrote that ``SBREFA only \n     addresses enforcement proceedings. . . .'' Quite to the \n     contrary, the Act amended chapter 6 of title 5, U.S. Code \n     (commonly known as the Regulatory Flexibility Act) to address \n     explicitly rulemaking activities affecting small entities. In \n     fact, SBA's Office of Advocacy, which is referenced in the \n     letter, is actively involved in the Small Business Advocacy \n     Review Panels created under the Act and is exercising its \n     authority to file amicus briefs in cases initiated by small \n     entities aggrieved by agency noncompliance with the \n     requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. While \n     improving fairness toward small entities during agency \n     enforcement actions is an important part of the Act, the law \n     also addresses agency rulemaking and informal compliance \n     assistance with statutes and agency regulations.\n       In conclusion, there is nothing in Mr. Schattman's letter \n     that relieves SBA of its obligation to comply with sections \n     213 and 223. Moreover, there is nothing in the law that \n     allows SBA to forego the requirement to report to Congress on \n     its implementation of these sections. While SBA may not be a \n     regulatory agency of the magnitude of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency or the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration, the scope of SBA's activities, its programs \n     and rulemaking activities are consistent with the definition \n     of a regulatory agency. The simple fact that SBA has the \n     authority to issue regulations that affect small entities--\n     positively or negatively--triggers the need to comply with \n     the Act. Furthermore, the Act provides agencies with broad \n     discretion to implement the general requirements of these \n     sections in accordance with the agency's underlying statutes \n     and programs.\n       It would be an oversight if I did not express my \n     disappointment with SBA. Indeed, I would have expected SBA to \n     lead the charge to comply with this law, which was enacted in \n     great part to implement recommendations from the 1995 White \n     House Conference on Small Business. However, it appears that \n     rather than engaging its attorneys in an effort to comply \n     with the law, SBA instead asked them to devise a rationale to \n     justify noncompliance. This is unacceptable. Consequently, I \n     request that SBA immediately implement programs to provide \n     compliance assistance to small entities and to offer penalty \n     reductions, or waivers, where appropriate, and keep this \n     Committee apprised of your efforts. I look forward to \n     receiving a response by 3:00, April 29, 1999, detailing the \n     steps you will take to bring SBA into compliance with SBREFA.\n       Should you need additional information, please contact me \n     or Suey Howe, the Committee's Regulatory Counsel, at 224-\n     5175.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Christopher S.

Aida Alvarez,\n     Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Alvarez: The Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Act) required federal \n     agencies that regulate the activities of small business to \n     implement programs to provide informal compliance assistance \n     and penalty reductions/waivers to small entities, including \n     small businesses, small governments and small not-for-profit \n     organizations. All such federal agencies, including the Small \n     Business Administration (SBA or Agency), were to report to \n     Congress on implementation of these programs no later than \n     March 29, 1998--nearly one year ago. To date, SBA has not \n     submitted to this Committee the reports to Congress required \n     under Sections 213 and 223 of the Act.\n       As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \n     as the principal author of the Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act, I request a detailed explanation \n     why SBA failed to fulfill its statutory obligation to report \n     to Congress on SBA's implementation of the requirements under \n     Sections 213 and 223. Furthermore, I request that SBA provide \n     these reports to this Committee, as well as the other \n     committees named in the statute to receive the reports, by \n     March 31, 1999. Moreover, should SBA fail to meet a statutory \n     deadline in the future, I expect the Agency to advise this\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\n     Committee of its failure in writing, describing why the \n     deadline was missed and when the required activities will be \n     completed. In closing, and perhaps most importantly, SBA's \n     failure to comply with these reporting requirements raises \n     questions regarding the Agency's commitment to fulfilling its \n     responsibilities under the Act, which was enacted by Congress \n     to ensure that federal agencies treat small businesses fairly \n     in rulemaking and enforcement activities.\n       Should you need additional information, please contact me \n     or Suey Howe, the Committee's Regulatory Counsel, at 224-\n     5175.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of General \n           Counsel,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 31, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I have been asked by Administrator \n     Alvarez to respond to your letter of March 16, 1999, to \n     provide you with my legal interpretation of the Small \n     Business Regulatory Enforcement Act (SBREFA). The Small \n     Business Administration (SBA) strongly supports SBREFA. As an \n     Agency we are very sensitive to the problems that small \n     businesses face in dealing with regulatory agencies that \n     impose penalties for regulatory violations and force small \n     businesses to comply with laws and regulations that require \n     them to conduct their businesses in a certain way.\n       However, SBA is in a different category. All of our \n     programs and activities are specifically designed to aid, \n     counsel and protect small businesses. Unlike regulatory \n     agencies that set policies with which small businesses must \n     comply, SBA provides assistance and counseling. As you know, \n     SBA reports annually, and in many cases more often, on its \n     program activities and the assistance it provides. Therefore, \n     SBA does not believe the SBREFA reports were required.\n       Rather than regulate small businesses, we provide small \n     businesses access to capital indirectly by guaranteeing loans \n     made by our lending resource partners. Through our Small \n     Business Development Centers, we counsel and train small \n     businesses to start or grow their businesses, often by \n     providing them with information on SBA's programs. Also, SBA \n     assists small businesses in obtaining government contracts \n     through our procurement programs and through working with \n     other Federal agencies to encourage them to contract with \n     small businesses.\n       SBA is committed to ensuring that we meet both the spirit \n     and dictates of SBREFA. We provide support to the National \n     Ombudsman and the Regulatory Fairness Boards. As you know, \n     the Office of the National Ombudsman is fully staffed and can \n     draw on the resources of the Agency whenever necessary. After \n     consulting with the National Ombudsman, we established a \n     process to respond speedily and thoroughly to small business \n     issues raised with the National Ombudsman.\n       In fact, we received special mention in the Ombudsman's \n     Report filed with you on March 1, 1999, for our commitment to \n     using high-level, independent staff to process SBREFA \n     comments. Additionally, we are constantly developing new ways \n     to reach as many small businesses as we can to tell them how \n     to take advantage of our programs.\n       SBA is not a ``regulatory'' agency. It does not, except in \n     very rare instances, impose penalties or conduct enforcement \n     activities. In fact, there are only four instances in which \n     SBA can impose a monetary penalty. (The four instances are: \n     SBA may impose a penalty on an SBIC for failure to cooperate \n     in an examination or for providing books and records in poor \n     condition; SBA may impose a penalty on an individual who \n     wrongfully applies disaster loan proceeds; SBA may impose a \n     penalty on an SBIC for every day that an SBIC fails to report \n     pursuant to the Small Business Investment Act; SBA may impose \n     penalties on a lender or a fiscal transfer agent in certain \n     circumstances.) None of these four penalties are imposed \n     against small businesses--two may be imposed on Small \n     Business Investment Companies, one may be imposed on \n     individuals receiving disaster loans, and one may be imposed \n     on lenders or fiscal transfer agents. In no circumstance can \n     SBA regulate, control or penalize a small business in the \n     conduct of its enterprise.\n       However, SBA is covered by other sections of SBREFA and has \n     been very responsive to the Regulatory Fairness Program \n     (RegFair) developed by the National Ombudsman and Regional \n     Fairness Boards. For example, we eagerly participate, as an \n     Agency, not just through the Ombudsman's Office, in regional \n     RegFair meetings.\n       While SBREFA only addresses enforcement proceedings, I \n     would be remiss in not mentioning SBA's Office of Advocacy. \n     The Office of Advocacy works with Federal agencies in \n     developing regulations that address small business concerns. \n     The Office of Advocacy helps ensure that agency policies are \n     structured in such a way that agencies, using fair \n     enforcement policies, can achieve their missions with the \n     least possible burdens on small entities.\n       SBA strongly supports your efforts on behalf of small \n     business and believes that, working together, we can provide \n     a more positive atmosphere in which small businesses can \n     flourish. I would be glad to meet with you or your staff to \n     discuss this further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Michael D. Schattman,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. BOND. For the Reg Flex and Red Tape Reduction Act to deliver the \nbenefits intended by Congress, the agencies must comply with the law. \nIt is that simple. Too many agencies, too many officials, \nunfortunately, in this administration seem to have the attitude that \nthey are Olympians on the hill who know what is best for the peasants \nin the valley, when it really is the other way around. We should be \nlistening to what the people who create the jobs and the economic well-\nbeing in our country, the small business sector, are saying.\n  Perhaps these plungers will help unclog things. But if sunshine and \nfriendly persuasion will not work and if a plumber's friend cannot get \nit unclogged, it may be time to put civil penalties and fines in place \nso the agencies know we are serious. The job we are telling them to do \nis simple: Help small business, don't hurt it. If they will not do it, \nif the plumber's best friend won't help them, then we will change the \nlaw again and impose some penalties.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak about three items today. \nFirst, I want to talk for just a moment about Kosovo and the NATO \nactions in Kosovo.\n  I had a town meeting in North Dakota over the weekend and had a \nfairly large number of North Dakotans pack into a rather small room, \nand we had a 1\\1/2\\ hour discussion about the airstrikes in which NATO, \nincluding the United States, is involved in Yugoslavia and in Kosovo. I \nexpect I am joined by all of my colleagues when I say I hope and pray \nthe hostilities in the region will cease. I hope Mr. Milosevic will \npull back his Serb troops and that we will be able to restore peace and \norder and have the opportunity to find a way to provide those refugees \nwho have streamed across the border the opportunity to go home.\n  Most North Dakotans who have communicated with me, and those who came \nto this weekend's meeting I had in Fargo on this subject, are anxious \nand nervous and concerned about what is happening in the region.\n  They do not have any better answers than I or my colleagues, or \nanyone else for that matter, on what to do when someone like Mr. \nMilosevic commits genocide or ethnic cleansing, including substantial \nmassacres of the civilian population in the region of Kosovo.\n  The question that all of us at this weekend's meeting in North Dakota \nposed was, What shall we do? Shall we say it is none of our business, \nit is not in our part of the world? Genocide committed by Mr. Milosevic \nor ethnic cleansing is not something we need to be concerned about? I \nthink most people believe that is not the answer either.\n  Clearly, we do not want in 5 or 10 years from now to look back and \nsay, that genocide or Holocaust, or whatever it was Mr. Milosevic \ncommitted, killing thousands, perhaps ultimately hundreds of thousands, \nis something that we did not care about. If that were the case, I think \nit would be reasonable to say shame on us.\n  We must be involved and we must care. The question is, How do we \naddress it? How do we effectively thwart the attempt by Mr. Milosevic \nto clear all of the Albanians out of Kosovo? How do we thwart his \nattempt to massacre innocent civilians with the Serb Army? How do we \nrestore order to this region?\n  I have supported the airstrikes, and I hope and pray they succeed in \ndriving Mr. Milosevic back. I have said before and I reiterate today \nthat I do not and will not support the introduction of U.S. ground \ntroops to the Balkans. I think that would be a horrible mistake.\n  Frankly, the bulk of the airstrikes have occurred in the Balkan \nregion with U.S. planes and U.S. pilots. If, in fact, ground troops are \nultimately needed, I believe it is the responsibility of the European \ncountries to commit those ground troops. I know NATO is involved in \nthis as an alliance, and we are a significant part of that alliance. \nBut the United States bears the heaviest burden in the air war, bears \nthe heaviest cost in the airstrikes, and I think if ground troops \nultimately are necessary--and I hope they will not be--I think those \nground troops must be furnished by the European countries. I will not \nsupport the position that we should introduce U.S. ground troops in the \nBalkans. I believe that would be a serious mistake, and I cannot and \nwill not support that.\n  Let me again say, I do not believe my constituents or my colleagues \nhave any easy answers. This is not an easy situation. Things are \nhappening in the Balkans that I think all of the world looks at with \nhorror and says, ``We must do something to try to respond to it.'' But \nit is not easy.\n  Dozens of foreign powers over many centuries have gone to the Balkans \nonly to experience profound disappointment in their attempt to change \nsomething that was internally happening in that region of the world.\n  Let me hope, along with my colleagues, that these airstrikes by NATO \nwill convince Mr. Milosevic that the price is too high to continue \ndoing what he is doing in that region to so many innocent men, women, \nand children. Let us hope that this is a success sooner rather than \nlater and we can provide some peace and stability to that region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3830-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3830-S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FAMILY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk just for a moment about \nagriculture and the challenge facing agriculture.\n  On Saturday, I was in an airplane and opened up a newspaper to an \ninteresting article. I have spoken about agriculture and family farmers \nduring the past weeks. I have talked about what is happening in our \npart of the country with the depopulation of middle America, rural \ncommunities drying up--shriveling like prunes, people moving out--not \nmoving in, Main Street businesses boarding up, family farmers going \nbroke, and nobody seemingly caring very much.\n  The business section of the Minneapolis Tribune had two fascinating \nstories on the front page. They respond in a kind of perverse way to \nwhat is happening, both in this Chamber and also around the country \nwith respect to the policy dealing with family farmers.\n\n  The first article: ``Cargill Profits from Decline in Farm Prices; 53 \npercent jump in earnings expected.'' Cargill is a large company and has \nalways done quite well, I believe. It is a privately held company. It \npurchases agricultural products and is involved in a wide range of \nactivities adding value to agricultural products.\n  ``Cargill Profits from Decline in Farm Prices.'' Is that unusual? No. \nBig agribusinesses all too often are profiting from the misery of \nAmerica's family farmers. Family farmers on the one side go broke; \nwhile Cargill sees a 53 percent jump in earnings. Cargill, \nincidentally, wants now to marry up with Continental Grain. Cargill and \nContinental want to get married, merge, and become bigger, with more \nmarket power.\n  In the question of market power, it is reasonable to ask, who wins \nand who loses? Family farmers all too often lose, and those with the \nmost market power win. ``Cargill Profits from the Decline in Farm \nPrices.'' You could wipe out the name ``Cargill'' and include any \nnumber of agribusinesses. I am not picking on Cargill; they just \nhappened to be in this paper on Saturday.\n  Let's go to the article on the bottom of the front page. Family \nfarmers are going broke because commodity prices have collapsed. The \nprice of wheat has collapsed. The article states, ``General Mills to \nboost cereal prices 2.5 percent'':\n\n       General Mills, Inc., the maker of Cheerios, Wheaties and \n     Lucky Charms, is raising cereal prices an average of 2.5 \n     percent.\n\n  One might ask the question, in terms of public policy, What is going \non in this country when the folks who gas up the tractor in the spring, \nborrow money to buy seed, fertilizer, plant the crop, harvest the \nwheat, sell it in the market, and then go broke because they are told \nthat the wheat they produced from their fields has no value? But the \npeople who buy that wheat and turn it into Cheerios or Wheaties or \nLucky Charms, even though the prices of commodities have collapsed and \nthey are paying the farmer less--in fact, so little that family farmers \nare going broke in record numbers--they say they need to boost cereal \nprices that people pay at the grocery store.\n  I woke up this morning and I ate a bowl of cereal. I will not \nadvertise which cereal it was, but I ate a bowl of cereal. I looked at \nthe box, after I had seen this in the paper on Saturday, and I read the \nlabel about what is in this\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\ncereal I am eating. I will tell you what is in the cereal--grain.\n  So this company buys it from farmers, pays them a pittance, and then \nthey puff it or crisp it or shred it. Once they have it all puffed and \nlabeled as Puffed Wheat or Shredded Wheat, the process is all done. \nThey have added the air to the grain or they have shredded it with a \nknife, then they put it on the grocery store shelf and charge a fortune \nfor it.\n  Buy a box of cereal at the grocery store and ask yourself whether you \nlike that price. Now, they say it is not enough. While farmers are \ngoing broke, they say they need to boost cereal prices. Talk about a \ndisconnection and evidence that the market system does not work in \nagriculture. There must surely be a golden rule here, the one that \nsays--those who have the gold make the rules--there must be a golden \nrule here that says cereal manufacturers can increase prices with \nimpunity while family farmers go broke because they are selling their \ngrain at the elevator and are told that their food has no value.\n  I mentioned last week an auction sale by a farm wife in North Dakota. \nShe wrote a letter and said they were forced to sell out. She said her \n17-year-old son would not even come down, he stayed in bed during the \nday of the auction sale and refused to come down to witness the auction \nsale of this farm because he was heartbroken. It was breaking his \nheart.  It was breaking his heart that they were having to sell their \nfarm. He wanted to farm.\n\n  This is all about human misery, failure--and it is not their fault. \nIt is not the family farmers' fault that commodity prices have \ncollapsed at the same time we have a hungry world. Hundreds of millions \nof people go to bed with an ache in their belly every night because \nthey do not have enough to eat, while our farmers are told their \nproduct has no value. And when companies take the farmers product and \nturn it into cereal by puffing it, then they send it to the grocery \nstore, they say it not only has value, in fact, they are announcing a \nprice increase. Yet, they have received record profits and now want to \nincrease cereal prices.\n  I want to put up a chart that shows the average annual return on \nequity for the major cereal manufacturers, 1993 to 1997: 29 percent, 24 \npercent, 25 percent, 22 percent.\n  Our family farmers are going broke raising the products that go into \nthese cereals; and the largest corporations that make cereal are making \nvery substantial returns on their equity. There is something wrong with \nthat economic system. Some say, ``Well, that's just the way it works. \nThe big get bigger and the small get phased out.'' If this country \ndecides it is worth losing family farmers, it will have lost something \nof great value to our country.\n  Some in this Chamber think having only giant agrifactories around in \nthe future is fine. They will buy up farms from coast to coast. Only \nhaving large farms in America is not fine with me. This country will \nhave taken a giant step backwards, unless we fundamentally change the \nfarm law this year and provide a decent safety net for family farmers. \nWe do it for another segment in our economy. We provide a safety net \nfor workers with a minimum wage.\n  Family farmers were told, under the current farm bill--about 3 years \nago--``We're going to pull the safety net out from under you.'' And \nthen, of course, prices collapsed, and the result is family farmers \nhave no effective safety net.\n  I just say that when you look at what is going on in the business \npage of the newspaper, ``Cargill profits from decline in farm prices'' \nand ``General Mills to boost cereal prices''--I do not mean to single \nout these two companies, they are doing what economic clout and power \nallows them to do--but it is unfair to family farmers.\n  We have asked for substantial investigations by the Justice \nDepartment about the concentration of economic power and what it is \ndoing to the family-sized farm. I hope the Justice Department will \nmove, and move aggressively, on these issues. But more importantly, \nthis Congress needs to decide, in the next few weeks, whether it wants \nfamily farmers left in this country. And if it does, we have to do a U-\nturn on farm policy and reconnect a decent safety net for family-sized \nfarms.\n  I know what some people say, ``Well, all this is wonderful, but it's \nboring and it's not very important.'' It is critically important to \nfamilies out there struggling to make a living.\n  Will Rogers said, many years ago, ``You know, if on one day all the \nlawyers on Wall Street failed to show up for lunch, it wouldn't mean a \nthing for this country. But if one day all the cows in our country \nfailed to show up to be milked, that would be a problem.'' What he was \ntrying to describe was a difference between those who move paper around \nin America and those who produce real products on the farm, that are of \nreal value and contribute to feeding our country. That admonition by \nWill Rogers is just as important today.\n  I hope the Justice Department will take a look at the Cargill-\nContinental merger with a critical eye, to say, why do we need \ncorporations in this system, already too large, to get bigger? Why do \nwe need them to impose their economic will on small producers? Why do \nwe need to give them more economic clout to do that?\n  I hope the Justice Department will look at market  concentration in \nmeat packing and in a whole range of other areas, because those are the \nkinds of things that are undermining the foundation of America's family \nfarms.\n\n  A number of us will speak at greater length on these issue in the \ncoming days, because we must convince this Congress that we have a \nresponsibility to develop a farm program that works, one that tells \nfamily farmers: ``You matter to our future. And we want you to be able \nto make a decent living if you work hard on the family farm.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3831-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3831-S3832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              INCOME TAXES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last Thursday was tax filing day, and we \nhad a number of my colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and talk \nabout taxes. I have yet to meet anybody who likes taxes. I know taxes \npay for the cost of civilization. I know we would not have the kind of \ncountry we have in this country without taxes. I know that the ability \nto drive on good roads, to have a police force, to have a fire \ndepartment, to have a Defense Department, to have safe food through \nfood inspectors, to be able to control our borders--all of those things \nrequire the payment of taxes.\n  But our tax system has become enormously complicated, and it ought to \nchange. I authored, about a year and a half ago, a proposal called the \nFair and Simple Shortcut Tax Plan; it is called the FASST Plan.\n  You want to file your tax return with minimum bother? You want to \navoid having to file an income tax return at all? Then this is a plan \nthat will work for you.\n  It was not too many years ago that the American people, by and large, \ndid not have to file an income tax return because only a small \npercentage of the American people paid income taxes. About 6 percent of \nthe American people had a requirement to file a tax return. The rest of \nthe people did not. For those who had to file, they had a very thin \ninstruction booklet, just a couple of pages.\n  Now we have an instruction booklet with our income tax return that \nlooks very much like a J.C. Penney's catalog. We have moved \ndramatically in the wrong direction with a highly complicated federal \nincome tax system. Taxpayers are spending more than 3 billion hours at \na cost of some $75 billion in trying to comply with our federal income \ntax laws every year; and it need not be that way.\n  We have had people come to the floor of the Senate to say, ``I have a \nbetter idea. Let's abolish the whole federal income tax.'' I would like \nto know what they want to put in its place before abolishing it. Others \nsay, ``Let's have a flat tax so that the person making $30,000 a year \ncan pay the same tax rate as Ross Perot or Donald Trump pay.'' I do not \nhappen to share that belief.\n  Still some others say, ``Let's have a national sales tax; get rid of \nthe income tax and put a national sales tax on everything.'' I don't \nknow how much you would like to buy a home and discover you have to pay \na 35 percent sales tax on the value of the home. Or if that is the \nfirst thing you would exempt, how much higher would the national sales \ntax rate increase in order to get the required money to make the \ndifference?\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n  My point is, it sounds great to say, ``Let's abolish the income \ntax,'' but I want to know what you want to do in place of it. Some \nwould say--and some have offered plans here in the Senate and the \nHouse--``Let's have a different tax system. Let's have one that taxes \nwork. You go out and work for a living? We want you to pay a tax. But \nif, on the other hand, you get your income from capital gains, \ndividends or interest, you don't pay a tax. Let's tax only activities \nfrom work; and let's exempt investments.''\n  I guess that sounds pretty good, if all your income comes from \ninvestment. Guess who would pay taxes and be exempt under that kind of \nscheme. The wealthiest folks would be exempt and the working people \nwould pay the taxes. That is a tax on work.\n  My point is, let's take a look at seeing if we can't change the \ncurrent system in a way that benefits at least a fair number of the \nAmerican people.\n  Here is what I propose we do. More than 30 countries have some kind \nof income tax system in which most of the taxpayers, or many of the \ntaxpayers, do not have a requirement to file an income tax return. Here \nis how I would propose we do it. Everyone who signs in at work for a \njob fills out a W-4 form. It says, My name is so and so. My Social \nSecurity number is x, y, and Z. I'm claiming this many allowances. And \nI am married, filing jointly, or whatever that information would \nconclude; and therefore your employer calculates how much income tax \nshall be withheld from your weekly or monthly wage.\n  I propose an approach where we would put a couple of extra lines on \nthe W-4 form, and for a lot of Americans--perhaps 60 to 70 million \nAmericans--with a few extra checkmarks on the W-4 form, their \nwithholding at work will become their exact tax liability for the year. \nThey would have no requirement to file a tax return--no return to be \nfiled at all--therefore, no trips to the post office on April 15 and no \nworry about major audits. What is your wage? and based on what you \nchecked on your W-4 form, what kind of withholding is necessary.\n  Let me give you an example of how we would do that. Families earning \nup to $100,000 in annual wages--$50,000 for singles--and up to $5,000 \nin capital gains, dividends and other non-wage income--$2,500 for \nsingles--may elect this tax return-free filing system at work. This \nother income would be tax free. When they sign in at work, they would \nsimply fill out a slightly modified W-4 form that allows them to have \ntheir employers withhold their exact tax obligation computed by using a \ntable provided by the IRS, and they would pay a single low tax rate of \n15 percent on their wages. They would still be allowed their standard \ndeduction, their personal exemptions, a deduction for home mortgage \ninterest and property taxes paid, and their child tax credits. Those \nwould be the couple of extra boxes checked on the W-4 form. But by and \nlarge, this would radically simplify income tax filing for 60 to 70 \nmillion Americans to say to them, check these extra boxes, you, \ntherefore, do not have to file an April 15 tax return. You have a flat \n15-percent tax rate on wages, and your other income, up to $5,000 for \nmarried, filing jointly, is totally exempt from any income tax \nobligation.\n\n  This system makes a great deal of sense in my judgment, and, as I \nindicated, anywhere from 60 to 70 million Americans will be able to \ndecide if they want to use this system and, therefore, not be required \nto file any income tax return at all on April 15.\n  The reason I am describing this system today is the discussion last \nweek on tax day was interesting. I do not quarrel with those who say we \nought to change the current tax system. Yes, we should.\n  The first step would be to dramatically simplify the responsibility \nfor filing income tax returns for the bulk of the American people. I am \nsaying that the majority of taxpayers could avoid having to file any \nincome tax return at all on April 15, could avoid all of the problems \nof getting paperwork together, and could stop worrying about a \nsubsequent major audit. They could avoid all of that with the Fair and \nSimple Shortcut Tax plan.\n  My proposal allows every taxpayer, if they want, to compute and file \ntheir tax returns under the old system. You could get your tax return \nand your catalog size instructions, and you can go through it and you \ncan labor and agonize and sweat and talk to accountants if you want. \nThat is your choice. You will have the choice. But the second choice \nand I believe much more appealing for most Americans is to access the \nreturn-free income tax system with a single 15-percent rate, with the \nabolition of both the marriage tax penalty and the Alternative Minimum \nTax under this system, with up to $5,000 of capital gains, dividends \nand interest income completely tax free.\n  We can do this. We can do it easily, and we can do it now. More than \n30 countries have some kind of approach like this. This is better \ntailored to our system, but some 30 countries already have some form of \na tax return free system. This country can do that for the 60 to 70 \nmillion Americans it would relieve of having to file an annual federal \nincome tax return.\n  As we debate and discuss the tax system in this Congress, it is \nimportant for us to listen to all of the ideas that exist, and there \nare plenty, some wonderful, some crackpot, some workable, some \nunworkable. This, in my judgment, is a system that can be implemented \nalmost immediately, is eminently workable, and will address the first \nroadblock that exists in our current income tax system--that is, \ncomplexity. It can eliminate all of the complexities all at once for up \nto 60 to 70 million American people. That makes a great deal of sense.\n  I will be visiting with a number of my colleagues about it, and we \nare going to introduce it as a formal plan very soon. I hope that some \nof my colleagues will consider it favorably.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \ncertain aspects of our military campaign in Kosovo that deeply trouble \nme.\n  We are now into the fourth week of the NATO bombing campaign, and so \nfar things are far worse for the Albanian Kosovars who have been \nsystematically uprooted from their homes and either killed or driven \ninto exile in neighboring countries. Many of their homes have been \nburned to the ground. Whole villages have been destroyed, with the \nresult that hundreds of thousands of people have become refugees with \nno worldly possessions except what they could carry on their backs.\n  On March 23, on the eve of NATO's bombing campaign, Secretary of \nState Madeleine Albright stated that there was a specific purpose, and \nthat was to:\n\n       Deter Slobodan Milosevic from continuing on this rampage \n     and going in and torching--having his soldiers and special \n     police torch the villages. So it is designed to deter that, \n     and also to damage his capability to do that.\n\n  Well, less than 4 weeks later, it is clear that Secretary Albright \nand the Administration seem to have misjudged Milosevic. NATO bombing \nhas in no way deterred the torching and ethnic cleansing. It has, in \nfact, intensified since the bombing began. There can be no doubt that \nif, as Secretary Albright stated, our goal was to deter the rampage \nagainst the ethnic Albanians, our policy has failed.\n  When it became apparent to the Administration that its policy of \nprotecting the Albanian Kosovars had failed, the Administration in \nearly April shifted the message and claimed that the bombing was \ndesigned to ``degrade'' Serbia's military capacity. However, we appear \nto be doing this indirectly in that our bombs and cruise\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\nmissiles have been targeting infrastructure, specifically bridges, oil \nrefineries, rail lines, and telecommunications, rather than hitting \ntanks, heavy guns and, of course, the troops.\n  Despite the massive air campaign, the Serbs' ability to wage war on \nKosovo continues unabated. Fuel for the Serbian war machine flows \nthrough Montenegro, whose ports are filled with tankers. Although we \nhave sought to blockade the ports, our allies, primarily the French, \nhave blocked that effort for fear of widening the conflict.\n  What greatly concerns me, however, is that while the Serbian war \nmachine continues to roll south unimpeded, it is the American military \nthat has been substantially degraded by the shortsighted policies of \nthe Clinton administration.\n  When NATO bombing began, the military fired between 30 and 50 air-\nlaunched cruise missiles targeted primarily against Serbian air \ndefenses. The air-launched cruise missiles are a critical element in \nour military because they can be fired hundreds of miles away from \nheavily guarded targets without directly risking pilots and other air \npersonnel. In addition, since they rely on global positioning \nsatellites for navigation, they can hit their targets in both good and \nbad weather.\n  Unfortunately, there is a crucial shortage of cruise missiles because \nthe Administration has had a propensity to use them for some dubious \npurposes in the past. In the short 4-day bombing that occurred in Iraq, \nOperation Desert Fox, the United States used 90 air-launched cruise \nmissiles. We fired an additional barrage of cruise missiles against \nSudan and Afghanistan last summer. In both instances, it is not clear \nthat we achieved any policy objectives beyond using up a large \npercentage of our arsenal of cruise missiles.\n  Now, what is truly astonishing is that today the United States is \nnot, and I emphasize not, producing a single cruise missile. There is \nnot a single production line operating that is manufacturing or \nrefitting cruise missiles to replace the missiles in our arsenal.\n  Today there are only 90 to 100--that's right--90 to 100 air-launched \ncruise missiles in our inventory. They apparently won't be replaced any \ntime soon.\n  Because of operations in Kosovo, the Office of Management and Budget \nhas requested $51 million to convert 92 nuclear-tipped cruise missiles \ninto conventional cruise missiles. That is what it cost--almost a half \nmillion dollars each for that conversion. However, the first converted \ncruise missile would not be available for at least 7 months, by \nNovember at the earliest. If the production line for new air-launched \ncruise missiles was reopened at Boeing, it would take several million \ndollars of commitment and funding simply to restart it. Even if that \nhappened, the line would not even begin producing new missiles for more \nthan a year.\n  Why have the cruise missile production lines closed? The answer \nappears to be that a new generation of air-launched cruise missiles \nwill be added to the Air Force's inventory, and the military hence \ndecided it no longer needed to add to its current inventory. However, \nthe new generation of missiles will not be available before 2001 or \n2002 at the earliest.\n  Given President Clinton's propensity to fire off cruise missiles \napparently at whim, and given Secretary Albright's blustery rhetoric, \nwe wonder if anyone in the Administration in recent years gave \nconsideration in advance to reopening the closed production lines to \nallow us to rebuild our inventory before we began the air campaign in \nYugoslavia. Or did they believe that diplomatic bluster from the State \nDepartment would convince adversaries that military confrontations \nwould not happen until our new generation cruise missiles were on line \nin 3 to 4 years?\n  A similar, but less dangerous, scenario exists with the Navy cruise \nmissile, the Tomahawk. During the past 10 years, we have had \napproximately 2,500 Tomahawks in our inventory. That number is down \nconsiderably--down to about 2,000 since we used 330 during the 4-day \nbombing in Operation Desert Fox and 150 by the Navy so far in Kosovo. \nAs in the case with the Air Force, the Tomahawk production line has \nalso been shut down because a new generation of missiles will be \nproduced. However, again that missile production will not be available \nbefore the year 2003.\n  By one estimate, the cost of restarting the Tomahawk production line \nwould be $40 million, and it would take 2\\1/2\\ years before a missile, \na single missile, would come off that line. Clearly, this is not an \noption. Although the Navy is seeking $113 million to remanufacture 324 \nolder model Tomahawks, those will not be available in the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, there are very strong indications that if nothing \nchanges, the bombing campaign in Yugoslavia could last through the \nsummer. Quite frankly, I do not believe that anyone in the \nAdministration really knows how long this campaign is going to \ncontinue. But so long as the air campaign continues, the shortage of \ncruise missiles means that it is our pilots who will have to take \ngreater risks and they will be subjected to those risks.\n  It is our pilots who will have to hit the facilities that cruise \nmissiles could have hit. They will have to deal with the surface-to-air \nmissiles and ground fire that have a minimal impact on the unmanned \ncruise missiles. They will have to deal with the vagaries of the \nweather, something that does not affect the capabilities of our cruise \nmissiles.\n  Moreover, we have many responsibilities and vital interests in other \nareas throughout the world. What would happen if Saddam Hussein began \nposing threats to Kuwait again? What would happen with regard to \nthreats that we have seen regularly coming from North Korea? A recent \narticle in the Washington Post quoted Russian analysts who have been \ninterviewed from time to time and have picked up sensitive material \nadvising us of the North Korean officials and their continued threat. \nNorth Korean officials have indicated that the NATO bombing has had a \nsufficient impact on their Government that could lead to further \nupgrades of its missile and military capability.\n  Clearly, the severe shortage of cruise missiles diminishes some of \nour military options and surely makes the world a more dangerous place.\n\n  But the shortage of cruise missiles also reflects on the \nshortsightedness and overcommitments made by the Administration over \nthe last few years. At the same time that this Administration was \ncommitting us to military interventions of some dubious purposes, they \nhave been cutting military spending. They have shortchanged our \nmilitary readiness because they have been unwilling to sacrifice \ndomestic spending and provide our troops with the necessary means to \ncarry out our military objectives, and particularly to have an adequate \ninventory.\n  Now that we are engaged in this very serious mission in Kosovo, the \nshortfalls in our military spending are becoming dangerously obvious. I \nbelieve it is incumbent on the Administration and Congress to \nrealistically assess the state of our military readiness and to provide \nthe appropriate funds to maintain that we, indeed, have a technological \nsupport base for our troops and adequate inventories of cruise missiles \nand other military armaments.\n  At the same time, we need to have a real debate about the goals in \nthis conflict in Yugoslavia and our strategy to achieve those goals. I \nfear the Administration completely miscalculated when it launched the \nair campaign. It is my view that they thought the air campaign would be \na short campaign. I believe they assumed that the Serbs would \nimmediately retreat when the bombs began to descend and that the Serbs \nwould passively accept Secretary Albright's demand that NATO troops be \npositioned in Kosovo.\n  That has not happened. And now the question is, What is next? Why are \nwe to assume that if bombing had not worked in this last 4 weeks, that \nanother 4 weeks or another 4 months of bombing will change anything on \nthe ground? History suggests that bombing by itself tends to steel the \nwill of the people who are under assault. Why would the Serbian people \nreact any differently than the people of London, who endured far \nharsher bombings by the Nazis and still never gave in?\n  Mr. President, it has been said that when it comes to the Balkans, \nthere are no good options. What is clear to me is that even if the \nrefugees would somehow be allowed to return to Kosovo, a very large \noccupation force on the ground, including Americans,\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nwould be needed to maintain any semblance of peace, and that force \nwould be required to stay not for months but for years, and perhaps \ndecades.\n  This is not an outcome I can support. We were told by the President \nthat we were only going to be in Bosnia for 1 year. Four years later, \nwe are still there and there is little sign that Bosnian peace can \nsurvive without a military presence to maintain that peace.\n  I think it was shortsighted of the Administration to allow cruise \nmissile production to end and to initiate a conflict without an \nadequate inventory. That same shortsightedness marks our foreign \npolicy. And the result today is that we are engaged in a conflict, with \nNATO's credibility on the line.\n  I believe the only solution to the crisis in Kosovo is to re-engage \nthe Serbs in diplomatic negotiations. Most importantly, we need to \nrecognize that the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans have a long history \nand the people living there may never live in peace so long as the \nborders are drawn as they are today. Unfortunate as this may be, it may \nultimately become necessary to redraw some of those borders in the \nBalkans to reflect political and ethnic realities.\n  Mr. President, I came across an article written by David Greenberg. \nMr. Greenberg writes the History Lesson column for Slate and is a \nRichard Hofstadter fellow in American history at Columbia University.\n  This particular article poses the question, What solution does \nhistory dictate for Kosovo?\n  I thought it an excellent treaty on the history and background. \nKnowing the Presiding Officer's familiarity with this particular \nsubject, I will read this article into the Record at this time.\n  Mr. Greenberg writes:\n\n       Ever since the United States began contemplating doing \n     something about war and ethnic cleansing in the collapsing \n     state of Yugoslavia in 1991, all sides have invoked history \n     as a guide to action. Those who opposed involvement in Bosnia \n     in the early '90s--and who doubt that NATO can bring peace to \n     Kosovo today--argue that the long record of intractable \n     ethnic tension among the Balkan peoples means we should stay \n     out. Any settlement, they say, is doomed to be temporary. \n     Robert Kaplan's book ``Balkan Ghosts,'' which advances this \n     thesis regarding Bosnia, reportedly convinced President \n     Clinton to steer clear of military action there for a time.\n       Interventionists also invoke history. They note the \n     longstanding claim of ethnic Albanians to the territory of \n     Kosovo dating back to 1200 B.C., when the Albanians' supposed \n     ancestors, the Illyrians, settled there. This ancient history \n     forms the basis of demands for self-determination on the part \n     of the long-suffering Albanian Kosovars. But the Serbs, too, \n     stake a historical claim. Their Slavic forebears migrated to \n     Kosovo around A.D. 500, and they contend that Serbs have \n     lived there ever since.\n       In fact, each of these assertions is subject to \n     qualification, as is made clear in Noel Malcolm's masterly \n     (but misnamed) ``Kosovo: A Short History'' (my main source \n     along with Hugh Poulton's ``The Balkans: Minorities and \n     States in Conflict''). The tie of today's Albanian Kosovars \n     to the ancient Illyrians is fairly attenuated. And while \n     Slavs did move into the area around 500, when the Bulgarian \n     Empire conquered the Balkans, the Serbs didn't gain control \n     of Kosovo until the 12th century, when a dynasty of their \n     leaders known as the Nemanjids invaded it after a period of \n     Byzantine rule.\n       For two centuries the Nemanjids basked in their Balkan \n     kingdom. Serb nationalists today are fond of noting that in \n     1389 it was in Kosovo that the Serbian Prince Lazar and his \n     armies made their last stand against the invading Ottoman \n     Empire at the Battle of Kosovo. They're less likely to note \n     that the Albanians of Kosovo fought alongside them. (Explicit \n     references to the Albanian people as opposed to the Illyrians \n     begin to appear around the 11th century.)\n       During Turkey's 500-year rule, most of Kosovo's Albanians--\n     and Albania's Albanians, also subjects of the Ottoman \n     Empire--converted to Islam. The Serbs remained Orthodox \n     Christians. That may be one reason that the Serbs sought \n     independence first. In 1804 they rose up and in 1828 broke \n     free. Kosovo, however, remained largely content under \n     Turkish rule. Serbs, believing that Kosovo still \n     rightfully belonged to them, did briefly conquer it in \n     1877 when, along with Russia, the new Serbian state made \n     war on Turkey. But under the Russian-Ottoman armistice a \n     year later, Serbia was forced to withdraw.\n       At this point, the Albanians--of both Kosovo and Albania \n     proper--commenced their so-called ``national awakening.'' A \n     group called the League of Prizren, named for the Kosovo town \n     where it met, lobbied for autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. \n     A generation later, this movement flowered into insurrection, \n     as Albanians throughout the western pocket of the Balkans \n     revolted. Albania secured statehood in 1912, but before the \n     status of Kosovo could be resolved, the entire region was \n     rocked, in quick succession by the First Balkan War (1912), \n     the Second Balkan War (1913) and, for good measure, World War \n     I (1914-18).\n       First to invade Kosovo in these years were the Serbs. The \n     Serbs were knocked out by the Austrians, who were knocked out \n     by the French. The French handed the province back to their \n     allies the Serbs. After the war, the Allies, following \n     Wilsonian ideals of self-determination, straightened up \n     Europe into tidy nation-states. With minimal thought on the \n     part of the mapmakers, Kosovo was folded into Serbia, which \n     joined five neighboring Balkan territories to form the new \n     state of Yugoslavia. Albania appealed to the Allies for \n     control of Kosovo but, considered an insignificant state, was \n     rebuffed in deference to Serbian claims.\n       As the largest republic in the multinational state, Serbia \n     dominated Yugoslavia. Its capital of Belgrade, for example, \n     was the nation's capital too. Under Serbian rule, Kosovo \n     again became a battleground.\n       In the late 19th century, Serbian nationalists had built up \n     national myths about the heroics of Prince Lazar and cast \n     Kosovo's status as a Jerusalem-like holy land populated with \n     Orthodox religious shrines. Throughout the 1920s and '30s, \n     the central government in Belgrade pushed Albanians out of \n     the region and moved Serbs in--efforts the Albanian majority \n     resisted, often to their peril.\n       In World War II, Kosovo again resembled Europe's Grand \n     Central Station. The Axis powers rolled in and carved up the \n     region: Albania's Fascist government, headed by a puppet of \n     Mussolini's, seized the biggest chunk, while Bulgaria and \n     Germany each occupied a strip. Communist partisans retook the \n     province in 1944, and when the war ended, the partisan leader \n     Josip Broz Tito became dictator of the reconstituted Yugoslav \n     federation. The Communists considered ceding Kosovo to \n     Albania but instead decided that it should revert to its \n     antebellum status quo. They deemed Kosovo not an autonomous \n     republic but a province of Serbia.\n       In the name of Yugoslav unity, Tito suppressed most \n     assertions of ethnic identity. He jailed or killed thousands \n     of Albanian Kosovars and banned Albanian-language \n     publications. But he was, to some degree, an equal \n     opportunity tyrant: He also halted Serbian efforts to settle \n     Kosovo. In 1968, with uprisings sweeping the globe, student \n     protests triggered a wave of demands for greater Kosovar \n     autonomy. Tito acceded to a series of reforms, culminating in \n     a new Yugoslav Constitution in 1974, which gave Kosovo \n     control over much of its internal affairs. That year marked \n     the high point for Kosovar aspirations to independence, and \n     it remains the benchmark for NATO's demand at Rambouillet for \n     a restoration of Kosovo's ``pre-1989'' autonomy.\n       Tito died in 1980. The next year, Albanian Kosovar students \n     erupted again, with some Kosovars clamoring for republichood. \n     Belgrade, no longer restrained by Tito's aversion to \n     exacerbating ethnic conflict, cracked down. Polarization \n     followed: Slobodan Milosevic--first as a Communist and then \n     as a Serbian nationalist--whipped up anti-Albanian sentiment. \n     In 1989, he stripped Kosovo of its cherished autonomy. \n     Meanwhile, Albanian Kosovars proclaimed their territory a \n     republic and, through channels violent and nonviolent, sought \n     actual independence. Unrelenting, Milosevic undertook the \n     massacres of the last year, which finally precipitated NATO's \n     bombing.\n       That, in a nutshell, is the history of Kosovo. If you can \n     find a solution to today's mess in there, let me know. Take a \n     snapshot at 1200 B.C. and the Albanians can claim it; look at \n     A.D. 1200 and it's a Serbian kingdom. The United States \n     prefers to use the 1974 benchmark. Milosevic points to 1989. \n     But even at those points, the snapshot looks pretty blurry.\n       Before NATO began bombing Yugoslavia March 24, the proposed \n     Rambouillet solution--restoring Kosovo's autonomy but not \n     granting it independence--seemed like a plausible outcome. \n     Now it's hard to imagine Kosovars accepting any kind of \n     Serbian rule. If victorious, NATO may grant Kosovo \n     independence or perhaps divide it up. History won't decide \n     Kosovo's fate. Our actions in the weeks ahead will decide \n     history.\n  I bring this to the attention of my colleagues simply to highlight a \nlittle history and point to the complexities in reaching a resolution \nto this very difficult foreign policy question.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, President Clinton has just signified \nhis intention to ask Congress for additional appropriations of some \n$5.45 billion for military costs involved in the war in Kosovo and some \n$491 million to pay for humanitarian assistance. It is my thought that \nCongress will be receptive to humanitarian aid for the thousands of \nrefugees who have been driven from their homes in Kosovo. These \nrequests will give us an opportunity to ask some very important \nquestions and get some very important information to assess our \nmilitary preparedness and to make the determination as to how much our \nallies are contributing to this effort, which ought to be a joint \neffort.\n  We have seen the U.S. military preparedness decline very markedly in \nthe past decade and a half. During the Reagan years, in the mid-1980s, \nthe defense budget exceeded $300 billion. In 1999 dollars, that would \nbe well over $400 billion, might even by close to the $500 million \nmark. But our budget for this year, fiscal year 1999, was $271 billion, \nand according to the President's request, is projected to be slightly \nover $280 billion for fiscal year 2000.\n  That raises some very, very important questions as to the adequacy of \nour defense and our ability to deal with a crisis in Kosovo, where we \nare at war, notwithstanding the fact that a declaration has not been \nfiled. The Senate of the United States has authorized air strikes in \nour vote of 58 to 41 on March 23, but the House of Representatives has \nnot had a correlating move. Constitutionally this is a very, very \ndangerous situation, because only the Congress under our Constitution \nhas the authority to declare war. We have seen a constant erosion of \ncongressional authority, which is a dangerous sign, in terms of the \nrequirements of constitutional law--this is bedrock constitutional \nlaw--and also in terms of having congressional support, which reflects \npublic support, for the military action.\n  We have seen this war in Kosovo move ahead. We have seen missile \nstrikes, air strikes. The authorization of the Senate was limited in \nthe air strikes because of our concern about not putting too many U.S. \nfighting men and women in so-called harm's way. It is rather a \nsurprising consequence to find we are in short supply of missiles. We \nhave seen the activity in Iraq reduced, according to military reports. \nWe know of our commitments around the globe, including South Korea. I \nbelieve this is an occasion to take a very close look as to the \nadequacy of our military preparations. At this time, we have some 10 \ndivisions, 20 wings active in reserve, some 13 active wings and some \n256 naval service combatants. This is very limited, compared to the \npower of the United States during the mid-1980s in the Reagan years.\n  Of course, it is a different world. It is a world without the \npotential clash of the superpowers--the United States and the Soviet \nUnion--but it is still a world with major, major problems.\n  When the President comes to Capitol Hill, comes to the Appropriations \nCommittee on which I serve, comes to the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee on which I serve, then I think we need to ask some very, \nvery hard questions. Those questions turn on whether the United States \nis, realistically, capable of carrying on the kind of a war in which we \nhave become engaged in Kosovo. Do we even have sufficient air power to \ncarry out our objectives? Do we have sufficient missiles to carry out \nour objectives?\n  So far, we have bypassed the issue of ground forces. Some of our \ncolleagues have advocated a resolution which would authorize the \nPresident to use whatever force is needed. I am categorically opposed \nto such a resolution. I do not believe that the Senate and the Congress \nof the United States ought to give the President a blank check, but I \nam prepared to hear whatever it is that the President requests, to \nconsider that in the context of our vital national security interests \nand in the context of what we ought to do. But at a time when the \nCongress and the country has been put on notice that the President is \nconsidering calling up Reserves, we find ourselves in a military \nentanglement, a foreign entanglement and, by all appearances, we are \nill-equipped to carry out the objectives and the course which the \nPresident has set out for us.\n  We need to know on an updated basis what is happening in Iraq and \nwhat our commitments are there and what our potential commitments are \naround the world.\n  Similarly, we need to know, Madam President, our allies' \ncontributions. At a time when the Congress of the United States is \nbeing called upon to authorize $5.450 billion for the Pentagon, it is \nfair to ask what the contribution is from Great Britain. What is the \ncontribution from France? What is the contribution from Germany? What \nis the contribution from the other NATO countries?\n  The morning news reports carried the comment that the French are \nopposed to a naval blockade to cut off Yugoslavian oil reserves. That \nis sort of a surprising matter. As General Wesley Clark has noted, why \nare we putting U.S. pilots at risk in bombing Yugoslavian oil \nproduction at oil refineries if we are not willing to take on a less \ndrastic matter of a naval blockade? Certainly a naval blockade is an \nact of war, as the French have been reported to have said, but so are \nmissile and air strikes. As we are being asked for almost $6 billion, I \nwould be especially interested to know the French contribution, besides \ntheir naysaying of a naval blockade to stop petroleum from reaching \nYugoslavia.\n  The issue of the relative contribution of the United States and the \nNATO countries has been a longstanding controversy for the 50 years \nthat NATO has been in existence. I recall attending my first North \nAtlantic Assembly meeting in Venice shortly after I was elected. It was \nthe spring of 1981. The chief topic was burden sharing.\n  On the occasions when I have had an opportunity to return to North \nAtlantic Assembly meetings, burden sharing has always been a big \nquestion. I think it is a fair question for the Congress to ask: What \nis the proportion of burden sharing now in Kosovo, especially when we \nare being asked to ante up an additional $6 billion.\n  There is another aspect to our activity in Kosovo which requires an \nanswer, and that is, what are we doing with respect to prosecution of \ncrimes against humanity in the War Crimes Tribunal, looking toward the \nprospective indictment of President Milosevic. There is an active \neffort at the present time to gather evidence against President \nMilosevic. There is a question as to why it has taken so long. In late \n1992, then-Secretary of State Eagleburger, pretty much branded \nMilosevic a war criminal. There has been constant speculation over the \ncourse of the past 7 years about why Milosevic was not indicted, along \nwith others in the Bosnia and Croatia crimes against humanity.\n\n  We need an answer, Madam President, as to what has happened with \noutstanding key indictments against Mladic and Karadzic with respect to \nwhat has happened in Bosnia. When a group of Members of the House and \nSenate were briefed by the President last Tuesday, a distinction was \nmade between our military activity and collateral ways to have an \nimpact on the war in Kosovo, such as through the War Crimes Tribunal.\n  There have been major efforts to locate Karadzic. There have also \nbeen major efforts to locate Mladic who is supposed to be in hiding \nnear Belgrade.\n  The activities of the War Crimes Tribunal could have a very profound \neffect\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\non those committing atrocities as we speak in Kosovo--that that kind of \nconduct is going to be treated in a very severe and tough manner by the \nWar Crimes Tribunal. This involves having the War Crimes Tribunal \nfollow up on those who have been indicted, like Mladic and Karadzic, \nand it also involves the War Crimes Tribunal acting aggressively to \ngather evidence about Milosevic and any others who may be perpetrating \ncrimes against humanity.\n  At a time when we are looking for a supplemental appropriation, we \nought to be as certain as we can be that the War Crimes Tribunal is \nadequately funded. I have had occasion to visit the War Crimes Tribunal \nthree times in The Hague and have noted a very serious group of \ndedicated prosecutors, headed by Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour. But \nthat contingent has been laboring with insufficient resources. Only \nrecently their courtrooms have increased from one to three, and a \nsubstantial increase in their budget was achieved when the 1999 budget \nwas increased from the 1998 level of $68.8 million to slightly more \nthan $100 million to take care of the prosecutions in Bosnia and \nCroatia.\n  That leaves open the question about what is going to happen with \nrespect to the prosecutions in Kosovo. It is vital that efforts be \nongoing contemporaneously with these atrocities to gather evidence \nwhile it is fresh. From my own experience as a prosecuting attorney, I \ncan say firsthand--gather the evidence while the eyewitnesses are \navailable, while the recollections are fresh and while the tangible \nphysical evidence is present.\n  There may be a necessity--and it is a very unpleasant subject but one \nof the facts of life in Bosnia, Croatia and now Kosovo--that mass \ngraves be uncovered for tangible evidence of these atrocities. An \ninquiry today gave me the preliminary bit of advice that there is a \nrequest for some $5 million for documentation support for the War \nCrimes Tribunal. I have made the request that further information be \nforthcoming so that when the Appropriations Committee considers these \nsupplemental matters, that we have in hand the needs of the War Crimes \nTribunal. This will put all would-be war criminals on notice that these \nmatters are going to be very, very vigorously pursued. It would be a \nvery, very strong blow for international law and international justice \nto have a War Crimes Tribunal indictment at the earliest possible time \nbranding Milosevic a war criminal for all to see. I think that would \ninevitably have a profound effect everywhere, including in Belgrade, \nincluding in Serbia, including in the Republic of Yugoslavia.\n  So, these are questions which I hope we can have answers to in the \nforthcoming days when I do believe my colleagues will be willing to \nshare my sense that the fighting men and women need to be supported on \nthis $5.45 billion request from the Pentagon and on the almost $500 \nmillion for humanitarian aid. But we need to use this as an occasion to \nfind out if we have adequate military strength to carry on the war \nwhich we have undertaken and to discharge the kind of commitments that \nwe have made worldwide. We also need to take a close look at the burden \nsharing with our allies and to make sure that the important work of the \nWar Crimes Tribunal is adequately funded.\n  In the absence of anyone else on the floor seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President I rise to note the passing of a great \nRepublican and a great American. Dr. Albert E. Bullock died on April 7 \nat the age of 72 at his home in Kensington, Maryland. He had been \nfighting cancer for some time.\n  Al, as he was known by everyone who knew him, was the husband of my \nable and dedicated office manager, Katja Bullock. He was also a \ndedicated dentist and a devoted Republican activist who lived life to \nthe fullest and brought energy and humor to everything he did.\n  Born in Washington, Al served in the United States Navy during World \nWar II and was awarded both the Victory Medal and the American Theatre \nRibbon. When he was honorably discharged in 1946, Secretary of the Navy \nJames Forrestal sent him a letter expressing ``the Navy's pride'' in \nhis service. He became a life-long member of American Legion Post 268 \nin Wheaton, Maryland.\n  Al attended the University of Maryland and graduated from Georgetown \nUniversity's School of Dentistry in 1952. He served as a Clinical \nInstructor at Georgetown immediately after graduating and published \noriginal scientific articles in the District of Columbia Dental Society \nJournal and the Southern California Journal of Orthodontics. He was \nelected to the National Dental Honor Fraternity and named a Fellow of \nthe Royal Society of Health.\n  Al was an integral part of his community. He was particularly active \nand important in the Montgomery County Republican Party. And his \npositions in the party were numerous. He served twice as Montgomery \nCounty Republican Party Chairman and was a regular fixture on the \nCounty's Republican Central Committee between 1982 and 1994.\n  He also served as Executive Director of Maryland's Reagan for \nPresident Committee and as a member of Maryland's Electoral College. In \n1994 he was the Republican nominee for Maryland State Senate.\n  During the Reagan Administration Al served on the National Advisory \nCouncil on Child Nutrition and the National Advisory Committee on the \nNational Health Service Corps.\n  But it was perhaps as a mentor to young conservatives that Al had his \ngreatest effect on politics. Literally dozens of Washington interns at \none time or another stayed with the Bullocks or attended one of the \nmany events hosted at their home. Across America today, there are many \nactive Republicans who were strengthened in their convictions by Al and \nKatja Bullock.\n  Indeed, many of us believe there is a political dynasty forming in \nthe Bullock family. Al would allow himself to be put up for elective \noffice in heavily Democratic Montgomery Country because no one else \nwanted the task of losing. But he must have had some effect because his \nson, also named Al, made a respectable showing in his own run for \npublic office. And everyone agrees that Al's grandson, Al the third, \nwho at a quite tender age was already defending his grandfather on the \nstump, could just be the one to turn Montgomery County Republican.\n  Al Bullock knew how important it is to keep active in political life. \nBut he also knew that politics is not all of life. He was a strong \nfamily man as well as a dedicated professional who took great pride in \nhis work and in this relations with his patients. He also was active as \na member of the American Light Opera Company, serving on its Board of \nTrustees and as Chairman in 1965.\n  The story goes, in fact, that Katja fell in love with Al when, seeing \nhim for an emergency dental procedure, she was soothed by the strains \nof opera as Al worked on her teeth.\n  I will always remember Al's winning combination of humor and \ndedication to conservative principles. He led a full and colorful life, \nin which he met many of the great public figures of our age. It was a \ngreat honor for anyone in public life to make it to the photographic \nhall of fame lining the Bullock family's front stairs. I was happy to \nsee last Christmas that my own photo had made it to one corner of that \nhallway, overshadowed by pictures of more than one President.\n  My heartfelt condolences go to Katja, Al's son Albert, his daughter-\nin-law Katie and grandsons Albert and Seamus, as well as his sister, \nBetty Sorrell.\n  Al will be sorely missed by everyone lucky enough to know him.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S. 531.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 531) to authorize the President to award a gold \n     medal on behalf of the Congress to Rosa Parks in recognition \n     of her contributions to the Nation.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Lott for bringing forward this unanimous consent agreement to \ndischarge an important piece of legislation from the Banking Committee.\n  I also thank the original cosponsors of this bill, Senators Sessions, \nLevin, Kennedy and Harkin for their support, along with 74 other \ncolleagues who have cosponsored this bill.\n  Our intent is to honor one of the most important figures in the \nAmerican civil rights movement, Rosa Parks. This legislation would \nhonor Mrs. Parks with a Congressional gold medal in recognition of her \nimmense contributions to our nation over a lifetime committed to \nfurthering civil rights in our nation.\n  Rosa Louise McCauley was born in Tuskegee, Alabama in 1913. At age 2 \nshe moved to her grandparents' farm in Pine Level, Alabama with her \nmother, Leona McCauley, and younger brother, Sylvester. Her mother, a \nschool teacher, taught her at home until, at age 11, she enrolled in \nthe Montgomery Industrial School for Girls.\n  The young Miss McCauley cleaned classrooms to pay her tuition, then \nmoved on to attend Booker T. Washington High School. She was forced to \nleave that school to take care of her sick mother.\n  In 1932 she married Raymond Parks. Mr. Parks, who was largely self-\ntaught, supported his wife, Rosa's, desire to finish high school and to \nattend Alabama State College, which she did.\n  The couple settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where they were active in \nthe local chapter of the NAACP and the Montgomery Voters League.\n  Mrs. Parks worked to register African American voters and to fight \nthe violence and injustice visited upon them under segregation.\n  As Mrs. Parks put it, ``There were cases of flogging, peonage, \nmurder, and rape.'' During this time the NAACP ``didn't seem to have \ntoo many successes. It was more a matter of trying to challenge the \npowers that be, and to let it be known that we did not wish to continue \nbeing second-class citizens.''\n  Rosa Parks issued that challenge to the powers that be. And her brave \nact helped bring down the system of segregation in this country.\n  The story has been told many times of how Mrs. Parks, employed as a \nseamstress in a local department store, boarded a Montgomery city bus \non December 1, 1955. After a few stops, a number of white people got on \nthe bus--too many to fit into the seats in the ``whites only'' section. \nSeeing a white man standing on his bus, the driver ordered Mrs. Parks \nand three other African Americans to give up their seats to him.\n  The other three people moved, but Rosa Parks had had enough. As she \nreflected later, ``I kept thinking about my mother and my grandparents, \nand how strong they were. I knew there was a possibility of being \nmistreated, but an opportunity was being given to me to do what I had \nasked of others.''\n  Mrs. Parks showed her strength by refusing to give up her seat. She \nwas arrested, she was taken to jail and four days later she was \nconvicted of disorderly conduct. Her crime? Refusing to be treated as a \nsecond class citizen.\n  Even before this unjust conviction was handed down, indeed, the very \nday after Mrs. Parks' arrest, the response, born of righteous \nindignation, had begun. Mrs. Parks had set in motion events that would \nchange the face of the United States forever.\n  On December 2, the Women's Political Council distributed fliers \nthroughout the community encouraging African Americans to boycott the \nMontgomery bus system on the day of Mrs. Parks' trial.\n  A meeting was held at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, whose pastor was \nthe Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, jr. This meeting, held to plan \nthe boycott, included the reverend Ralph Abernathy, Reverend King and \nJo Ann Robinson of the Women's Political Council.\n  The boycott was an astounding success, and on the day of Mrs. Parks' \ntrial the Montgomery Improvement Association was formed with Dr. King \nas spokesman and president.\n  The Montgomery Improvement Association took over management of the \nbus boycott, which was to last 381 days, and filed suit on behalf of \nthose against whom the bus company had discriminated.\n  In the face of widespread harassment, threats and even bombs, the \nbrave people of the Montgomery Improvement Association, along with \ntheir supporters, kept up their boycott while their case made its way \nthrough the courts.\n  Finally, on November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court held Montgomery's \nbus segregation unconstitutional. After a brief period of defiance the \nsegregationists gave in, and the boycott ended.\n  Of course this was far from the end of the battle for civil rights in \nAmerica. But it was an important event, spurring the civil rights \nmovement to further action.\n  Through marches, boycotts, civil disobedience and the power of their \nprinciples, members of the civil rights movement broke down the \nbarriers of legal discrimination and established equality before the \nlaw as a reality for all Americans.\n  Rosa Parks set these historic events in motion. Because of her faith, \nperseverance and quiet dignity, all Americans have been freed from the \nmoral stain of segregation.\n  But Rosa Parks paid a price for her principles. She was arrested. She \nlost her job. She could not find work. And she was constantly harassed.\n  Fortunately for my state of Michigan, Mrs. Parks' bother, Sylvester, \nhad resettled in Detroit, and the Parks family joined him there in \n1957.\n  For over 40 years now, Michigan has been a particular beneficiary of \nMrs. Parks' work on behalf of civil rights and her efforts to educate \nyoung people in particular.\n  And this mother of the civil rights movement, as she is known \nthroughout our nation, continues to be active in the struggle for \nequality and the empowerment of the disenfranchised.\n  In 1965 she joined the staff of U.S. Representative John Conyers, \nwhere she worked until her retirement in 1988.\n  After the death of her husband in 1987 she founded the Rosa and \nRaymond Parks Institute for Self-Development.\n  This non-profit organization helps young people achieve their full \npotential. Over 5,000 young people have participated in the Institute's \n``Pathways to Freedom'' tour, which traces parts of the Underground \nRailroad along which escaped slaves traveled to safety. The Institute \nalso runs local programs offering summer school, tutoring programs and \nlife-skills classes.\n  Ms. Parks has received many awards in recognition of her efforts for \nracial harmony, including the Springarn Award, the NAACP's highest \nhonor for civil rights contributions, the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, and the first \nInternational Freedom Conductor Award from the National Underground \nRailroad Freedom Center.\n  Throughout her long life, Rosa Parks has shown that one woman can \nmake a real difference. She has shown all of us the power of conviction \nand quiet dignity in pursuit of justice and empowerment. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting legislation to bestow upon her the \nCongressional gold medal she so well deserves.\n  Madam President, I was thinking about Rosa Parks as I came to the \nfloor today. I remembered an incident that I briefly mentioned when we \nintroduced this legislation, an incident of my own. It was the first I \nhad heard of Rosa Parks, although her name wasn't specifically \nmentioned, or at least it did not register at the time. As an \nelementary schoolchild, probably around, I would guess, in 1962, 1963--\nsomewhere in the second, third, fourth grade--I remember the teacher in \nmy classroom talking about this incident, this\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\nwoman who would not move to the back of the bus, explaining it to us as \none explains things to children who do not necessarily know history as \nwell as they should at that age, explaining what it meant and why it \nhad been so important.\n  I was thinking about that today because I recognized at that moment \nI, as a second-grade student, first realized that everybody in the \ncountry was not always treated the same way. That is how that incident, \nRosa Parks' contribution, touched my life. Later, obviously, as I moved \nalong in school, I read more and watched the news a little and began to \nrealize the magnitude of the civil rights struggle we as a nation had \naddressed, and so much of it was based on this event which Rosa Parks \nprompted in 1955.\n  So, while all of us, I suppose, can see this in its national \nconsequence, I am sure all of us, too, probably, have a more personal \nconnection as well. That is mine. It is also, first, a connection that \nI share with my colleague from Michigan, who is about to speak on this \nas well. That is the connection of pride that we have that Rosa Parks \nis a Michiganian.\n  While she may have been born and lived much of her life in another \npart of the country, we are awfully proud of the fact that most of the \nlast 40 years she has lived in our State.\n  Madam President, if you look at the list of those who have been \nrecipients of congressional gold medals, most recently President and \nMrs. Gerald Ford and such other honorees as Mother Teresa and the \nLittle Rock Nine, Billy and Ruth Graham, it seems only fitting that \nCongress should now pass this legislation and add Rosa Parks to this \nlist of Americans who have made such great contributions.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent that Meg Mehan, who \nis on my staff, be granted the privilege of the floor during \nconsideration of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor for the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Michigan.\n  Today, we will authorize the President of the United States to award \nthe congressional gold medal to one of our Nation's greatest heroines, \nRosa Parks. Rosa Parks is the mother of the civil rights movement, and \nwe are going to make this medal available and we are going to award \nthis to her because of her extraordinary contributions to America.\n  Forty-three years ago, in December of 1955, an unassuming woman by \nthe name of Rosa Parks decided she would not give up her seat in the \nfront of the bus and move to the back of the bus. It was not scheduled \nas a media event. It was not intended to be something which would spark \na revolution. It, indeed, did spark an American revolution. It \nunleashed forces in this country, which are positive forces, which have \nadded equal opportunity or fairer opportunity for African Americans and \nothers who have been discriminated against for too many decades and \ncenturies.\n\n  It was the act of an American citizen who just made a simple, \nstraightforward decision that she is entitled equally to sit on a bus \nwith any other person. She is not going to take an inferior position to \nanybody. She seeks no advantage over anyone else, but she will not \naccept an inferior status any longer on a public bus in Alabama.\n  The forces that set in motion have changed this Nation. It has \nchanged this Nation for the better. It has forced us to confront \ncenturies of discrimination against African Americans brought here as \nslaves and, even after slavery was abolished, too often treated as \ninferiors in a country that prides itself on treating all of its \ncitizens equally and whose Constitution and Declaration of Independence \nheld out a promise which had been thwarted and which was unfulfilled \nfor our African American citizens.\n  Her arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the catalyst \nfor the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that December day in 1955 \nwas not an isolated incident but was actually part of a lifetime of \nstruggle for equality and justice. Twelve years earlier, in 1943, Rosa \nParks had been arrested for violating another one of the city's bus-\nrelated segregation laws. That earlier law had required African \nAmericans to pay their fares at the front of the bus, then get off the \nbus and then get on the bus at the back to reboard the bus. As it \nhappened, the driver of the bus in 1955 was the same driver who was \ndriving the bus in 1943. The rest is history.\n  The boycott which Rosa Parks began was the beginning of an American \nrevolution that elevated the status of African Americans and introduced \nto the world a young leader who would one day have a national holiday \ndeclared in his honor, the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. The \nCongressional Medal of Honor is a fitting tribute to Rosa Parks, a \ngentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the \nhumiliation and the demoralization of racial segregation.\n  Rosa Parks, as my friend from Michigan said, is a resident of \nMichigan, and we are very proud of it. We hope that is acknowledged in \nthe final bill which comes out of the Congress. We are trying to add \nthat fact to the final bill because, as it happens, since 1957, Rosa \nParks has been a Michiganian. She and her husband made the journey to \nMichigan in 1957 because of threats on their lives and persistent \nharassment by phone. That is what prompted her move to Detroit where \nRosa Parks' brother resided.\n  She continues to dedicate her life to advancing equal opportunity and \nto educating our youth about the past struggles for freedom, from \nslavery up to the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\n  In 1987, Rosa Parks and Elaine Eason Steele cofounded the Rosa and \nRaymond Parks Institute for Self-Development. Its primary focus has \nbeen working with young people in Michigan and from across the country \nand the world as part of the ``Pathways to Freedom'' program. The \npathways program traces history from the days of the underground \nrailroad to the civil rights movement of the sixties and beyond. \nThrough this institute, young people, ages 11 to 17, meet with national \nleaders and participate in a variety of educational and research \nprojects. During the summer months in particular, many have the \nopportunity to travel across the country visiting historical sites.\n\n  In recent years, the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-\nDevelopment has expanded to include an intergenerational mentoring and \ncomputer skills partnership program. This innovative program teams \nyoung people with elderly Americans. Generational and age barriers \nbreak down as young people help the elderly develop computer skills, \nwhile the elderly provide their unique and personalized recollections \nof their lives in American history. Each year, the institute matches \nhundreds of young people with elderly Americans. Since 1987, more than \n7,000 youth from around the world have participated in this program.\n  With the work of her institute, we can truly say that in addition to \nhaving played a major role in shaping America's past and present, Rosa \nParks is playing a major role in shaping America's future. With the \ndawn of a new millennium at hand, America must ensure that all of our \nyouth are knowledgeable of one of the great national stories of our \ntime and the struggle of African American individuals that finally \nforced us to honor the principles which founded this country and which \nhad so long been rejected in the real world and in reality, even though \nthey were promised on paper.\n  The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development ``Pathway \nto Freedom'' programs preserve the memories of self-sacrifice that \nAfrican Americans, and so many others, have made to this country's \ndevelopment as truly the land of the free.\n  Madam President, this is great work which Rosa Parks continues to do. \nShe continues to bless us, our Nation, our State with her presence, \nwith her dignity, with her very direct, simple statement about \nequality. We hopefully will not just award her a medal one of these \ndays, but we will also hopefully support the important work which she \ncontinues to do in her institute.\n  We have come a long way in achieving Dr. King's dream and Rosa Parks'\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\ndream of justice and equality for all, but we still have a long ways to \ngo. That is going to take a constant rededication to these goals and to \nthe lifetime work of Rosa Parks and to the spirit of human rights which \nshe so embodies and for which the name ``Rosa Parks'' stands.\n  I am proud to join Senator Abraham and others, so many others, in \nthis body and in the other body who have initiated this gold medal for \nher. We look forward to the day when we are actually able to present to \none of the true champions of justice a gold medal which she so truly \ndeserves.\n  I yield the floor and again thank my friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I know there are other Members who have \nexpressed an interest to speak on this issue, some of whom will be \narriving back in Washington, if they have not already gotten here, on \nflights this afternoon. So we will, I know, be here for some time \nwaiting to give them the opportunity to speak before our vote on this. \nBut at this time, seeing none of them on the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Knowing there are speakers on each side who hope to have \na chance to speak, so we do not run the clock completely off during \nquorum calls, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time of the quorum call be equally divided between \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I yield such time as he needs to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Today is a special day for me. I remember a number of \nweeks ago when Senator Abraham and I discussed the possibility of \nawarding a congressional gold medal to Rosa Parks. It was an idea that \nwe thought was a good one. I am glad to see it moving rapidly to \nfruition.\n  I certainly believe the congressional gold medal is a very \ndistinguished award that ought to be preserved for the most exceptional \ncircumstances and persons. And I certainly believe that the person we \nwill honor today has all the qualities for receiving the congressional \ngold medal.\n  So I am pleased to honor a native Alabamian who, through her life and \nthrough her example, has touched both the heart and conscience of an \nentire Nation. I speak, of course, of Ms. Rosa Parks, a native of \nTuskegee, AL, and a former resident of Montgomery, whose dignity in the \nface of discrimination helped spark a movement to ensure that all \ncitizens were treated equally under the law.\n  Equal treatment under the law is a fundamental pillar upon which our \nRepublic rests. In fact, over the first 2 months of this year this \nSenate was engaged in a constitutional debate over the scope and \nmeaning of this very concept.\n  As legislators, we should work to strengthen the appreciation for \nthis important fundamental governing principle by recognizing those who \nmake extraordinary contributions towards ensuring that all American \ncitizens have that opportunity, regardless of their race, sex, creed, \nor national origin, to enjoy the freedoms this country has to offer.\n  Through her efforts, Ms. Parks has come to be a living embodiment of \nthis principle, and it is entirely appropriate that Congress take this \nopportunity to acknowledge her contribution by authorizing the award of \na congressional gold medal to her. Her courage, what we may call \n``gumption,'' resulted in historic change. Certainly there is still \nmuch to be done. True equality--the total elimination of discrimination \nand a real sense of ease and acceptance among the races--has not yet \nbeen fully achieved, but it is fair to say that in the history of this \neffort, the most dramatic and productive chapter was ignited by the \nlady we seek to honor today.\n  Ms. Parks' story is well known but it bears repeating. She was born \non February 4, 1913, in the small town of Tuskegee, AL, to Mr. James \nand Mrs. Leona McCauley. As a young child, she moved to Montgomery with \nher mother who was a local schoolteacher. Like many southern cities, \nthe Montgomery of Ms. Parks' youth was a segregated city with numerous \nlaws mandating the separate and unequal treatment of people based \nsolely upon the color of their skin. These laws were discriminatory in \ntheir intent and divisive, unfair, and humiliating in application. But \nfor years Ms. Parks had suffered with them, until that fateful day of \nDecember 1, 1955, when her pride and dignity would not allow her to \nobey them anymore.\n  On this day, Ms. Parks, a 42-year-old seamstress, boarded a city bus \nafter a long, hard day at work. Like other public accommodations, this \nbus contained separate sections for white passengers and black \npassengers. White passengers were allocated to the front rows. The \nblack passengers were given the back rows. This bus was particularly \ncrowded that evening.\n  At one of the stops, a white passenger boarded and the bus driver, \nseeing Ms. Parks, requested that she give up her seat and move to the \nback of the bus, even though this meant that she would be forced to \nstand for the rest of the trip. Ms. Parks refused to give up her seat \nand was arrested for disobeying the bus driver's order.\n  With her act of civic defiance, Ms. Parks set off a chain of events \nthat have led some to refer to her as the mother of the civil rights \nmovement. Her arrest led to the Montgomery bus boycott, an organized \nmovement led by a young minister named Martin Luther King, Jr., who had \nbegun preaching at the historic Baptist church located on Montgomery's \nDexter Avenue. The bus boycott lasted 382 days, and its impact directly \nled to the integration of bus lines, while the attention generated \nhelped lift Dr. King to national prominence. Ultimately, the U.S. \nSupreme Court was asked to rule on the constitutionality of the \nMontgomery law which Ms. Parks had defied, and the Supreme Court struck \nit down.\n  This powerful image, that of a hard-working American ordered to the \nback of the bus just because of her race, was a catalytic event. It was \nthe spark that caused a nation to stop accepting things as they had \nbeen and focused everyone on the fundamental issue--whether we could \ncontinue as a segregated society.\n  As a result of the movement Ms. Parks helped start, today's \nMontgomery is a quite different city from the one of her youth. Today \nthe citizens of Montgomery look with a great deal of historical pride \nupon the church that once heard the sermons of Dr. King. Montgomery is \nthe home of the Civil Rights Memorial, a striking monument of black \ngranite and cascading water which memorializes the individuals who gave \ntheir lives in pursuit of equal justice.\n\n  Today's Montgomery is a city in which its history as the capital of \nthe Confederacy and its history as the birthplace of the civil rights \nmovement are both recognized and reconciled. And soon Troy State \nUniversity of Montgomery will become the home of the Rosa Parks Library \nand Museum, built on the very spot upon which Ms. Parks was arrested in \n1955, the old Empire Theater. I will briefly describe this important \nproject.\n  Troy State University, Montgomery, is an important university of over \n3,400 full-time students. They are in the midst of constructing a \n50,000-square-foot library and museum on the land they own which \nincludes the exact location where Ms. Parks was arrested in 1955. When \ncompleted, this museum will include a 3,700-square-foot permanent \nexhibit focusing on the commemoration of the Montgomery civil rights \nmovement. This project memorializes an historic event that changed the \ncity of Montgomery for the better, and I look forward to offering any \nsupport I can to aid in its completion.\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\n  Ms. Parks' efforts helped spark the dynamic social changes which have \nmade it possible for this kind of recognition to be supported by \nMontgomerians and Alabamians. But, in fact, Ms. Parks' contributions \nmay extend beyond even the borders of our Nation. In his book ``Bus \nRide to Justice,'' Mr. Fred Gray, who gained fame while in his twenties \nas Ms. Parks' attorney in the bus desegregation case and one of the \nearly African American attorneys in Alabama--he was a lead attorney in \nmany of Alabama's other famous civil rights cases--wrote--and I do not \nbelieve it is an exaggeration--these words:\n\n       Little did we know that we had set in motion a force that \n     would ripple through Alabama, the South, and the Nation, and \n     even the world. But from the vantage point of almost 40 years \n     later, there is a direct correlation between what we started \n     in Montgomery and what has subsequently happened in China, \n     eastern Europe, South Africa and, even more recently, in \n     Russia. While it is inaccurate to say that we all sat down \n     and deliberately planned a movement that would echo and \n     reverberate around the world, we did work around the clock, \n     planning strategy and creating an atmosphere that gave \n     strength, courage, faith and hope to people of all races, \n     creeds, colors and religions around the world. And it all \n     started on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, with Rosa Parks on \n     December 1, 1955.\n\n  For her courage, for her role in changing Alabama, the South, the \nNation, and the world for the better, our Nation owes a great debt of \nthanks to Rosa Parks. I hope that this body will extend its thanks and \nrecognition to her by awarding her the congressional gold medal.\n  Madam President, I thank you for this time and for being able to \nshare these remarks. I also thank Senator Abraham for his skill and \nwork in helping us move this award forward. I think it is a fitting and \nappropriate thing to do. I have enjoyed working with him on quite a \nnumber of other issues. No one in the Senate is more respected by me \nthan the Senator from Michigan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nhis work on this legislation as well as many other things which he does \nhere. But particularly for how hard he worked on this, as has his \nstaff, to help us move this forward, I express my appreciation to him \nas well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gregg of New Hampshire be added \nas a cosponsor to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, on our side I am not aware specifically \nof any other Member who wishes to speak. I do know that the Senator \nfrom California is here and there may be others coming. We do have some \ntime left. We will temporarily reserve the remainder of our time, but \nif others who wish to speak from either side of the aisle are here, we \nwill be glad to offer that. At this point, I will reserve the remainder \nof my time. The Senator from Alabama may stay for a minute. I am not \nsure. If necessary, I will come back down. I want to make clear to the \nPresiding Officer that anyone who wishes to speak may draw from that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So noted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I am proud to join my colleagues from \nMichigan, Senators Abraham and Levin, in sponsoring S. 531, legislation \nauthorizing the presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Rosa \nParks.\n  As we approach the 21st century, it is only fitting that the Senate \ntake this moment to recognize the efforts of Rosa Parks, who, on \nDecember 1, 1955, proved that one person can make a difference in the \nworld in which we live. By refusing to give up her seat on a city bus, \nan act which put her in violation of the segregation laws then in place \nin her community, Mrs. Parks sparked a series of events that have \nhelped to shape this nation's path.\n  For refusing to acquiesce to the systematic degradation placed upon \nher and other black-Americans, Rosa Parks was arrested. But rather than \naccept the status quo, this quiet lady from Montgomery, Alabama, chose \nto challenge the segregation order by seeking redress in our federal \ncourts. During the court battle, Mrs. Parks was harassed, threatened, \nand even lost her job as a seamstress at a local department store. In \nthe end, though, Rosa Parks won her battle when the U.S. Supreme Court \nruled segregation unconstitutional, thus vindicating her simple, but \nmonumental, pursuit of justice and equality.\n  Madam President, the actions of Rosa Parks were not staged for the \ntelevision cameras. They were not part of a grand scheme to create a \ntest case. On the contrary, they were the actions of a single \nindividual determined to preserve her dignity as best she could. They \nwere the actions of a simple lady who, at that moment in her life, \ndecided that enough was enough.\n  It is fitting, then, that the Senate should award the Congressional \nGold Medal to Rosa Parks, the highest award that the Congress can \nbestow on a private citizen, in recognition of her courage and her \nlifelong commitment to the Jeffersonian ideal that ``all men are \ncreated equal.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this legislation conveys our Nation's \nrespect to one of its foremost civil rights pioneers.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is no common accolade, but Rosa Parks is \nno common woman. Her achievements are indeed most uncommon; they are \nnothing short of extraordinary.\n  None of us of sufficient age to remember the year 1955 will ever \nforget Ms. Parks' courage in refusing to give up her seat to a white \nman who wanted it.\n  What makes Ms. Parks' courage so uncommon was its manner: the type of \naction we usually associate with greatness in the civil rights movement \nmight involve a speech, a march, a coalition . . . . Ms. Parks' courage \nwas quiet, determined and resolute, but it had the volume of a great \nspeech, the force of a mass march, and the power to coalesce that would \nlead to historic Supreme Court decisions abrogating segregation, and \npassage of the seminal Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  It has been said of our extraordinary figures that their heroic \nactions, as the years pass, begin to appear more accepted and less \ncontroversial. This is because, as leaders, great men and women have \nlittle company, but as their revolutionary ideas gather strength, they \nalso gather adherents. This medal will help remind us, and generations \nto come, that at the time Ms. Parks refused to move from her seat on \nthe bus, her act of defiance was anything but common.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, Rosa Parks is an enduring symbol of \nfreedom, dignity, and courage for our time and for all time, and she \neminently deserves this Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Her momentous decision to quietly and peacefully defy her community's \nsegregation laws nearly half a century ago was a defining moment for \nthe entire civil rights movement in the United States and in many other \nlands as well. On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Mrs. Parks \nwas a 42 year old seamstress returning home on a city bus after a long \nand tiring day at work. She refused to give up her seat and move to the \nback of the bus as the law required, and America would never be the \nsame again.\n  Because of her quiet, simple, eloquent act of courage, she was \narrested and fined. As news of her arrest spread, thousands of African \nAmericans in the city quickly rallied to her cause, and four days \nlater, on December 5, 1955, the famous Montgomery Bus Boycott was \nlaunched.\n  It took a year, but the Supreme Court declared the Montgomery \nsegregation law unconstitutional. On December 21, 1956, thanks to her \nunyielding demand for equal justice, Rosa Parks and the African \nAmericans of Montgomery were free to ride on the city buses as full and \nequal citizens.\n  The Montgomery Bus Boycott touched the conscience of the nation, and \nfocused the attention of citizens across America on the evils of \nsegregation, discrimination, and the notorious Jim Crow laws. The power \nand justice of the civil rights movement could not be denied. In the \ndecade that followed, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1964, and America took giant steps toward \nfulfilling the promise of equal justice under law and full \nconstitutional rights for all Americans.\n  For her historic act of peaceful civil disobedience, Rosa Parks is \noften called the ``Mother of the Civil Rights Movement.'' She changed \nthe course of\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\nAmerica history, and made us a stronger, better, and freer nation. All \nAmericans owe her a deep debt of gratitude for bringing us closer to \nour ideals, and I am proud to support this bill to award her the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased to speak today as a co-\nsponsor of legislation to award a gold medal to Rosa Parks in \nrecognition of her historic contributions to the civil rights movement \nand to our country.\n  The word hero is one of the most overused words in our national \nvernacular, a term that should be reserved for those rare people whose \nincredible acts of courage in the face of tremendous adversity and long \nodds inspire us all. Surely it can be said, though, that one of the \ntrue living heroes in our country is the mother of the civil rights \nmovement, Rosa Parks.\n  No one would deny that America is a better place today because, on \nDecember 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks sat down on a bus \nin Montgomery, Alabama and insisted that she would not be moved. To \nthose of us who were children in these years watching the news on black \nand white television sets, entranced by the grainy images and the \nreassuring voice of Walter Cronkite, it is difficult to express the \nsingular act of courage expressed in Rosa Parks' determination--her \nabsolute resolve--to make a stand in a part of our nation we knew was \nhome to Bull Connor and his snarling police dogs, George Wallace and \nhis promise of ``segregation today, segregation tomorrow, and \nsegregation forever,'' and men like Orval Faubus who pledged to stand \nin schoolhouse doors from Little Rock to Selma to prevent us all from \nliving as one America, undivided by race.\n  In one incredible moment, Rosa Parks set forth a wave of activism all \nacross America and captured the essence of the better half of the \nAmerican spirit--proud, courageous, defiant against injustice--and \nAmericans followed her lead. 42,000 African Americans boycotted \nMontgomery's buses for 381 days until the bus segregation laws in \nAlabama were changed on December 21, 1956.\n  The changes that Rosa Parks made possible in America transcended the \nrealm, even, of our public laws--they literally changed a way of life. \nBecause Rosa Parks stood firm against injustice, she not only joined \nwith Martin Luther King, Jr. in ending the era of Jim Crowe, she helped \nusher in an age in America when Thurgood Marshall could serve on the \nhighest court of the land; an America where John Lewis and so many \nothers who marched for freedom could serve in the United States \nCongress; and an America in which we could all, living, working, and \nhoping together, envision a future--still ahead--when a still-better, \nstill-stronger America heals itself of all the scars of racism and \nbigotry.\n  Future generations of Americans need to know that this country \nconsiders Rosa Parks a hero. It should be known that we recognized Ms. \nParks' contributions to our country--and that we hoped that for years \nto come--in our homes, our schools, in our cities and on our village \ngreens--we wanted all Americans to learn and to remember what Rosa \nParks struggled to make true for our nation.\n  As we all join together as a Senate united in our deep respect for \nRosa Parks, let us remember also that we can do more for this leader \nthan give her a gold medal--we can make her work our own--in the House, \nin the Senate, and in our lives every day. We can all summon--at the \nedge of the twenty-first century--the best of our own spirit to wipe \naway the hatred, the bigotry, and the intolerance that remains in \nAmerica--and we can dedicate ourselves to building a better America in \nRosa Parks' image. That effort, too, will be a part of Rosa Parks' \nlegacy in the United States, and that monument will endure long after \nany medal has lost its shine.\n  Madam President, I urge the United States Senate to contemplate that \nchallenge on this special day in the United States of America, as we \nhonor Rosa Parks--but also as we ask ourselves how we can fulfill her \npromise and finally create Rosa Parks' America.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the Congressional Gold Medal is among \nthe most distinguished honors that Congress can bestow on individuals \nin recognition of their work or accomplishments. Since 1776, this \naward, initially reserved for military leaders, has also been given to \nsuch diverse individuals as Sir Winston Churchill, Charles Lindbergh \nand Mother Teresa.\n  Rosa Parks is not a military hero, not a head of state, explorer or \nadventurer.\n  On December 1, 1955, she was a seamstress on her way to work, who \ntook a seat on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. For that simple \naction of sitting on a bus, she was arrested, sent to jail, and \nconvicted of what city laws called a crime and lost her job.\n  Rosa Parks is a living example of how an extraordinary person, \nengaged in the ordinary matters of life, can change the world.\n  The day that Ms. Parks refused to surrender her seat to a white man \nsymbolizes the beginning of the modern civil rights movement. Her \narrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the catalyst for a \nmass boycott of the city's buses, whose rider ship had been 70 percent \nblack. The boycott led to the national prominence of the Rev. Martin \nLuther King Jr. and to a Supreme Court order declaring Montgomery \nCounty's segregated seating laws unconstitutional.\n  Ms. Parks, known now as the ``first lady of civil rights,'' later \nsaid, ``I felt just resigned to give what I could to protest against \nthe way I was being treated.''\n  Rosa Parks had been involved in the civil rights movement years \nbefore the bus incident and her efforts continued long afterward. She \nwas one of the first female members of the Montgomery Chapter of the \nNAACP, she joined the Montgomery Voters League and encouraged blacks to \nregister to vote.\n  Despite her civil rights work, Rosa Parks on that historic day \nactually followed the degrading rules that reserved the first ten seats \nwere reserved for ``whites only.'' If those rows filled up, blacks were \nsupposed to move even further back. Parks, who was sitting just beyond \nthe 10th row, refused to move and the arrest, the conviction and the \nwinning appeal followed. All she had asked for was the basic respect \nand simple dignity of not being forced to give up her seat to a white \nman.\n  Rosa Parks actions and her determination to preserve her dignity \nspread throughout the nation and sparked the end of segregation in the \nSouth. She hasn't stopped since.\n  In 1957, she moved to Detroit where she worked for nonviolent social \nchange with Martin Luther King Jr's Southern Christian Leadership \nConference. She worked for Congressman John Conyers and in 1987 she \nfounded an institute to provide leadership and career training to black \nyouth. Forty-four years after that historic day in Montgomery, she \ncontinues to speak out on civil rights issues.\n  We have heard the ``first lady of civil rights'' story over and over \nagain throughout the years and it will own a permanent place in our \nhistory books. But we need to keep listening and reminding ourselves of \nthe extraordinary courage and determination that this working woman had \nto win the most basic rights that everyone in our nation deserves. She \nserves as a model and inspiration for what each of us can do in our \neveryday lives toward greater respect, dignity and kindness among \nhumankind.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in bestowing the Congressional Gold \nMedal to ``the mother of the freedom movement.''\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, last week I offered a few comments on two \ngreat civil rights leaders, Ms. Rosa Parks and Mr. Oliver W. Hill.\n  Today, as we are on the verge of passing S. 531, legislation to award \na Congressional Gold Medal to Ms. Rosa Parks, I want to speak again \njust briefly.\n  As I noted last week, our Nation owes Ms. Parks an immense debt of \ngratitude. It is gratifying to me that we have been able to move this \nlegislation so quickly, and I think the great speed with which the \nSenate is acting is testimony in itself to our admiration of Ms. Parks.\n  No matter how eloquent our words or how eloquent we believe them to \nbe, words can never match the simple act of this courageous woman. Ms. \nParks herself has become a symbol for the courage and righteousness of \nthe civil rights movement. When we think of her action, we cannot help \nbut think of\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\nthe consequences --an historic bus boycott by 40,000 people, a decade \nof principled protests, and legal and legislative victories that helped \nmake America more free.\n  Ms. Parks, an unassuming seamstress who stood up to segregation by \nsitting down in the front seat of a city bus in Montgomery, AL, now \nstands like a giant in the history of the 20th century.\n  I thank our colleagues and the leadership for their support for \npassing S. 531 today. While we still face too long a journey to end \ndiscrimination, Rosa Parks and thousands of individual acts of courage \nhave made us more free and have inspired the rest of us to carry on in \nour own efforts.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nawarding Mrs. Rosa Parks a Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of \nher contributions to the nation.\n  On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks got on a \nbus--a quiet, proud woman, bound unfairly by the laws of our country \nand the limits of her surroundings. But by the time the police took her \noff that bus, she was bound only by the strength of her will, a will \nthat refused to be moved.\n  Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus.\n  Somewhere, in the brief moment that separates a spoken objection from \nan act of protest, Rosa Parks emerged as the ``first lady of civil \nrights,'' and the ``mother of the freedom movement.'' We look at this \nwoman's accomplishment and we salute her for the civil rights movement \nshe helped set in motion. We look back now, and we applaud the \nmonumental force which is still a vital part of our society today.\n  Back in the 1950's, in a small city, on an ordinary bus, she had \nneither titles nor honorifics. She was just Rosa Parks--and ``just'' \nRosa Parks refused to let others limit what she was supposed to do. Her \nact was defined, not by its violence, but rather by its non-violent \nchallenge towards a violent system.\n  Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus.\n  If our country's history has taught us anything, it is that small \ndecisions of action can change our world. If Rosa Parks has taught us \nanything, it is that the courageous action of one individual can be \nmore powerful than the shouted declaration of a crowd.\n  Thus, I am honored today to join with my colleagues in honoring this \ngreat American whose courage, dignity, and character have continued to \nserve as an inspiration for the quiet but heroic actions that shape our \nworld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, how much time remains on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I ask for as much time as I might consume--not \nexpecting to consume more than about 5 or 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, this is a good day for the Senate. I am very proud \nto be a cosponsor of S. 531, and I want to thank my colleagues, \nSenators Abraham, Levin, Sessions, Kennedy and Harkin, for working on \nthis important and historic legislation and making sure that it was \nbrought to the floor of the Senate.\n  Today I expect that we will move forward unanimously--this is my \nexpectation--in the effort to award Rosa Parks a Congressional Gold \nMedal which will celebrate her leadership to ensure that all of us are \ntreated equally in this country, the greatest of all countries in the \nworld, the United States of America.\n  I urge the House to move forward with their bill. I understand they \nhave many, many cosponsors, so we ought to take care of this soon.\n  The last time I saw Rosa Parks, she was getting on in years, just as \nwe all do. It would be important to allow her this one more reward for \nher bravery, for her courage, and recognize that she is an inspiration \nto every single one of us regardless of our race or religion, \nregardless of what we look like, regardless of whether we have a \ndisability or not. We all find ourselves in the situation where we are \nnot treated equally. And for ensuring that African Americans will be \ntreated equally, Rosa Parks took a giant step forward for all of us.\n  I shudder to think of where our country would be were it not for the \npioneers in the civil rights movement. We have seen in the world and we \nsee every day what happens when people turn on people for no reason \nother than the status of their birth. It makes no sense. It goes \nagainst God. But it happens.\n  For us to take time out particularly now to honor Rosa Parks is very, \nvery fitting. Where would we have been as a society if Mrs. Parks had \nagreed when the bus driver turned around, and said, ``You get up and \ngive your seat'' to a white person on December 1, 1955? We don't have \nto speculate, because Rosa Parks had the courage to say no.\n  At the time she was 42 years old. She was coming back from work. She \nwas tired. She worked hard, and she thought to herself--I am sure \nbecause I am sure she had thought it many times--``Am I worth so little \nas a human being that I can't have the dignity to have a seat on a \nbus?''\n  Senator Abraham was talking about the first time he heard about Rosa \nParks. We all have our experiences when we are in the presence of \ngreatness and how it feels. It is very humbling to meet someone like \nthat. She could have been beaten, injured, or killed for a very simple \npremise that she had an equal right to sit on a bus.\n  When I was a little girl--and I will not give away how old I was--I \nwas in a southern State where my mother was recuperating from an \nillness. I was very unaware of any of these laws that said black people \nhave to go on the back of the bus. I didn't know anything about it. I \nwas young. I was having fun. I found myself in a situation with my \nmother in a bus. And I was sitting down kind of towards the front, \nabout the middle of the bus. An elderly woman came in who happened to \nbe African American. She was carrying a lot of packages. She was frail. \nI did what I was always taught to do. I stood up. I said, ``Here, \nma'am. Please sit down.'' My mother was sitting next to me on the bus. \nShe let me do this. She knew. And this woman said, ``No, thank you.'' I \ndidn't understand.\n\n  I said, ``No. Really. Please sit down. I want you to sit down.'' She \nsaid, ``No. No, thank you.'' And she proceeded down. And my mother told \nme. She leaned over, and she said, ``She can't sit there.'' I said, \n``Why?'' ``Because she is minority, she can't sit there.''\n  I didn't know quite what to do. I mean I was not quite a teen. But I \nknew this was absolutely wrong because of everything that I was taught \nas a child in my loving family.\n  I just said to my mother, ``Well, I am not going to sit down. I will \njust stand up.'' I went toward the back and held on and stood up, and \nfor whatever it was worth--nothing, probably, but to me at least what I \ndid was not totally helpless. It occurred to me as a youngster, this \nmakes no sense at all.\n  The thought that it took Rosa Parks to turn it around is amazing to \nme. It shows you how institutions of discrimination are so inculcated \nin society that it takes that kind of bravery to turn it around.\n  What is the message of all of this when we give Rosa Parks this \nmedal? It is, of course, to remember these times, because if we don't \nremember the past, we are bound to repeat it. Everybody said that it is \ntrue. But it is also a message to our young people, and to all of us \nwho live pretty good lives--that we should have a little bit of courage \nin our lives, that when we see something wrong, if we hear something \nthat is offensive, that is hurtful, it is real easy to turn the other \nway. And we hear it all the time. We always say, ``Well, I don't want \nto really not be liked by everyone. I don't want to say anything. They \nwill think I am `politically correct'.'' I hate that term, because I \ndon't get that term. It is either right or it is wrong. It is not \n``politically'' anything. It is right or it is wrong. If it is wrong, \nwe need to do something. We may not have the courage of Rosa Parks. Not \nall of us are born with that. But there are things that we can do.\n  Mrs. Parks' quiet strength and defiance helped commence one of the \nmost profound social movements in American history. Imagine just \nsaying, ``No. I will not give up. I have a right to be treated \nequally.'' She helped precipitate the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It took \na long time. But we came around.\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\n  That is why this country is so great, because we do the right thing.\n  There she was, a woman of 42 years old, well respected, and had a lot \nto lose by acting out in this way. But she did it.\n  She also refused to take ``Black Only'' escalators, and often avoided \nriding the bus home from work because of the constant harassment and \nthe segregated seating arrangement.\n  Finally, she acted. Her arrest was a call to action for the African \nAmerican residents in Montgomery, AL, who were determined to fight \nsegregation and win.\n  That boycott lasted 382 days, and it involved 42,000 boycotters. It \ncost the bus company a lot of profit.\n  Then, in 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Montgomery \nsegregation law was illegal and ordered the desegregation of buses.\n  That was the first of many victories for those in the civil rights \nmovement.\n  When you see Mrs. Parks, you will see a fragile person. You look in \nher eyes, and you try to imagine what it was like for her to do what \nshe did. But you see a strength in those eyes. She kept the community \nglued together for the common goal of equality, and she changed this \nNation for the better forever.\n  This is what she said when someone asked her how she would like to be \nknown. She said, ``I would like to be known as a person who is \nconcerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all \npeople.''\n  Her actions made sure that this Nation does offer freedom, equality, \njustice, and prosperity to all people if they work hard for it.\n  Our courts ensure that people are free from discrimination. When we \nsee it here, we cry out about it with one voice, whether it is against \npeople for the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, their \ndisability, or their religion. It is all part of what it means to be an \nAmerican, it seems to me, to fight for equality for all our people. \nThat is what makes us a better country. It makes us a more prosperous \nnation.\n  In closing, I will read part of the preamble to the Constitution. The \ngreat thing about our country is we don't put our Constitution on a \nback shelf. We try to make it real. There are a lot of nations in the \nworld that have good constitutions but they don't enforce them.\n\n       WE THE PEOPLE of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     CONSTITUTION. . . .\n\n  ``[D]omestic Tranquility.'' It is not tranquil if we are hurting one \nanother, if we discriminate against one another.\n  ``[E]stablish Justice.'' We have no justice if people can't sit down \non the bus or can't go to a school simply because of the color of their \nskin or because of a disability.\n  ``[P]romote the general Welfare.'' You can't have a society where \neveryone is moving forward if we discriminate against people.\n  This Constitution is a magnificent document, and Rosa Parks, with her \naction, made that Constitution a living document. The Supreme Court \nlooked at what was going on and they said that was wrong; it is \nunconstitutional to harm people, to discriminate against people, \nbecause of the status of their birth. So we continue to fight for civil \nrights. These fights come in many different ways. I think it is pretty \nsimple. It is what Mrs. Parks said:\n\n       I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about \n     freedom, equality, justice and prosperity for all people.\n\n  Very simple. But I think we ought to look at that and give everything \nwe do here the Rosa Parks test: Are we doing the right thing for the \npeople of this great Nation? She deserves this congressional medal, \nthis gold medal.\n  I am very proud, Madam President, to have the opportunity to be here \nand make a few comments. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am delighted to see the Senate take up \nthis bill--and I suspect we will pass this bill unanimously--honoring \nthe courage and leadership of Rosa Parks. She played a significant role \nin moving this country toward recognition of human dignity and \nprotection of civil rights of all our citizens.\n  As we move forward in unanimity to call for a medal to recognize Rosa \nParks' contribution to our history, I hope all of the sponsors and \nsupporters of this bill will also take at least a moment to consider \nnot only the progress we made but the distance we have yet to travel.\n  I hope, among other things, the Senate will honor Rosa Parks and all \nthat the civil rights movement in this country has accomplished by \nmoving forward with the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil \nRights Division at the Department of Justice. Action on this matter is \nlong overdue.\n  Bill Lann Lee is the first Asian American to be nominated to head the \nCivil Rights Division in its history, 42-year history. He is currently \nserving as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights as he \nhas for almost 16 months. He has done an impressive job enforcing our \nNation's civil rights laws.\n\n  He was originally nominated in July 1997. Despite his excellent \ncredentials and legal record, some chose to demagogue his nomination \nand turn it into a symbolic vote against the President.\n  Six former Assistant Attorneys General for Civil Rights, from the \nEisenhower through the Bush administrations, wrote to the Judiciary \nCommittee in support of his nomination: Harold Tyler, Burke Marshall, \nStephen J. Pollak, J. Stanley Pottinger, Drew Days, and John R. Dunne. \nBut he has still not come before the Senate.\n  He was renominated in January 1998, but the committee went all of \nlast session without reporting his nomination. He was renominated again \nfor the third time last month. It is past time to do the right and \nhonorable thing, and report this qualified nominee to the Senate.\n  I hope, Madam President, that the Senate will be allowed to vote on \nBill Lann Lee and not just leave him bottled up in a committee where a \nsmall minority of the Senate can vote. After 29 months and three \nsessions of Congress, bring it before the Senate of the United States, \nso that all Senators--Republican and Democrat alike--can either vote \nfor him or vote against him. Let all Senators state to the country \nwhether this extraordinary person is going to be allowed to serve in \nthe position for which he has been nominated or whether we will tell \nthis outstanding Asian American that the doors of the Senate are closed \nto him.\n  That is the question. Do we open the doors to this outstanding Asian \nAmerican or do we close the doors? Right now they are closed. Let's \nhave them open.\n  Civil Rights is about human dignity and opportunity. Bill Lann Lee's \nnomination ought to have the opportunity for an up or down vote on the \nSenate floor. He should no longer be forced to ride in the back on the \nnominations bus but be given the fair vote that he deserves.\n  After looking at Bill Lee's record, I knew he was a man who could \neffectively lead the Civil Rights Division, enforce the law and resolve \ndisputes. Prior to his tenure at the Department of Justice, he had been \ninvolved in approximately 200 cases in his 23 years of law practice, of \nwhich he settled all but six of them. This is strong evidence that Mr. \nLee is a problem solver and practical in his approach to the law. No \none who has taken the time thoroughly to review his record could call \nhim an idealogue. I knew Bill Lee would be reasonable and practical in \nhis approach to the job, and that he would be a top-notch enforcer of \nthe nation's civil rights laws. All of this has proven true.\n  Over the past several months, Bill Lee has been acting head of the \nCivil Rights Division the way it should be run. Here in Washington, \nwhere we have a lot of show horses, Bill Lee is a work horse--a \ndedicated public servant who is working hard to help solve some of our \nnation's most difficult problems. He is solving problems every day in \nbig and small cases, which are settled or\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\nbrought to trial by his remarkable team of attorneys in the Division.\n  During his tenure, the Civil Rights Division has resolved several \nhate crimes cases, including: In Idaho, six men pleaded guilty to \nengaging in a series of racially motivated attacks on Mexican-American \nmen, women and children, some as young as 9-years-old; in Arizona, \nthree members of a skinhead group pleaded guilty to burning a cross in \nthe front yard of an African-American woman; and in Texas, a man \npleaded guilty to entering a Jewish temple and firing several gun shots \nwhile shouting anti-Semitic slurs.\n  The Division has also been vigorously enforcing our criminal \nstatutes, including: indictments against three people in Arkansas \ncharged with church burning; guilty pleas by 16 Puerto Rico \ncorrectional officers who beat 22 inmates and then tried to cover it \nup; cases arising from Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14, \nbeing lured to the U.S. and then being forced into prostitution; and \nguilty pleas from 18 defendants who forced 60 deaf Mexican nationals to \nsell trinkets on the streets of New York. Out of concerns about slavery \ncontinuing in the U.S., Bill Lee has created a Worker Exploitation Task \nForce to coordinate enforcement efforts with the Department of Labor. I \ncommend Mr. Lee for putting the spotlight on these shameful crimes.\n  Other significant cases which the Civil Rights Division has handled \nover the past year include the following: several long-standing school \ndesegregation cases were settled or their consent decrees were \nterminated, including cases in Kansas City, Kansas; San Juan County, \nUtah; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Japanese-Latin Americans who were \ndeported and interned in the United States during World War II also \nreceived compensation last year. Lawsuits in Ohio and Washington, D.C. \nwere settled to allow women better access to women's health clinics.\n  This record indicates that Bill Lee has been running the Division the \nway it should be run. Over the past year, we have seen the strong and \nsteady work of the Division -- solid achievements and effective law \nenforcement. I had high expectations for Bill Lee when he was nominated \nand I have not been disappointed. He is doing a terrific job, and I \nknow that he will keep up the good work.\n\n  Given his outstanding work as Acting Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights, I urge the Committee and the Senate to take up his \nnomination and accord him the dignity of a Senate vote. I am confident \nthat in a fair vote on his nomination Bill Lann Lee will be confirmed \nby the United States Senate as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil \nRights. He should no longer be relegated to second class status as an \nActing Assistant Attorney General. He should be confirmed and serve out \nhis term with the full measure of dignity accorded to all other \nAssistant Attorneys General in charge of Civil Rights during our \nhistory.\n  When Bill Lee appeared before the Committee for his confirmation \nhearing in 1997, he testified candidly about his views, his work and \nhis values. He articulated to us that he understands that as the \nAssistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division his client is \nthe United States and all of its people. He told us poignantly about \nwhy he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for \nall when he spoke of the treatment that his parents received as \nimmigrants. Mr. Lee told us how in spite of his father's personal \ntreatment and experiences, William Lee remained a fierce American \npatriot, volunteered to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in \nWorld War II and never lost his belief in America.\n  He inspired his son just as Bill Lee now inspires his own children \nand countless others across the land. They are the kind of heroes that \nwe honor and respect as fellow Americans. Mr. Lee told us:\n\n       My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it \n     difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching \n     patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I \n     did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to \n     a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance. \n     But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an \n     American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside \n     the momentary ugliness. He knew that the basic American tenet \n     of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.\n\n  I know that Bill Lann Lee has remained true to all that his father \ntaught him and I hope that the ``momentary ugliness'' of people \nopposing his nomination based on an ideological litmus test, and of \npeople distorting his achievements and beliefs, and of some succumbing \nto narrow partisanship, will not be his reward for a career of good \nworks. Such treatment drives good people from public service and \ndistorts the role of the Senate.\n  I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it \nserves as the conscience of the nation. In this case, I am afraid that \nthe Senate may show no conscience. I call on the Senate's Republican \nleadership to end their targeting of Bill Lann Lee and to work with us \nto bring this nomination to the floor without obstruction so that the \nSenate may vote and we may confirm a fine person to lead the Civil \nRights Division into the next century. Racial discrimination, and \nharmful discrimination in all its forms--remains one of the most vexing \nunsolved problems of our society. Let the Senate rise to this occasion \nto unite the nation.\n  Bill Lann Lee is highly educated and highly skilled. He could have \nspent his career in the comfort and affluence of any one of the \nnation's top law firms. Yet he chose to spend his career on the front \nlines, helping to open the doors of opportunity to those who struggle \nin our society. And now some decry his lifetime of advocacy for civil \nrights by arguing that a civil rights advocate should not head the \nCivil Rights Division. The chief enforcement officer for our civil \nrights should be someone who believes in our civil rights laws.\n  Bill Lee's skills, his experience, the compelling personal journey \nthat he and his family have traveled, his commitment to full \nopportunity for all Americans--these qualities appeal to the best in \nus. Let us affirm the best in us. Let us confirm--or at least allow the \nSenate to vote on the confirmation of this good man. We need Bill Lann \nLee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times.\n  If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe he will be confirmed \nand will move this country forward to a time when discrimination will \nsubside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each \nchild-- girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, \nregardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual \norientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to \nlive the American dream.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, \n     Alabama, the first child of James and Leona (Edwards) \n     McCauley;\n       (2) Rosa Parks is honored as the ``first lady of civil \n     rights'' and the ``mother of the freedom movement'', and her \n     quiet dignity ignited the most significant social movement in \n     the history of the United States;\n       (3) Rosa Parks was arrested on December 1, 1955, in \n     Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat on a \n     bus to a white man, and her stand for equal rights became \n     legendary;\n       (4) news of Rosa Parks' arrest resulted in 42,000 African \n     Americans boycotting Montgomery buses for 381 days, beginning \n     on December 5, 1955, until the bus segregation laws were \n     changed on December 21, 1956;\n       (5) the United States Supreme Court ruled on November 13, \n     1956, that the Montgomery segregation law was \n     unconstitutional, and on December 20, 1956, Montgomery \n     officials were ordered to desegregate buses;\n       (6) the civil rights movement led to the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964, which broke down the barriers of legal \n     discrimination against African Americans and made equality \n     before the law a reality for all Americans;\n       (7) Rosa Parks is the recipient of many awards and \n     accolades for her efforts on behalf of racial harmony, \n     including the Springarn Award, the NAACP's highest honor for \n     civil rights contributions, the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, and the first \n     International Freedom Conductor Award from the National \n     Underground Railroad Freedom Center;\n       (8) Rosa Parks has dedicated her life to the cause of \n     universal human rights and truly embodies the love of \n     humanity and freedom;\n       (9) Rosa Parks was the first woman to join the Montgomery \n     chapter of the NAACP, was an active volunteer for the \n     Montgomery Voters League, and in 1987, cofounded the Rosa and \n     Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development;\n       (10) Rosa Parks, by her quiet courage, symbolizes all that \n     is vital about nonviolent protest, as she endured threats of \n     death and persisted as an advocate for the simple, basic \n     lessons she taught the Nation and from which the Nation has \n     benefited immeasurably; and\n       (11) Rosa Parks, who has resided in the State of Michigan \n     since 1957, has become a living icon for freedom in America.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The President is authorized \n     to award to Rosa Parks, on behalf of the Congress, a gold \n     medal of appropriate design honoring Rosa Parks in \n     recognition of her contributions to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2, under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, and at a price \n     sufficient to cover the costs thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS AS NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals \n     for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund an amount not to exceed $30,000 to pay for the cost of \n     the medals authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals under section 3 shall be deposited in \n     the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3845-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Brian Merry \nElementary School in Augusta, has been a teacher for 23 years. His \nmotivation and source of inspiration comes in part from the belief that \nit was his duty to give something back to society, and he has done so \nthrough his teaching.\n  To achieve his goal of getting kids to learn, Mr. Baumgartner creates \na sense of adventure in his classroom. He has used his creativity and \nimagination to bring the magic of reading and learning to the minds of \nhis kids.\n  The award, sponsored by the Council of Chief State School Officers \nand Scholastic, Inc., will send Mr. Baumgartner on a promotional tour \nas 1999 National Teacher of the Year, where he will share his \ninnovative ideas with other teachers around the nation. I wish Mr. \nBaumgartner the best of luck during this tour and am confident that he \nwill inspire other teachers with his creativity and willingness to do \nwhatever it takes to get kids to learn.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I congratulate Andrew Baumgartner on being \nnamed 1999 National Teacher of the Year and I commend him for his \ndedication to teaching America's youth. As we continue to search for \nways to improve education in our country, let us look at the example \nset by Mr. Baumgartner and be inspired by his commitment to education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3845-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3845-S3846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 6, 1999, the Secretary of \nthe Senate on April 16, 1999, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1376.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, The Michigan National Guard carries out a \n     demanding mission with responsibilities to both the state and \n     the federal government. The citizen soldiers who make up the \n     National Guard must train to meet a demanding federal role in \n     support of the active components of the Armed Forces as well \n     as remaining on call to assist with emergencies in the state; \n     and\n       Whereas, Training time is precious for the National Guard \n     personnel who must strive to match active duty standards. In \n     order to maximize training time, a cadre of full-time \n     National Guard personnel carry out a number of duties \n     essential to the smooth functioning of a National Guard unit. \n     They make sure everybody is paid on time, review retirement \n     points, process orders for military education, and resolve \n     other administrative issues for the soldiers and airmen; and\n       Whereas, Analysis by the Department of Defense shows that \n     the National Guard has fewer than half the number of full-\n     time personnel required to perform all the tasks necessary to \n     carry out its missions. Nonetheless, federal budget analysts \n     continue to propose additional cuts to the full-time force in \n     the National Guard; and\n       Whereas, Even maintaining the status quo increases the \n     duties of the full-time personnel because of the greater \n     burden the National Guard shoulders today. Operations in \n     Bosnia, the Sinai, Haiti, and the Gulf, plus support for the \n     war on drugs, increase the workload of full-time staff. \n     Additional missions such as the National Guard's new role in \n     combating the threat of weapons of mass destruction add to \n     the duties. The vital role of the National Guard in \n     protecting our state and nation requires increased federal \n     funding; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the President \n     and Congress to increase funding for full-time National Guard \n     personnel; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-30. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Nebraska; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Legislative Resolution 29\n\n       Whereas, the State of Nebraska filed a lawsuit against the \n     tobacco industry on August 21, 1998, in the district court of \n     Lancaster County; and\n       Whereas, the State of Nebraska and forty-five other states \n     settled their lawsuits against the tobacco industry on \n     November 23, 1998, under terms of the Tobacco Master \n     Settlement Agreement (MSA) without any assistance from the \n     federal government; and\n       Whereas, under terms of the Master Settlement Agreement, \n     Nebraska's lawsuit against the tobacco industry was dismissed \n     by the district court of Lancaster County on December 20, \n     1998, and State Specific Finality was achieved in the State \n     of Nebraska on January 20, 1999; and\n       Whereas, the State of Nebraska has passed legislation to \n     allocate its portion of settlement funds awarded under the \n     Master Settlement Agreement for the preservation of the \n     health of its citizens; and\n       Whereas, the federal government, through the Health Care \n     Financing Administration, has asserted that it is entitled to \n     a significant share of settlement funds awarded to the \n     settling states under the Master Settlement Agreement on the \n     basis that such funds represent a portion of federal Medicaid \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, the federal government previously chose not to \n     exercise its option to file a federal lawsuit against the \n     tobacco industry, but on January 19, 1999, the President of \n     the United States announced plans to pursue federal claims \n     against the tobacco industry; and\n       Whereas, the State of Nebraska is entitled to all of its \n     portion of settlement funds negotiated in the Master \n     Settlement Agreement without any federal claim to such funds; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the ninety-sixth legislature of \n     Nebraska, first session:\n       1. That the Legislature hereby petitions the Congress of \n     the United States and the executive branch of the federal \n     government to prohibit federal recoupment of state tobacco \n     settlement recoveries.\n       2. That official copies of this resolution be prepared and \n     forwarded to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives and President of the United States Senate and \n     to all members of the Nebraska delegation to the Congress of \n     the United States with the request that it be officially \n     entered into the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States.\n       3.

Sec. 1396b(a)(3)) entitles the Federal Government \n     to a pro rata share of the net amount recovered by a state \n     from liable third parties for the amount spent under Medicaid \n     on behalf of eligible individuals; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Government is not entitled to take \n     away from the states any funds negotiated on their behalf to \n     settle state lawsuits for recovery of state costs; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Government can initiate its own \n     lawsuit or settlement with the tobacco industry to recoup \n     Federal Medicaid funds; and\n       Whereas, Recently, there have been unsuccessful efforts in \n     the United States Senate to earmark or otherwise impose \n     Federal restrictions on the respective states' use of state \n     tobacco settlement funds; and\n       Whereas, The payments to the Commonwealth will be used to \n     fund important programs and initiatives in this Commonwealth \n     as determined by the General Assembly; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania memorialize the Congress of the United States to \n     enact legislation clarifying section 1903(a)(3) of the Social \n     Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C.

However, the government of our sister \n     Republic of the Antilles does not respect this principle \n     today.\n       On July 16, 1997, the Cuban authorities arrested four \n     citizens: Vladimiro Roca-Antones, Marta Beatriz Roque-\n     Cabello, Felix Bome-Carcases and Rene Gomez-Manzano, for the \n     sole reason of having made statements and published documents \n     in which they denounced their dissatisfaction with the thesis \n     of the governing party and exhorted the people to take \n     pacific civil action. For this action, that in Puerto Rico \n     and the democratic countries is totally acceptable in \n     politics and in community life, and which did not entail \n     any act of violence against persons or property, the Cuban \n     government accused the four of counterrevolutionary \n     activities and kept them in prison for nineteen months \n     prior to their trial. During this period, persons such as \n     Pope John Paul II--who achieved the pardon and commutation \n     of penalties for many convicts in many countries--and \n     prime minister Jean Chretien of Canada, a country with \n     which Cuba has good relations--asked for the freedom of \n     the group of four, which went unnoticed.\n       In addition to this, as the date of the trial near, the \n     authorities of the neighboring country initiated a wave of \n     detentions and arrests of citizens. Some of them, for being \n     associated to dissident activities, but many others for \n     having simply stated their sympathy or asked for tolerance \n     for those who were first arrested, including the members of \n     the independent news bureau ``Cubapress''. Many were detained \n     or placed under house arrest during the last days in order to \n     prevent public demonstrations of support. The total number of \n     arrests is estimated in the hundreds, many of whom were \n     detained for short periods, and others for longer ones, and \n     some of them, such as poet Raul Rivero and the Christian-\n     Democratic leader Osvaldo Paya, were still under arrest when \n     this Resolution was drafted.\n       On March 1, 1999, when after nineteen months, the Cuban \n     government submitted the four dissidents to a flash trial \n     which lasted only one day, during which it used public force \n     to keep the accredited press and the public at a considerable \n     distance and prevent their access. Observers of recognized \n     diplomatic personnel of the United States, Poland, the Czech \n     Republic, Great Britain, as well as Switzerland, a neutral \n     country, and South Africa which has a revolutionary \n     government, were also denied access.\n       The People of Puerto Rico, who, as our poet said, ``receive \n     flowers or bullets in the same heart'' as that of Cuba, \n     expresses solidarity with its sisters and brothers who simply \n     seek to exercise their natural and undeniable right of \n     expression, and demand a dialogue on the future of their \n     country.\n       The government of Puerto Rico, due to the nature of our \n     present political status, depends on the international forum \n     of the United States government as its representative and \n     agent endowed with sovereignty, without having a direct \n     representation in the instruments of power of said \n     representative and agent. Nevertheless, the House of \n     Representatives cannot remain silent in view of this \n     situation, and, in behalf of the People of Puerto Rico, and \n     under the guarantee of freedom of speech and protest which we \n     enjoy, and which is not enjoyed in Cuba, remits to the \n     government of the United States our clamor to act through all \n     available means to intercede for the freedom of these \n     imprisoned conscientious objectors; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--To express the clamor of the House of \n     Representatives of Puerto Rico to the President of the United \n     States, William Jefferson Clinton, and the Secretary of \n     State, Madeleine Albright, to use all means in their power to \n     intercede for the freedom of those persons detained and tried \n     in Cuba solely for their dissidence with the government \n     policies of said republic, or for their exercise of freedom \n     of the press, or their support of the rights of dissidents \n     and journalists.\n       Section 2.--To state our special concern in the case of \n     journalists, authors and communicators such as Vladimir Roca-\n     Antones, Marta Beatriz Roque-Cabello, Felix Bonne-Carcases \n     and Rene Gomez-Manzano, and the members and directors of \n     independent news bureaus.\n       Section 3.--This Resolution shall be translated and \n     remitted expeditiously to the President of the United States, \n     William Jefferson Clinton, and to the Secretary of State, \n     Madeleine Albright, as well as to the presidents of both \n     houses of the Congress of the United States.\n       Section 3.--This Resolution shall take effect immediately \n     after its approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-34.

A bill to limit the acquisition by the United States of land \nlocated in a State in which 25 percent or more of the land in that \nState is owned by the United States; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                    NO NET LOSS OF PRIVATE LANDS ACT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is really the ``No-Net-Gain'' bill \nthat we have talked about before. The regulation is a commonsense \nproposal that will limit additional Federal land acquisition in public \nland States. The Federal Government continues to acquire more land \nthroughout the Nation in every State of the Union, and folks are saying \nwe have to take a new look at the growth of the Federal Government and \nbegin to protect private property rights. This, however, only applies \nto States in which 25 percent or more of the State now belongs to the \nFederal Government. So, as you can imagine, the acquisition of \nadditional lands is especially a problem for those of us living in the \nWest.\n  Roughly 50 percent of the land in my home State of Wyoming is owned \nby the Federal Government. In some States it is as high as 87 percent--\nin Nevada. In Colorado, the home State of the Presiding Officer, it is \nhigher than 50 percent. This bill deals with that sort of phenomenon. \nAs you probably know, in the past, of course, much land was set aside \nin parks and forests. They were reserve lands. And I support that. I am \nglad they are set aside. These are national treasures and we want to \nkeep them.\n  Much of the land, of course, was then put into private ownership \nthrough the Homestead Act. When that was concluded, there were still \nlands there that were left afterwards, and they were taken and are now \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management. These were not lands that \nwere ever reserved; these were lands that were simply left over when \nthe Homestead Act was completed.\n  So they, too, are managed for many uses and are important. This bill \nin no way asks these total lands be reduced. We are simply saying \nwhenever there is an acquisition made for something that is useful--and \nit does allow the Federal Government to do that, of course--that an \nequal value of land, Federal land, be sent back into private ownership.\n  The Federal Government, of course, makes it a little more difficult \nsometimes in the States to have multiple use, to use them, to set them \naside, to manage the environment, but at the same time have economic \nactivities, to have mining, to have oil, to have timber, to have \ngrazing. These are the things, of course, that are the lifeblood to the \nWestern States. This creates often a hardship for the local economies; \nand it depresses the economy.\n  The Clinton administration, I think, has been particularly difficult \nin the way it has handled some of the public lands. The latest \nproposal, the Lands Legacy Initiative, is an example of a rather \nexpansive acquisition of Federal lands. Again I say I have no objection \nto the maintaining of lands that have a special character, that have a \nspecial need, to be reserved into public ownership. All we say is, if \nyou are going to do that, then release an equal value amount of lands \nback into private ownership. Many of us are very concerned about the \nLands Legacy Initiative, that it will again impede the private \nownership, which, of course, is a very basic thing to this whole \ncountry.\n  I think the time has come to put some kind of a bridle on the \ninsatiable appetite for additional land in the western part of the \nUnited States. The No-Net-Loss of Private Lands Act is, I think, a \nreasonable approach to an ever-increasing growth of Federal land \nownership. This measure requires the Federal Government to release an \nequal value of land when it acquires property in the States that are at \nleast 25 percent federally owned.\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\n  The property would be released at the same time of the new \nacquisition and could be any type of Federal lands. In addition, the \nlegislation would provide a provision waiving the disposal requirement \nin time of national emergency or war.\n  While in the Congress, both in the House and the Senate, I have \nworked extensively to protect unique public lands, such as national \nparks. I served as chairman of the National Parks Committee. I think \nthere is nothing more important to us, in terms of preserving natural \nresources and cultural resources.\n  In fact, we passed a rather extensive bill called Vision 20/20 last \nyear that does this. It helps to strengthen national parks. When I grew \nup, my parents' ranch bordered the Shoshone National Forest, so I feel \nvery strongly about forests and that they should be there, but I do \nbelieve there needs to be some equality between the private ownership \nand Federal ownership. So it is time for the Congress to protect the \nrights of private owners and to instill some common sense and restraint \nin the further acquisition and growth of Federal lands. That is what \nthis bill is designed to do. And I indicate the cosponsorship of \nSenator Kyl and Senator Helms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 827. A bill to establish drawback for imports of N-cyclohexyl-2-\nbenzothiazolesulfenamide based on exports of N-tert-Butyl-2-\nbenzothiazolesulfenamide; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                DUTY DRAWBACK ON IMPORTS OF CBS AND TBBS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould establish the authority to provide a duty drawback on imports of \ntwo commercially interchangeable rubber vulcanization accelerators \nknown commonly as CBS and TBBS.\n  CBS and TBBS are the major primary accelerators used in the \nproduction of tires and other rubber products. Both CBS and TBBS belong \nto the same class and subclass of rubber vulcanization chemicals, and \ncan be used interchangeably with one another to perform the same \nfunction and to achieve the same end results. They can be manufactured \nby similar industrial processes using the same raw materials and \nidentical process steps; and for all practical purposes, it is not \npossible to tell if CBS or TBBS were used in the final rubber product. \nIn short, the two chemicals are commercially interchangeable in both \nfunction and use, and therefore, I believe they meet the specified \ncircumstances required under Section 202 of U.S. trade law to receive \nduty drawback benefits based on a substitution basis.\n  More specifically, this bill is extremely important to a West \nVirginia company, Flexsys, that produces both CBS and TBBS, and employs \n230 West Virginians with an average annual salary of $42,000. Passage \nof this bill will preserve these jobs in an increasingly competitive \nchemical market, and will permit American-made products to compete more \neffectively in world markets.\n  Because of the competitive nature of the chemical business, American \ncompanies must constantly look for new opportunities to improve \nefficiency, strengthen U.S. operations and cost position, and provide \nbenefits to their customers. I believe the Congress had these goals in \nmind when we passed the duty drawback provisions in the Customs \nModification Act of 1993. Flexsys meets the conditions set forth under \nthe duty drawback provision that two products must be ``commercially \ninterchangeable'' to claim a drawback credit, and I urge my colleagues \nto adopt this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 827\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF DRAWBACK BASED ON COMMERCIAL \n                   INTERCHANGEABILITY FOR CERTAIN RUBBER \n                   VULCANIZATION ACCELERATORS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The United States Customs Service shall \n     treat the chemical N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide \n     and the chemical N-tert-Butyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide as \n     ``commercially interchangeable'' within the meaning of \n     section 313(j)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \n     1313(j)(2)) for purposes of permitting drawback under section \n     313 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1313).\n       (b) Applicability.--Subsection (a) shall apply with respect \n     to any entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, \n     of the chemical N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide \n     before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act, that \n     is eligible for drawback within the time period provided in \n     section 313(j)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \n     1313(j)(2)(B)).\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to add my name as an original \ncosponsor of the bill introduced by Senator Rockefeller that would \nprovide the necessary authority to implement the trade drawback \nallowance based on the commercially interchangeable feature of two \nrubber vulcanization accelerators.\n  These two chemicals, commonly referred to as CBS and TBBS, are one-\nand-the-same for all practical purposes. CBS and TBBS belong to the \nsame class and subclass of rubber vulcanization accelerator chemicals; \nthey can be manufactured by similar industrial processes using the same \nactive ingredients and identical process steps; and they generally \ncannot be distinguished by informed analysts once used in the finished \nrubber product. In short, CBS and TBBS are commercially interchangeable \nin function and use--the specified circumstances required under Section \n202 of U.S. trade law to receive duty drawback benefits on a \nsubstitution basis.\n  By establishing the commercial interchangeability for CBS and TBBS, \nduty drawback law can be implemented. Under duty drawback law, a \ncompany would receive a refund of import duties--called a duty \ndrawback--paid by that company on its imports of CBS, based on the \nexports of the company's production of TBBS, or vice-versa. In other \nwords, for every ton of TBBS that a company exports out of the United \nStates, the company would receive a refund of duties that it paid on a \nton of CBS that was imported into the United States. A drawback \nallowance on the commercially interchangeable standard is granted on a \ncase-by-case authorization. The bill I join Senator Rockefeller in \ncosponsoring would simply provide the commercially interchangeable CBS \nand TBBS chemicals with the necessary authorization required by law.\n  This bill is vital to a West Virginia company, Flexsys, that produces \nboth CBS and TBBS. Flexsys provides 230 jobs in West Virginia with an \naverage annual salary of $42,000. Without the duty drawback, these jobs \nare at risk due to the increasingly competitive chemical market. The \npurpose of the drawback statutes is to permit American-made products to \ncompete more effectively in world markets. The Congress adopted \ndrawback provisions recognizing that U.S. manufacturers need the \nauthority to enable them to select the most advantageous production \nmethods. Flexsys meets the conditions set forth under drawback law, and \nmy review of Flexsys has convinced me that it is the type of company \nthat was in mind when this Body approved the drawback statutes.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support our effort to aid \nhardworking Americans through passage of this bill. Enactment of this \nbill would fulfill the purpose of drawback law by advancing the \ncontinued operations at Flexsys and, as a result, the utilization of \nAmerican labor and capital.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 828. A bill for the relief of Corina Dechalup; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a private bill \nfor the relief of Corina Dechalup of France. My bill would grant \npermanent resident status to Corina, affording her the legal security \nshe needs to rebuild her life in this country.\n\n  Corina Dechalup first arrived in the United States from France in \nFebruary 1990. She was admitted under the visa waiver pilot program \nafter her then-fiancee Marin Turcinovic of Croatia was injured. \nAdmitted on an H-1 visa in January 1990, Marin was hit by a car in \nFairview, New Jersey in February 1990. Both of his legs were shattered. \nHis spinal cord was severed, leaving him paralyzed below the neck. He \nwill probably never walk again. Both Marin and Corina have been in the \nUnited States since their initial entries.\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\n  Corina and Marin married in February 1996, six years after his \naccident. Corina is an essential part of Marin's life. She has been \nwith Marin throughout his ordeal and has been instrumental in \ncoordinating his medical care. She has directly provided care for \nMarin, and he could never have reached the degree of recovery he now \nenjoys without her support.\n  Marin requires 24-hour medical care for his survival. An insurance \nsettlement from litigation filed after the accident provides Marin with \nlifetime medical and rehabilitative care. Marin and Corina currently \nlive in a specially modified house located in the Beverly community of \nChicago. According to Marin's lawyers, the insurance settlement that \nprovides for Marin's lifetime shelter and medical care would not cover \nhim at another location.\n  Marin was granted permanent resident status on September 30, 1998, \npursuant to former section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nThough he can now file a petition requesting permanent resident status \nfor Corina, she will still face a four to five year wait. Because she \nentered the U.S. under the visa waiver pilot program, she was subject \nto an order of deportation, without the right to an administrative \nhearing, once she overstayed her 90-day authorized admission in \nFebruary 1990. Since 1994, she has received a stay of deportation in \none year increments. She cannot currently travel to see her family in \nFrance, and she has no assurance that her stay will be renewed from one \nyear to the next.\n  Before arriving in the U.S., Corina, a university graduate, worked as \na tour guide for a Yugoslavian tourist agency. Although her days are \nprimarily devoted to Marin, she has the skills and desire to find part-\ntime employment and would like to obtain authorization to work.\n  Mr. President, nine years ago, fate tragically changed forever the \nlives of Corina Dechalup of France and her husband Marin Turcinovic of \nCroatia. A terrible accident in the United States left Marin \npermanently injured, making his return home impossible. Fortunately for \nMarin, he had the love and support of Corina, who left her home and her \nfamily to devote her life to him. Given the tremendous adversity that \nshe faces on a day-to-day basis, I believe it appropriate for Congress \nto grant her permanent resident status. Such status would clear up much \nof the uncertainty that currently clouds her future, and would allow \nCorina and her husband to rebuild their lives in our country with \nconfidence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 828\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Corina Dechalup shall be held and considered to have been \n     lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent \n     residence as of the date of the enactment of this Act upon \n     payment of the required visa fees.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.\n\n       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Corina \n     Dechalup, as provided in this Act, the Secretary of State \n     shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by the \n     appropriate number during the current fiscal year the total \n     number of immigrant visas available to natives of the country \n     of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 829. A bill to deauthorize the project for navigation, Searsport \nHarbor, Searsport, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n          DEAUTHORIZATION AND REALIGNMENT OF SEARSPORT HARBOR\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 830. A bill to deauthorize the project for navigation, Carvers \nHarbor, Vinalhaven, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n           DEAUTHORIZATION AND REALIGNMENT OF CARVERS HARBOR\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills \nthat call for the deauthorization and realignment of harbor boundaries \nin Searsport, Maine and for Carvers Harbor on Vinalhaven Island, Maine. \nPassage of these bills will allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \nissue permits to the Maine Department of Transportation for projects \nthat are vital to the economic well being of the town of Searsport and \nthe island of Vinalhaven.\n  The first bill addresses the deauthorization and realignment of the \nnavigation channel in Searsport Harbor so that the existing cargo pier \ncan be replaced. The bill will allow a multimillion dollar improvement \nto be made to the Mack Point cargo port at the earliest possible date. \nIn addition, a second cargo pier will be rehabilitated. The work will \ninclude new dolphin structures, which will encroach upon the existing \nFederal channel. The navigation project was authorized by the River and \nHarbor Act of October 23, 1962.\n  The second bill deauthorize and realigns Carvers Harbor in Vinalhaven \nso as to allow the construction of a new ferry terminal to replace the \nexisting pier facility that is located within the established Army \nCorps of Engineers anchorage. The deauthorization will allow the ferry \nterminal project to remain on schedule and occur at the earliest \npossible date. The year round population of the island is comprised \nprimarily of lobster fishermen and the businesses that support that \nindustry. This navigation project was authorized by the River and \nHarbor Act of June 3, 1896.\n  Along with my support, both projects have the blessing of the \nrespective towns and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. I am also \nworking with Senator Chafee in the hopes of having these two harbor \ndeauthorizations included in the Managers amendment for the Water \nResources Development Act, which has already passed out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and is expected to be taken up \nby the full Senate shortly.\n  I urge the support of my colleagues for these two deauthorizations \nand I thank the Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 831. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to set \naside up to $2 per person from park entrance fees or assess up to $2 \nper person visiting the Grand Canyon or other national parks to secure \nbonds for capital improvements to the park, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            NATIONAL PARKS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am renewing my efforts to provide \ninnovative solutions to address urgently needed repairs and \nenhancements at our nation's parks. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday is nearly identical to the bill I sponsored in the 105th \nCongress, which received substantial support from many of the \norganizations supporting the National Parks system. I am pleased that \nRepresentative Kolbe will introduce companion legislation in the House.\n  The National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 1999 would help secure \ntaxable revenue bonding authority for National Parks. This legislation \nwould allow private fundraising organizations to enter into agreements \nwith the Secretary of Interior to issue taxable capital development \nbonds. Bond revenues would then be used to finance park improvement \nprojects. The bonds would be secured by an entrance fee surcharge of up \nto $2 per visitor at participating parks, or a set-aside of up to $2 \nper visitor from current entrance fees.\n  Our national park system has enormous capital needs--by last \nestimate, over $3 billion for high-priority projects such as improved \ntransportation systems, trail repairs, visitor facilities, historic \npreservation, and the list goes on and on. The unfortunate reality is \nthat even under the rosiest budget scenarios, our growing park needs \nfar outstrip the resources currently available. Parks are still \nstruggling to address enormous resource and infrastructure needs while \nseeking to improve the park experience to accommodate the increasing \nnumbers of visitors to recreation sites.\n  Revenue bonding would take us a long way toward meeting our needs \nwithin the national park system. For example, based on current \nvisitation rates at the Grand Canyon, a $2 surcharge would enable us to \nraise $100 million from a bond issue amortized\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\nover 20 years. That is a significant amount of money which we could use \nto accomplish many critical park projects.\n  Let me emphasize, however, the Grand Canyon National Park would not \nbe the only park eligible to benefit from this legislation. Any park \nunit with capital needs in excess of $5 million is eligible to \nparticipate. Among eligible parks, the Secretary of Interior will \ndetermine which may take part in the program.\n  I also want to stress that only projects approved as part of a park's \ngeneral management plan can be funded through bond revenue. This \nproviso eliminates any concern that the revenue could be used for \nprojects of questionable value to the park.\n  In addition, only organizations under agreement with the Secretary of \nInterior will be authorized to administer the bonding, so the Secretary \ncan establish any rules or policies he deems necessary and appropriate.\n  Under no circumstances, however, would investors be able to attach \nliens against Federal property in the very unlikely event of default. \nThe bonds will be secured only by the surcharge revenues.\n  Finally, the bill specifies that all professional standards apply and \nthat the issues are subject to the same laws, rules, and regulatory \nenforcement procedures as any other bond issue.\n  The most obvious question raised by this legislation is: Will the \nbond markets support park improvement issues, guaranteed by an entrance \nsurcharge? The answer is an emphatic yes. Bonding is a well-tested tool \nfor the private sector. Additionally, Americans are eager to invest in \nour Nation's natural heritage, and with park visitation growing \nstronger, the risks appear minimal.\n  Are park visitors willing to pay a little more at the entrance gate \nif the money is used for park improvements? Again, I believe the answer \nis yes. Time and time again, visitors have expressed their support for \nincreased fees provided that the revenue is used where collected and \nnot diverted for some other purpose devised by Congress. The National \nPark Service conducted a survey last year which indicated that nearly \n83 percent of participating respondents were satisfied with their paid \nfees, or thought the fees too low.\n  With the fee demonstration program currently being implemented at \nparks around the Nation, an additional $2 surcharge may not be \nnecessary or appropriate at certain parks. Under the bill, those parks \ncould choose to dedicate $2 per park visitor from current entrance fees \ntoward a bond issue. The latest figures from the National Park Service \nindicate that revenues from fees doubled in 1998 to $180 million. This \nlegislation can easily complement the recreational fee program to \nincrease benefits to support our parks and increase the quality of \nAmerica's park experience well into the future.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and National Parks \nsupporters to ensure passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 27--ESTABLISHING THE POLICY OF THE UNITED \n                 STATES TOWARD NATO'S WASHINGTON SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Roth, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Hagel) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 27\n\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will \n     celebrate its fiftieth anniversary at a historic summit \n     meeting in Washington, D.C., commencing on April 23, 1999;\n       Whereas NATO, the only military alliance with both real \n     defense capabilities and a transatlantic membership, has \n     successfully defended the territory and interest of its \n     members over the last 50 years, prevailed in the Cold War, \n     and contributed to the spread of freedom, democracy, \n     stability, and peace throughout Europe;\n       Whereas NATO remains a vital national security interest of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas NATO is currently conducting military operations \n     against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n     Montenegro) to further the objective of a lasting peace in \n     Kosovo;\n       Whereas NATO enhances the security of the United States by \n     embedding European states in a process of cooperative \n     security planning, by preventing the destabilizing \n     renationalization of European military policies, and by \n     ensuring an ongoing and direct leadership role for the United \n     States in European security affairs;\n       Whereas the enlargement of NATO, a defensive alliance, \n     threatens no nation and reinforces peace and stability in \n     Europe, and provides benefits to all nations;\n       Whereas Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that \n     ``any other European state in a position to further the \n     principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security \n     of the North Atlantic area'' is eligible to be granted NATO \n     membership;\n       Whereas the July 1998 communique of the NATO Summit in \n     Madrid reaffirmed that ``NATO remains open to new members \n     under Article X of the North Atlantic Treaty'' and stated \n     that ``the Alliance expects to extend further invitations in \n     coming years to nations willing and able to assume the \n     responsibilities and obligations of membership'';\n       Whereas the accession to NATO by Poland, the Czech \n     Republic, and Hungary will strengthen the military \n     capabilities of NATO, enhance security and stability in \n     Central and Eastern Europe, and thereby advance the interests \n     of the United States and NATO;\n       Whereas Congress has repeatedly endorsed the enlargement of \n     NATO with bipartisan majorities;\n       Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, a multinational \n     body composed of delegations from the member states of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty, has called for NATO to welcome new \n     members through the adoption of Resolution 283 of 1998, \n     entitled ``Recasting Euro-Atlantic Security: Towards the \n     Washington Summit'';\n       Whereas additional democracies of Central and Eastern \n     Europe have applied for NATO membership;\n       Whereas the enlargement of NATO must be a careful, \n     deliberate process with consideration of all security \n     interests;\n       Whereas the selection of new members should depend on \n     NATO's strategic interests, potential threats to security and \n     stability, and actions taken by prospective members to \n     complete the transition to democracy and to harmonize \n     policies with NATO's political, economic, and military \n     guidelines established by the 1995 NATO Study on Enlargement;\n       Whereas NATO must consider and debate the qualifications \n     and potential ramifications of new members on a country-by-\n     country basis;\n       Whereas the accession of Poland, the Czech Republic, and \n     Hungary to NATO is an important step in the post-Cold War era \n     toward a Europe that is truly whole, undivided, free, and at \n     peace and must be complemented by the extension of NATO \n     membership to other qualified democracies of Central and \n     Eastern Europe;\n       Whereas extending NATO membership to other qualified \n     democracies will strengthen NATO, enhance security and \n     stability, deter potential aggressors, and thereby advance \n     the interests of the United States and its NATO allies;\n       Whereas, because participation in missions under Article 4 \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty is not obligatory and each NATO \n     member is free to make an independent decision regarding \n     participation in those missions, the United States and other \n     NATO members are able to decide on the basis of their \n     interests and an independent assessment of the situation \n     whether to participate;\n       Whereas NATO's continued success requires a credible \n     military capability to deter and respond to common threats;\n       Whereas, building on its core capabilities for collective \n     self-defense of its members, NATO will ensure that its \n     military force structure, defense planning, command \n     structures, and force goals promote NATO's capacity to \n     project power when the security of a NATO member is \n     threatened, and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of \n     willing partners among NATO members;\n       Whereas the members of NATO face new threats, including \n     conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from historic, \n     ethnic, and religious enmities, the potential for the \n     reemergence of a hegemonic power confronting Europe, rogue \n     states and nonstate actors possessing weapons of mass \n     destruction, and threats to the wider interests of the NATO \n     members (including the disruption of the flow of vital \n     resources);\n       Whereas this will require that NATO members possess \n     national military capabilities to rapidly deploy forces over \n     long distances, sustain operations for extended periods of \n     time, and operate jointly with the United States in high \n     intensity conflicts; and\n       Whereas the principal effect of upgraded capabilities for \n     NATO members to operate ``out of area'' with force \n     improvements for power projection will be to make NATO \n     members more effective American partners in supporting mutual \n     interests around the globe: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That (a) Congress--\n       (1) regards the political independence and territorial \n     integrity of the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern \n     Europe as vital to European peace and security and, thus, to \n     the interests of the United States;\n       (2) endorses the commitment of the North Atlantic Council \n     that NATO will remain open to the accession of further \n     members in accordance with Article 10 of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty;\n       (3) believes all NATO members should commit to improving \n     their respective defense capabilities so that NATO can \n     project power decisively within and outside NATO borders in a \n     manner that achieves transatlantic parity in power projection \n     capabilities and facilitates equitable burdensharing among \n     NATO members; and\n       (4) believes that NATO should prepare more vigorously to \n     defend itself against future threats and to expand its \n     primary defensive focus beyond its previous concentration on \n     threats to the east.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the North Atlantic Council should pace, not pause, the \n     process of NATO enlargement by extending the invitation of \n     membership to those states able to meet the guidelines \n     established by the 1995 NATO Study on Enlargement and should \n     do so on a country-by-country basis;\n       (2) the North Atlantic Council in the course of the 1999 \n     Washington Summit should initiate a formal review of all \n     pending applications for NATO membership in order to \n     establish the degree to which such applications conform to \n     the guidelines for membership established by the 1995 NATO \n     Study on Enlargement;\n       (3) the results of this formal review should be presented \n     to the membership of the North Atlantic Council in May 2000 \n     with recommendations concerning enlargement;\n       (4) NATO should continue to assess potential applicants for \n     NATO membership on a continuous basis; and\n       (5) the President, the Secretary of State, and the \n     Secretary of Defense should fully use their offices to \n     encourage the NATO allies of the United States to commit the \n     resources necessary to upgrade their capabilities to rapidly \n     deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for \n     extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the United \n     States in high intensity conflicts, thus making them \n     effective American partners in supporting mutual interests.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, later this week NATO will honor its \n50th anniversary at a Summit here in Washington, D.C. The leaders of \nthe 19 NATO member nations and the heads of state of many Partnership-\nfor-Peace participants will participate in meetings to discuss the \nsuccesses of the NATO Alliance and its future in the post-Cold War \nworld.\n  The more distant we become from the days of the fall of the Berlin \nWall and the collapse of communism, the clearer it becomes that we have \nentered a new era. But dangers still abound in post-Cold War Europe. \nThe ongoing conflict in Kosovo is a stark reminder that threats to the \nsecurity of NATO's members still exist. The revolutions of 1989 not \nonly led to the collapse of communism but also to the end of the peace \norders established after two world wars. What is at stake today is \norder and stability in Europe as a whole. And that is why American \ninterests are involved.\n  Mr. President, NATO cannot by itself solve all of Europe's problems. \nBut without a stable security framework, we run the risk that reform \nand democracy in Eastern Europe will not persist but will instead be \nundercut by destructive forces of nationalism and insecurity. The \nfailure of democracy in the East could not help but have profound \nconsequences for democracy in the continent's western half as well.\n  The resolution that I submit today on behalf of Senators Roth, Lott, \nLieberman, DeWine, Voinovich, and Hagel sets forth three goals for the \nUnited States to achieve in discussions over the future of the NATO \nAlliance: (1) the enforcement of Article 10 of the Washington Treaty to \nremain open to the accession of additional members and a formal review \nof all applications for memberships; (2) expansion of the primary focus \nbeyond threats from the east; and (3) the upgrading of our allies' \nability to project power and to operate ``out of area.''\n  NATO's ``open door'' policy toward new members established by Article \n10 of the Washington Treaty, has given countries of Central and Eastern \nEurope the incentive to accelerate reforms, to peacefully settle \ndisputes with neighbors, and to increase regional cooperation. Hopes of \nfuture membership in NATO has been a tremendous driving force of \ndemocratization and peace in Eastern and Central Europe including \nformer Warsaw Pact nations.\n  To retract the ``open-door'' policy, as some have suggested, would \nrisk undermining the tremendous gains that have been made across the \nregion. The result of a ``closed-door'' policy would be the creation of \nnew dividing lines across Europe. Those nations outside might become \ndisillusioned and insecure and thus inclined to adopt the competitive \nand destabilizing security policies of Europe's past.\n  NATO's decision to enlarge in stages recognizes that not all new \ndemocracies and applicants in Europe are equally ready or willing to be \nsecurity allies. Some states may never be ready.\n  The selection of future NATO members should depend on: (1) a \ndetermination by NATO members of their strategic interests; (2) NATO's \nperception of threats to security and stability; and (3) actions taken \nby prospective members to complete their democratic transitions and to \nharmonize their policies with NATO's political aims and security \npolicies.\n  To reinforce the benefits of Article X, I believe a comprehensive \nreview of the qualifications of the nine current applicant countries \nshould be conducted under the guidelines laid out in the 1995 NATO \nStudy on Enlargement. A review of this type would further demonstrate \nthat NATO is actively considering a continuation of the enlargement \nprocess. Some believe that the Alliance is not interested in further \nenlargement; a formal review of the type I am suggesting would go far \nin reassuring NATO and non-NATO states of the Alliance's plans. \nFurthermore, a review would provide NATO aspirants with additional \nincentive to continue democratic, economic and military reforms. This \nis in the national security interests of the United States and NATO and \nshould be encouraged.\n  These actions would also serve to clarify the security expectations \nof non-NATO members. It would make clear that it is the intention of \nthe United States that NATO remain a serious defensive military \nalliance and not slip into a loose collective security society. It \nwould suggest that enlargement will be a careful, deliberate process, \nwith consideration of all security interests. Finally, it would draw \nagain on the principle of reciprocity, both to encourage prospective \nmembers to align themselves with NATO's values and policies and to \nsignal that threats levied against would-be members will be \ncounterproductive.\n  A second goal enunciated in this resolution concerns the need to \nbroaden NATO's focus. For nearly 50 years, NATO was oriented and \norganized to defend and respond to an attack from the East. An invasion \nby Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces was the primary threat facing the \nAlliance. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, new threats have \nreplaced the nightmare of Soviet armored divisions crashing through the \nFulda Gap. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, rogue \nstates, terrorism, ethnic strife, and other potentially destabilizing \nelements now threaten the Alliance.\n  It is a basic American interest that the Alliance not only enlarge to \nhelp stabilize Eastern Europe but that enlargement be part and parcel \nof a broader transformation that turns Europe into an increasingly \neffective strategic partner of the United States in and beyond the \ncontinent.\n  I believe this includes an improvement in the ability for NATO to \noperate outside the borders of its members. This is not a new mission. \nThe potential for these types of endeavors has been present since \nNATO's inception. The true core of NATO has always been \ncollective defense, but Article 4 of the Washington Treaty suggests \nthat NATO will consult and can act if the security of any of the \nParties is threatened. This interpretation was reinforced by John \nFoster Dulles in May 1949 during Senate consideration of the Washington \nTreaty. Secretary of State Dulles testified that the occasions for \nconsultation under Article 4 are not merely attacks in the Atlantic \narea dealt with by Article 5, but threats anywhere to any of the \nparties since the parties have interests and possessions throughout the \nworld. So we are not talking about new NATO responsibilities; these \ntypes of actions were considered by the members of the Alliance and are \nsupported by language in the treaty ratified by the Senate in 1949.\n\n  It is important to remember that participation in non-Article 5 \nmissions is not obligatory and each NATO member is free to make an \nindependent decision regarding participation in those missions. The \nUnited States and other NATO members are able to decide on the basis of \ntheir interests and an independent assessment of the situation whether \nto participate. This is as it should be.\n  A third goal set forth in this resolution deals with NATO members' \ncapabilities. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact have \naltered the strategic and military landscape in which NATO forces will \noperate in the future. The potential for massive tank battles over the \nplains of Central Europe has been reduced. Instead military strategists \nbelieve the conflicts of the 21st century will require NATO members to \nrapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for \nextended periods of time and operate jointly with the United States in \nhigh intensity conflicts.\n  NATO developed a truly credible capability to defend itself from \nthreats emanating from Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. But \nour allies have not moved far enough or fast enough to improve their \ncapabilities to defend against newly emerging threats. In many cases \nthese threats cannot be readily distinguished as either Article 5 or \nArticle 4.\n  Today NATO faces threats to its southern borders and forces. For \nexample, Turkey's borders are directly threatened by rogue states to \nits south. NATO has a credible plan to reinforce Turkey in the event of \nhostilities. Unfortunately, this plan relies heavily on\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\nU.S. forces. If the U.S. were unable to provide the military apparatus \nnecessary to implement this plan because of its involvement in \noperations elsewhere, the reinforcement blueprint would be in jeopardy. \nEuropean forces lack serious power projection capabilities for \ndemanding Article 5 missions, in addition to the potential for meeting \nArticle 4 contingencies.\n  We must maintain and improve NATO's military force capability to \nrespond to all conceivable missions. Our goal must be to enlarge NATO \nby enhancing NATO's strategic strength and military effectiveness. The \nneed for improved European power projection capability becomes self-\nevident when one considers that the U.S. currently contributes only \nabout 20% of NATO's total conventional forces, but provides about 80% \nof NATO's usable military capability for power projection missions.\n  We must reconfigure NATO to deal with the threats of the 21st century \nby requiring improved allied power projection forces for operating in a \nseamless web of situations including within NATO's enlarging borders, \ninside Europe including on its periphery, and outside Europe when the \nAlliance's vital interests are at stake.\n  The U.S. Government must demand rough trans-Atlantic parity in power \nprojection capabilities and we must not settle for less. NATO is the \nonly institution capable of building these necessary force structures. \nNATO's 50th Anniversary provides an opportunity for the Administration \nto press our European allies on these issues and call for a more \nequitable burden-sharing arrangement in power projection capabilities.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the Summit cannot proceed with the \nagenda that was envisioned prior to the commencement of military \noperations in Kosovo. However, it does provide the United States with \nan opportunity to raise the key issues that will determine the ability \nof NATO to serve as the premiere U.S. and European security \narchitecture for the 21st century. That is the primary reason we have \nset forth these major Alliance goals in our resolution.\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that, because of Kosovo, we \nshould delay or postpone these important discussions. I do not agree. \nThe Alliance must revise NATO's Strategic Concept and military \nstructure to make NATO both more politically and militarily relevant to \npost-Cold War security issues. This is an outstanding opportunity to \nensure that NATO continues to meet the security needs of all of its \nmembers states, including the U.S. A pause or delay will simply \npostpone necessary revisions to the current Strategic Concept, a \nconcept that was adopted in 1990 while the Soviet Union was still in \nexistence.\n  We must move ahead. The Alliance must not allow Serbian President \nMilosevic to derail NATO's important work. It is my hope that the \nAdministration will be able to work with our Allies to produce a \nStrategic Concept able to meet the security needs of the U.S. and our \nallies in the 21st century. That should be our primary objective of the \nSummit; that is the primary objective of this Resolution.\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I wish to briefly comment on the \nresolution that my colleague from Indiana and I, the majority leader, \nand others have just introduced.\n  This weekend the NATO Alliance will hold a summit meeting here in \nWashington. That summit will be dominated by the conflict in Kosovo, \nand that is to be expected as so much is at stake.\n  Should the Alliance emerge defeated from this conflict, it would \nsignal that dictatorship and atrocity can lead to political survival in \npost-Cold War Europe. NATO's defeat by a bloody regime that controls no \nmore territory than the state of Kentucky would signal NATO's \nirrelevance. It would mark the decay of the transatlantic order of \ndemocracy, human rights, and security that NATO spent the last five \ndecades defending and promoting.\n  For these grave reasons, the Kosovo crisis underscores how vital NATO \nis today to the values and interests we share with our European allies. \nAt stake in this conflict is more than Balkan peace and stability, but \nalso the prospects of a transatlantic partnership based on a Europe \nthat is undivided, democratic, and secure.\n  However significant and immediate the Kosovo issue may be, NATO's \nleaders cannot allow it to obscure two other critical issues that will \nsignificantly shape NATO's future as the cornerstone of Euro-Atlantic \nsecurity. These are the revisions to NATO's Strategic Concept the \nAlliance intends to codify at this summit and the next phase of NATO \nenlargement.\n  Mr. President, NATO's Strategic Concept is a public document that \ndefines the threats and opportunities that lie before the Alliance's \ninterests and values. It defines the political and military roles and \nmissions the Alliance must undertake to protect and promote those \ninterests and values. From this important document are derived the \nresources Alliance members commit to the implementation of this \nstrategy. It is a critically important document, one whose revision \nmust be taken with great care.\n  Two Strategic Concept issues that right now appear unresolved prior \nto this summit and that should be of great concern to us are NATO's \nrelationship with the United Nations and the future of the European \nSecurity and Defense Identity (ESDI).\n  There are still today Allies who wish to require NATO to attain a UN \nor a OSCE mandate prior to undertaking out-of-area military actions. I \ncannot think of a more destructive poison pill for the Alliance. A UN \nmandate would give non-NATO countries, such as Russia and China, a veto \nover Alliance decisions. We must not forget that NATO was established \nin 1949 to overcome the inability of the United Nations to act \ndecisively in the face of danger, threats, and conflagration. We need \nonly to look back to the UN's role in the former Yugoslavia this decide \nto be reminded of the grave limitations of this institution. If there \nis one thing that new Strategic Concept must not do, it is to constrict \nNATO freedom to act by subjecting it to the decisions of other \norganizations. NATO must preserve its freedom to act.\n  Second, the Alliance's new Strategic Concept must continue the \nprocess toward a viable ESDI within the framework of the Washington \nTreaty. Allied leaders should focus on developing better European \nmilitary capabilities within NATO. The resolution we introduce today \nunderscores this point by calling upon our European Allies to acquire \nbetter capability to ``rapidly deploy forces over long distances, \nsustain operations for extended periods of time and operate jointly \nwith the United States in high intensity conflicts.'' The Alliance must \nnot only be able to project power decisively within and outside NATO \nborders; it must be able to do so in a manner that features \ntransatlantic parity in power projection capabilities.\n  Mr. President, let me add one more point on this matter. Over the \nlast half decade NATO has restructured its command structure to afford \nit greater operational flexibility. The establishment of Combined Joint \nTask Forces (CJTF), one of the most important reforms, will enable \nEuropean Allies to utilize Alliance assets for operations of a \ndistincity European character. Europe's key to maximizing the potential \nof these reforms is the development of better military capabilities. It \nis through capability--not rhetoric--that our Allies can put a final \nend to the often acrimonious debates over burden-sharing, and at the \nsame time allow them to more effectively address security challenges of \ndistincity European concern.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, the issue of NATO enlargement. How the \nWashington Summit manages the next phase of enlargement will determine \nwhether this meeting strengthens or undermines the dream for a Europe \nthat is free, secure, and undivided. If the process of NATO enlargement \nis clearly advanced, the summit will reinforce the prospects for \nenduring peace and stability in post-Cold War Europe.\n  Article Ten of the Washington Treaty, which established the NATO \nAlliance in 1949, articulates the Alliance's vision of a united Europe. \nIt states that NATO is open to ``any other European state in a position \nto further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the \nsecurity of the North Atlantic area.'' In 1995 the Alliance defined \nthrough its Study on Enlargement the political, military, and foreign \npolicy guidelines to direct enlargement in the post-Cold War era.\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\nThese include a commitment to democracy, the resolution of disputes \nwith neighbors, and the ability to contribute to the Alliance's roles \nand missions, including collective defense.\n  Based on these guidelines, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary \nwere invited to join the Alliance. Their accession on March 12 \nstrengthened the Alliance and marked the first step in the elimination \nof the divisive and destablizing vestiges, not only of the Cold War, \nbut of the era preceding World War II.\n  The Washington Summit must not only celebrate the first round of NATO \nenlargement, it must decisively press the process forward. Toward that \nend, I believe that NATO should invite Solvenia and any other qualified \nNATO European applicant to accession negotiations. Recently, at my \nrequest, the Congressional Research Service examined the nine European \nstates that have applied for NATO membership. This study clearly \nrevealed that Slovenia not only meets NATO's own guidelines, it \nsurpasses some of the economic and military standards set by the \nAlliance's three newest members.\n  An invitation to Slovenia would demonstrate to the other democracies \nof Central Europe that NATO remains genuinely committed to its ``Open \nDoor Policy''--proof that would reinforce their commitment to \ndemocratic and economic reform and the Alliance's Partnership for Peace \nprogram.\n  Above all, it would help ensure that enlargement becomes a \ncontinuous, not a convulsive, process. The momentum generated by the \nfirst round of enlargement would be sustained. In contrast, if \nenlargement is subject to pauses of undefined and indefinite duration, \neach succeeding round will be more difficult to initiate and complete. \nEnlargement would less likely be seen and appreciated as a normal \ndynamic of post-Cold War Europe.\n  In the absence of new invitations at the Summit, it will be a \nchallenge for NATO to sustain the credibility of its Open Door Policy. \nThe Alliance must not step back to the theme of its 1994 Summit in \nBrussels: ``NATO enlargement is not a matter of if, but when.'' This \nApril, such an open-ended ``when'' would ring especially hollow.\n  For this reason, NATO cannot simply retierate longstanding promises; \nit must yield a process. Herein lies an important recommendation \npresented by our resolution on the issue of NATO enlargement.\n  It calls upon Alliance leaders to instruct the NATO International \nStaff to conduct a comprehensive and transparent review of the nine \napplicant countries in terms of the guidelines articulated in its 1995 \nstudy. (Such a review should not be confused with discrete annual \nreviews currently being considered for each applicant.) This \ncomprehensive review should be presented, with recommendations, to a \nNorth Atlantic Council meeting of ministers or heads of state no later \nthan May 2000.\n  While this review should complement new NATO invitations, even \nstanding alone it offers the following advantages:\n  The Alliance would demonstrate that it is actively engaged in an \nongoing enlargement process. It would deflect suspicions that the \nAlliance is camouflaging its unwillingness for further enlargement \nbehind the generosity of more financial and material assistance. A \nreview is more than words, it is action.\n  A review would not bind the Alliance to ``automaticity'' in that it \ndoes not commit the Alliance to issue new invitations in 2000. The \nreview would, however, probably highlight the fact that one or more \napplicant countries have met the grade.\n  It would underscore that NATO stands by the guidelines established in \nthe 1995 Study on Enlargement. That would encourage the applicant \nstates to continue, if not accelerate, the democratic, military, and \neconomic reforms and regional cooperation requisite for NATO \nmembership.\n  NATO enlargement must also be a central component of NATO's new \nStrategic Concept, the document that will define the Alliance's roles \nand missions for the next century. It inclusion will not only \ncommunicate commitment, it will help institutionalize enlargement as a \nplanning priority of the Alliance.\n  NATO enlargement is not an act of altruism; it is an act of self-\ninterest. It is a process motivated by the dream of an undivided \nEurope, the stability that would come to the Euro-Atlantic community, \nand the capabilities new members would yield the Alliance. It is a \npolicy guided by objective political, economic and military criteria.\n  Each of these enlargement steps outlined above, an invitation to \nSlovenia, a comprehensive review process, and an emphasis in the \nAlliance's game plan for the future, will ensure that the Washington \nSummit is remembered for revitalizing the dream of a Europe, whole, \nfree, and undivided.\n  Mr. President, history will judge this week's NATO Summit not only \nfor how it handles the crisis in Kovoso, but also for the strategy that \nit lays out for its future. Kosovo, the new Strategic Concept, and \nenlargement present a challenging agenda at a very trying time. Yet, I \nremain confident this Alliance has the potential to address each of \nthese issues in a manner that will ensure that NATO becomes an even \nmore capable and effective promoter of a transatlantic partnership that \nfeatures a strong, undivided and democratic Europe. It is toward this \nvision that we introduce this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to \nlend their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url":

Mr. President, today I am joining my good friend \nfrom New York, Senator Moynihan, as a cosponsor of his bill to limit \ncivil actions against a sitting President. The Supreme Court may have \nbeen right in its analysis in Clinton v. Jones that the separation of \npowers doctrine does not require immunity from civil suit for a sitting \nPresident, but it was wrong when it concluded that ``a deluge of such \nlitigation will never engulf the Presidency,'' and when it went on to \nassert, ``if properly managed by the District Court, it appears to us \nhighly unlikely [for the Paula Jones civil suit] to occupy any \nsubstantial amount of petitioner's time.''\n  No one can reasonably believe that President Clinton didn't spend a \nsignificant amount of his time preparing his defense in the Paula Jones \ncase. Moreover, we can all understand how the existence of such a case \ncan be a significant distraction and preoccupation even when it is not \nbeing worked on directly.\n  The Supreme Court recognized in its decision in Clinton v. Jones the \nall-consuming nature of the responsibilities of being President of the \nUnited States. The Court wrote:\n\n       ``As a starting premise, petitioner [the President] \n     contends that he occupies a unique office with powers and \n     responsibilities so vast and important that the public \n     interest demands that he devote his undivided time and \n     attention to his public duties . . . We have no dispute with \n     the initial premise of the argument. Former presidents, from \n     George Washington to George Bush, have consistently endorsed \n     petitioner's characterization of the office. After serving \n     his term, Lyndon Johnson observed: ``Of all the 1,886 nights \n     I was President, there were not many when I got to sleep \n     before 1 or 2 A.M., and there were few mornings when I didn't \n     wake up by 6 or 6:30.''\n\n  Being President of the United States is a 24 hour a day job. That's \nboth necessary and desirable. To allow the President to be sued for \nmatters arising from acts committed prior to his taking office makes \nthe President vulnerable to mischievous, possibly politically-motivated \nand time-consuming litigation. As the leader of our country and the \nmost important political leader in the world, I don't want the \nPresident's attention diverted from the many important and \nconsequential responsibilities of the office to defend against lawsuits \nbased on allegations of conduct before the President ran for office and \nwhich could have therefore been filed prior to his taking office. \nThat's why I support limiting the involvement of sitting Presidents in \ncivil litigation.\n  Senator Moynihan has taken the first step in addressing this problem. \nHis bill would bar the President from participating in any civil trial \ninvolving the President as plaintiff or defendant but would permit \ndiscovery to the extent it is carried out with ``due deference to \nPresidential responsibilities'' and using ``reasonable case management \nprinciples.'' The bill would allow a civil suit to be filed and limited \ndiscovery to occur, but would not allow a President to proceed to trial \nas either a plaintiff or defendant. Senator Moynihan has made a \nthoughtful proposal. However, I prefer that the bill be limited to only \nthose civil cases brought with respect to matters that occurred before \nthe President assumed office or before the President participated in \nthe general election; I would not want to affect cases brought against \nPresidents for actions they have taken while President in their \nofficial capacity. There are a significant number of cases against \nevery President for actions taken during their term in office, and I \ndon't believe we can or should immunize the President from those types \nof cases. For example, President Truman was sued when he seized the \nsteel plants. President Carter was sued over his decision to return the \nPanama Canal to Panama. President Reagan was sued regarding the role of \nAmerica in El Salvador, and President Bush was sued for various matters \nrelating to the Persian Gulf War. I am not commenting on the validity \nof these suits, I am only saying that such suits should not be \ndisallowed since they are brought against the President in his or her \nofficial capacity and they are handled not by the President but by the \nDepartment of Justice and White House Legal Counsel. Another class of \ncases that should be permitted while a President is in office are \ndomestic cases--those related to or involving personal family \nrelationships such as the resolution of a will or an estate or child \nsupport.\n  The Supreme Court reported that only three sitting Presidents have \nbeen defendants in civil suits involving their actions prior to taking \noffice. These were Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman whose cases were \ndismissed before they took office, and John F. Kennedy, whose case was \nsettled once he took office. Given the increasing litigious nature of \nour society, we cannot rely on this history to project what may happen \nin the future. And given the recent experience of President Clinton and \nthe Paula Jones case, we know the enormous consequences just one such \ncase can have.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Moynihan on this legislation \nand to getting it enacted in this Congress, before the next President \ntakes office in the year 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3862-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3862-S3863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MR. GERALD T. HALPIN\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'd like to use this occasion to \nhonor a long-time friend, Mr. Gerald T. Halpin, who has shown that \neconomic prosperity can go hand-in-hand with public service. Jerry \nHalpin is the Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\nWEST*GROUP, a commercial real estate company based in McLean, Virginia, \nand he was recently honored as the 1998 Fairfax County Citizen of the \nYear by the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens Associations and \n``The Washington Post.'' Jerry Halpin deserves this recognition, not \njust because he changed the face of Fairfax County as a visionary \nbusinessman, but also because of his vast record of quiet and selfless \ncommunity leadership.\n  Anyone who is familiar with Northern Virginia is also familiar with \nJerry Halpin's business accomplishments, although not everyone knows \nthe full range of this self-effacing, public-spirited citizen's \ncontributions to our community. In 1962, Jerry and three partners \npurchased a 125-acre farm on the crest of a hill in western Fairfax. On \nthat crest he built Tysons Corner, which remains to this day one of the \nprimary commercial centers in the entire region. His WEST*GROUP \nproperties dot the area, and he has been responsible for the \ndevelopment, redevelopment or construction of office, retail, \nresidential, resort, and industrial space for WEST*GROUP affiliates \naggregating more than 12 million square feet.\n  In the midst of this time-consuming and successful business career, \nhowever, Jerry Halpin made the time to reinvest in his community. His \nspecific contributions to this region are far too numerous to mention, \nalthough I would like to highlight a few. Thirty-five years ago, when \nthe Fairfax County Park Authority was unable to secure sufficient funds \nto purchase land for a park site, he refinanced his home to cover the \npurchase price and then turned the land over to the Park Authority. \nToday, that land constitutes Burke Lake Park, one of Fairfax County's \nfinest public recreation areas. As he was developing the WEST*GATE and \nWEST*PARK Office Parks in Tysons Corner, Jerry ensured that a net gain \nof trees existed after construction and donated land for a school, a \nball park and transit stations. He played a major role in the purchase \nof various structures for Wolf Trap Farm Park, one of the finest \nfacilities in the area, and dedicated substantial time to the Park as \nan early Trustee, Executive Committee Co-Chairman and Finance Committee \nChairman of the Wolf Trap Foundation. On a more personal scale, Jerry \nwas also involved in the landscaping of Trinity United Methodist Church \nand the Churchill Road Elementary School playground, both in McLean. A \ncommon thread runs through these disparate projects. Knowing him as I \ndo, I am convinced that Jerry undertook each, not to advance his \npersonal ambitions, but to promote the public interest. That's why many \nwho live in the region are familiar with Jerry's commercial work but \nare less familiar with his public works. That is because Jerry is not a \nself-promoter, and I know he did not seek the honor that was bestowed \nupon him by the Federation of Citizens Associations. I am glad, \nhowever, that his selflessness has been recognized, not so much because \nJerry needs awards, but because he provides the community with such a \npositive role model.\n  Despite his many years of work and service, Jerry Halpin is still \ngoing strong. He currently serves as Chairman of the Grand Teton \nNational Park Foundation, as a Director of the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation, and as a Director and Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for the National Capital Bicentennial Celebration. These \ncurrent activities build on many in the past, such as his service with \nthe American Horticultural Society, the American Museum of Immigration, \nthe National Parks and Recreation Association, the Virginia Museum of \nScience, the Boarder Baby Project Gala, and the Medical Care for \nChildren Partnership Awards Dinner. Jerry has also volunteered his time \nand leadership skills to many charitable organizations including the \nMcLean Project for the Arts, United Community Ministries, the Claude \nMoore Colonial Farm, Hospice of Northern Virginia, Fairfax Hospital and \nNorthern Virginia Community College.\n  Jerry's civic participation has extended to various public boards and \ncommissions. During my term as Governor of Virginia, I appointed him to \nthe Governor's Task Force on Science and Technology and to the \nGovernor's Joint Study Committee to inquire into the practicality of \ncreating a Coal Slurry Pipeline in Virginia. Jerry served as a member \nof the Governor's Advisory Board on Industrial Development under \nGovernors Holton, Godwin and Dalton. He was also a member of the \nFairfax County Economic Development Authority and its predecessor \norganizations for over eight years.\n  Jerry Halpin has been a personal friend of mine for many years now. \nFor over forty years, he has provided community leadership not only for \nFairfax County, but to all of Northern Virginia and the Washington D.C. \nmetropolitan area. The Fairfax County Federation of Citizens \nAssociations and ``The Washington Post'' could not have selected anyone \nmore deserving than Jerry Halpin to be the 1998 Fairfax County Citizen \nof the Year. George Hartzog, the former Director of the National Park \nService, has called Jerry a ``treasure to mankind''--I couldn't have \nsaid it better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3863-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3863-S3864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE ``STEPS AHEAD'' PROGRAM IN SEATTLE, WA\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during this past recess, I had the \npleasure of presenting my Innovation in Education Awards to two \nexcellent recipients, one of which I would like to recognize now.\n  One award was given to the ``Steps Ahead'' program from ``Community \nfor Youth.'' Community for Youth is a local non-profit organization in \nSeattle whose Steps Ahead program provides adult mentors to youth at \nrisk of academic or social failure. This program has been in existence \nfor eight years and has demonstrated remarkable progress in \ntransforming the lives of students who might otherwise fall through the \ncracks of our education system.\n  Steps Ahead's curriculum focuses on five key factors for student \nbehavior: (1) Building a positive self-image, (2) Expressing themselves \nassertively rather than passively or aggressively, (3) Accepting \nresponsibility for their behavior rather than making excuses, (4) \nSetting and keeping realistic goals in life and (5) Making conscious \ndecisions to solve problems rather than reactively letting the world \npass them by. These may seem like exceedingly basic principles but, \nthis focus has reaped great rewards with the students it has reached.\n  The students involved in this program have, for whatever reason been \nlabeled as ``at-risk.'' Fortunately, through the simple concept of \nrestoring self-respect, accountability, and confidence, the Steps Ahead \nprogram has achieved outstanding results. Steps Ahead participants have \nfewer dropouts and fewer expulsions from school than their peers. The \nSteps Ahead students also have ten percent better classroom attendance, \ntwenty-five percent fewer grades, and fifteen percent fewer dropouts, \nexpulsions and long term suspensions--all this is the heart of \nmetropolitan Seattle where the escourge of dropouts rates, poor \nattendance, and violent behavioral problems have traditionally been \nsome of the worst in Washington state.\n  Community for Youth's efforts thought the Steps Ahead program is just \none piece of the puzzle of trying to improve the lives and education of \ntroubled youth. More importantly, perhaps, Steps Ahead has accomplished \nthese feats by teaming up with local business to provide funding and \nmentors and by teaming up with the Seattle School District to target \nschool populations most in need of mentoring. This type of common-sense \nand community-oriented approach to solving a difficult education \nproblem demonstrates the exact reason why I began this Innovation in \nEducation Award program.\n  I think any of my colleagues would be hard pressed to prove the kind \nof program I am talking about here today could come from the innovation \nof a bureaucrat here in Washington, DC. Rather, it is the hard work of \nthe people that look into the eyes of our children every day, the \nparents, the teachers, the school administrators, and the volunteers \nlike those at Steps Ahead, who make a difference in the lives of our \nchildren.\n  I am pleased to have been able to recognize Steps Ahead and Community \nFor Youth with an Innovation in Education Award. They represent the\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\nideals in education that deserve our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3864-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRUE AMERICAN HEROES: A SALUTE TO BOYD CLINES, LARRY ROGERS, AND MATT \n  MOSELEY FOR THEIR BRAVERY AND COURAGE IN THE APRIL 12, 1999 DARING \n                          RESCUE OF IVERS SIMS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and \nsalute the heroism and bravery displayed during the brave and daring \nrescue of Ivers Sims by Atlanta firefighter Matt Moseley, Georgia \nDepartment of Natural Resources pilot Boyd Clines, and his navigator, \nLarry Rogers on April 12, 1999.\n  Many Americans watched this frightening drama unfold on television, \nand all prayed for a successful and joyous rescue. Last Monday \nafternoon, as members of the Atlanta City Fire Department fought a \nraging fire throughout the historic Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill in \nsoutheast Atlanta, Ivers Sims, a construction worker, found himself \ntrapped on top of a swaying, 250-foot crane above the raging fire that \nhad erupted in the mill. Boyd Clines and Larry Rogers arrived on the \nscene and miraculously negotiated their helicopter through the menacing \nwind, smoke, and fire which emanated from the cotton mill, while \nAtlanta firefighter, Matt Moseley, dangled from a rope near the \nflames--all working together to save the life of Mr. Sims.\n  Thanks to dedicated teamwork, amazing heroism, courage and valor in \nrisking their own lives, these three brave men rescued Ivers Sims from \nabove the flames, and moments later, all four safely returned to the \nground. When I think of these three heroic Americans and their brave \nactions I am reminded of the words of Theodore Roosevelt who once said, \n``Americanism means the virtues of courage, honor, justice, truth, \nsincerity, and hardihood--the virtues that made America.'' These three \nmen have brought pride and honor to the State of Georgia and to the \nentire Nation. Boyd, Larry and Matt are true examples of the courage, \nhonor, justice, truth, sincerity, and hardihood that this Nation is \nbuilt upon, and are indeed great Americans!\n  I would like to salute all Atlanta firefighters, police officers and \nSheriffs deputies who diligently worked together in order to fight the \nmassive fire that engulfed the historic cotton mill. I would also like \nto praise the fire fighters throughout the Nation who, like Matt \nMoseley, put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve our \ncommunities. Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in \nrecognizing and honoring the heroism and bravery displayed by Boyd \nClines, Larry Rogers, and Matt Moseley under the most dangerous of \ncircumstances in saving the life of Ivers Sims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3864-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING SCITUATE HIGH SCHOOL FOR ITS FIRST PLACE FINISH IN THE \n    ``WE THE PEOPLE . . .

Mr. President, on May 1st, fifteen outstanding \nstudents from Scituate High School in Rhode Island will visit \nWashington to begin their competition in the national finals of the \n``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program.\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with it, the ``We the \nPeople . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program is among the \nmost extensive educational programs in the country focusing on \ncitizenship. The program was developed specifically to ensure that \nyoung people understand the history and philosophy of the Constitution \nand the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing in which students are given the opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on historical and contemporary constitutional issues.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We the People . \n. . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program provides an excellent \nopportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the \nsignificance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history. It \nis heartwarming to see young Rhode Islanders taking such an active and \nparticipatory interest in public affairs.\n  I am very proud of Philip Amylon, Matthew Bilotti, Caitlin Bouchard, \nJessica Bradbury, Kathleen Burdett, Jacqueline Gallo, Christopher \nGranatino, Thomas Hynes, Carolyn Jacobs, Danielle Lachance, Catherine \nMoser, Ross Mtangi, Christopher Natalizia, Ian Noonan, and Christina \nRossi for making it to the national finals. I applaud this terrific \ngroup of young men and women for their hard work and perseverance. \nAlso, Mr. President, I want to congratulate Amy Grundt, a fine teacher \nwho deserves so much credit for guiding the Scituate High School team \nto the national finals.\n  Congratulations to Ms. Grundt and her students for what they have \nalready achieved, and best of luck in the final competition. These \nstudents, with the guidance of Ms. Gundt, have learned what our Nation \nis all about and what countless men and women have fought and died to \nprotect. No matter what the outcome of the contest is, they have each \nearned the greatest prize of all: knowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3864-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN HOLM OF THE FLORIDA ORCHESTRA\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to offer a tribute to an \noutstanding Floridian and a premier musician, Ms. Kathryn Holm, of The \nFlorida Orchestra, will be recognized this evening at the Kennedy \nCenter for the Performing Arts as ``Arts Administrator of the Year.''\n  As we prepare to begin a new millennium, we must remember that a key \nindicator of the health and well-being of any society has always been \nits treatment of the arts. Our society is one which admires its \nartists, and Ms. Holm has spent her career providing a basis for our \nreverence of music, working with The Florida Orchestra to transform \nsounds into majestic expressions.\n  Kathryn Holm joined The Florida Orchestra as a principal harpist in \n1977. Some 17 years later, she was named executive of the orchestra, \nwhich was, at the time, heavily in debt.\n  Combining her musical talent with her business acumen, she was able \nto restore fiscal solvency to The Florida Orchestra. Her effective \nthree-stage recovery plan earned Kathryn Holm the ``Jessie Ball DuPont \nTurnaround Award,'' while restoring credibility to the orchestra. Now \nin its fourth consecutive year without operating losses, The Florida \nOrchestra has boosted ticket sales, sponsorships and donations, and \nreleased its first compact disc.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to join the art world in applauding the \nleadership of Kathryn Holm on this special day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3864-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3864-S3865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING PEGGY O'NEILL-SKINNER FROM THE BUSH SCHOOL, SEATTLE, WA\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, during this past recess, I had the \npleasure of presenting Innovation in Education Awards to two excellent \nrecipients; the first of which I noted in a previous floor speech.\n  The second Innovation in Education Award went to Peggy O'Neill-\nSkinner, a truly remarkable science teacher at the Bush School in \nSeattle. Peggy has been a science teacher for 28 years and is doing \noutstanding work in helping her students learn the importance of \nbiology and technology in today's world. Her years of devotion in \nteaching AP Biology, general biology, and numerous elective science \ncourses have shown great dividends. In fact, at a larger education \nevent at which this award was presented, my staff was approached by a \nnumber of attendees who had one universally similar point to share: \n``my child went to Bush and Peggy is a truly remarkable teacher. She is \nthe kind of teacher that can change a student's life and is a perfect \nfit for this award.'' Such praise needs no elaboration.\n  Last December, Peggy was given the prestigious Siemens Award for \nAdvance Placement, one of only 20 award winners across the country. The \nSiemens Award recognizes excellence AP courses for math and science. By \nvirtue of being selected with such a small number of her peers to \nreceive such\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\nrecognition, Peggy's own accomplishments speak to her supererogatory \nnature.\n  Her devotion to her students and to pursuing her own continued \neducation has paid great dividends with her students. Indeed, she \nspends her own summers teaching and learning at the University of \nWashington as well as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It is \nthis kind of effort--to be the best possible educator one can be--that \nmakes the education of all our children better.\n  I am pleased to have been able to give Peggy an Innovation in \nEducation Award in recognition of her hard work, her dedication, and \nher devotion to making the lives of her students better. While Peggy \nteaches in a private school, she clearly demonstrates the common sense \nthat permeates local educators in all of our constituencies. They can \ndo amazing things if we make sure they have the resources to do so \nwithout the red tape that would otherwise stifle the learning of our \nchildren.\n  For too long the federal government has been in the business of \nplacing burdensome regulations on our local schools. We have in Peggy \nO'Neill-Skinner an example of what educators can do without those \nrestraints and we owe it to our children and grandchildren to let \neducators like Peggy reach their potential. That is why I will continue \nto fight hard on behalf of legislation that provides relief from red \ntape and brings more money into local classrooms where the people with \nreal common sense to educate our children work everyday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3865-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING APRIL 28, 1999, AS ``ILLINOIS STUDENT TECHNOLOGY DAY''\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize April 28, \n1999, as ``Illinois Student Technology Day.'' On that day, \napproximately 140 schools will participate in school technology \ndemonstrations at the eighth annual Students for the Information Age \nprogram at the Illinois State Capitol Building in Springfield.\n  During this all-day event in the middle of National Science & \nTechnology Week, over 300 Illinois students will demonstrate the \nimportant impact technology, and access to it, has had in their \nclassrooms.\n  The advancements that have been made in technology, and the role it \nhas played in increasing access to valuable information and resources, \nhas improved the learning experience for many of our nation's students. \nTechnology has clearly become a powerful instrument for enhancing the \nlearning process. With the advent of the information age, it is more \nimportant than ever to expose students to technological innovations \nthat will play a crucial role in their intellectual development. We \nneed to redouble our efforts to ensure that more students, especially \nthose in rural and impoverished areas, have access to these \ntechnological advancements.\n  I hope that we can look at what will take place in Springfield, IL, \non April 28, 1999, as a sign of the continuing commitment to give our \nstudents the best possible opportunity to learn and succeed both in the \nclassroom and in their later careers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3865-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE TRI-CITY CRYSTAL APPLE AWARDS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as my colleagues may remember, each \nweek I give an Innovation in Education Award to recognize outstanding \neducators and education programs in Washington State. The premise is \nvery simple, that local people in our communities, not bureaucrats here \nin Washington, DC, know best how to educate our children.\n  As nominations for these awards have poured into my office, I \nreceived one noting the work of the program I will recognize today: the \nTri-City Crystal Apple Awards. The Crystal Apple Awards is sponsored by \nlocal service groups, businesses, and individuals. The community comes \ntogether to recognize educators who have a positive impact on the lives \nand futures of their students.\n  Each educator nominated for this award has demonstrated that he or \nshe has a special focus on students, has enthusiasm and versatility in \nmeeting individual needs, creativity in their use of curriculum and \nresources, give special attention to creating a constructive learning \nenvironment, have the ability to develop parent support and respect, \nand have the ability to inspire students so the student may achieve \ntheir maximum potential in life. These are truly outstanding \ncharacteristics for any educator to have.\n  I commend the Crystal Apple Award program for recognizing the \nexcellence that occurs in their midst. Too often today, educators of \ngreat merit go without recognition. Indeed, currently there is a heated \ndebate occurring in Washington State regarding teacher pay and methods \nto improve compensation for these deserving educators. The Crystal \nApple Awards are doing the right thing in teaming up with the community \nto recognize the people that are making the difference in their local \nschools. My only regret is that I am not able to be in Richland for the \nawards presentation.\n  I hope that the attendees of the Crystal Apple Awards ceremony will \nhave a pleasant event. I hope too that my colleagues will recognize the \nexcellence in education found in communities across our country. This \nissue energizes me in a special way. I am glad to stand up for what the \neducators in my State have wanted for a long time: the freedom to \ninnovate. That is why I will work hard this year to allow local \ncommunities to decide how to best spend their Federal education \ndollars; giving people like the recipients of the Crystal Apple Awards \nthe flexibility to teach our kids the way they--and only they--know \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/19/senate-section/article/S3865-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARY MAIER\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mary Maier, the \nassociate director for the Wisconsin Rural Leadership Program. Mary \nwill be retiring this month after an outstanding 26-year career with \nthe University of Wisconsin Extension Service.\n  As a member of the Community Programs Division and then the Wisconsin \nRural Leadership Program, Mary has demonstrated an unequaled passion \nand devotion to her work.

Mr. President, I am proud that the Senate is now \nconsidering S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children \nProtection Act of 1999. First, I would like to thank my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for his hard work \nand dedication in advancing this important legislation. I also want to \npay tribute to the cosponsors of S. 249, Senators DeWine, Grams, \nAshcroft, Abraham, and Biden. This bill, which was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee on a unanimous vote, reauthorizes two vital laws \nthat serve a crucial line of defense in support of some of the most \nvulnerable members of our society--thousands of missing, exploited, \nhomeless, or runaway children. It is a tragedy in our Nation that each \nyear there are as many as over 114,000 attempted child abductions, \n4,500 child abductions reported to the police, 450,000 children who run \naway, and 438,000 children who are lost, injured, or missing. I am told \nthat this is a growing problem even in my State of Utah.\n  Families who have written to me have shared the pain of a lost or \nmissing child. While missing, lost, on the run, or abducted, each of \nthese children is at high risk of falling into the darkness of drug \nabuse, sexual abuse and exploitation, pain, hunger, and injury. Each of \nthese children is precious, and deserves our efforts to save them.\n  Our bill reauthorizes and improves the Missing Children's Assistance \nAct and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. First, our bill revises the \nMissing Children's Assistance Act in part by recognizing the \noutstanding record of achievements of this National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children. It will enable NCMEC to provide even greater \nprotection of our Nation's children in the future. Second, our bill \nreauthorizes and revitalizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act.\n  At the heart of the bill's amendments to the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act is an enhanced authorization of appropriations for the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Under the authority \nof the Missing Children's Assistance Act, the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) has selected and given \ngrants to the Center for the last fourteen years to operate a national \nresource center located in Arlington, Virginia and a national 24-hour \ntoll-free telephone line. Today, the National Runaway Switchboard, \nwhich is a communications system designed to assist runaway youth and \ntheir families, responds to 150,000 calls a year. The Center provides \ninvaluable assistance and training to law enforcement around the \ncountry in cases of missing and exploited children. Through the \nCenter's work in FY 1997, almost 36,000 youth received food, 35,000 \nacquired shelter, over 22,000 obtained transportation home, 21,000 \nreceived substance abuse prevention services, and almost 18,000 \nreceived clothing. The Center's record is quite impressive, and its \nefforts have led directly to a significant increase in the percentage \nof missing children who are recovered safely.\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\n  In fiscal year 1999, the Center received an earmark of $8.12 million \nin the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations \nconference report. In addition, the Center's Jimmy Ryce Training Center \nreceived $1.25 million.\n  This legislation continues and formalizes NCMEC's long partnership \nwith the Justice Department and OJJDP, by directing OJJDP to make an \nannual grant to the Center, and authorizing annual appropriations of \n$10 million for fiscal years 1999 through 2004.\n  NCMEC's exemplary record of performance and success, as demonstrated \nby the fact that NCMEC's recovery rate has climbed from 62% to 91%, \njustifies action by Congress to formally recognize it as the nation's \nofficial missing and exploited children's center, and to authorize a \nline-item appropriation. This bill will enable the Center to focus \ncompletely on its missions, without expending the annual effort to \nobtain authority and grants from OJJDP. It also will allow the Center \nto expand its longer-term arrangements with domestic and foreign law \nenforcement entities. By providing an authorization, the bill also will \nallow for better congressional oversight of the Center.\n  The record of the Center, described briefly below, demonstrates the \nappropriateness of this authorization. For fourteen years, the Center \nhas served as the national resource center and clearinghouse mandated \nby the Missing Children's Assistance Act. The Center has worked in \npartnership with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, the Department of Treasury, the State Department, and \nmany other federal and state agencies in the effort to find missing \nchildren and prevent child victimization.\n  The trust the federal government has placed in NCMEC, a private, non-\nprofit corporation, is evidenced by its unique access to the FBI's \nNational Crime Information Center, and the National Law Enforcement \nTelecommunications System (NLETS).\n  NCMEC has utilized the latest in technology, such as operating the \nNational Child Pornography Tipline, establishing its new Internet \nwebsite, www.missingkids.com, which is linked with hundreds of other \nwebsites to provide real-time images of breaking cases of missing \nchildren, and, beginning this year, establishing a new Cyber Tipline on \nchild exploitation.\n\n  NCMEC has established a national and increasingly worldwide network, \nlinking NCMEC online with each of the missing children clearinghouses \noperated by the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In \naddition, NCMEC works constantly with international law enforcement \nauthorities such as Scotland Yard in the United Kingdom, the Royal \nCanadian Mounted Police, INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, and \nothers. This network enables NCMEC to transmit images and information \nregarding missing children to law enforcement across America and around \nthe world instantly. NCMEC also serves as the U.S. State Department's \nrepresentative at child abduction cases under the Hague Convention.\n  The record of NCMEC is demonstrated by the 1,203,974 calls received \nat its 24-hour toll-free hotline, 1(800)THE LOST, the 146,284 law \nenforcement, criminal/juvenile justice, and health care professionals \ntrained, the 15,491,344 free publications distributed, and, most \nimportantly, by its work on 59,481 cases of missing children, which has \nresulted in the recovery of 40,180 children. Each of these figures \nrepresents the activity of NCMEC through Spring, 1998. NCMEC is a \nshining example of the type of public-private partnership the Congress \nshould encourage and recognize.\n  The second part of our bill reforms and streamlines the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act, targeting federal assistance to areas with the \ngreatest need, and making numerous technical changes. According to the \nNational Network for Youth, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act provides \n``critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the \ncountry.'' Its three programs, discussed in more detail below, benefit \nthose children truly in need and at high risk of becoming addicted to \ndrugs, sexually exploited or abused, or involved in criminal behavior.\n  The cornerstone of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act is the Basic \nCenter Program which provides grants for temporary shelter and \ncounseling for children under age 18. My home state of Utah received \nover $378,000 in grants in FY 1998 under this program, and I have \nreceived requests from Utah organizations such as the Baker Youth \nService Home to reauthorize this important program. Cities such as \nProvo, Ogden, Cedar City, and Salt Lake City have received funding \nunder the grants. Since 1993, at least 5,000 youths have received \nassistance in Utah.\n  Community-based organizations also may request grants under the two \nrelated programs, the Transitional Living and the Sexual Abuse \nPrevention/Street Outreach programs. The Transitional Living grants \nprovide longer term housing to homeless teens aged 16 to 21, and aim to \nmove these teens to self-sufficiency and to avoid long-term dependency \non public assistance. The Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach \nProgram targets homeless teens potentially involved in high risk \nbehaviors.\n  In addition, the amendment reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act Rural Demonstration Projects which provide assistance to \nrural juvenile populations, such as in my state of Utah. Finally, the \namendment makes several technical corrections to fix prior drafting \nerrors in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act.\n  The provisions of this bill will strengthen our commitment to our \nyouth. The children helped by this legislation are not nameless, \nfaceless statistics. They are children from every State and from each \nof our hometowns who are lost, sometimes abused, and frequently scared. \nToo often, no one takes the time to care. The Missing Children's \nAssistance Act and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act fund programs in \nevery State run by dedicated staff and volunteers who take the time to \ncare. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will \nstrengthen the Missing Children's Assistance Act, the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, and the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct, and thus improve the safety and the lives of our Nation's most \nvulnerable children.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate is \nconsidering the Leahy-Hatch substitute to S. 249, the ``Missing, \nExploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act,'' which will \nreauthorize programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and \nauthorize funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren.\n  This bill authorizes a variety of critical programs for our nation's \nmost at risk children and youth--those who are missing or have been \nexploited and those who have run away or been forced from home or are \nhomeless. That is why I am particularly pleased that Senator Hatch and \nI were able to work together and with Senator Biden, DeWine and Abraham \nin the Judiciary Committee to report our substitute amendment without a \nsingle objection in early March. These children need our help, not \npartisan bickering, and I hope the House of Representatives will follow \nour lead and enact this bill promptly.\n  I have been working since 1996 to enact legislation to reauthorize \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Unfortunately, that Act has been \nwithout clear authorization since then. It is past time for Congress to \nremedy this situation. Last Congress, I worked hard to pass a similar \nbill, S. 2073, which would have reauthorized the Runaway and Homeless \nYouth Act and would have provided special authorization for the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children (``NCMEC''). With \nthe assistance of Senators Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, and Feingold, Senator \nHatch and I reported S. 2073 from the Judiciary Committee to the Senate \nin May 1998. That bill passed the Senate with the unanimous consent of \nall Senators on June 26, 1998.\n  Rather than consider the Senate bill last year, the House of \nRepresentatives chose to use our bill number as a vehicle to try to \nforce Senate action on controversial juvenile justice matters that had \nnever been considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the full \nSenate. Thereafter, I worked to attach the provisions of our original \nand noncontroversial bill as an amendment to other legislation. Even \nwhen we were successful in the Senate, certain House\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\nRepublicans continued to block all of our efforts.\n  I am optimistic that S. 249, this year's bill, will not face the same \nfate. With such an array of supporters in the Senate, surely the House \nwill also see fit to pass this legislation quickly so that the critical \nprograms in the bill can be funded and implemented.\n  I am particularly pleased that we have passed this bill with such \nstrong bipartisan support. Reauthorizing the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nAct for five more years is the first step in assuring local community \nprograms that they will have the resources they need to assist runaway \nyouth and their families. And, today's bill will also help the NCMEC to \ncontinue their good work by providing them with a special authorization \nof appropriations for five years as well. These programs are just the \nsort that studies have found to be effective and efficient uses of \nlimited federal dollars.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provides \nextremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families \nfacing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the \nNational Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 \nmissing children. They also handled 132,357 telephone calls to their \nhotline, which included calls to report a missing child, to request \ninformation or assistance and to provide leads on missing or \npotentially exploited children. This figure includes 10,904 reported \nleads or sightings of missing children, an increase of 25 percent over \nsuch leads in 1997.\n  Since 1984, the National Center has helped investigate 83 cases \ninvolving Vermont children who have been reported missing. They have \nhad extraordinary success in resolving these cases, some of which have \ntaken several years and have involved out of state or international \nnegotiations, and have only one unresolved case at this time. I want to \nthank Ernie Allen and all the dedicated employees and volunteers \nassociated with the National Center for their help in these matters.\n  The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of \nresources and information for both family members and law enforcement \nofficers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which \nwill provide free services to parents in search of their children and \nhave also developed extensive training programs. The National Center \nhas trained 728 sheriffs and police chiefs from across the U.S. in \nrecent years, including police chiefs from Dover, Hartford, Brattleboro \nand Winooski, Vermont, as well as members of the Vermont State Police. \nThey have trained an additional 150,000 other officers in child sexual \nexploitation and the detection of missing children since 1984.\n  The National Center is also a leader in reducing the number of infant \nabductions by educating nurses, security staffs and hospitals. Their \nrecent seminar in Vermont, which trained 250 nurses and security \npersonnel, should provide greater peace of mind to new parents in my \nhome State.\n  Most recently, they have expanded their role in combating the sexual \nexploitation of children by going on-line. Last year, they launched \ntheir ``CyberTipline'' which allows internet users to report suspicious \nactivities linked to the Internet, including child pornography and the \npotential enticement of children on-line. In the second half of 1998, \nthey received over 4,000 leads from the CyberTipline which resulted in \nnumerous arrests. I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope the \nHouse of Representatives will promptly pass this bill so that they can \nproceed with their important activities with fewer funding concerns.\n  The National Center established an international division some time \nago and has been working to fulfil the Hague Convention on the Civil \nAspects of International Child Abduction. Last year the National Center \nheld a conference on international concerns with child abductions and \ninternational custody battles between separated parents from different \ncountries. This week, Lady Catherine Myer will be hosting another \nimportant event on these matters and launching an International Centre \nfor Missing and Exploited Children with the help of the First Lady, \nHillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act distributes funding to local \ncommunity programs on the front lines assisting the approximately 1.3 \nmillion children and youth each year who are homeless or have left or \nbeen forced from their families for a variety of reasons. These \nprograms assist some of our nation's neediest children--those who lack \na roof over their heads. Many of the beneficiaries of these programs \nhave either fled or been kicked out of their family homes due to \nserious family conflicts, substance abusing parents or other problems. \nThese programs assist children facing a variety of circumstances and \nprovide funding for shelters and crisis intervention services, \ntransitional living arrangements and outreach to teens who are living \non the streets.\n  J.C. Myers, Coordinator of the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Programs, noted recently in a letter to me that:\n\n       Early interventions such as those authorized under this \n     act: the transitional living programs, crisis response and \n     family reunification services, and peer street outreach \n     programs are, in many cases, the only helping resource \n     available to runaway & homeless young people and families in \n     crisis. These services are much less costly and more \n     effective than later, more drastic interventions runaway and \n     homeless youths often eventually encounter, such as substance \n     abuse treatment and incarceration.\n\n  Miriam Rollin, the Director of Public Policy at the National Network \nfor Youth has noted:\n\n       Because runaway and homeless youth often cross state lines, \n     there is a uniquely federal interest in addressing the needs \n     of these youth. For a quarter of a century, the federal RHYA \n     programs have helped to meet the needs of these young people, \n     prevent their involvement in criminal activity, and provide \n     them with a doorway to a safe and productive future.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of both of their letters be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nExhibit 1.)\n  Under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, each year each State is \nawarded a Basic Center grant for housing and crisis services for \nrunaway and homeless children and their families. The funding is based \non its juvenile population, with a minimum grant of $100,000 currently \nawarded to smaller States, such as Vermont. Effective community-based \nprograms around the country can also apply directly for the funding \navailable for the Transitional Living Program and the Sexual Abuse \nPrevention/Street Outreach grants. The Transitional Living Program \ngrants are used to provide longer term housing to homeless teens age 16 \nto 21, and to help these teenagers become more self-sufficient. The \nSexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach Program also targets teens who \nhave engaged in or are at risk of engaging in high risk behaviors while \nliving on the street.\n  Vermont's Coalition for Runaway and Homeless Youth and the Spectrum \nYouth and Family Services in Burlington, Vermont, have developed very \ncomprehensive and effective programs to assist both teens who are \nlearning to be self-sufficient and those who are struggling to survive \non the streets. As such, Vermont programs have been successful in \napplying for these two specialized programs and have been on the \nforefront of developing and improving the services available to runaway \nand homeless youth across the U.S.\n  The Leahy-Hatch substitute language to S. 249 that was reported from \nthe Judiciary Committee is intended to recognize the important work of \nthese programs in Vermont, as well as the many other programs and staff \nacross the U.S. that are working effectively with runaway and homeless \nyouth and their families. This substitute language preserves current \nlaw governing the minimum grants available for small States for the \nBasic Center grants and also preserves the current confidentiality and \nrecords protections for runaway and homeless youth.\n  In addition, our substitute amendment reauthorizes the Runaway and \nHomeless Youth Act Rural Demonstration Projects for an additional five \nyears. This program provides targeted assistance to States with rural \njuvenile populations. Programs serving runaway and homeless youth have \nfound that those in rural areas are particularly difficult to reach and \nserve effectively.\n  For those who do not think rural areas have significant numbers of \nrunaway youth, I note that in fiscal year\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\n1998, the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs and \nSpectrum Youth & Family Services served 1,067 young people and 1,345 \nfamily members in their programs throughout Vermont. This was an 8 \npercent increase in cases from fiscal year 1997. These numbers have \nbeen increasing rapidly over the past few years with a 175 percent \nincrease in the number of youth served by the Vermont Coalition between \n1992 and 1998. An area of special concern is the increasing number of \nyoung people who are being ``pushed'' out of their homes--those numbers \nincreased 263 percent between 1993 and 1997 in Vermont. This is in \naddition to the hundreds of children each year who find themselves \nhomeless or who have run away from home.\n  The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act does more than shelter these \nchildren in need. As the National Network for Youth has stressed, the \nAct's programs ``provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk \nsituations all over the country.'' This Act also ensures that these \nchildren and their families have access to important services, such as \nindividual, family or group counseling, alcohol and drug counseling and \na myriad of other resources to help these young people and their \nfamilies get back on track. As a result of this multi-pronged approach \nto helping runaway and homeless youth, the Vermont Coalition of Runaway \nand Homeless Youth was able to establish 81 percent of the youth served \nin 1998 in a ``positive living situation'' by the end of services. The \nVermont Coalition and Spectrum Youth & Family Services should be \napplauded for their important work and I believe the best way to do \nthat is to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Act for five more \nyears, so programs like these in Vermont have some greater financial \nsecurity in the future.\n  I want to thank the many advocates who have worked with me to improve \nthe bill and, in particular, the dedicated members of the Vermont \nCoalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs and the National \nNetwork for Youth for their suggestions and assistance. Without these \ndedicated public spirited citizens these programs could not be \nsuccessful.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs,\n                                    Montpelier, VT, March 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you very much for your efforts in \n     working for the reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless \n     Youth Act. We believe that reauthorization of this \n     legislation is very important for runaway and homeless youths \n     and their families in Vermont, and all over the nation.\n       Early interventions such as those authorized under this \n     act: the transitional living programs, crisis response and \n     family reunification services, and peer street outreach \n     programs are, in many cases, the only helping resource \n     available to runaway and homeless young people and families \n     in crisis. These services are much less costly and more \n     effective than later, more drastic interventions runaway and \n     homeless youths often eventually encounter, such as substance \n     abuse treatment and incarceration.\n       The Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth \n     Programs supports the Leahy-Hatch substitute to S-249, the \n     Bill which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on March \n     4th, 1999. We urge passage of this Bill by the full Senate, \n     and feel confident that our colleagues at the National \n     Network for Youth, and runaway and homeless youth providers \n     all over the country also support this important legislation.\n       We are very grateful for the way that you and your staff \n     have worked with us to determine the needs of this vulnerable \n     population, and the way that we can best address those needs. \n     Karen Marangi, counsel for your office, has been diligent in \n     her efforts to meet with us and our youthful program \n     participants, keep us informed about your actions in \n     Committee, and use the data which we have provided to help \n     steer the best course. We commend you for your vision and \n     energy in pursuing the reauthorization of the Runaway and \n     Homeless Youth Act. Please let us know if we can be helpful \n     to you as you continue this good work.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       J.C.

As \n     you know, the RHYA includes three major grant programs: the \n     Basis Center Program, which provides grants to support \n     temporary shelter for youth (under age 18) and counseling for \n     youth and their families, in order to assist them in a time \n     of crisis; the Transitional Living Program, which provides \n     grants to support longer-term (up to 18 months) shelter as \n     well as independent living services to youth (age 16-21) who \n     are unable to return home safely, in order to promote their \n     successful transition to adulthood and self-sufficiency; and \n     the Street Outreach Program, which provides grants to support \n     street-based outreach and education to runaway, homeless and \n     street youth who have been sexually abused or are at risk of \n     sexual abuse, in order to connect these most vulnerable youth \n     with services and a chance for a safe and healthy future.\n       The following are a few key points about runaway and \n     homeless youth--and the programs which provide them critical \n     supports and opportunities--which you may consider as you \n     move this legislation to the Senate floor:\n       Runaway and homeless youth are not running TO anything; \n     they're running FROM homes where they have experienced \n     extreme parental neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, or \n     other situations like family violence or parental alcoholism \n     or substance abuse; some of these youth have been failed by \n     the child welfare system, and perceive the streets as \n     preferable to endless shuffling from one foster home or group \n     home to another.\n       Runaway and homeless youth face numerous dangers on the \n     streets: lack of education, health care and job training \n     opportunities; increased risk of substance abuse, depression, \n     early pregnancy, and HIV infection; and the dangers of \n     physical and sexual assault from adults who prey on these \n     young people.\n       The federal Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs support \n     cost-effective community-based services for these youth, to \n     protect them from the harms of life on the streets and either \n     reunify them safely with family or find alternative \n     appropriate placements.\n       Because runaway and homeless youth often cross state lines, \n     there is a uniquely federal interest in addressing the needs \n     of these youth. For a quarter of a century, the federal RHYA \n     programs have helped to meet the needs of these young people, \n     prevent their involvement in criminal activity, and provide \n     them with a doorway to a safe and productive future.\n       Thank you for your hard work in reauthorizing these vital \n     programs for our nation's most vulnerable youth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Miriam A. Rollin,\n                                        Director of Public Policy.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I join my chairman, Senator Chafee, in \nsupport of the legislation before us today, S. 507, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1999. I also want to recognize the new Chairman of \nthe Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, Senator Voinovich, \nfor his hard work on this bill, along with last year's Chairman, \nSenator Warner.\n  As we all know, the Water Resources Development Act of 1998 passed \nthis chamber last year, but was never enacted. It is our hope that \nearly action in this session will help us wrap up the unfinished \nbusiness from the 105th Congress. It will also set us on course to \ndevelop a Water Resources Development Act for 2000.\n  S. 507 authorizes more than 40 projects for flood control, \nnavigation, shore protection, environmental restoration, water supply \nstorage and\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nrecreation. Twenty-seven projects are modified and the Corps is \ndirected to conduct 43 separate studies throughout the Nation. The \nprojects have the support of a local sponsor willing to share the cost \nof the project. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \ntotal Federal cost of this bill will be $2.3 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Many of the projects contained in this bill are necessary to protect \nthe nation's shorelines, along oceans, lakes and rivers. Several of the \nnavigation projects need timely authorization in order to keep our \nports competitive in the global marketplace. Furthermore, the study \nauthorizations, including a comprehensive, cumulative impact study of \nthe Yellowstone River in my home state of Montana, need to get started \nto help us make informed decisions about the future use and management \nof these precious resources.\n  The projects in this bill have been reviewed by the Army Corps of \nEngineers and have been found to be in the Federal interest, \ntechnologically feasible, economically justified and environmentally \nsound. In other words, these are projects worthy of our support.\n  I am pleased to bring this bill to the floor and urge my colleagues \nto approve it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 253\n\n                (Purpose: To make managers' amendments)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nconsidered as read and agreed to, the committee substitute be agreed \nto, as amended, the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
