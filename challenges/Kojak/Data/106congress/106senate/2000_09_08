Mr. President, senior citizens need a drug benefit under \nMedicare. They've earned it by a lifetime of hard work, and they \ndeserve it. It is time for Congress to enact it. The clock is running \nout on this Congress, but it is not too late for the House and Senate \nto act.\n  Al Gore and George Bush have proposed vastly different responses to \nthis challenge. The Gore plan provides a solid benefit under existing \nMedicare. The Bush plan, by contrast, cannot pass the truth in labeling \ntest. His plan is not Medicare--and it is not adequate. It is too \nlittle, too late. It puts senior citizens needing prescription drug \ncoverage at the mercy of unreliable HMOs.\n  And it is part of a proposal to privatize Medicare that will raise \npremiums and force the most vulnerable elderly to give up their family \nphysician and join HMOs.\n  Senior citizens need help now. Al Gore's plan provides prescription \ndrug coverage under Medicare for every senior citizen in 2002--the \nearliest date such a program could realistically be implemented.\n  Under the Bush plan, there is no Medicare coverage of prescription \ndrugs for four years. Instead, Governor Bush proposes a block grant to \nstates for low-income seniors only. Less than one-third of seniors \nwould even be eligible. Only a minority of those who are eligible would \nparticipate. Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare. Al Gore's plan \nrecognizes that. George Bush's plan does not.\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n\n  On this chart, we see the differences between the two programs. This \neffectively, in under Vice President Gore, would go to the year 2002--a \nlittle over a year from where we are now. Under the Bush program, \neffectively it will go in 4 years after enactment. It would be a block \ngrant that would go to the States to deal with those neediest among our \npoor. But it would effectively leave out 29 million Medicare \nrecipients.\n  Under the Gore program, you have guaranteed benefits. What does \n``guaranteed benefits'' mean? That means a senior goes into a doctor's \noffice. The doctor says that you need XYZ drug. They could prescribe \nit, and the individual patient is going to be assured of it.\n  Under the Bush program, under the HMO, which particular prescription \ndrugs are going to be included? Just like it is under the HMO, to make \na decision on what the premium is going to be, what the copayment is \ngoing to be, and what the deductible is going to be. There isn't a \nperson today, including Governor Bush, who can tell what the benefit \npackage would be for a senior under his program. They couldn't tell \nwhat the deductible, what the premium or what the copay would be. Under \nthe Gore program, they could; and it is basically under the Medicare \nsystem.\n  When Governor Bush says it is an ``immediate helping hand,'' that \nreally can't pass the truth-in-labeling test. The claim is that it \nwould help. The truth is, it is too little for too few.\n  Seventy percent of the Medicare beneficiaries--more than 27 million--\nwould not be eligible for the block grant program.\n  Effectively what we are saying is that under the program, 27 million \nwill not be eligible under the block grant program. Even fewer would \nparticipate. Less than 20 percent of the eligible low-income seniors \ncurrently participate in the State-run Medicare premium assistance \nprogram, which is known as SLMB. That is where the States are basically \nhelping and assisting through Medicare to offset the premiums for the \nlowest income. The States have shown a remarkable lack of interest in \nprotecting the low-income seniors, and it is very little too late. They \nwill do much better with regard to this program. This is a matter of \nvery considerable concern.\n  Again, the challenge is this ``immediate helping hand.'' We also say \nthis can't pass the truth-in-labeling test. All 50 States must pass \nenabling or modifying legislation. We are going to have a different \nbenefit package in each of the States under this particular program. \nOnly 16 States currently have any drug insurance program at the \nexisting time.\n  If you look at the CHIP experience, which was enacted in August of \n1997, when the funding was already available to any of the States that \nwent ahead and passed the law, it still took over 2 years for Texas to \nimplement the CHIP program. We haven't even gotten the block grant \nmoney. It will have to be approved by the Congress in the future.\n  As Governor Bush has pointed out, many States don't have the \nlegislation. They meet biannually, and this will require enabling \nlegislation in the States. Beyond that, the Governors have already \nrejected the block grant program. The Governors rejected the State \nblock grant program. They did so in February of this year.\n\n       If Congress decides to expand the prescription drug \n     coverage for seniors, it should not shift that \n     responsibility, or its costs, to the States.\n\n  That is exactly what this program does. Here are the Governors, in a \nbipartisan way, indicating that they didn't want to take the new \nadministration on and the bureaucracy of trying to administer this \nprogram. They didn't want the responsibility, and they didn't want to \nhave to put out any of the costs as well. It is a very clear indication \nthat the Governors are not interested in this program, to have it \nimplemented with regard to the States. The Gore plan provides the \nguaranteed benefits. The Bush plan leaves the benefits and premiums up \nto the HMOs.\n  We are out on the floor of the Senate trying to get a Patients' Bill \nof Rights up to try to make sure the HMOs are going to be responsive to \nthe health care needs of our people in this country and do what is \nnecessary for them as identified by the doctors and trained \nprofessionals. Here we are having a whole new program that is going to \nbe effectively administered by the HMOs.\n  Under the Gore plan, there is no deductible. The Government pays for \n50 percent, up to $2,000, and rising to $5,000. Premiums are limited to \nthe cost of the services--not the profits of the HMOs. The Government \nand beneficiaries each pay half of the premium. There is a $4,000 limit \non the out-of-pocket costs.\n  It seems to me we have this dramatic difference in these approaches \nbetween the two programs. Under the Gore proposal, this will be a \nprompt help for senior citizens, just 1 year after enactment; under \nGovernor Bush's proposal, it will take 4 years after enactment to be \nput in place in the 50 different States, it will rely upon the HMOs, \nand it will take care of less than a third of the needs of our senior \ncitizens.\n  We have a guaranteed benefit program. They have no guaranteed benefit \nprogram. We will not hear any Republican able to identify what \nprescription drugs are going to be guaranteed to the seniors of this \ncountry. Under the Gore proposal, whatever the doctor says is going to \nbe necessary will be guaranteed. We have guaranteed access to the \nneeded drugs. The doctor decides.\n  Mr. President, I think there is a dramatic contrast and difference.\n  Look at the cost under the different proposals. We find with a 25-\npercent premium payment under the Medicare actuaries, they have \nindicated there will be a rise in the premiums anywhere from 35 to 45 \npercent. It was because of those findings, which have been \nsubstantiated by the Senate Finance Committee, that the basic Gore \nprogram has indicated there has to be a support of at least 50 percent \nof the premium in order to make sure it will be universal. It is \nvoluntary. But with this kind of a 50-percent premium offset, the best \nestimate is, according to the Senate Finance Committee hearings, there \nwill be virtually a universal appeal for that. With 25 percent of \npremium, according to the Finance Committee hearings, they believe the \nincrease in the cost of the premiums will rise from 35 to 45 percent.\n  In conclusion, we have the Federal budget commitment of $253 billion \nunder Vice President Gore; it is $158 billion under Governor Bush. The \nFederal contribution to beneficiary premiums is 50 percent under Vice \nPresident Gore; under Bush, it is 25 percent.\n  I say to the editorial writers, read the Senate Finance Committee and \nthe House Ways and Means Committee. Find out, in the questions and \nanswers at those hearings, whether anyone believes with a 25-percent \noffset in premium--without knowing what the premium is going to be, \nbecause the premium is going to be established by the HMO--whether the \noverall costs in terms of prescription drugs is not going to increase \nanywhere from 35 to 42 percent. The proportion of our seniors \nparticipating in the drug coverage is virtually 100 percent; in the \nBush program, less than half.\n  I think it is important to have an understanding of what is before \nthe Congress in the Senate. We still have time to take action. We are \ninterested in taking action. We ought to be able to develop a \nbipartisan effort to try to deal with the principal concerns of our \nsenior citizens. We all know that if Medicare were being passed today \nrather than in 1965, a prescription drug benefit would be included. The \nguarantee in 1965 to our senior citizens was: Work hard, contribute \ninto the Medicare system, and your health care needs will be attended \nto. We are not attending to the needs of our senior citizens. Every day \nthat goes by without a prescription drug benefit, we are violating that \ncommitment to our senior citizens, and that is wrong.\n  We have in the last 4\\1/2\\ weeks the opportunity to take meaningful \nsteps to address that critical need for our senior citizens. We should \nnot fail them. That is what I think is a fundamental responsibility we \nhave in the Senate.\n\n  More than 900,000 senior citizens lost their Medicare under HMOs this \nyear. Yes, 900,000 senior citizen lost their Medicare HMO coverage this \nyear. Yet that is going to be the pillars on which this program is \ngoing to be built after 4 years; 934,000 Medicare beneficiaries lost \ntheir HMO coverage this year. Approximately 30 percent of beneficiaries \nlive in areas with no HMOs.\n  In vast areas of the country, there are virtually no HMOs at all. We \nhave\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\nseen them leaving in droves, including the States of Connecticut and my \nown State of Massachusetts. It has been true in the State of Maryland. \nThere is one HMO left in the State of Maryland. Now we have 30 percent \nof all beneficiaries living in areas with no HMOs.\n  Private insurance premiums will increase 10 to 30 percent this year. \nThis is the principal concern. In the first 4 years, 29 million senior \ncitizen otherwise eligible under Medicare will not be able to \nparticipate in the Bush program. After that, it will be built upon the \nHMOs without a defined benefit package, without any indication of what \nthe premiums, copays, or deductibles are going to be.\n  The alternative is a very impressive and significant downpayment in \nthe commitment of this country to building on Medicare. I know there \nare many--and probably most--who are opposed to building on Medicare, \nwho are against the Medicare system in any event. One doesn't have to \nbe a rocket scientist to understand that. But we believe the Medicare \nsystem has worked and is working. It has to be strengthened, it has to \nbe improved. There are many features in terms of health care that it \ndoesn't cover. It don't cover the eye care, dental care, or foot care \nthat it should. It doesn't do the prescription drug coverage, which is \nlife and death. That is the major opening.\n  We find under the Bush plan the benefits provided are guaranteed to \nnot be adequate. The Bush program allocates $100 billion less to \nprescription drug coverage than the Gore plan over 10 years. The reason \nfor this large gap is obvious. The Bush approach allocates too much of \nthe surplus to tax breaks for the wealthy, and too little is left to \nhelp our senior citizens.\n  Under the Bush plan, the Government contributes 25 percent of the \ncost of prescription drug premiums--half as much as under the Gore \nprogram. In the entire history of Medicare, citizens have never been \nasked to pay such a high proportion of the cost of any benefit. They \nhave never been asked to pay such a high proportion of the cost of any \nbenefit. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated \nunder the similar Republican plan passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, benefits would be so inadequate, costs so high, that \nmore than half of the senior citizens who need help the most will not \nbe able to participate. Any prescription drug benefit that leaves out \nmore than 6 million of our senior citizens who need the protection the \nmost is not a serious plan to help senior citizens.\n  Perhaps the worst aspect of the Bush plan is that it makes \nprescription drugs available to senior citizens only if they also \naccept the extreme changes in Medicare that would dramatically raise \npremiums for their doctors and hospital bills and coerce the most \nvulnerable seniors to join HMOs. That is not the kind of Medicare \ncoverage and it is not the kind of prescription drug benefit the \nAmerican people want.\n  Under Bush's vision of Medicare reform, the premiums paid by senior \ncitizens for conventional Medicare could increase by as much as 47 \npercent in the first year and continue to grow over time, according to \nthe nonpartisan Medicare actuaries. The elderly would face an \nunacceptable choice between premiums they can afford and giving up \ntheir family doctor by joining an HMO.\n  Senior citizens already have the right to choose between conventional \nMedicare and private insurance that offers additional benefits. The \ndifference between what seniors have today and what George W. Bush is \nproposing is not the difference between choice and bureaucracy, it is \nthe difference between choice and coercion, driven by the right-wing \nRepublican agenda to undermine Medicare by privatizing it. On this \nground alone it deserves rejection. We don't have to destroy Medicare \nin order to save it.\n\n  There is still time this year for Congress to enact a genuine \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare. Al Gore and the \nadministration have presented a strong proposal. Let's work together to \nenact it. The American people are waiting for our answer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, ironically, I came to the floor to talk \nabout some of Vice President Gore's proposals, specifically in the \nareas he is spending money. The fact he has created this Pyrhhic \nlockbox--not Pyrhhic, this mystical lockbox he is claiming for the \nextra surplus which has been identified under the new budget estimates, \nwhich is mystical because he has already spent the entire surplus plus \nwhatever would occur as a result of the increased estimates on the \nsurplus. In fact, according to the Budget Committee, he spent under the \nhigh estimate almost $1 trillion more than the surplus. As a result, he \nis significantly invading the Social Security accounts.\n  But having listened to the Senator from Massachusetts, I do not \nbelieve his words can go unanswered because he has, first, made a \nnumber of statements which are inaccurate about Governor Bush's \nproposals on the drug plans for seniors and, second, I think he has put \nforward the basic premise of the debate between the two parties on the \nissues that should be answered. Let's begin there before I go to the \nspecifics of the areas of his presentation, which were unfortunately \nnumerous as they related to Governor Bush's positions. The difference \nhere is fairly simple between the two approaches.\n  What was very distinctly stated by the Senator from Massachusetts is \nthat they want to create--they use the term ``universal,'' but a 100-\npercent program in the drug benefit area, which is totally managed by \nthe Federal Government--100 percent. Vice President Gore wants to do \nfor prescription drugs what Hillary Clinton wanted to do for health \ncare generally. He wants to take ``Hillary Care,'' which is essentially \na nationalization of health care, and apply it to the prescription drug \nprogram.\n\n  There are a lot of problems with nationalizing the prescription drug \nprogram, with having the Federal Government take over the senior \ncitizens' ability to buy drugs. I think most seniors understand that \nhaving the Federal Government tell them what they are going to be able \nto buy in drugs, exactly what type of drug program they are going to \nhave--and it will be one size fits all for this entire country--I think \nmost seniors have an inherent understanding, as most Americans have an \ninherent understanding, that that program has some significant flaws.\n  One of the reasons this Congress and the American people so \nenthusiastically rejected ``Hillary Care'' is that people intuitively \nunderstand that taking a program and turning it over to the Federal \nGovernment to operate, specifically when that program is critical to \none's well-being, as is health care, is putting at risk one's health \ncare, by definition.\n  So the Gore plan is essentially a nationalization plan. The term is \nused ``universal, 100 percent.'' That means the Government runs it all. \nWell, 68 percent of the seniors in this country today already have a \ndrug benefit. Many of them are fairly happy that they are able to go \nout and purchase a drug benefit that is tailored to what they need. \nThere are, obviously, a lot of seniors in this country who need \nassistance in purchasing that drug benefit. There are a lot of seniors \nin this country today who do not have adequate coverage in drug \nbenefits. The concerns of those seniors need to be addressed. But we \ndon't address them by taking all the other senior citizens of this \ncountry who have set up their own\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\nsystems--and most of them come as a result of their employer continuing \nto cover their drug benefit as a result of their retirement--and saying \nto them: No longer can you participate in your employer plan, no longer \ncan you participate in a plan which you chose which covers the needs \nwhich you and your family have. No. Now you must participate in a plan \ndesigned by Vice President Gore and a group of bureaucrats here in \nWashington under the guidance of the Senator from Massachusetts, and \nyou either participate in that plan or you get nothing. When you \nparticipate in that plan, you don't get options. You have to do exactly \nwhat the Federal Government says. That can be a nightmare. That can be \na nightmare, as we all know.\n  That is the fundamental difference. What Governor Bush has put forth \nis a proposal which will address the needs of seniors who do not \npresently have adequate prescription drug coverage and will address it \nin a way that allows seniors to have choices. It allows them to tailor \ntheir health care plans to what they need, not to what somebody here in \nWashington thinks they need. That is the difference of opinion here. \nThere is the Washington mindset which says we in Washington actually \nknow better than you do, John Jones out in Iowa, what you need to buy \nfor your prescription drug benefits. It is this arrogance, this elitism \nthat just permeates Washington and which was so precisely stated in the \n``Hillary Care'' package and which is now just being repackaged with \nnew words--``universal, 100 percent''--under the Gore drug plan.\n  Governor Bush has put forward a very thoughtful, very aggressive \nproposal in the area of prescription drugs that does address the needs \nof seniors who cannot afford those programs and seniors who need \nassistance in those programs. It was, regrettably, misinterpreted by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. To begin with, it doesn't start 4 years \nfrom now. It actually begins much sooner and potentially 2 years sooner \nthan the Gore plan. The Gore plan does not go into effect until 1 year \nafter the date of enactment, which means we are probably looking--\nshould we have the fate of having the Vice President become President, \nwe are probably looking at somewhere around the year 2002 before it \neven gets operating.\n\n  That is a pretty optimistic viewpoint. The Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid Texas took a long time to participate in the CHIPS program and all \nthe other States took a long time to participate in the CHIPS program. \nWhat was that? That was an attempt by the Federal Government to make \nsure all the kids who are low income, who need insurance in this \ncountry, get health insurance. It was passed by the Congress.\n  Do you know how long it took this administration to put in place the \nregulations to manage the health care plan for children, CHIPS? They \nhave not done it yet. They are still working on those regulations. Why \nhave States not been able to put their CHIPS program into place \nquickly? Because the regulations have taken so long to get in place. \nThey have a majority of them in place now, but it literally took years \nto get the regulations in place so the States could comply with them.\n  So the idea that the Vice President, should he be fortunate enough to \nbe elected President, is going to put in place a drug program that is \ngoing to be managed by the same agencies that manage the present \nsystems, that manage the health care system we have--and they couldn't \neven do that--is going to set up a program for the country in a prompt \nway is, on its face, not believable.\n  The fact is his plan, if he is lucky, assuming he was able to pass \nthe nationalization of the prescription drug programs in this country, \nassuming he was able to inflict ``Hillary Care,'' relative to drugs, on \nour people, assuming he was able to get that through the Congress, \nthere is no way that plan would be in place and operating even by the \nyear 2002, which he claims it could be. Maybe 2003; maybe 2004.\n  This timeframe thing the Senator from Massachusetts talked about is \njust a lot of mush. The fact is, the Gore plan, by definition, cannot \nstart until 2002, and we know, as a practical matter, the way the \nFederal Government operates, and especially the way HCFA operates, \nthere is no way it will be operating until probably sometime in 2005, \nwhereas Governor Bush has proposed a unique and creative idea. He \nrecognizes that what we need is fundamental Medicare reform. We need to \nbring all the parties to the table and reach a Medicare package that \nwill reform the whole system to get efficiencies into the system, to \nreduce the costs of the operation of the system, to make it work more \nlike a system for the 21st century rather than a system designed in the \nsixties, which is the way it works today.\n  He said it is going to take time to develop that package, it is going \nto take time to develop that comprehensive agreement, bipartisan in \nnature, so let's have a bridging program and let's begin the bridging \nprogram immediately. He said one of his first pieces of legislation \nwill be a bridging program in the area of drugs which will allow the \nStates, during the period when the Federal Government is working out \nmajor Medicare reform, to address not only drug benefits but everything \nelse that deals with Medicare. During the period when the Federal \nGovernment is working on that, he said let's set up a specific program \nthat will benefit seniors who need prescription drugs as a bridging \nprogram. That program can be in place--if the Congress actually wants \nto get to work, that program can be in place by March of next year.\n  There is a distinct difference in timeframe, yes. The difference is, \nunder the Gore proposal, which is nationalization of the prescription \ndrug program, which is ``Hillary Care'' for the prescription drug \nprogram, it puts all seniors in America under one system managed by the \nFederal Government. We know it is going to be a bureaucratic disaster \nand there are going to be a lot of delays. By definition, his plan does \nnot start for 2 years, whereas what Governor Bush suggested is that he \nunderstands Government takes time to address major issues such as this, \nso let's put in a bridging program and start the program early. There \nis a time difference. The difference is Governor Bush's plan starts a \nheck of a lot earlier than the Vice President's plan. The Senator from \nMassachusetts was wrong in that assessment.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Massachusetts--there are a whole series of \npoints, and I am not going to be able to cover them all--the Governor's \nplan only covers 25 percent of the cost and we cover 50 percent of the \ncost. I remember a story told by an attorney in New Hampshire who \nrepresented the northern part of New Hampshire. He said he was once \nworking for a logging company and sent back a report. There were five \nloggers at this base camp, three men and two women. One of the women \nmarried one of the men, and a report said that 50 percent of the women \nhad married 33 percent of the men. This statistic is one of those types \nof statistics. It is a nice statistic. It may make sense, but if you \nlook behind it, it makes absolutely no sense because the statistic is \nbased on two different programs.\n  The Gore plan, yes, covers 50 percent of the cost, but what it says \nis every American must use the federalized system of drug care. As I \nmentioned earlier, 68 percent of senior citizens already have a drug \nprogram. Many of them do not need a new drug program. Some may want to \nopt into a new drug program if it is available, but many of them do \nnot. They are quite happy with what they have from their company which \ncontinued to cover them after they retired. If they have to pay 50 \npercent now under a Federal program, it actually works out for many \nseniors that the premium costs of the Gore plan will be higher than the \npremium costs which they have for their present drug program.\n\n  If one looks behind this 50-percent number, it becomes very clear \nthat it is not a positive number for seniors, it is very negative for a \nlot of seniors who will end up paying more for their drug benefit than \nthey pay today because they are going to be put in a Federal plan where \nthe premium costs more than the premium they have today, and they do \nnot have any choice, they have to go into the Fed plan. Why? Because Al \nGore knows better; because the Members on the other side of the aisle \nknow better; they are smarter than the rest of Americans; they\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\nshould design the plan for the rest of Americans, and it should be run \nout of Washington. It is called elitism and, as I said, it permeates \nthis city. Whereas under Governor Bush's plan, yes, 25 percent of the \npremium will be picked up by the Federal Government, but he also said \nthis is an option, this is not a requirement. In other words, a senior \nwill take that option if it is a better deal than what they already \nhave.\n  He has also said that for low-income seniors, people at 175 percent \nof poverty, his plan covers all the premium. So let's not have any of \nthis class warfare jargon we have been hearing from the other side of \nthe aisle through their convention and since then. Actually, Governor \nBush said he will cover all the premium for people up to 175 percent of \npoverty; the Vice President said he is only going to cover all the \npremium up to 150 percent of poverty. Governor Bush has exceeded, for \nlow-income seniors, the assistance that will be given.\n  This 25-50 percent is a nice number, but it has no relevance to \nreality because they are two different plans which have two huge, \ndifferent impacts on the flow of events around how this is covered.\n  Then the Senator from Massachusetts went on to say that block grants \nare a terrible idea generally, which has always been the theory coming \nfrom the other side of the aisle because they do not like to give \nStates any authority, and especially in this instance it is a bad idea \nbecause of, as I mentioned earlier, the time lag between when the block \ngrant is created and when the States will be able to operate under it.\n  The point is, once again, that is a Democratic approach to a block \ngrant. A Democratic approach to a block grant is: We will give you the \nmoney, but we will set up a whole bunch of strings in Washington which \nyou have to comply with before you get the money. Governor Bush's \nproposal is a real block grant. ``Block grant'' has become a \npejorative. It should not be a pejorative. It is a return of funds to \nthe States, and it says to the States: Manage these funds for low- and \nmoderate-income seniors so they have a drug program.\n  I happen to think States are going to do that more effectively than \nHCFA has done their job in a variety of different areas, or the other \nMedicare activities that have occurred. I am willing to put the State \nof New Hampshire up against the Federal bureaucracy in health care any \nday of the week, and I can absolutely assure you that New Hampshire \ncitizens are going to get a lot better care when the State of New \nHampshire is making the decisions than when some bureaucrat in some \nbuilding in Washington is making decisions under the guidance of \nHillary Clinton or under the guidance, in this case, of Vice President \nGore. Why can I say that? Because it is a fact. It is the way it works \ntoday. We have seen it time and time again.\n  This proves the point of what I am saying: that HMOs have been \ndropping their participation like flies, radically. The Senator from \nMassachusetts pointed out that HMOs have been moving out of States, as \nthey have in New Hampshire--senior HMOs, Medicare HMOs. That is \nabsolutely right. Why? Because the Federal Government under this \nadministration shortchanged the reimbursement to HMOs. HCFA \nspecifically undercut the ability of Medicare HMOs to function because \nthey would not reimburse Medicare HMOs at a reasonable rate.\n  It has become such a crisis that before this Senate adjourns and \nbefore this Congress adjourns, we are going to adjust that. \nUnfortunately, so much of the damage has been done by this \nadministration's Health and Human Services Department that I am not \nsure we are going to recover the HMOs. He is proving my point by saying \nthe HMOs are falling out of business. It is another classic example of \na statement which, on its face, may make sense, but if you look behind \nit, just the opposite is the fact.\n  It is like another story in New Hampshire, another legal story, which \nis the guy who shoots his parents and then goes to the court and claims \nhe is an orphan and throws himself on the mercy of the court. The \nadministration is shooting the Medicare HMOs, left and right, because \nthey will not reimburse them. Then they come here and say: Oh, the \nMedicare HMOs are falling off; therefore, plans can't work because they \nmight use Medicare HMOs. It is a little hard to accept that logic. And \nit is especially inappropriate for that argument to be made, in my \nopinion, from people in this administration.\n  So beyond the specific errors of the statement, which I think were \nconsiderable as they related to Governor Bush's proposal, and which I \nhave tried to outline--I am sure I have not hit them all because I am \nnot that intimately familiar with the entire package; but even with \ngeneral familiarity, I noticed a number of mistakes--beyond that, it \nreally does come back to this basic philosophical difference: Do we \nwant to give our senior citizens in this country the opportunity to \nhave quality prescription drug coverage, which they get to choose, and \nhave some part in the participation, in making decisions as to what it \nwill be, what type of coverage they want, and how much it will benefit \ntheir families, or do we want to nationalize the prescription drug care \nprocess in this country, and have what is essentially another slice of \n``Hillary Care'' put upon the Nation?\n  That is the difference. That is the difference between these two \napproaches. Both approaches try to address the needs of the low- and \nmoderate-income seniors and give them adequate health care and drug \ncoverage. Governor Bush's proposal does a little better job because he \ntakes 175 percent of poverty and covers all the premiums up to that, \nand Vice President Gore's proposal only goes to 150 percent of poverty.\n  So we are not talking anymore about whether or not low-income seniors \nare going to have adequate drug care. We are talking about timing. \nGovernor Bush's proposal moves a lot quicker than Vice President Gore's \nin getting the money out and getting support to seniors.\n  But what we are really talking about is the ability of seniors to \nplay a role and have participation in the choice of the drug care they \nget as versus having the Federal Government doing it all.\n  So that is a response to Senator Kennedy's comments on drugs, which I \nguess we are going to hear a lot more about, and which I am sure the \nSenator will have a response to my response, if he decides he deems it \nworthwhile.\n  I was going to discuss this other issue, so let me quickly discuss \nit. I know the Senator from Idaho has been very patient.\n  I do have to make this one point that this chart illustrates which is \nthat the Senate Budget Committee took a look at the Vice President's \nproposals. Anybody who has been listening to the Vice President \nwandering around the country knows he has gone to just about every \ninterest group in this country and has suggested money he will spend to \nassist them in some program, which is his right and, obviously, his \nphilosophical viewpoint. But at some point you have to pay the piper. \nYou have to add those numbers up.\n  So the Senate Budget Committee added those numbers up. When you get \nto the bottom line, which is shown on this chart, the surplus, over the \nnext 10 years, which is $4.5 trillion, is entirely spent.\n\n  We have heard a lot from the Vice President about how Governor Bush's \nproposal of the $1.3 trillion tax cut, which is about a quarter of the \nentire surplus, is going to eat up the surplus and, therefore, not \nleave anything for anybody else. But what we do not hear about, because \nmaybe the press has not focused on it because it is a lot of numbers--\nbut they can now go to the Senate Budget Committee numbers and focus on \nit fairly easily--is that Vice President Gore has already spent the \nsurplus. He has spent the entire surplus.\n  If you use the low range, he has overspent the surplus by $27 \nbillion. That is the low range. That is if you give him every benefit \nof the doubt. If you use the high range, which is not an outrageous \nhigh range--if it were my high range, it would be a lot higher than \nthis is from the Budget Committee; and they tend to be fairly \nconservative number crunchers up there--it comes up to $900 billion, \nalmost $1 trillion, that he has spent that exceeds the surplus. From \nwhere does that come? That comes from Social Security. That is what you \nend up hitting.\n  There are a couple numbers on this chart that stand out like sore \nthumbs\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\nthat I want to mention quickly, and then I will stop.\n  First, the tax cut relief. In the entire Gore package--we have a $4.5 \ntrillion surplus--do you know how much tax cut relief there really is? \nThe Vice President says he has $500 billion, but that is, once again, \none of these numbers which, if you look behind it, is not really there. \nThe net tax cut relief in his package is $147 billion out of a $4.5 \ntrillion surplus.\n  The American people are paying $4.5 trillion more to the Federal \nGovernment than the Federal Government needs to operate. That is what \nthe surplus is. Everyone in this room, everyone in America who pays \ntaxes is paying taxes which the Federal Government does not need to \noperate. It adds up to $4.5 trillion. And all that the Vice President \ncan agree to give back in the way of a tax cut--and it is not really a \ntax cut, returning taxes that do not need to be paid--is $147 billion \nout of $4.5 trillion. It is incredible.\n  That number distinctly reflects the view that any money that comes to \nWashington is not the money of the taxpayers; it is the money of the \npeople who live in Washington. It is the Vice President's money; \ntherefore, he does not have to give it back. It is the Government's \nmoney. They don't have to give it back. Not in my view. Not in Governor \nBush's view, which is that it is the taxpayers' money. It comes out of \nyour pocket. It is your taxes. It is your money. If the Government has \ntoo much of it, let's give it back.\n  The second item that I want to highlight is this retirement savings \nplus plan, which is a brand new major entitlement of huge proportions \nand a massive increase on the next generation. This is only a 10-year \nnumber shown on the chart. That number explodes, as you move into the \noutyears, into trillions. It is the most significant major entitlement \never put on the books of the American Government, in my opinion--if it \nwere to pass. It will exceed Medicare by a huge function in the \noutyears, as we head toward the year 2030, I believe. But it will at \nleast be competitive with Medicare as a massive new entitlement \nprogram.\n  Who is going to pay it? The next generation. Our kids. My daughter \nwho just got her first job. She is out of college, which we are very \nhappy about because we don't have to pay tuition. She got a job, which \nwe are even more happy about. Unfortunately, around about 10 or 15 \nyears from now, assuming she keeps her job, she is going to be paying \ntaxes at an outrageous rate in order to support a brand new entitlement \nput on the books by Vice President Gore, if he should become President. \nThat, to me, is a little number in there that seems little in this \npackage, although it is huge--obviously, even in this package; $750 \nbillion on the upper side. That is not talked about much but should be \nlooked at by the American people as they consider who they are going to \nvote for in this coming election.\n\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Idaho in \nallowing me to proceed for a little extra time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I ask where we currently are in the \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We should be proceeding to H.R. 4444, but if \nthe Senator wishes to speak on a different subject, he certainly can \nask unanimous consent to do so.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as much time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, \nfirst of all, for being on the floor this morning to discuss what I \nthink is a very important issue. For any of us who were listening to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Massachusetts, let \nme see if I can get this together.\n  If you are for the Gore prescription drug health plan, then you are \ngoing to have a major premium increase, and you may get the plan in 8 \nyears. It will be a Government plan, and it will be a major Government \ntakeover of health care for the seniors in this country. And it will be \nlimited to no choice.\n  If you accept what Governor Bush is proposing, then you have a \nsubstantially greater choice. The plan is back to the States, where \ndoctors and nurses and local health care delivery systems deliver it, \nand you do not move toward a major federalization of health care.\n  We had this debate in 1992 and 1993. About 70 percent of the citizens \nof the country said: We don't want the Federal Government as the \ndeliverer of health care and health care components, including \nprescription drugs.\n  Is there a difference in the debate today? Not at all. Do the seniors \nof America want the Federal Government to control their health care or \ndo they want to control it themselves with optimum choices, similar to \nwhat we as employees of the Federal Government have today? The Federal \nGovernment doesn't control our health care. We choose. We pay some \npremium, obviously, to offset the costs, and we have choice in the \nmarketplace.\n  I think as the debate goes on through September and October, the \nclear differences will come out, and they will be very simple. I think \nit is important that we think of it that way. It is called ``Gore and \nthe Federal Government and health care,'' or ``George W. Bush and you \nand your choice at the local level delivering health care for \nyourselves with optimum choices and flexibility.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8250-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE DEMOCRATS' STRATEGY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have to respond to something that was in \ntoday's USA Today paper, September 8. I know the Presiding Officer is a \nmember of our leadership. Let me, for a few moments, tell you what he \nand I are going to expect in the final month of this Congress. I am \nquoting now an article about Senate minority leader Tom Daschle. It is \nreported here that they have a simple strategy; the Democrats have a \nsimple strategy for winning the final negotiations over spending.\n  In other words, they want to spend more of your money than we are \nproposing to be spent by some billions of dollars. Here is their \nstrategy, and he admitted it: Stall until the Republicans have to cave \nin because they can't wait any longer to recess. That means shut the \nCongress down and get out on the campaign trail. Why? Well, because 18 \nof the 29 Senators seeking reelection are Republicans this year and 11 \nare Democrats, and there are a lot of vulnerable Republicans, according \nto Senator Daschle. He says, ``We only have one vulnerable Democrat, \nand he happens to be just across the river.'' I think he was probably \nreferring to Senator Chuck Robb.\n  Well, if that is the strategy of the Democrats, let me repeat it \nbecause that is what they have been doing for 3 long months: Stall, \nstall, stall. Yet they turn around and tell our friends in the press it \nis a ``do-nothing Congress.'' I don't see how the press can mix that \none up as much as they have. You have the minority leader of the Senate \nadmitting that their strategy for the balance of September will be to \nstall until the Republicans cave.\n  Thank you, Mr. Daschle, for telling us your plan. We will attempt to \noffset those by working as hard as we can. It probably means we will be \nworking late into the night so that we can get the work of the Congress \ndone, get our appropriations bills finished, deal with the most \nimportant trade issue that is on the floor--PNTR--and that is, of \ncourse, permanent normal trade relation status for China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8250-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8250-S8252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PRESIDENT IS BEGGING FOR OIL\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for a few moments this morning, before we \nget on with the debate on PNTR, I want to deal with an issue happening \nin New York City right now. Our President is up there at the United \nNations Millennium Summit. Mr. President, there is something going on \non the side. In a back room, the President of the United States has \nbeen sitting down with a Saudi Arabian sheik. Here is why: He is \nbegging. The President of the United States is begging a Saudi sheik to \nreach over and turn their oil spigot on a little more and increase \ntheir output of oil by about 700,000 barrels a day. Why? Because in the \nlast few days, crude prices have spiked to an all-time high of $35.39 a \nbarrel.\n  Why has that happened? Because the market has analyzed that there \nisn't enough oil and the demand is ever increasing, and there is no \nstrategy in\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\nthis country to solve it. In May and June of this year, the President \ntried to cover his tracks by sending the Secretary of Energy to Saudi \nArabia to beg, tin cup in hand. At that time, I think the press called \nit the ``tin cup energy policy'' of this administration. Well, today in \nNew York City, behind closed doors, the President of the United \nStates--this great and all-powerful country--is begging a small country \nin the Middle East for just a little more oil.\n  Here is what the market analysts are saying. They have said that they \nfear that even the 700,000-barrel increase will not be enough to curb \nthe jump in prices for crude oil contracts in the futures market. I \nmentioned yesterday they jumped to $35.39 a barrel. That is a \nphenomenal spike. This price is the highest since, of course, the \nbattles of the Persian Gulf war of 1990. Why is this happening? Well, \nmany of us stood on the floor in May and June and July and discussed \nthe energy of our country and our energy needs. We were very frustrated \nat that time because we had 8 years of no energy policy. You know, Al \nGore has been OPEC's best friend. There is no question about that. This \nadministration and Vice President Gore, during their tenure in office, \nhave allowed domestic oil production to drop by 17 percent and oil \nimports to go up by at least 14, and maybe as high as 20 percent. Oil \nimports averaged about 56 percent of all of our consumption, and now \nthey are predicted to be well over 64 percent in the year 2020.\n  Of course, there is a simple reason for that: For 8 long years, this \nadministration has had no policy. Let me tell you what Vice President \nAl Gore has said. He says he wants to increase the use of natural gas, \nalthough it has nearly quadrupled in price. Yet he wants to cancel \nexisting leases. Here is his quote:\n\n       I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no \n     new drilling, even in areas already leased by previous \n     administrations.\n\n  Here is a man asking to be President of the United States; yet he is \nout in the field today campaigning and saying: I guarantee you there \nwill be no more increased production in this country, while his \nPresident, behind closed doors in New York, is begging a foreign nation \nto open its valves and increase production. Does it make any sense for \nthis great Nation to be on its knees begging Arab sheiks of the OPEC \nnations to increase production while we go around saying we are going \nto decrease production?\n  During the Clinton-Gore administration, there has been no energy \npolicy, no domestic oil or gas exploration or production--in 8 long \nyears. No new oil refineries. In fact, because of a lack of policy and \ncompliance with the Clean Air Act in this country, in the last 8 years, \nwe have closed 36 oil refineries. That is a staggering amount. We have \nclosed 36 oil refineries in the past 8 years. There is no new use of \ncoal. EPA has tried to shut down coal fired plants and are now suing \nsome in the East because they don't think they are in compliance with \ncertain standards. There is no new nuclear power. In fact, quite the \nopposite has happened. We have tried here to solve the gridlock over \nthe production of energy and electricity by nuclear power, only to have \nitems vetoed time and again by the President.\n  Now, yesterday, the President said oil prices are too high. Gee whiz, \nBill, where have you been all summer? You're darn right they are too \nhigh. You have done nothing about it nor has your Vice President, \nexcept to say we will shut down production. He even went on to say that \nit will impact not just America but it could result in a world impact, \nand it could result in the specter of a recession here or abroad if \noil-producing countries do not raise production to bring down soaring \ncrude prices.\n  Well, what about production in our country? What are you doing here, \nVice President Gore? I will tell you what you are doing here. You are \nsaying: I am not going to allow new drilling; I am going to shut off \nthe areas where you can drill. I don't want to see more production in \nthis country.\n  That doesn't make a lot of sense.\n  Here is Gore's new energy plan:\n  Don't develop proven domestic energy;\n  Give $75 billion in new subsidies for new renewables and new \ntechnology.\n  OK. Homeowner in the Northeast: You are just about to see your costs \nfor heat this winter go up 35, or 40, or 50 percent. The message to \nyou, homeowner, in the Northeast is: Vice President Gore is going to \ninvest $75 billion in subsidies and in new renewables, and in 10 or 15 \nyears you can put a solar cell up or we can put a wind machine out on \nthe Adirondacks, and somehow we will generate this new abundance of \nenergy.\n  That is the answer for the problem today. That is the answer you are \nbeing given. That will not work tomorrow. It will not work a week from \nnow.\n  I support renewables. We ought to clearly drive ourselves in that \ndirection as best we can. But my guess is when what is going on today \ntranslates into the price of gas at the pump, and when the oil truck \nbacks up to your home in New York or Connecticut this winter and sticks \nthe hose in the oil barrel and starts cranking in the fuel oil that \nwill heat your home, and it is going to double or triple your fuel oil \ncosts, if it is available, who are you going to blame? Who are you \ngoing to blame because of this dramatic increase?\n  My suggestion is that fingers deserve to be pointed to an \nadministration that has had no energy policy, has worked to shut down \nall increased production, and, in fact, in a rather swaggering way has \nsuggested we will not drill anymore. We will not produce anymore. It is \nsomehow environmentally wrong to produce oil and energy in this \ncountry. That is a fundamentally critical thing with which we have to \ndeal.\n  We have attempted to deal with it in the Senate. We have dealt with \nthese issues on a regular basis. We have introduced legislation to \nbring about that increased production. We have suggested that these \ngreat oil reserves we still have remaining in our country be allowed to \nbe drilled, and in an environmentally safe and sound way, that we bring \nour production back on line.\n  In the nonlarge oil producing segment of our country, a segment \ncalled stripper wells, oftentimes owned by farmers and ranchers through \nthe Southeast, the South, and the upper Midwest--if we, by tax \nincentives alone, would guarantee them a margin, we could see a million \nbarrels a day come back on line--our oil; money that stays in our \ncountry and doesn't go to Saudi Arabia to buy the limousines or the G-4 \njet airplanes of the OPEC sheiks.\n  What is wrong with that policy, Mr. President? What is wrong with \nthat policy, Mr. Gore? Is it wrong to support domestic production at \nhome? I think not.\n  This is an issue we will spend a good deal more time with in the \ncoming days. But I thought with this press release coming out of New \nYork today, and we know the President has been talking with the Arab \nsheiks yesterday, Mr. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, quit begging. Don't \nbeg these nations to produce. Turn our producers loose. Let us produce. \nLet us become the great producing country again. Let us be the masters \nof our own destiny. Don't apologize. And don't suggest to somebody this \nwinter when their heating bill goes up that it is some Arab sheik's \nproblem, that they shut the oil off. No. In the last 8 years, you have \nshut the oil off, Mr. Gore. You have shut the oil off, Mr. Clinton, \nbecause your policies have denied production and brought production \ndown at a time when we were increasing consumption and were the \nbeneficiaries of that consumption by an ever increased standard of \nliving in our country.\n\n  I am not ashamed, nor will I apologize for the citizens of my State \nbecause they want to be consumers. But I will be angry about a \ngovernment that denies the kind of production that keeps the strong \neconomy. And that is exactly what is going on. In our great country \ntoday, the only energy policy that exists in the Clinton/Gore \nadministration is a policy of begging, begging the producing nations of \nthis world to please turn on the valves and give us a few more barrels \nof oil in hopes that it will drive the price down. The analysts say it \nwon't.\n  This winter, as we grow increasingly cold, I am very fearful the \ncitizens of the Northeast and in other cold areas, especially those who \nstill use heating oil for their space heat, will find the price tag \ngetting even higher, and my colleagues will be on the floor asking that \nwe offset that with Federal tax\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\ndollars. I will not blame them for asking that.\n  But once again I will ask: Where was Mr. Gore? Where was Mr. Clinton \nfor these 8 long years when they knew the day would come that there \nwould be no oil to burn and we would have to beg to get oil?\n  I yield the floor. I see the principals are on the floor to continue \nthe debate on PNTR with China. I hope we can move that expeditiously \ntoday. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8252-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8252-S8256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n                           REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Chafee). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume the consideration of H.R. 4444, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4444) to authorize extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to the People's Republic of China, and to \n     establish a framework for relations between the United States \n     and the People's Republic of China.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Wellstone amendment No. 4118, to require that the President \n     certify to Congress that the People's Republic of China has \n     taken certain actions with respect to ensuring human rights \n     protection.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 4119, to require that the President \n     certify to Congress that the People's Republic of China is in \n     compliance with certain Memoranda of Understanding regarding \n     prohibition on import and export of prison labor products.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 4120, to require that the President \n     certify to Congress that the People's Republic of China has \n     responded to inquiries regarding certain people who have been \n     detained or imprisoned and has made substantial progress in \n     releasing from prison people incarcerated for organizing \n     independent trade unions.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 4121, to strengthen the rights of \n     workers to associate, organize and strike.\n       Smith (of N.H.) amendment No. 4129, to require that the \n     Congressional-Executive Commission monitor the cooperation of \n     the People's Republic of China with respect to POW/MIA \n     issues, improvement in the areas of forced abortions, slave \n     labor, and organ harvesting.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan, and myself have been here \nfor several hours for the purpose of making progress on the \nconsideration of the permanent normal trade relations with China. We \nboth agreed that this is the most important vote we will face this \nyear. In fact, it may be the most important vote we have had this \ndecade. But I am deeply concerned that we are not having any of our \ncolleagues making themselves available to come down to bring up the \namendments that they say they want to offer.\n  Time is running out. This is the third day we have been on this bill. \nI thought we made some very good progress yesterday. We considered a \nnumber of amendments. But it is absolutely critically important that we \ncontinue to make that kind of progress today and next week.\n  I point out that the regular order of business is that if there are \nno amendments we ought to proceed to the vote on the legislation \nitself.\n  I want every Senator to have the opportunity to offer any amendments \nthey may care to offer because there is no question about the \nimportance of this legislation. But we cannot wait indefinitely. I ask \nmy friends on both sides--on the Republican side and on the Democratic \nside--who have amendments that they want to offer on this critically \nimportant piece of legislation to please come down now. Time is running \nout.\n  Would the Senator from New York not agree with that?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wholly agree with the statement by our \nrevered chairman of the Finance Committee. The operative part of this \nmeasure is two pages. It is a simple statement. It came out from the \nFinance Committee almost unanimously.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That would be four months ago, in mid-May. There has \nbeen plenty of time to examine it. The House bill has a few additional \nfeatures we find attractive and which we think we could adopt and send \nright to the President who would sign it. It is a bipartisan measure.\n  There are those who do not want this legislation.\n  It has been avowedly, unashamedly, and legitimately their desire to \nprolong the debate until time runs out. If they could just add one \namendment, the measure would have to go back to the House, then to \nconference, then to the floor. Time would run out.\n  We have passed two appropriations bills. We are in a Presidential \nelection year. That election is less than 60 days away. The desire to \nget back to our constituencies is legitimate and proper. Therefore, the \ndevice of delay is a legitimate, recognized, and familiar strategy.\n  However, this is not a matter on which to delay. The Chairman was \nabsolutely right, this may be the most important vote we take this \ndecade. In my opening statement, I referred to the testimony of Ira \nShapiro, our former Chief Negotiator for Japan and Canada at the Office \nof the U.S. Trade Representative. He, just by chance, concluded his \ntestimony, in the last testimony we heard, as it happened:\n\n       . . . [this vote] is one of an historic handful of \n     Congressional votes since the end of World War II. Nothing \n     that Members of Congress do this year--or any other year--\n     could be more important.\n\n  Well, let us be about it. We look around and we are happy to see our \nfriend from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, who wishes to speak on \nbehalf of the measure. We welcome any other Member who wishes to speak. \nWe have heard many. The real matter before the Senate is those who wish \nto offer amendments. A good friend, a distinguished Senator, the \nchairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, laid down a \nmeasure last evening. We had to juggle our schedule to go to the water \nappropriations measure. But he is not here this morning. He claimed a \nplace--which is fine, legitimately--but the place is empty. When I \narrived, as when the Chairman arrived, looking to start the amendment \nprocess, no one was here.\n  Now, sir, there can be only one response, and the Chairman has stated \nit. On Tuesday, I hope the Majority Leader will move to close debate by \ninvoking cloture. It is a process with which we are familiar. We are \nnot cutting off amendments; amendments will be in order afterwards. But \nwe are sitting here asking for amendments, and none comes forward. This \nmatter is of the utmost gravity, urgency, the issues that are in \nbalance, and not just economic issues but political, military issues of \nthe most important level. That is what is at stake. If nobody wishes to \ndebate it, let's proceed to a final vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me say to my distinguished colleague, I \ncould not agree more with his statement as to the importance of \noffering any amendments Members desire to offer. I am told we have \nactually been on this bill 4 days this week.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And before we had the August recess.\n  Mr. ROTH. And before we had the August recess, we had discussion; \nthat is correct.\n  I say to Senator Moynihan, I think it is important we take some time \ntoday. I am delighted our friend from South Dakota is here. We will \ncall upon him to make his remarks. I think it is important that the \nAmerican people fully understand why this legislation is of such \ncritical importance. It is important to our economy and to our growth. \nIt is particularly important to provide better and more jobs to the \nworking people of America. I can't stress how much I think it is \nimportant to agriculture in my little State of Delaware.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Did you say the ``little State of Delaware''? Do you \nmean the first State to ratify the Constitution of the United States?\n  Mr. ROTH. You are absolutely right. I stand corrected.\n  In my State of Delaware, the people are waiting to see action on \nthis.\n  For farmers, take poultry. It is critically important to the economy \nof my State. China is the second largest importer of poultry and has \noffered to cut the tariff in half. This makes a tremendous opportunity.\n  The same thing with automobiles. I bet the Senator didn't know this.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I bet I did, sir, because I heard it from your very \nself\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\nseveral times. I believe you are the second largest producer of \nautomobiles in the Nation.\n  Mr. ROTH. We have more workers, percentage-wise, than any other \nState, including Michigan. There are significant concessions made with \nrespect to automobiles.\n  Chemicals, likewise, are critically important to my State.\n  After my distinguished friend from South Dakota finishes, it might be \nworthwhile to spell out to the American people why this legislation is \nof such critical importance.\n  Perhaps we ought to recognize Senator Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from \nDelaware and New York.\n  Mr. President, my purpose today is to share some thoughts about the \ncritical importance of PNTR legislation. Because my good friend and \ncolleague from Idaho, just prior to my opportunity this morning, \ndiscussed the role of my good colleague from South Dakota, Senator \nDaschle, relative to the timing of legislation, I do feel compelled to \nmake a remark or two in that regard.\n  No one in this body has done more than Senator Daschle of South \nDakota to move legislation forward in an expeditious and well-timed \nmanner. Whether it is PNTR, where Senator Daschle has for months been \ntrying to bring this bill to the floor, or the Patients' Bill of \nRights, prescription drugs, school construction, minimum wage, and down \nthe entire list of legislative agenda items before this body, Senator \nDaschle has been tireless in his efforts to bring them to the floor, to \nhave consideration in a full manner. For anyone to suggest that somehow \nour good colleague from South Dakota would be playing some role in \nslowing down progress on these or other matters, I think, is a point \nsimply not correct.\n  I comment as well that while the President of the United States is \nseeking additional fuel from Saudi Arabia, it strikes me, and strikes \nothers who are not concerned about the partisan politics of this, that \nis what we would expect the President of the United States to be doing \nat this summit conference in New York--trying to address the various \ncomponents of energy policy necessary to reduce costs and increase the \navailability of fuel for American consumers. If the President were not \ndoing that, there is no doubt there would be criticism leveled at him \nfor doing nothing to negotiate and use American leverage with our OPEC \nneighbors and the world.\n  I think some of this discussion earlier this morning has to be seen \nand evaluated in light of the fact that we are in this last month or \ntwo before a Presidential election. The partisan swords clearly have \nbeen drawn this morning. I should never be shocked at that, I suppose, \nparticularly in an election year at this time of the year. But it is my \nhope that through all of this partisan political rhetoric, the American \npublic will see through that. I think it is transparent.\n  We need to work together in a bipartisan fashion. One of the things I \nam pleased about this morning is the bipartisan nature of our support \nfor permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of \nChina. Our distinguished colleague, Senator Moynihan, who, among his \nother talents, is perhaps the finest scholar in this body--for many \nyears, many generations--has observed that this may be one of the half \ndozen most critically important votes that we as Senators will take \nsince the end of World War II.\n  Obviously, this issue is of enormous import in terms of economic \npolicy, economic strategy for the United States. It is a win situation \nfor us. It is one sided. They give up limitations against the export of \nAmericans goods. We give up nothing. But even if economic issues were a \nwash, even if there were not these kinds of obvious economic benefits \nfor the United States, the geopolitical consequences of integrating the \nPeople's Republic of China's 1.3 billion people into the world rule of \nlaw, into the international community of nations to help stabilize the \nongoing process of democratization and the free flow of ideas and \nscholars and business leaders is, in itself, reason enough for support \nfor permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  So I rise to express my strong support for H.R. 4444, legislation \nwhich would grant PNTR to the People's Republic of China. In the past, \nCongress has had to pass legislation each and every year to ensure \nmutually beneficial relations between our two nations. Now we have \nreached the point where permanent normal trade relations with the \nPeople's Republic of China is appropriate and will help pave the way \nfor the World Trade Organization, WTO, membership for the PRC, and will \nstrike a blow for the rule of law throughout the world.\n  I am joining the leadership of both parties to oppose all amendments \nto PNTR, due to the very late stage of the congressional session in \nwhich we are taking up this bill. Many Senators will offer important \namendments to H.R. 4444 concerning worker's rights, religious freedom, \nand human rights in the PRC. I support efforts to improve China's human \nrights record, the right of workers to organize, and religious freedom \nin China. But, I believe that jeopardizing H.R. 4444 is exactly the \nwrong approach. As a nation, we have attempted to promote global human \nrights, democracy, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. While \neach nation ultimately determines for itself whether to pursue \ndemocracy and other American-supported values, I support efforts to \nopen China to trade with democratic cultures. I am also opposed, \nobviously, to religious persecution and will support efforts to \ndiscourage it in China. However, there are other pieces of legislation \nthat can be used to achieve these goals. The PNTR bill must be adopted \nin an amendment-free fashion if we are to avoid its ultimate defeat. \nWith few days remaining in Congress, a PNTR bill adopted by the Senate \nthat differs from the clean bill passed in the House of Representatives \nwould force us to convene a conference committee to iron out the bill's \ndifferences. The result--significant delay which would be compounded by \nthe margin in which the House adopted H.R. 4444 in May. Sending PNTR \nback to the House for another vote very likely means its ultimate \ndefeat for this year. At this late stage in Congress, that is not an \nacceptable strategy for any of us to endorse.\n  It is true this vote is of significant importance to family farmers, \nranchers, and independent businesses in South Dakota and the entire \ncountry. However, this vote means much, much more--I believe this vote \nsignifies one of the most critical geo-political votes the U.S. Senate \nwill take since World War II.\n  China, with its 1.2 billion people and one of the fastest growing \neconomies in the world, needs to be required to live by the discipline \nof international law. That is what World Trade Organization--[WTO] \nmembership would mean. China would have to open up its agricultural and \nother markets to the world, and it would not be permitted to violate \ninternational rules on copyright or patents. As a result of PNTR, I \nbelieve the presence of western consumer products, the exchange of \ndemocratic principles, and the free flow of ideas via technology and \ninternet communication will do more to undermine authoritarian aspects \nof China's government than any kind of isolation could possibly \naccomplish--particularly unilateral isolation on the part of the United \nStates. I feel very strongly that we need to build more bridges of \nunderstanding and cooperation between western democracies and the PRC, \nrather than work for the contrary. In the meantime, the biggest winners \nof all in establishing the same normalized trading relationships with \nChina that we have with almost every other nation on the planet will be \nAmerican farmers and ranchers and small businesses.\n  The bilateral deal struck between the United States and China on \nNovember 15, 1999 is a completely one-sided trade agreement. China will \nbe required to allow more of our goods into their country, while the \nUnited States will not be required to change a thing. Frankly, a \nfailure to enact PNTR will simply mean that every other country in the \nworld would have open access to Chinese markets, but the United States \nwould have virtually none. Since the United States has few barriers to \ntrade, and current trade restrictions are almost exclusively on the \npart of China and other nations, WTO agreements in\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\ngeneral are overwhelmingly to the benefit of the United States.\n  I have been to China and witnessed first-hand the opportunities for \ngreater market access there. Since 1998, I have facilitated a series of \ntrade missions to improve relations with China. The relationships we \nhave built in this course of time may open markets for the farmers and \nranchers of South Dakota and the United States.\n  In March of 1998, my office hosted senior trade and agriculture \nofficials from the Chinese Embassy on a trade mission to South Dakota. \nThe officials toured the John Morrell meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls, \nthe South Dakota Wheat Growers Cooperative in Aberdeen, and the Harvest \nStates Feed Mill in Sioux Falls. During their visit, the Chinese trade \nofficials also witnessed the ingenuity of South Dakota businesses like \nGateway of North Sioux City, Daktronics of Brookings, and Wildcat \nManufacturing of Freeman. The officials were impressed with our \ndiversified economy and the quality and pride in our products.\n  In a follow-up mission, in December of 1998, I led a delegation of \nSouth Dakota farmers to the PRC. We met with trade officials and \nscholars at the Ministry of Agriculture, Beijing University, and \nMinistry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\n  Finally, in May of 1999, a 29-member delegation of Chinese trade \nofficials traveled to South Dakota at my request to further explore \nagricultural trade opportunities. These Chinese officials met with farm \ngroup leaders, toured farming and ranching operations, and visited the \nSouth Dakota Soybean Processors plant near Volga.\n  My visit to China, and discussions with Chinese trade officials, \nindicate that family farmers and ranchers in South Dakota are ideally \nsituated to help satisfy the needs of China's 1.2 billion residents, \nwho exhibit a growing appetite for a more sophisticated diet. China's \nagricultural production capabilities just cannot satisfy their people's \nneeds right now, especially considering the country represents a mere 7 \npercent of the world's arable land.\n  South Dakota agricultural exports in 1998 reached $1.1 billion and \nsupported nearly 17,000 jobs. While Congress needs to place a much \ngreater emphasis on improving domestic policies--like reforming the \n1996 farm bill--greater access to closed-off markets will provide a \nboost to our agricultural economy too. Two-thirds of the prosperity or \ndecline in South Dakota agriculture still depends upon a fair \nmarketplace price here at home. I believe Congress has failed to make \ncommon sense reforms to the farm bill which may allow farmers to take \nadvantage of a fair market. Nonetheless, one-third of our agricultural \neconomy requires trade with other nations. Under the agreement we \nstruck with China, South Dakota farmers and ranchers will no longer \nhave to compete with unfair tariffs, unscientific bans, and export \nsubsidies on China's agricultural goods.\n  Beef cattle receipts represent the largest share of South Dakota's \nagricultural economy. China currently imports very little beef, but a \ngrowing middle class and rising demand from urban areas are expected to \nresult in significantly increased demand for beef imports. China has \nagreed to lower tariffs on beef meat products from 45 to 12 percent, \nwhich may mean better returns for independent cattle ranchers in South \nDakota. In addition, tariffs on pork imports into China will decline \nfrom 20 to 12 percent, aiding South Dakota's pork products as well.\n  Wheat farmers in South Dakota desire greater access to the Chinese \nmarketplace. As a result of our agreement with China, they will \neliminate their unscientific ban on Pacific Northwest wheat imports \nfrom the United States. They will also agree to a substantial increase \nin the amount of wheat they purchase under their tariff rate quota. In \n1998 China imported a mere 2 million metric tons of wheat. Our \nagreement will allow China to purchase up to 9.6 million tons of wheat \nbelow tariff rate quotas. In fact, in February of this year, China \nbought nearly 800,000 bushels of hard red winter and spring wheat from \nSouth Dakota and several other wheat growing states. While a relatively \nsmall transaction, their commitment to more open trade with the U.S. is \nexhibited with this purchase.\n  Furthermore, as a large soybean producer, South Dakota's soybean \nfarmers and farmer-owned processors of soybeans will benefit from a \ntariff cut China agreed to make on United States soybean exports. South \nDakota farmers also produce substantial bushels of feed grain and corn. \nChina agreed to make market-oriented changes to their tariff rate quota \nsystem on corn, nearly doubling the amount of corn they import under \ntheir tariff quota rate.\n  While South Dakota agriculture is poised to benefit from greater \ntrade with China, other businesses in our state are set to become major \nexporters under a more market-oriented trading system granted by PNTR \nfor China as well. In fact, electronics and electronic equipment today \ncomprise 78 percent of total South Dakota exports to China. More than \nhalf of the South Dakota firms, 58 percent, that export to China are \nsmall and mid-sized enterprises--with fewer than 500 employees--and \nseveral are family owned. China will liberalize quotas on manufacturing \nequipment, information technology products, and electronic goods \nproduced right in South Dakota. This means our computer manufacturers \nlike Gateway and equipment firms like Wildcat Manufacturing will find \ngreater access to that nation.\n  From 1993 to 1998, South Dakota's exports to China nearly doubled--\nincreasing by over 91 percent. I believe that if the Senate adopts H.R. \n4444, South Dakota farmers, ranchers, and businesses will see \ntremendous new trade opportunities.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to take advantage of this historic \nopportunity before us. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting passage of a clean PNTR bill so that it can be sent to the \nPresident and signed into law in a proper fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Kentucky will \nindulge me for a 90-second comment, I thank my friend from South Dakota \nfor that superb address of the importance of a mixed economy and the \ncontacts they already have. I ask to be indulged a moment from an \nacademic past.\n  I was once a colleague and remained a good friend of Raymond Vernon, \nan economist who developed the theory of the product cycle: How a \nproduct begins to be produced in one nation, then will be exported, \nconsumed abroad, then produced abroad and exported back. This goes on.\n  The soybean--I now have to invoke my age in this regard. I remember \nas a boy in the 1930s reading in the Reader's Digest about this magic \nlittle bean that was grown in China and contained proteins of \nunimaginable consequence and would some day come to our country and be \ngrown, and we would all be so much healthier and happier.\n  That happened, and now those very Chinese are coming to South Dakota \nnegotiating the sale of soybeans back to China. This is Vernon's \nproduct cycle, part of the dynamism of trade. It is never one way. It \ngoes back and forth, not to be feared, not by us. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to granting \npermanent normal trade relations to China, and in support of Senator \nThompson's China Non-proliferation Act.\n  It is a sad time in the Senate. Soon we are going to vote on \nextending permanent normal trade relations--PNTR--to China. And it \nlooks like it is going to pass.\n  If we grant PNTR and give our seal of approval to China's application \nto join the World Trade Organization, Congress will not only relinquish \nits best chance to scrutinize China's behavior on a regular basis, but \nit will also give away what little leverage we have to bring about \nreal, true change in China. I think that is a serious and dangerous \nmistake.\n  For years, we have been able to annually debate trade with China in \nCongress, and to use the debate to discuss the wisdom of granting broad \ntrade privileges to Communist China.\n  When the Chinese troops massacred the students in Tiananmen Square, \nor when the Chinese military threatened democracy on neighboring \nTaiwan, or when revelations came to light about China spreading weapons \nof mass destruction to terrorist nations, we had a chance in the House \nand Senate to shine the spotlight on Communist China.\n  I served on the House Ways and Means Committee for 8 years, and\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\nevery year we debated most-favored nation trade--so-called MFN status--\nfor China. Supporters of MFN always had the votes to pass it, but it \nwas still an important opportunity to focus attention on China's \nmisdeeds and to make sure the American public knew about China's dirty \nlittle secrets. Now we are going to lose that ability.\n  I would like to take some time today to talk about why we should not \ngrant PNTR to China and explain my reasons for opposing it. While I \nknow that the votes are probably there to pass PNTR, I want to lay out \nfor the record what is at stake and also to argue that we should at a \nminimum take the step of also passing Senator Thompson's bill to \nmaintain some semblance of accountability for Communist China.\n  First, let's look at China's record when it comes to arms control and \nthe spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n  There is no doubt that China's practice of making weapons of mass \ndestruction available to rogue states like North Korea, Iran, and Libya \nhas made the world a more dangerous place.\n  The commission led by Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that \nrecently examined this problem pointed out in its final report that \nChina is ``a significant proliferator of ballistic missiles, weapons of \nmass destruction and enabling technologies.''\n  We know Communist China has sold nuclear components and missiles to \nPakistan, missile parts to Libya, cruise missiles to Iran, and that it \nshared sensitive technologies with North Korea.\n  In the last few months it has even been reported in the press that \nChina is building another missile plant in Pakistan, and is illegally \nusing American supercomputers to improve its nuclear weapon technology.\n  Many of these technologies are being used by enemies of America to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.\n  In short, Beijing is guilty of spreading the most dangerous weapons \nimaginable to some of the most treacherous and threatening states on \nthe globe.\n  That is about as bad as it gets.\n  From experience, we know that China doesn't change its policies just \nbecause we ask them to. China only makes serious non-proliferation \ncommitments under the threat of the actual imposition of sanctions.\n  We have to hold their feet to the fire. A memorandum from the \nassistant director at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency to the \nClinton White House in 1996 makes the case:\n\n       The history of U.S.-China relations shows that China has \n     made specific non-proliferation commitments only under the \n     threat or imposition of sanctions. Beijing made commitments \n     [to limit missile technology exports] in 1992 and 1994, in \n     exchange for our lifting of sanctions.\n\n  Over the years, it is only when the United States has clearly brought \neconomic pressure to bear on China that we have seen real, hard results \nfrom Beijing.\n  For instance, economic pressure in the late 1980s and early 1990s led \nto China's agreement to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in \n1992.\n  In 1991, the Bush administration applied sanctions against China \nafter Beijing transferred missile technology to Pakistan. Five months \nlater, China made the commitment to abide by the missile technology \ncontrol regime.\n  In 1993, the Clinton administration imposed sanctions on Beijing for \nthe sale of M-11 missile equipment to Pakistan in violation of \ninternational arms control agreements. Over a year later, Beijing \nbacked down by agreeing not to export ground-to-ground missiles in \nexchange for our lifting of sanctions.\n  Time and time again we have seen that Chinese respond to the stick, \nand not the carrot. And this experience certainly points to the fact \nthat the threat of sanctions like those in the Thompson bill, and not \nthe olive branch of greater trade, is what the Chinese will respect.\n  Beijing's behavior has not been much better when it comes to \ndemocratic Taiwan.\n  I have been to Taiwan, and seen how its commitment to democracy and \nthe free market has enabled that country to build one of the most \nvibrant economies in the world.\n  Taiwan is a friend of the United States and a good ally.\n  But time and time again Communist China has rattled its saber and \nthreatened the very existence of free Taiwan. Less than 5 years ago, \nChina actually fired missiles over Taiwan.\n  Since then China has conducted a massive military buildup across the \nTaiwan strait.\n  Last year, CIA Director Tenet reported to Congress that while China \nclaims it doesn't want conflict with Taiwan, ``It refuses to renounce \nthe use of force as an option and continues to place its best new \nmilitary equipment across from the island.''\n  This belligerent attitude threatens not only Taiwan, but more \nominously relations throughout East Asia.\n  The Pentagon's 1998 East Asian strategy report notes that many of \n``China's neighbors are closely monitoring China's growing defense \nexpenditures and modernization of the People's Liberation Army, \nincluding development and acquisition of advanced fighter aircraft; \nprograms to develop mobile ballistic systems, land-attack and anti-ship \ncruise missiles, and advanced surface-to-air missiles; and a range of \npower projection platforms.''\n  Recently there seems to have been a thaw in relations between China \nand Taiwan. This is a hopeful sign. But who knows when Beijing will \nchange course and revert to its belligerent ways. We need to help keep \nthe pressure on.\n  Eliminating the annual debate on China trade in Congress will remove \none of our most effective and high-profile options in pressuring the \nChinese. In dealing with an adversary as tenacious and patient as \nChina, this is exactly the wrong philosophy to adopt.\n  Even more ominous than threats to Taiwan have been recent signs of \nincreased Chinese belligerence toward the United States.\n  In February, 1999, the CIA reported to Congress that China is \ndeveloping air and naval systems ``intended to deter the United States \nfrom involvement in Taiwan and to extend China's fighting capabilities \nbeyond its coastline.''\n  And we should not forget the recent threat from a Chinese general to \nfire a nuclear weapon at Los Angeles if the United States were to \ninterfere in Taiwan-China relations.\n  There are even indications that China's military could be \nanticipating a confrontation with the United States.\n  In January, 1999, the Washington Times reported that for the first \ntime, China's army conducted mock attacks on United States troops \nstationed in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  Intelligence also reported that United States troops in South Korea \nand Japan were envisioned as potential targets of these practice \nattacks.\n  President Reagan used to talk about adopting a policy of peace \nthrough strength in approaching the Russians during the cold war. That \npolicy worked then, and it should be the policy we follow in \nconfronting the Chinese.\n  All of the experts tell us that China potentially poses the strongest \nmilitary and economic threat to America in the 21st century.\n  Passing PNTR sends the signal to China that we want trade more than \nwe want peace.\n  Instead, we should heed the lessons we learned in winning the cold \nwar and understand that the Communist Chinese are more likely to \nrespect our strength than to fear our weakness.\n  Finally, the strongest case against PNTR can be made based on China's \npathetic, indefensible human rights record.\n  Let me quote from the very first paragraph of our own State \nDepartment's most recent report on human rights in China:\n\n       The People's Republic of China is an authoritarian state in \n     which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount source of \n     all power. At the national and regional levels, party members \n     hold almost all top government, police and military \n     positions. Ultimate authority rests with members of the \n     Politburo. Leaders stress the need to maintain stability and \n     social order and are committed to perpetuating the rule of \n     the Communist Party and its hierarchy. Citizens lack both the \n     freedom peacefully to express opposition to the party-led \n     political system and the right to change their national \n     leaders or form of government.\n\n  The report goes on to note that in 1999:\n\n       The government's poor human rights record deteriorated \n     markedly throughout the year, as the government intensified \n     efforts to suppress dissent, particularly organized dissent.\n\n  That is our own State Department saying that. It doesn't sound like a \nnation that we want to encourage with expanded trade privileges.\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\n  Many of my friends in this body argue that China is making progress \non human rights, and that expanded trade and western influence will \nhelp turn the tide. They tell me that in China things have improved \ndramatically in recent years.\n  I say, tell that to the tens of thousands of members of the Fulan \nGong who have been hunted down and punished by Beijing over the past 2 \nyears.\n  Tell that to the prisoners in China's Gulags who continue to suffer \nunder conditions that, in our own State Department's words, are \n``harsh'' and ``degrading''.\n  Tell that to the political dissents who are jailed out without charge \nonly because they threaten the communist party's political dominance.\n  Tell that to the children who were murdered because of China's brutal \none child per family policy.\n  Tell that to the people of Tibet.\n  Mr. President, all those who say that things are getting better in \nChina and that PNTR will help improve conditions in China are wrong.\n  It's been 11 years since the Tiananmen Square Massacre, and the \nChinese Government still carries out the same brutal, repressive \ntactics.\n  Things aren't getting any better in China. They're only getting \nworse.\n  The supporters of PNTR made the same argument year after year during \nthe annual debates on most-favored-nation status for China. And year \nand year, Beijing showed no sign of changing its ways. None.\n  In one way, this is a hard vote for me, Mr. President. Many of my \nfriends support expanded trade privileges for China, and they make an \nenthusiastic argument for expanding access to Chinese markets in order \nto help American business compete with their overseas competitors.\n  My gut reaction is to vote for free and expanded trade. In my mind, \nthere isn't any doubt that the world is really drawing closer and \ncloser together, and that it will be through trade that the United \nStates can take advantage of its economic and technological advantages \nto maintain our dominant position in the world.\n  But in other, more important, ways this vote is easy is for me--\nbecause the issues are so clear when it comes to China, and because \nChina's behavior has made it so undeserving of improved trade ties with \nthe United States.\n  Mr. President, I've tried to simplify this issue in my mind and I've \nboiled it down to a single question that I've asked of everyone I have \ntalked to about China trade:\n  Why should we give the best trade privileges possible under our law \nto a communist nation that so clearly threatens us and our values?\n  We didn't grant most-favored-nation status to Russia during the cold \nwar. But now we are on the verge of passing the most privileged trade \nstatus we can give to the communist nation that is bent not only on \nsupplanting America as the dominant economic power in the world, but is \nalso actively supporting dangerous, rogue nations that threaten our \ncitizens and our way of life.\n  It just doesn't make sense.\n  In conclusion, I urge a ``no'' vote on the China PNTR bill, and a \n``yes'' vote on the Thompson bill. The Chinese have not earned the \nright to trade with us, and they have show no inclination to change \ntheir ways.\n  Senator Thompson's proposal is at least a modest attempt to preserve \nour options and to keep closer tabs on Communist China in case things \ntake a turn for the worse.\n  For years, the pro-China trade forces have argued that expanding \ntrade with China is the carrot we can use to bring about democratic \nchange in that country. The evidence has proven them wrong time and \ntime again.\n  Years of continuing MFN, or NTR, or whatever you want to call it \nhaven't changed things in China. When it comes to China, the old saying \nstill holds true: the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n  Trade has not worked before as a carrot, and it certainly won't work \nin the future if we remove the stick of annual reviews and possible \nsanctions. That's why it's so crucial that we pass the China Non-\nProliferation Act.\n  Mr. President, when President Reagan negotiated arms control with the \nRussians, he used an old Russian phrase to sum up his approach--trust \nbut verify. That strategy worked.\n  But by granting PNTR we are trusting, but failing to verify. In fact, \nwe are even giving up what little ability we even have to verify. The \nChinese certainly haven't given us any reason to take them at their \nword.\n  We need to verify and the Thompson bill is our best hope of insuring \nthat China will live up to its word. Otherwise, why should we blindly \ntrust a country that has proven time and time again that it doesn't \nlive or play by the rules.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8256-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXTENSION OF VITIATION ORDER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to discuss why \npermanent normal trade relations with China are of such critical \nimportance to the United States.\n  One of the most remarkable strengths of the economy has been its \nability to deliver a rising standard of\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\nliving and the creation of high-paying jobs. Trade plays a very \ncritical role in achieving both goals. In that respect, normalizing our \ntrade relations with China represents a positive step forward for \nAmerican business, American farmers, American workers, and American \nconsumers.\n  Just let me speak very briefly about security because we will discuss \nthat in greater detail at a later time. Moving ahead with trading \nrelations with China will help promote the rule of law and the \nacceptance of the way we do business in the international market. This \nwill help strengthen the hands of those who are most interested in \npromoting the rule of law. Security-wise, if we reject PNTR, there is \nno question but what we play into the hands of the militants, the \nCommunists, who want no change, the Communists who oppose promoting a \nmarket economy.\n  So I just want to say, as we discuss the economics of this agreement, \nthat it is also critically important from the standpoint of \nstrengthening those who want to bring China into the international \ncommunity. What international trade does is let us focus on what we do \nbest.\n  Our exports are an indicator of where we have a strong comparative \nadvantage because we are more efficient in producing those goods than \nwe are at producing others. Those industries where we are most \nefficient represent our economic future. Over the past 20 years, trade \nas a percentage of the U.S. gross domestic product has increased by \nmore than 50 percent. Exports of goods and services this past year was \nclose to $1 trillion. It is no surprise that the export sectors of our \neconomy have grown faster than the economy as a whole. Nor is it any \nsurprise that export-based jobs pay on average of 15 percent more than \nthe prevailing wage. According to recent reports by Standard & Poor's \neconomic consulting arm, DRI, the benefits are 32.5 percent higher \noverall than with jobs in nonexport industries.\n  Those figures reflect the fact that an increase in our exports \ntranslate into new opportunities for workers and industries with a \ngreater number of higher paying jobs.\n  Since 1992, the strong U.S. economy has created more than 11 million \njobs, of which 1.5 million--or more than 10 percent--have been high-\nwage export-related jobs.\n  The significance of PNTR to that overall picture is obvious. \nAccording to estimates by Goldman, Sachs, normalizing our trade \nrelations with China and opening China's market through the WTO will \nresult in an increase in our exports of $13 billion annually; thus \nChina's accession to the WTO will enhance the economic prospects for \nU.S. export-led industries, and employment opportunities for U.S. \nworkers in higher paying export-related jobs.\n  Exports, however, are only half of the trade picture and only half of \nthe story of normalizing our trade relations with China. We benefit \nfrom imports as well. Being able to trade for goods that we are \nrelatively less efficient in producing means that investments in our \nown economy are channeled to more productive use. That enhances our \nability to maintain higher than expected economic growth.\n\n  Imports also enhance the competitiveness of American firms regardless \nof whether they participate in international markets. The ability to \nbuy at the lowest price and for the highest quality component allows \nAmerican firms to deliver their goods and services to both U.S. markets \nand markets overseas at competitive prices.\n  International trade also has a broader microeconomic benefit of \nkeeping inflation low. International competition yields more efficient \nproducers who are under constant pressure to deliver goods and services \nat the lowest price possible. The United States benefits from increases \nin productivity that allow us to make more from less from the \ncompetition, and that yields lower prices for goods and services across \nthe board.\n  To the extent that international competition helps keep inflation in \ncheck, it also allows the Fed to keep interest rates low. There is no \ndoubt that keeping interest rates low not only helps consumers when \nbuying a home or a car but deepens the pool of low-cost capital \navailable to American firms to invest in productive enterprises.\n  Normalizing our trade relations with China is not a panacea, but it \nwill have a positive impact on the economy by reducing the uncertainty \nand risk that our producers and farmers currently face in gaining \naccession to the Chinese markets and ensuring continued competition \nwith its benefits for American companies and American consumers.\n  In other words, a vote in support of PNTR is a vote for a stronger \neconomic future here in the United States.\n  I ask my distinguished colleague from New York, because I think it is \nimportant that the American people basically understand what this \nlegislation does and does not do--I don't think people understand this \nlegislation will not determine whether or not China will become a \nmember of WTO. Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I may, the chairman is absolutely \ncorrect. I believe it to be the case. You can't obviously say this with \ncomplete confidence, but China will become a member of the WTO with us \nor without us. They have completed their negotiations with the great \nmajority of the 137 members of the WTO. They will be admitted. However, \nhaving been admitted, the privileges of the relationship the WTO \nestablishes includes being subject to the rule of law. Panels say what \nthe trade law means. What have you done? What are the facts? Here is \nthe judgment handed down, which can be appealed. It is a rule of law \nprocess. That is only available to countries that have met the WTO \nstandard enunciated in Article 1, which says you must have given \nunconditional normal trade relations. If you have done that with \nanother country, then you can non-apply the WTO to that country (and \nnot gain any of the benefits the other country's concessions) or that \ncountry can take you into court--if you would like to put it that way--\nand you can answer the decisions and so forth.\n  This is everything you would hope for in a relationship where, up \nuntil now, we have had no recourse to binding dispute settlement. When \nfaced with the unwillingness of the Chinese government from time to \ntime to comply with trade agreements, we could do nothing, excepting to \ncomplain to them and say: We very much regret you did that. We don't \nwant you to do it again. Once China joins the WTO and we extend PNTR, \nwe will have a different answer: If you do it again, we will do this \ninstead of saying you have broken a rule, as we judge it, and we will \ngo to court.\n  Going to court is so much better than going to war or otherwise.\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely. One of the things that bothered me is that the \nUnited States, under three Presidents, has negotiated for something \nlike 13 years on this agreement. The fact is, some very major \nconcessions are made that benefit agriculture, that benefit industry, \nand benefit the workers.\n  The Senator was saying they are going to become a member of WTO. That \nmeans those concessions they made in negotiations with our USTR will \nbecome available to the other members of WTO but not ourselves if we \ndon't grant them permanent normal trade relations; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Chairman is absolutely correct.\n  If I could make a point here--it is a personal one, but so be it--I \nfirst visited the People's Republic of China in 1975. I had been \nAmbassador to India, and, for reasons that were undiscernible at the \ntime, the Foreign Minister of China wished to talk to me as I was on my \nway home. I received this message from George Bush, who represented our \ninterests there. He was not ambassador. And, oh gosh, he was kept to \nthe end of every line, and he had the smallest compound, and all the \nhelp went home at 7 o'clock. But he and Barbara were in good spirits.\n  I made my way up to Tiananmen Square, to two enormous flagpoles. One \nof them had vast portraits of 19th century German gentlemen: Marx and \nEngels; the other, a rather Mongol-looking Stalin. They were the \nvanguard of revolution.\n  At that point, one of the big issues was, When would the fourth \nCommunist Party take place--the fourth in their history? The French \nAmbassador thought in the spring; the British Ambassador thought June; \nsome said maybe it had been canceled. We were on Tiananmen Square. \nThere was a\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nGreat Hall of the People. It had the look of a post office on a Sunday \nmorning. The very week I was there and everyone was thinking about when \nit would happen, it was happening. That is how secret that world was. \nFour thousand delegates made their way in and out and voted \nunanimously. The Foreign Minister succeeded Mao.\n  This was a Communist country. Everybody wore Mao jackets. The people \nwere color-coded. The army was green; the civil service was blue; the \nworkers were gray. We were taken to see the model apartments and so \nforth. The children would sing about growing up with industrial hands: \nWe will settle the western regions; we will smash the imperialists.\n  It is over. First they rejected Stalin. In the 1960s, the Soviet \nUnion and the People's Republic were, at times, in a shooting war--\nwhich never sank in across the river, but all right. Then Mao \ndisappeared. Go there now, and there is a little portrait of Mao above \nan entrance to the Forbidden City--this nice portrait, nothing \ndomineering.\n  Had anyone noticed in the photographs of the leaders of the United \nNations, the head of the Chinese Government wears a blue suit, a white \nshirt, and a tie such as the distinguished Chairman?\n  We just heard an hour ago from our Senator from South Dakota, last \nyear there were 29 Chinese agronomists in South Dakota discussing the \npurchase of soybeans. They wouldn't come near us 30 years ago. They are \nhere now.\n  Can't we grasp this? Is there something missing?\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me say to the distinguished Senator, I had a very \nsimilar experience. Back in the 1970s when Carter became President, he \nwas kind enough to invite me to go with a delegation he was sending to \nChina.\n  The Senator's description of China in those days is right on the \nmark. It was truly a Communist country; everything we saw, ate, where \nwe stayed, was controlled by the Government. One could not read \nanything unless it was published by the Communist Party. It was \nunbelievable depression.\n  I saw those same portraits. I was dumbfounded to see this portrait of \nLenin and Stalin. It was 20 years before I went back. The difference is \nunbelievable. The Chinese will talk to you; they are not afraid; they \ndon't just say the party line.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Did the Senator have the experience that they talked in \npairs the first time the Senator was there?\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely. Visitors heard nothing but the party line. We \ntalked to one person, met somebody else, and we heard exactly the same \nthing.\n\n  Now make no mistake, we all understand it is no democracy.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No.\n  Mr. ROTH. It is outrageous what they do in the area of human rights.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is.\n  Mr. ROTH. We have serious problems with respect to proliferation of \nweapons.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We do.\n  Mr. ROTH. But aren't we better off and don't we have a better chance \nof bringing more responsible leaders to the front if we work with them \nand do not alienate them?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is the best hope of mankind at this moment, sir, \nbecause the age of nuclear warfare is not over. If we think we have \nproliferation today, wait until we see. We won't, but if we were to \nannounce that we want the Chinese on hold, I cannot imagine what the \nnext 30 years would be like.\n  Mr. ROTH. My own personal experience is that significant progress is \nbeing made.\n  Let me give one illustration. When I was there the first time, an \nindividual could not move from Beijing to another region.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Internal passports.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, internal passports. You had to get approval of the \nGovernment. If you wanted to move from A to B, not only did you have to \nget the approval of the Government but you had to get somebody who was \nwilling to move from B to A. Unbelievable. At least that is what we \nwere told. Now these things are changing. Progress is being made, and \nit is critically important we encourage that.\n  I go back to what I was saying before. It is important to understand \nthat with permanent normal trade relations, we are not yielding access \nto our markets. They already have these markets; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. So states the balance of payments, sir.\n  They come in under our tariffs, which are already nonexistent. We \ncan't get in under theirs. Under this agreement, they have agreed to \nbring them down to a reasonably low level and to wipe them out in some \ncases where they have decided they need American technology and \nbusiness. They are not doing us any favors.\n  Mr. ROTH. In a very real way, isn't this agreement all about whether \nAmerica, the United States, our workers, our farmers, our businessmen, \nare going to have access to the Chinese markets? Isn't that what we are \ntalking about?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about \nthose most elemental rule principles that Adam Smith laid down so many \nyears ago: Comparative advantage.\n  Remember, he used the image, he said: You could make port wine in \nScotland and you could grow wool in Portugal. But on the whole, it is \nto our comparative advantage if Scotland made the wool cloth and sold \nit to the Portuguese who made the port wine and sent it to Scotland.\n  I hope it is not indiscrete--I am sure it isn't because it came up in \nthe Finance Committee--there is a wonderful compatibility between the \npoultry industry in Delaware and the Chinese trading system. The \nChinese cuisine, Chinese tastes, happen to be for parts of the chicken \nwhich are least liked, in least demand among Americans. By contrast, \nthe portions of the chicken which are most demanded among American \nconsumers are least demanded among Chinese. What a happy arrangement to \njust trade. We keep what we would most desire, they take what they most \ndesire, and we are better off.\n  The Chinese importing animal protein? When we were there first, a \nChinese family might see such a meal once a year. Hey, Americans, \nloosen up. Something good is happening. And be careful lest we miss an \nopportunity and something bad happens.\n  I will say one more thing. I am sure he won't mind. After Senator \nRoberts of Kansas spoke yesterday, I happened to say to him on the \nfloor what a fine statement he made.\n  He said: You know, I am glad you mentioned that century and a half of \nthe Chinese exclusion law--century. He said: My father was on the \nPanat. Like the father of our distinguished Presiding Officer, he \nshowed great heroism, and was awarded the Navy Cross. He came back to \nKansas and he said he never stopped talking about the way we treated \nthe Chinese.\n  You might start by saying what is that gunboat doing up the--was it \nthe Yangtze?\n  Mr. ROTH. I think it was.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If we found a Chinese gunboat on the Missouri, we might \nsay: I think you got your charts wrong here. This is U.S. waters, not \nyours.\n  It is easy for us to forget because there was no indignity done us. \nIt is not easy for them. I am not asking any sympathy for them, I am \njust giving a fact. If we suddenly break into that appearing hostile \nmode of wanting hegemony and all that, I shall be happy to have been \nout of this by then because we will be asking for terrible events: \nKorea, Japan, Taiwan, India--let's not do this. Let's do the sensible \nthing we have been trying to do since the day we began the Reciprocal \nTrade Agreements program in 1934.\n  My colleague is bringing it to a culmination. I hope he is proud.\n  Mr. ROTH. I appreciate that. But let me add, you have been there, not \nfrom the beginning but you have played a major role in bringing about \nthis world trade situation. I congratulate you and thank you for your \nleadership.\n  Time is running out.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I look about. I was told the Senator \nfrom West Virginia might want to speak but he is not here. I think we \nhave done our duty, I say to the Chairman.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think I would agree. I say to our friends and colleagues \nthat Monday will be here soon. It is important that those who have \namendments they want to offer take advantage of that situation. Time is \nrunning out.\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\n For the reason the distinguished Senator from New York has spelled \nout, we absolutely must proceed as expeditiously as possible.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I simply say we have been here all \nmorning. We would be here all afternoon and into the evening if there \nwere occasion--demand for it. We expected a measure to be brought up \nthat was laid down last evening. It was not. We would be here all \nMonday. But when, on Tuesday, we move to close debate and the final 30 \nhours during which amendments will be offered, that is only \nappropriate. It is fair play by the rules and we will get to some \nconclusion. It will be a very fine conclusion. We began it yesterday \nmorning when the motion to proceed was adopted, 92-5.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished Senator for his leadership. I \nhave confidence that this legislation will be enacted. It will be a \ngreat step for America.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have returned to keep the vigil on my \nattempt, in concert with other Senators, to have a debate on permanent \nnormal trade relations, PNTR, with the People's Republic of China. I \nshall once again implore my fellow colleagues to consider reason, to \nlisten to our case as we discuss these amendments, and to consider them \ncarefully; let your conscience be your guide, as the old saying goes. I \nhope that all Senators will look carefully at the merits of these \namendments. Should we not crack this big fortune cookie? Just imagine \nthe PNTR as a large fortune cookie. Should we not crack it and fully \nrealize what lies inside PNTR before we rush to pass this legislation? \nWhat is the rush? Fortune cookies look sweet and tempting on the \noutside, but they can hold a less than appetizing message inside. \nShould we not look, should we not peer, lift the covers and see what is \ninside? Should we not look before we leap?\n  So far, this debate reminds me of a greasy pig contest at a county \nfair. The distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, who presides \nover the Senate today--and, of course, I would not expect a response \nfrom the Chair, but I daresay that the Senator from Mississippi has \nmade his presence known at many a county fair in the great State of \nMississippi. At those county fairs, I am sure he is acquainted with the \ngreasy pig contest. We talk about the greasy pole, and now we refer to \nthe greasy pig--the greasy pig contest at a county fair. Everyone tries \nto slow down that pig, everybody tries to catch that pig, but the hands \njust slip away. That pig is greased and nobody can catch hold of the \npig. Everyone is trying to slow down the greasy pig, but the pig is \ngreased and just keeps on running.\n  I feel like one of those poor rubes out here chasing the greasy pig. \nBy the way, one of the best pigs of all is the Poland-China hog. My dad \nused to buy 10 or 12 of those Poland-China pigs every year, and I would \ngo around the community and gather up the leftovers from the tables of \ncoal miners' wives. They would save these scraps of food for me and I \nwould go around after school and pick up those scraps. I would take the \nscraps and feed them to the Poland-China pigs. Well, it just happens \nthat today I am talking about the greased China PNTR pig.\n  I am trying my best to slow it down. Here the crowd is standing on \ntheir feet, and they are shouting. They are saying: Robert C. Byrd \ntried to get his hand on that greasy pig and tried to hold that pig. \nBut the pig gets away. He can't hold that pig. Here we are--a few \nSenators--trying to slow down this greasy China PNTR pig so that we can \nget some amendments added or, perhaps by display of our judgment on \nthis legislation, cause some of our fellow Members to say: Whoa, whoa, \nhere; let's wait a minute. What are we doing? Why are we in such a \nhurry?\n  May I ask, do we have a copy of the bill that came out of the Senate \ncommittee? All right. I will have it in a moment. But that is not the \nlegislation the Senate is talking about. That is not the bill that came \nout of the Senate committee. While I am securing that bill, I shall \nsubmit to the chairman of the Finance Committee a copy of the amendment \nI am about to call up. If he will take a look at it, we may want to \ndiscuss a time limit on it.\n  Back to this greasy pig, other Senators and I are trying simply to \nget the Senate to stop, look, and listen before it rushes pellmell into \na vote on this legislation.\n  Here it is. This is S. 2277, a bill to terminate the application of \ntitle IV of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to the People's Republic \nof China.\n  It is a very short bill. As all Senators may see, it is two full \npages. Of course, it really is not two full pages. The first page \nsimply states the number of the bill, the title of the bill, and the \nSenators' names who are supporting it. There it is. Page 1, page 2, \npage 3; and page 3 consists only of four lines. There are three and a \nhalf lines, as a matter of fact, on page 3. There it is. This is what \nthe Senate Finance Committee reported to this body, reported to the \nCalendar. This is it. This is the product of the work of the Senate \nFinance Committee on the subject of trading with China. But this bill \nis not what we are talking about. This is not what we are debating. \nThis is not what we are attempting to amend. The bill is not before the \nSenate, it is at the desk. But this is not the bill we are attempting \nto amend.\n  What we are doing here in the Senate is this. We have taken the House \nbill.\n  May I ask the chairman, has the House bill ever had consideration by \nthe Senate Finance Committee?\n  (Mr. SESSIONS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes. I say to my distinguished colleague that it was \nconsidered in executive session by the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. So the House bill was considered in executive session by \nthe Senate Finance Committee. That was at the time of markup, I \nsuppose.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. But that bill came over from the House to the \nSenate. Unfortunately for those of us who would like to see the bill \nslowed down and perhaps amended to make it a better bill, we find there \nhas been kind of a contract entered into, if I may put it that way. It \nwas not a written contract. Perhaps I should say it is an understanding \nrather than a contract.\n  There seems to be an understanding among some Senators that perhaps \nwith the House--I don't know how far this understanding goes, but \nSenators who have entered into this understanding will vote against any \namendment--any amendment, any amendment--to the House bill. We are not \ngoing to debate the Senate bill. We are not going to act upon the \nSenate bill. We have taken up the House bill, and no amendments shall \npass. That is it. No amendments shall pass.\n\n  I want to say to the Chair, to the distinguished Senator from Alabama \nwho presides over the Senate, that I have been in legislative bodies \nnow 54 years. I have been in this Congress 48 years. I have been in \nthis body 42 years. This is something that is absolutely new to me, \nthis method of legislating where Senators and the administration--I am \ntalking about Senators on both sides--enter into an understanding \nsomehow. I don't know whether they met and had a show of hands or had a \ndebate about it. But anyway, we have been told by Senators on this \nfloor that they will vote against any amendment, no matter what its \nmerits. It doesn't matter who offers the amendment. It doesn't matter \nhow good an amendment it may be. The decision has been made to reject \nevery amendment--reject all amendments. Why? Why the hurry?\n  The powers that be--whoever they are--don't want an amendment because \nthey say that would mean the bill would have to go back to the House. \nAnd they say that would cause a conference between the two Houses and \nthat would mean a conference report. That would mean each House would \nhave to vote on that conference report. As I gather from my grapevine \ninformation, these Senators are concerned that if the House were to \nvote again on this measure, it might not pass. There are some who think \nit would not pass the House if the House voted on it again. I think we \nhave come to a pretty\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\npoor pass when we won't consider amendments seriously and judge them on \ntheir merits and vote accordingly. But that is apparently what is \nhappening here.\n  I feel like one of those poor rubes out there chasing the greasy \nChina PNTR pig, trying my best to slow it down with some good \namendments. But that pig is well greased, as you can understand by now. \nIt is flying through the Senate, flying through the Senate. This pig is \ntearing along and Members have made a blood vow to keep hands off and \njust let ``old porky'' run; let ``old porky'' run.\n  I will, however, continue to pursue some debate on this bill and to \noffer at least two amendments that I believe will improve the \nlegislation. I shall offer an amendment momentarily that is \nstraightforward. It would require the U.S. Trade Representative to \nobtain a commitment by the People's Republic of China to disclose \ninformation relating to China's plans to comply with the World Trade \nOrganization, WTO, subsidy obligations.\n  This is an important issue aimed at ensuring that the American people \nand their representatives here and in the other branches of the \ngovernment truly realize what is inside the big Chinese trade fortune \ncookie. State-owned enterprises continue to be the most significant \nsource of employment in most areas in China, and some reports suggest \nthese subsidized enterprises accounted for as much as 65 percent of the \njobs in many areas of China in 1995. That is two-thirds of the jobs. \nThe most recent data that the Library of Congress could provide on this \nmatter indicate those figures. Let me state them again: The subsidized \nenterprises in China accounted for as much as 65 percent of the jobs in \nmany areas of China in 1995.\n\n  Members of Congress need to remember that we are here to defend the \npeople of the United States, to use our best judgment at all times, to \nexercise our very best talents in behalf of the people who send us \nhere. I am here to represent the people of West Virginia, Democrats and \nRepublicans, old and young, black and white, rich and poor. I am here \nto represent them. Other Members are likewise here to represent the \npeople of their respective States. We are here to represent them. This \nincludes, may I say, the average American worker.\n  There are grave implications to Sino-American relations as a result \nof granting PNTR to China. I believe that the Chinese have developed a \nkeen understanding of the American political system. I have no doubt \nthat many Senators and U.S. businesses are naive about the increased \nworkings of the Chinese Government and its agenda. China is not a free \nmarket economy. It is not on the verge of becoming a free market \neconomy. It is a Communist, centrally controlled economy. The Chinese \nGovernment oversees the top-to-bottom operations of many industries \nsuch as iron and steel, coal mining, petroleum extraction and refining, \nas well as the electric power utilities, banking, and transportation \nsectors. The whole thing, one might say.\n  Government control reigns from top to bottom, supreme in China. \nGovernment control.\n  I was in China in 1975 along with our former colleague, Sam Nunn, and \nour former colleague, Jim Pearson, from the Republican side. At that \ntime I was told that no individual in China owned an automobile. There \nwere no privately owned automobiles. Oceans of bicycles but no \nprivately owned automobile.\n  There is some limited private enterprise in China. But private \ninvestment is heavily monitored and restricted by the Government. In \nfact, it has been suggested that the Chinese Government only sell \nminority shares, such as 25 percent of an enterprise, for the sole \npurpose of making money while still containing effective control over \nthe operations of that enterprise.\n  These conditions are serious impediments to fair trade and to free \ntrade. Yet we really do not have much detailed information about \nChina's state-owned enterprises and the type or amount of the benefits \nthat those enterprises receive from the Chinese Government. It is \nalmost impossible to measure accurately the extent of subsidized \noperations or the touted move to privatization in China, due to the \nlack of reliable Chinese statistics.\n  My amendment today that I will shortly send to the desk would help to \nsecure this information. What is wrong with that? This is information \nthat is vital to many U.S. businesses and vital to American workers. My \namendment is an effort to help secure that. What is wrong with that?\n  I hope the American people are following this debate--I am pretty \nsure they are not; they are not following it. No, the American people \nare not watching. If they were watching it, there would be more \nSenators here in the Chamber today. How many Senators are there here \ntoday? One, two, three--that is the whole kit and kaboodle--three \nSenators. So the American people are not watching it. They don't know \nwhat is happening.\n  My amendment would help to secure statistics that are vital to U.S. \nbusinesses and American workers.\n  One of the basic principles of liberalized trade is to obtain \nobligations to restrict Government interference, which provides an \nunfair advantage to national commerce. The WTO agreement on subsidies \nand countervailing measures restricts the use of subsidies and \nestablishes a three-class framework on subsidies consisting of red \nlight, yellow light, dark amber, and green light. The SCM prohibits \nsubsidies contingent upon export performance and subsidies contingent \nupon the use of domestic over imported goods.\n\n  We know that a significant portion of the economy of the People's \nRepublic of China consists of state-owned enterprises. We know that \nChinese enterprises receive significant subsidies from the Chinese \nGovernment. We know that Chinese state-owned enterprises account for a \nsignificant portion of exports from the Chinese Government. We also \nknow that U.S. manufacturers and farmers can not compete fairly with \nthese subsidized state-owned enterprises. So, once again, the question \nremains: how can the United States ensure that Chinese subsidies do not \nundermine U.S. commerce and threaten American jobs? That is what we are \ntrying to find out by way of my amendment.\n  The U.S.-China bilateral agreement contains report language on the \ncommercial operations of Chinese state-owned and state-invested \nenterprises. That language says that China, with respect to those \nenterprises, must follow private market export rules; China must base \ndecisions on commercial considerations as provided in the WTO; China \ncannot influence, directly or indirectly, commercial decisions; China \nmust follow WTO government procurement procedures; and China cannot \ncondition investment approval upon technology transfer. That is a \nfairly comprehensive set of guidelines. If followed, these guidelines \nought to level the playing field for competitive U.S. firms. That is, \nof course, a very big ``if.'' The Chinese government is pretty good at \napplying guidelines like these very selectively or not at all.\n  The United States Trade Representative states that the U.S.-China \nbilateral agreements meet significant benchmarks, but acknowledges that \nwork on the subsidy protocols is not complete. I understand that the \nUSTR has stressed that the WTO basic rule is clear--namely, China must \neliminate all red light subsidies or prohibited subsidies upon entry \ninto the WTO. Nevertheless, the USTR is wary enough to continue \nnegotiations on subsidy agreements particular to the agricultural and \nindustrial sectors.\n  In addition to the vague language in the protocol, another problem \narises with regard to subsidies and the Chinese Government. The SCM \nagreement provides principles whereby the specificity of a subsidy can \nbe determined, but it does so in the context of a market economy with \nprivate ownership of enterprises. The SCM Agreement does not have a \nspecific reference to economies in which a significant share of \neconomic activity and foreign trade is carried out by state-owned \nenterprises--which is the case with China. I understand that the USTR's \nprotocol language attempts to address this in their bilateral language, \nbut it seems to me that this is leaving U.S. businesses to the whims of \nan uncertain turn of fortune's wheel. In fact, China has expressed a \nview that it should be included in the grouping of the poorest \ncountries in the WTO--effectively exempting China from the disciplines \nof the WTO subsidy codes altogether. This does not, it seems to me, \npresage good\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\ncompliance on the part of China with regard to the subsidy restrictions \noutlined in the U.S.-China bilateral agreement report language. The \nChinese already say they are exempt.\n  I just got a note from our mutual good friend, Dave Obey, a Member of \nthe House. I think I should make it known to my colleague on the floor, \nSenator Dodd--he happens to be the only colleague I have on the floor, \nnot counting my colleague in the chair--but, I say to my colleague on \nthe floor, Dave Obey called: He simply wanted to tell you--meaning me--\ntell you that he is watching this debate and he hopes that you--meaning \nRobert Byrd--``will snare that pig,'' that greasy pig I was talking \nabout.\n  So what can U.S. businesses really expect from the protocol language \nin the U.S. China bilateral agreement? I have a gold watch and chain, \nand I'll bet my gold watch and chain that they can likely expect little \nto nothing with regard to potential benefits. I believe that U.S. \nbusinesses should expect to see continuing illegal subsidy programs by \nthe Chinese to state-owned enterprises.\n  I also hope I shall be proven wrong in the long run.\n  Without doubt, subsidies have been a very difficult issue to resolve. \nIn fact, with years of trade relations and negotiations, the U.S. has \nyet to reach a subsidy understanding with the European Union on \nagriculture or on some industrial sectors such as aeronautics.\n  But the United States should not leave this matter--or U.S. firms and \nworkers--hanging, and U.S. businesses should not be expected to pay \nmillions in litigation fees to resolve subsidy disputes.\n  My amendment will help address the vital issue of prohibited \nsubsidies. It would improve the transparency of the subsidies provided \nby the Chinese to state-owned enterprises. It would facilitate U.S. \nGovernment and private efforts to monitor Chinese compliance by \nproviding both an essential baseline of current subsidies and an \nexplicit schedule for their removal. Finally, it would help provide \ninformation that strengthens the evidentiary basis for grievances by \nU.S. industries regarding continued subsidies and it would help spur \nChina to reduce or eliminate subsidies to state-owned enterprises.\n\n  Should we not better understand the level of control that the Chinese \ngovernment exerts over their businesses? Again, my amendment simply \nrequires the USTR to obtain a commitment by the People's Republic of \nChina to identify state-owned enterprises engaged in export activities; \ndescribe state support for those enterprises; and to set forth a time \ntable for compliance by China with the subsidy obligations of the WTO. \nThis is basic information all members of the Senate and the \nAdministration should be eager to have.\n  Unfair subsidies hurt the working men and women of the United States \nevery day. Unfair subsidies hurt scores, hundreds of Americans working \nin U.S. industrial and agricultural sectors such as steel, the apple \nindustry and beef. It cuts across all of the vital products. I hope all \nMembers will stand up for vital American interests by voting in support \nof my amendment.\n  My amendment addresses the extensive control over the economy still \nexercised by the Chinese government, despite some window dressing of \nprivatization. It might be looked upon as a reality check. The same \nkind of very heavy-handed government control is exerted over virtually \nevery aspect of Chinese life. Heavy-handedness is evident all over \nChina. Take a look at religious freedom for example, and I would like \nto touch briefly on that subject because it is an important barometer \nof the way the Chinese Government controls their society and their \npeople.\n  Freedom of religion is near and dear to hearts of Americans. That \nfreedom is at the core of our Nation's being, and we do well to cherish \nit. Early settlers dared much to come to these shores so that they \ncould freely practice their religious beliefs. They left everything \nthey knew, every comfort of home, to escape the sometimes oppressive \nhand the heavy hand of governments that discriminated against them. The \nPilgrims, the Puritans, the Quakers--all came to the New World seeking \nreligious freedom. Even 171 years after the Pilgrim's Plymouth colony \nwas established in 1620, that fire for religious freedom was codified \nin the Bill of Rights which were ratified by the necessary number of \nStates on December 15, 1791. The first right--the first precious \nright--outlined in the First Amendment to the Constitution could not be \nclearer:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; * * *\n\n  The proliferation of churches in the United States of all stripes, \nfrom the Roman Catholic cathedral to the independent Baptist church, \nthe Muslim Mosque to the Mormon Tabernacle, the Shinto Shrine to the \nJewish Temple--all of these are a living testament to our commitment to \nreligious freedom.\n  That same freedom is repressed in China. It is not that the Chinese \npeople are opposed to free practice of religion, so far as I can tell. \nAccording to a recent article, in fact, the decay of communism, coupled \nwith rising unemployment and a desire for the trappings of affluent \nsociety, has sparked a religious revival in China. Twenty years ago, \nonly 2 million Chinese identified themselves as Christian. Today, the \nnumber is estimated at 60 million--60 million--according to overseas \nChristian groups. But, as an atheistic Communist state, China has long \nfeared religion as a threat to the government's monopoly over its \nsubjects. The People's Republic of China has a long and sorry history \nin this century of repressing religion and religious practice. The \nantireligious fervor of the Cultural Revolution is but one example. Its \nsubjugation of Tibet and the destruction of many of the Buddhist \nlamaseries there is another example. The meditative group called Falun \nGong, which mobilized more than 10,000 people for a mass protest in \nBeijing last year, has been outlawed.\n  In the Washington Times on Wednesday of this week, September 6, the \nfront page headline reads: ``Chinese religious rights `deteriorated' \n''. The article concerns a State Department report released yesterday, \non the eve of the United Nations Millennium Summit, a gathering of \nreligious leaders from around the world in support of peace. I would \nobserve, and not as an aside, that the exiled Dalai Lama, religious \nleader of Tibetan Buddhists and other Buddhists, was not invited, out \nof deference to China. In this, the second annual congressionally \nordered report on religious freedom around the world, respect for \nreligious freedom in China ``deteriorated markedly'' during the second \nhalf of 1999 and was marked by the brutal suppression of minority \nreligious faiths. Members of such groups have been subjected to \n``harassment, extortion, prolonged detention, physical abuse and \nincarceration.'' Those words are lifted out of the text.\n  Though the Chinese government sanctions five carefully monitored \nreligious organizations, including a state-supported Christian church, \nthe government has shown no hesitation in outlawing any religious sect \nor church that has shown any sign of gaining support among the Chinese \npeople. Missionaries are not welcome; nor are Bibles. In the past year, \nraids on worship groups meeting in private homes have increased from \ntwice a month to once a week, according to human rights groups in Hong \nKong. Yet Beijing's state-appointed bishop recently stated: ``There is \nno religious persecution in China.''\n  Just last month, on August 23, Chinese authorities raided a meeting \nof the Fangcheng Church in Henan Province, arresting three American \ncitizens and over 100 Chinese church members. The Americans, Henry Chu \nand his wife Sandy Lin, and Patricia Lan, were visiting the church when \nit was raided. The Taiwanese-born American citizens were released after \na protest from the U.S. embassy. They are luckier than Zhang Rongliang, \nthe Fangcheng Church leader, who was arrested on August 23, 1999, and \nsentenced to 3 years in a labor camp under an anticult ordinance. It \nhas been a long time, indeed, since a Christian church in the United \nStates was described as a cult. And, of course, no single church or \nreligion, or circumscribed list of churches, is officially sanctioned \nby the American Government.\n\n  We do not have that in this country. That is why many of our \nforbearers came to these shores. The Government of the United States \ndoes not sanction any particular church.\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\n  Again, in the Congress' annual renewal of China's NTR status, \nconditions favoring religious freedom or protesting Chinese actions \nagainst worshippers could be debated and voted upon. The United States \ncould go on record, at least, in support of the principle of religious \nfreedom. This annual debate on must-pass legislation, on legislation \nthat does mean something to the Chinese Government, may well have \nmoderated Chinese behavior. Who knows? It certainly did not \nfundamentally change that behavior, as proponents of PNTR have \nobserved. But it likely did moderate Chinese actions, if only to reduce \nthe embarrassment factor they may have faced during the annual debate. \nSo it served a useful function, one that we will now consign to the \ndustheap of history. When next year's congressionally mandated report \non religious freedom is issued, I for one will not be surprised to read \nabout further deterioration in religious freedom in China, once PNTR is \nassured.\n  Mr. President, I still read the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. \nEven though I have it--or once had it in my lifetime--just about \nmemorized, seeing the words themselves reinforces the beauty, the \npower, and the simplicity of that magnificent document for me. The Bill \nof Rights was added to the Constitution in order to ensure the \nratification of the Constitution itself, even though the framers did \nnot believe that those rights needed to be spelled out. For them, those \nrights were so fundamental that they did not need to be spelled out. \nOthers, less intimately involved in creating the Constitution, needed \nthe reassurance of the written word. The words are powerful: ``Congress \nshall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .'' I still respect those \nwords, and I still cherish those principles. I hope that others around \nthe world may eventually share in this great freedom. Until they do, I \ncontinue to think it is appropriate that we, our country, as a leader \nin supporting religious freedom, should take opportunities to urge \nother governments to allow unfettered worship of their Creator.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry that Senator Wellstone's amendment in \nsupport of international religious freedom was not adopted. It was a \nmessage worth sending to the Chinese people--a message that the United \nStates still places its principles and its values above mere avarice, \nabove mere greed for maximizing profits through increased trade. I hope \nthat my colleagues will support my amendment, which would provide \nneeded and difficult-to-obtain information about Chinese Government \nsubsidies to state-owned enterprises. This information is needed by the \nU.S. firms and U.S. workers who will be competing against those \nsubsidized producers. If our trade provisions in support of fair trade \nare to have any chance, we must have this information. I hope that we \nwill not put greed ahead of American jobs and interests. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. Let us at least put up a fence \nbefore the ambulance careens over the hill, which reminds me of a poem, \nwhich I think would be nice to have in the Record right here.\n\n  Before I attempt to recall it, let me ask my friend from \nConnecticut--he has been sitting here--does he wish the floor now? I \ncan postpone this for some other time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for posing the \nquestion, but I always love to hear my colleague quote poetry, under \nany set of circumstances.\n  I have some remarks to share regarding the pending matter, but there \nis no great hurry. I would not want to interrupt the flow of my good \nfriend and seatmate's remarks. So I am very patient to listen to his \ncomments.\n  I, too, voted for the Wellstone amendment yesterday on religious \nfreedom. I would like to associate myself with my colleague's remarks. \nMy remarks touch on the agreement but not as extensively as the \ncomments of my colleague from West Virginia on the subject of religious \nfreedom. I commend him for his comments. I would like to be associated \nwith those thoughts.\n  So I am very content to listen to the poetry. I think America is \nenlightened. I think there are a lot more people listening to this \ndebate, I say to my colleague from West Virginia, than would be \nreflected by the participation of our fellow colleagues on a Friday \nafternoon.\n  But the comments of the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia are always profound, always thoughtful, always meaningful. His \ncolleagues appreciate them, and the American public do as well. So I am \nvery delighted to sit here and be enlightened further. Poetry is always \nsomething that enriches the soul.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am flattered by the comments of my \ncolleague, my seatmate who sits right here. I appreciate his \nfriendship, and I appreciate his many, many words of advice, our many \nconversations we have had together about the Senate, about our country, \nand about the Constitution.\n  So if we can just think, as we do this poem--I always run the risk, \nof course, of having a lapse of memory. But after 50 years of quoting \npoetry, although I have had a few lapses of memory, I always take them \nas they come. It is something that is natural, nothing to be \nembarrassed about. Sometimes I start over and get the poem right.\n  But I am thinking of this legislation that is before us, and I am \nthinking of what is going on here. I have referred to a cabal. It isn't \nthat, of course, but there certainly is an understanding abroad here, \namong Senators on both sides--certain Senators I think are probably \nworking with the administration--that there will be no amendments, no \namendments will pass, they will vote down every amendment.\n  Well, a few of my colleagues and I are trying to improve this \nlegislation. We are not offering any killer amendments. But we are \noffering them because we think the bill would be improved.\n  This action on my part, and on the part of my colleagues who are \nattempting to improve the bill, might be likened to putting a fence \naround the edge of a cliff while an ambulance runs in the valley. The \nambulance represents this legislation, which, if passed, in the long \nrun, I fear, will result in increased unfair trade and constitute an \ninjury to the American worker and to the American businesspeople.\n\n     `Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,\n     Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;\n     But over its terrible edge there had slipped A duke and full \n           many a peasant.\n     So the people said something would have to be done,\n     But their projects did not at all tally;\n     Some said, ``Put a fence around the edge of the cliff,''\n     Some, ``An ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n     But the cry for the ambulance carried the day,\n     As it spread through the neighboring city;\n     A fence may be useful or not, it is true,\n     But each heart became brimful of pity\n     For those who slipped over that dangerous cliff;\n     And the dwellers in highway and alley\n     Gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence,\n     But an ambulance down in the valley.\n\n     ``For the cliff is all right, if you're careful,'' they said,\n     ``And, if folks even slip and are dropping,\n     It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much,\n     As the shock down below when they're stopping.''\n     So day after day, as these mishaps occurred,\n     Quick forth would these rescuers sally\n     To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff,\n     With their ambulance down in the valley.\n\n     Then an old sage remarked: ``It's a marvel to me\n     That people give far more attention\n     To repairing results than to stopping the cause,\n     When they'd much better aim at prevention.\n     Let us stop at its source all this mischief,'' cried he.\n     ``Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally;\n     If the cliff we will fence we might almost dispense\n     With the ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n     ``Oh, he's a fanatic,'' the others rejoined,\n     ``Dispense with the ambulance? Never!\n     He'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could;\n     No! No! We'll support them forever.\n     Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall?\n     Shall this man dictate to us? Shall he?\n     Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence,\n     While the ambulance works down in the valley?''\n\n     But a sensible few, who are practical too,\n     Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;\n     They believe that prevention is better than cure,\n     And their party will soon be the stronger.\n     Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen,\n     And while other philanthropists dally,\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\n     They will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence\n     Round the cliff that hangs over the valley.\n\n     Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old,\n     For the voice of true wisdom is calling,\n     ``To rescue the fallen is good, but `tis better\n     To prevent other people from falling.''\n     Better close up the source of temptation and crime\n     Than to deliver from dungeon or galley;\n     Better put a strong fence round the top of the cliff\n     Than an ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Chamber is not packed this afternoon, \nbut I hope our colleagues who are back in their offices on Capitol \nHill, and maybe our good friend David Obey from the House, were \nenlightened by the poetry of warning by our senior colleague from West \nVirginia, about putting a fence at the top of the cliff rather than the \nambulance down in the valley.\n  I am always impressed and I never cease to be amazed by my seatmate \nfrom West Virginia. I have been here for 20 years and not a day goes by \nthat I don't learn something new from and benefit immensely by my \nfriendship with the Senator from West Virginia. Today is no exception. \nThat was a tour de force. He recited from memory at least 10, 12, maybe \n14 stanzas. I thank him immensely for his comments regarding the \npending matter, the granting of permanent normal trade relations status \nwith the People's Republic of China.\n  I begin these brief remarks, if I may, by commending the two senior \nmembers of the Finance Committee who have jurisdiction over the pending \nmatter, Senator Roth of Delaware and Senator Moynihan of New York. Both \nof these gentlemen have made significant contributions to the wealth \nand strength of our Nation. This will probably be the last piece of \nbusiness the Senator from New York will be directly involved in before \nhis retirement from the Senate. It is appropriate that his closing \nefforts, legislatively, should involve a piece of legislation as \nmonumental and important as the pending matter.\n  Senator Moynihan has made unique and valued contributions to our \nNation's wealth during his years of public service. As a member of the \nexecutive branch--as a staff member there, a servant of various \nadministrations and, most recently, of course, during his tenure in \nthis wonderful body. So I wish him well and commend him once again for \nhis latest endeavor. I commend Senator Roth as well who has worked on \nthis legislation.\n  I rise to share a few thoughts about this bill, a bill that will \nconfer, as we all know now, permanent normal trading relations with the \nPeople's Republic of China. In so doing, this bill would also trigger \nthe implementation of the bilateral trade agreement entered into \nbetween the United States and China last November related to China's \naccession to the World Trade Organization. After many months of delay, \nI am very pleased that the Senate finally has arrived at this \ndiscussion that we have conducted over the past several days and will \ncontinue next week. I regret it has taken this long. I think the matter \nshould have come up earlier. But I am pleased we are finally getting a \nchance to debate the merits and consider amendments on this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  PNTR, as it is called, and China's entry into the WTO are extremely \nimportant milestones, in my view, toward the full assimilation of the \nworld's most populous nation into the global economic system. China's \nmembership in the World Trade Organization will also serve, in my view, \nas an important cornerstone of U.S.-China relations in the 21st \ncentury.\n  The requirement that China adhere to the World Trade Organization's \nglobal trading rules and standards should have and will have profound \nand long-lasting implications not only for China, but for the United \nStates and the world community. Not only will this agreement alter the \nlandscape of U.S.-Chinese trade relations and produce, I hope, a fairer \nand more competitive global trading environment, over time, I think \nthis agreement and this entry by China into the WTO will also have a \nmost profound impact on China's social, economic, and political \nsystems.\n\n  Over the last three decades, successive American Presidents, from \nRichard Nixon to the present occupant of the White House, Bill Clinton, \nhave worked hard to fashion a constructive relationship with the \nPeople's Republic of China. As we all know, this has proved more \ndifficult at some times than others because the Chinese have made it \nso--too often because of their unilateral decisions and actions. The \ngoal has always remained the same however--to move China toward a more \nopen and prosperous system, to enter the family of democracies and \nfreedom that are emerging throughout the world, and to become a society \nbuilt on a foundation consistent with the international community's \nnorms and values. The Clinton administration's proposal to grant PNTR \nstatus to China and support its membership in the World Trade \nOrganization are very much in keeping with the longstanding tradition \nthat has gone back over several decades.\n  Historically, the trade relationship between China and the United \nStates has been disproportionately tilted in China's favor due to its \nmercantilist trading policies. Granting PNTR and allowing China to \nenter the World Trade Organization, I hope, will restore the \ncompetitive balance in that relationship and generate what could be \nenormous opportunities for American exports, job creation, and \ninvestments in the world's third largest economy.\n  The commercial benefits to the United States from World Trade \nOrganization accession are clear, compelling and very wide-ranging.\n  American farmers, American workers, American businesses, both large \nand small, will benefit from China's new status.\n  In order for the United States to agree to support China's membership \nin the WTO, Chinese authorities were required to make across-the-board \nunilateral trade concessions to the United States to bring our trading \nrelationship into better balance.\n  Among other things, the Chinese have agreed to slash tariffs on U.S. \nagricultural and industrial imports, expand the rights of U.S. \ncompanies to distribute American products throughout China, and grant \nU.S. companies broad access to China's banking, telecommunications, and \ninsurance sectors.\n  The bilateral agreement which codifies these concessions includes as \nwell important safeguards against unfair competition by China that will \nallow U.S. authorities to respond quickly to products and specific \nimport surges that may threaten the viability of certain vulnerable \nimport-sensitive domestic industries.\n  The U.S. technology industry also stands to gain, in my view, from \nthis agreement as China begins participation in the information \ntechnology agreement. Under this ITA agreement, all tariffs on \ncomputers, telecommunications equipment, semiconductors, and other \nhigh-tech products will be totally eliminated.\n  U.S. high-technology companies have emerged as one of the driving \nforces of our recent economic boom. With China's participation in the \ninformation technology agreement, these companies may continue a trend \nof expansion and success on the international scale that will result in \nmore domestic jobs in the industry.\n  China has made important concessions on trading and distribution \nrights as well. Manufacturers in the United States have been severely \nhampered over the past number of years by China's restrictions on the \nright of foreign firms and U.S. firms to import and export and to own \nwholesaling outlets or warehouses in China. For the very first time, \nunder this agreement, these rights will be granted to U.S. firms.\n  Further distribution rights are being provided for some of China's \nmost restricted sectors, including transportation, maintenance, and \nrepair. As a result, American firms operating in China will not only be \nable to import a greater number of goods, but they will also be allowed \nto establish their own distribution networks.\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\n  While it is not easy to put an exact dollar figure on these \nconcessions, experts estimate that the annual U.S. exports will \nincrease by as much as $14 billion a year--nearly double the current \nvalue of our exports. And more than 400,000 high-paying export-related \nAmerican jobs will be sustained by expanded exports to the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  These are important benefits and serve to highlight the wide-ranging \nimpact that China's changed trading status will have on the American \neconomy as a whole.\n  At this juncture, I also want to briefly mention how granting the \nPNTR to China would affect my own State of Connecticut.\n  In 1998, Connecticut's merchandise exports to China totaled $302 \nmillion, making it one of the most trade-dependent States in the United \nStates. Nearly two-thirds of all firms exporting to China from \nConnecticut in 1997 were small- and medium-sized companies--not the \nlarge corporations in my State. Clearly, an open China will provide a \nvenue for increased sales of Connecticut-made products and an increase \nin jobs available to Connecticut workers in companies both large and \nsmall.\n  Connecticut's burgeoning high-tech industry, for example, will be \nable to take advantage of China's participation in the information \ntechnology agreement and the elimination of tariffs on these goods \nwhich is, in effect, a tax. Chemical products, which are one of \nConnecticut's largest exports to China, will enjoy reduced tariffs, and \nquotas will be totally eliminated by the year 2002. Insurance \ncompanies, which have long ties in Connecticut, will benefit from \ngreater geographic mobility within China, and an expanded scope of \nadmitted business activities. And lifesaving medical equipment made in \nmy home State may begin entering the Chinese market at reduced tariff \nlevels. Those tariffs will be phased out entirely over the next several \nyears.\n\n  The enthusiasm for the benefits that will flow from our bilateral WTO \naccession agreement with China must, however, be tempered by the fact \nthat there are a number of non-trade issues with respect to China that \nare deeply worrisome and need the attention of this body, of the \nlegislative branch, of the executive branch, and the American people.\n  I support the pending legislation. But I also want to make it very \nclear that I side with the critics of China who believe there is a \ngreat deal more that the Chinese Government needs to undertake in order \nto reach the standards of behavior expected of civilized nations and \ncountries.\n  If you wish to be a part of the World Trade Organization, implicit in \nthat request is that you are willing and anxious to also become a \nmember nation of civilized society recognizing the diversity of your \npeople and the basic fundamental freedoms that are guaranteed--not by a \ndocument, a constitution, or a declaration of independence but those \nguaranteed by the creator of all of us.\n  As China seeks to become a part of the family of civilized society, \nthen it must also begin to act accordingly with respect to the \ntreatment of its own people.\n  First and foremost, China must improve upon its human rights \nperformance, especially with regard to its citizens and religious \nfreedoms. This point was extremely well articulated by my colleague \nfrom West Virginia. He went on at some length in describing how \nvaluable and important religious freedom has been as a free people, \nciting the very first amendment to our Constitution which guaranteed \npeople this right. I will not go on at length about this point, except \nto say, once again, that I wish to be associated with the comments of \nthe Senator from West Virginia in his earlier discussion on religious \nfreedom and the absence of it, or almost a complete absence of it, in \nthe People's Republic of China.\n  In my view, China must also address the pervasive corruption that \nexists at all levels of Government--corruption that is damaging the \ncountry economically and politically and could jeopardize its \nmembership in the WTO if they persist in these practices.\n  China must also begin to act responsibly in its relationships with \nother nations if it is to become the world leader that it aspires to \nbe.\n  China must cease its threatening stance towards Taiwan and agree to \nenter into a productive dialog to resolve this question in a manner \nthat is consistent with the wishes of the people on Taiwan and mainland \nChina. They must try to resolve their dispute in the manner of a \ncivilized society.\n  Particularly worrisome is China's aggressive buildup of nuclear arms \nand its willingness to assist other nations to acquire a nuclear \ncapability that they don't currently possess.\n  In response to this concern, it is my understanding that Senators \nThompson and Torricelli may offer the China Non-proliferation Act as an \namendment to this bill. I think that it is important to let the Chinese \nauthorities know that in no uncertain terms that we object strongly to \ntheir continued proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \nbelieve that such behavior poses a direct and immediate threat to U.S. \nnational security interests as well as international peace and \nstability.\n  Having said that, I am also convinced that an amendment on the \npending legislation is not the right vehicle for attempting to \naccomplish that objective. In my view, the political realities are that \nan amendment such as this would not carry. That would be a much worse \nmessage in many ways. My belief is that the overwhelming majority of my \ncolleagues, regardless of party or ideology, believe that the \nproliferation practices of China must stop. But a vote by this body \nthat would come up short or be so narrowly decided could be a confusing \nmessage to China that we may not care about this issue as much as I \nthink most Members do.\n\n  Such a misinterpreted message would probably do more harm than good. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues who are considering such an amendment \nto seek another, more appropriate, vehicle to which the amendment could \nbe offered. That is the time when I think this body can speak with a \nmore singular voice on an issue with far greater unanimity than might \nbe reflected in an amendment on this particular trade proposal.\n  I know that not everyone supports this legislation or China's entry \ninto the World Trade Organization. They bring up good arguments and I \nhave mentioned some of them--religious freedom, workers rights, human \nrights, corruption, and nonproliferation issues.\n  I ask myself a question--Are we more likely to achieve the desired \ngoals of moving the Government of the People's Republic of China closer \nto the kind of social, economic, and political behavior that we seek by \nadopting this legislation and including China in the WTO? Or by not \ndoing that and allowing the status quo to persist? Is that going to \ncreate a greater deterioration in those very values that we seek? I \ncome to the conclusion that we are more likely to achieve those desired \ngoals by adopting this legislation than by not doing so. Some are \nopposed to it because they believe that it will unfairly enhance \nChina's ability to attract foreign investment and manufacturing \nfacilities to the detriment of the U.S. economy and the American \nworkers. Others would link U.S. support for China's WTO membership to \nimprovements in China's respect for human rights, religious tolerance, \nnuclear non-proliferation, as I mentioned.\n\n  There is no doubt that certain sectors of American industry have \nfared less well than others under the increased competition brought on \nby international trade. That will continue to be the case irrespective \nof whether China gains admission to the World Trade Organization or \nwhether the United States makes permanent the trade status China has \nalready had for more than two decades.\n  On the other hand, WTO membership would require that China operate \nunder the jurisdiction of international trade standards and agreements \nas dictated by that organization. China's non-compliance with those \nstandards would subject its government to an international arbitration \nand dispute settlement mechanism--a profound change in the treatment of \nChinese trade violations. For the first time China would be held \naccountable to all WTO members. This I think, provides the U.S. with \nstronger safeguards to protect their workers.\n  Furthermore, membership in the WTO would compel the Chinese \ngovernment to comply with international\n\n[[Page S8265]]\n\nlabor regulations, thus increasing opportunities for American workers \nby eliminating many of the incentives that currently induce firms to \nmove production and jobs to China.\n  What about using PNTR status and WTO membership to pressure Chinese \nauthorities into making significant improvements in other nontrade \nrelated policy areas? As I said earlier, while I have already \nregistered my concerns about China's record in these areas, I am \ndoubtful that directly linking PNTR status to changes in China's \npolicies in these areas will produce overnight positive changes. I \nthink all of us seek.\n  There is sufficient historical experience to suggest that linkage \nwill not cause Chinese authorities to improve their behavior in these \nareas one iota. Quite the opposite seems to be the case. Over the last \nquarter of a century, Chinese authorities have responded very \nconsistently and negatively to attempts by others to unilaterally \ndictate to them how they should govern their citizens. At such times, \nthe very issues we have cared about most--human rights, religious \nfreedom, Taiwan's security--have suffered. Rather, it has been during \nperiods of U.S. engagement with Chinese authorities, when we have \ncarried out a respectful dialogue between our two governments, that we \nhave seen demonstrable improvements in China's policies in these areas.\n  More recently, U.S. engagement has resulted in China joining a number \nof major multilateral arms control regimes, in assisting us to defuse a \nnuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula, and in participating \nconstructively in international efforts to contain the escalating arms \nrace between India and Pakistan.\n  I am not one who believes that China's accession to the WTO is going \nto convert the state-controlled Chinese society into a Jeffersonian \ndemocracy overnight. However, I would argue that China's adherence to \nthe discipline of WTO's rules and standards have a greater likelihood \nto accelerate the pace of market economic reforms that are already \nunderway in China. And, as a by-product of those reforms, the grip of \nthe Chinese state on the day to day lives of the Chinese people will \nbecome weaker and weaker. Individual freedom may gradually fill the \nvacuum created by the withdrawal of state control. Whether that process \nwill ultimately transform China's political system is impossible to \npredict with any certainty. Certainly isolating China isn't going to \nfacilitate such a transformation.\n  I am not the only one who holds that view. A number of prominent \nhuman rights activists in China have spoken out publicly in support of \nthe pending legislation and in favor of China's admission to the WTO. I \nam thinking of such individuals as Martin Lee, the internationally \nknown leader of Hong Kong's Democratic party, His Excellency the Dalai \nLama, Dai Qing, a leading political dissident and environmentalist who \nwas imprisoned for ten months following the 1989 Tiananmen Square \nMassacre, and Bao Tong, a senior advisor to ousted President Zhao \nZyiang--both of whom were imprisoned for their opposition to the \nTiananmen crackdown. None of these individuals have suggested that we \ndeny China admission to the WTO until it becomes a democracy.\n  In fact, if we refuse to grant PNTR status to China or oppose its \nadmission to the WTO, we will have delivered an enormous setback to the \nChinese reformers and entrepreneurs who have been the driving force for \nthe positive political and economic changes that have occurred in China \nover the last twenty years. We will also have given an enormous gift to \nour economic competitors in Europe and Asia by giving them a foothold \nin perhaps the most important emerging market in the global economy of \nthe 21st century--a foothold that will be difficult for our own Nation \nto regain. American jobs would be the ones that suffer and American \nworkers the ones who pay the price.\n\n  Denying China PNTR would also only exacerbate an alarmingly high \nexisting trade deficit with the United States, in my view. In 1997, the \nU.S. trade deficit with China soared to nearly $50 billion, making it \nsecond only to Japan as a trading deficit partner. Sadly, that number \nhas only increased over time. By 1999, it had climbed almost $20 \nbillion more, to $69 billion, and it continues to grow.\n  In closing, I believe the legislation we are considering today is in \nour national economic interest because it will enhance international \ngrowth and competition. It will strengthen the global trading system \nand foster adherence to rules and standards under which we want all \nnations to operate.\n  I also believe it is in our foreign policy interests, as well. \nChina's obligation to open its markets and to abide by internationally \nprescribed trade rules is an important step toward Chinese adherence to \nother important international norms and standards which must, over \ntime, lead to democratic transformation of that society, as I have seen \noccur in nearly every other corner of the globe in the past decade and \na half.\n  No one in this body is naive enough to believe this is going to \nhappen overnight, that these changes we talk about are necessarily \ngoing to occur at the pace we would like to see. But, at the very \nleast, we must begin making strides in that direction.\n  For those reasons, while I will support various amendments that I \nthink are an important expression of how my constituents feel in \nConnecticut and how the American public feels on a number of very \nimportant non trade-related issues, when this debate is concluded, I \nhappen to believe it would be in the best interests of my Nation that \nwe grant this status to China in the hopes that the improvements we all \nseek in this land of more than 1 billion people will occur sooner \nrather than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon on \nMonday, September 11, the Senate resume consideration of Senator Byrd's \namendment regarding subsidies. Further, I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be 60 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form with no \namendments in order to the amendment.

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that when \nSenator Byrd offers an amendment relating to safeguards, there be 3 \nhours for debate equally divided in the usual form, with no amendments \nin order to the amendment. Further, I ask consent, following that \ndebate time, the vote occur on the amendment at a time to be determined \nby the majority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho, Senator Craig, came to the floor to respond to an article \nthat appeared in the newspaper, USA Today. I want to take just a moment \nto respond to the article, as well as to some of his comments. He \nresponded, I think, as I would if I had read the article. It is \nentitled, ``Senate Democratic Leader Plans Stalling Tactics,'' and \nmakes reference to the fact that we are running out of time at the end \nof the year and it claims to know that I have a simple strategy for \nwinning the final negotiations over spending bills--and I am now \nreading from the article: ``Stall until the Republicans have to cave in \nbecause they can't wait any longer to recess,'' and noted there are a \nlot more vulnerable Republican Senators than there are Democratic \nSenators.\n  As often is the case--I don't blame this reporter, and I am not sure \nI know who the reporter is--I think that was taken from a comment that \nI made in my daily press conference, where I simply noted that those \nwho were in the majority oftentimes are the ones who pay a higher price \nthe longer we are in session, the closer we get to the election, noting \nthat we have experienced that rude realization ourselves on at\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\nleast two occasions, in 1980 and 1994, and that the longer one goes \ninto the campaign season while we are still in session, the more it \nrequires that Senators remain present here in Washington and not \navailable for the demands of a rigorous campaign.\n  That was all I said. I made no reference to our desire to stall \nanything. In fact, it is not. The reason I have come to the floor is to \nemphasize our strong hope that we do not see any stalling whatsoever; \nthat we move on with the remaining appropriations bills. Eleven of them \nhave yet to be signed into law. I note for the record that two have not \neven left subcommittee. The District of Columbia appropriations bill \nand the HUD-VA bill are still pending in the subcommittee.\n  We finished our work on the energy and water appropriations bill this \nweek. It would be my hope that we could go to the only other pending \nappropriations bill on the calendar, which is the Commerce-State-\nJustice bill, next week. I do not know that is the intention of the \nmajority leader, but clearly it is a bill that must be considered and \ncompleted at the earliest possible date.\n  Our hope is that as we work through these appropriations bills, we \nwill have the opportunity to work through other pieces of unfinished \nbusiness. We are hopeful we can make real progress, maybe as early as \nnext week, on the minimum wage bill. Our hope is that we can finish our \nwork next week on the legislation granting permanent normal trade \nrelations to China. Our hope is that we can actually finish a Patients' \nBill of Rights bill and maybe gun safety legislation. Our hope is that \nwe can deal with the prescription drug benefit bill. There is an array \nof pieces of the unfinished agenda that we would love to be able to \naddress--education issues having to do with reducing the number of \nstudents in every class, hiring teachers, afterschool programs, school \nconstruction. Those issues have to be addressed at some point.\n  Whether it is authorizing or appropriating, we remain ready and \nwilling to work with our colleagues to accomplish as much as possible. \nI do not know whether or not it is conducive to that goal not to have \nvotes on Fridays or Mondays. It seems to me, with all the work that \nremains, Senators should be here casting their votes and participating \nfully in debates that will be required ultimately if we are going to \ncomplete our work on time.\n  I come to the floor this afternoon only to clarify the record and \nensure that if anybody has any doubt, let me address that doubt \nforthrightly. We want to finish our work. We want to work with our \nRepublican colleagues. We have no desire to stall anything. Our hope is \nthat we can finish on time and complete all 13 appropriations bills no \nlater than the first of October. There is no need for a continuing \nresolution. We can complete our work in the next 3 weeks. That is our \ndesire, and that certainly will be our intent as we make decisions with \nregard to what agreements we can reach on schedule, as well as on \nsubstance, in the coming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Mr. President, I again ask why the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000 is being held up. Senator Campbell and I, \nand others, both Republicans and Democrats, introduced this bulletproof \nvest bill to help our police officers. We introduced it last April. It \nwas stuck in the Judiciary Committee for a time despite my requests \nthat it be brought forth. It finally was allowed on the agenda and was \npassed out of there unanimously in June.\n  I find it hard to think that anybody who would be opposed to using \nsome of our Federal crime-fighting money for bulletproof vests for our \npolice officers. In fact, most Senators with whom I have talked, \nRepublican and Democrat, tell me they are very much in favor of it. \nThey saw how this worked in its first 2 years of operation. The \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program under the original Campbell-\nLeahy bill funded more than 180,000 new bulletproof vests for police \nofficers across the Nation.\n  We have a bill, though, that has been stalled, unfortunately, by an \nanonymous hold on the Republican side. This is a bipartisan bill that \nis being held up in a partisan fashion.\n  I am continually being asked by police officers who know how well the \noriginal Campbell-Leahy bill worked on bulletproof vests why we cannot \npass this continuation of it. It is strongly supported by police \nofficers all over the country. The President has made it very clear he \nwould sign such a bill into law, as he did the last one. It is \nsomething that, if it were brought to a rollcall vote in the Senate, I \nam willing to guess 98, maybe all 100 Senators, would vote for it. \nCertainly no fewer than 95 Senators would vote for it.\n  When we could not pass it by unanimous consent before our summer \nrecess because there was a hold, I wanted to make sure I could tell \nthese police officers that there was no hold on this side. We actually \nchecked with all 46 Democratic Senators. All 46 told us they would \nsupport it. All 46 said they would consent to having it passed anytime \nwe want to bring it up by a voice vote.\n  I have told these police officers that while a significant number of \nboth Republicans and Democrats support it or have cosponsored it, and \nwhile every single Democrat has said they support having it passed \ntoday, there is an anonymous hold on the Republican side. I hope that \nhold will go away. I urge these same police departments that have \ncontacted me to contact the Republican leadership and say: Please ask \nwhoever your anonymous Senator is to take the hold away and let the \nCampbell-Leahy bill pass.\n  That it has still not passed the full Senate is very disappointing to \nme, as I am sure that it is to our nation's law enforcement officers, \nwho need life-saving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. \nProtecting and supporting our law enforcement community should not be a \npartisan issue.\n  Senator Campbell and I worked together closely and successfully in \nthe last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998 into law. This year's bill reauthorizes and extends the successful \nprogram that we helped create and that the Department of Justice has \ndone such a good job implementing.\n  We have 19 cosponsors on the new bill, including a number of \nDemocrats and some Republicans. This is a bipartisan bill that is not \nbeing treated in a bipartisan way. For some unknown reason a Republican \nSenator has a hold on this bill and has chosen to exercise that right \nanonymously.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 \npercent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty \nsince 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. \nIndeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while \nnot wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it.\n  To better protect our Nation's law enforcement officers, Senator \nCampbell and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, \n1998. Our law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program \nwithin the Department of Justice to help state and local law \nenforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001.\n  In its first two years of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program has funded more than 180,000 new bulletproof vests for \npolice officers across the country.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the \nsuccess of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million \nfor fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by \nguaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive \nthe full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these \nsmaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests \neligible for grant\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nawards to protect corrections officers in close quarters in local and \ncounty jails.\n  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the \ncountry face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during \nroutine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential \nthe we update this law so that many more of our officers who are \nrisking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves.\n  I hope that the mysterious ``hold'' on the bill from the other side \nof the aisle will disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and send it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Before we recessed last July, I informed the Republican leadership \nthat the House of Representatives had passed the companion bill, H.R. \n4033, by an overwhelming vote of 413-3. I expressed my hope that the \nSenate would quickly follow suit and pass the House-passed bill and \nsend it to the President. President Clinton has already endorsed this \nlegislation to support our Nation's law enforcement officers and is \neager to sign it into law.\n  Several more weeks have come and gone. Unfortunately, nothing has \nchanged. Not knowing what the misunderstanding of our bill is, I find \nit is impossible to overcome an anonymous, unstated objection. I, \nagain, ask whoever it is on the Republican side who has a concern about \nthis program to please come talk to me and Senator Campbell. I hope the \nSenate will do the right thing and pass this important legislation \nwithout further unnecessary delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8267-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8267-S8271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUVENILE JUSTICE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, talking about things that are being held \nup, I want to talk about the juvenile justice conference. Last year, in \nresponse to the terrible tragedy at Columbine, we passed a bipartisan \njuvenile justice bill through the Senate. Something like 73 Senators of \nboth parties voted for this bill. We had weeks of debate. We had a \nnumber of amendments that improved it and a number of amendments that \nwere rejected, but we had a full and open debate and a number of \nrollcall votes. As I said, it passed with 73 Senators voting for it.\n  That was last year. I urged before school started last year that we \nhave a conference and work out the differences, if there are \ndifferences, between the House and the Senate; that we vote up or down. \nThe conference is chaired by a Republican Senator, and we have not had \nanything other than a formal meeting to start the conference the day \nbefore the August recess in 1999. We have not met since then. We went \noff to our summer vacation and came back to schools starting all across \nthe country. We just returned this week from this year's summer recess \nand we still have not had a meeting of the conferees.\n  I have been willing to accept votes up or down on matters of \ndifference. I point out there are more Republicans on the conference \nthan there are Democrats, Republicans chair both delegations from both \nHouses, so Republicans control the conference. If they do not like \nsomething that is in the conference, they can vote it down, they can \nvote it out. I know the we are in the minority. What I want to do is \nget this juvenile justice bill through so we can make the school year \nbetter, more productive, more educational, and a safer one.\n  The President of the United States was concerned enough about this \nthat he invited the Republican leadership and Democratic leadership to \nmeet with him at the White House. I recall that he spent nearly 2 hours \nwith us going over the bill. He indicated that he wanted to work with \nus to get a good law enacted. All he wanted to do was to get us to at \nleast meet on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill that passed the \nSenate by a 3-to-1 bipartisan majority vote back on May 20, 1999. This \nis the Hatch-Leahy bill. Even with the two chief sponsors, you span the \npolitical spectrum.\n\n  I urge again that the Congress not continue to stall this major piece \nof legislation. I remind Republicans, if they do not like anything \nDemocrats have put in the bill, they can vote us down. There are more \nRepublican Senate conferees than there are Democratic conferees. There \nare more Republican House conferees than there are Democratic \nconferees. If the Republicans do not like something in it, they can \njust vote to remove it. There is nothing we can do to stop that. But at \nleast take what is a good piece of legislation that will protect our \nchildren in school and let it go forward.\n  It has been 17 months since the tragedy at Columbine High School. \nFourteen students and a teacher lost their lives there. Surely we could \ndo better than to just stall this bill and hold this bill up.\n  Every parent, every teacher, every student in this country is \nconcerned about the school violence over the last few years. It does \nnot make any difference which political affiliation it is. If you are a \nparent, you are worried about the safety of your children going to \nschool. If you are a teacher, you are worried about your workplace. If \nyou are a student, you worry when you go to school.\n  Now, many fear that there will be more tragedies. The list of places \nsuffering incidents of school violence continues to grow to include \nArkansas, Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, \nKentucky, Mississippi, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, and Florida.\n  We all know there is no single cause. There is no single legislative \nsolution to cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or on our \nstreets. But we have had an opportunity for us to do our part. Frankly, \nI am disappointed in the Republican majority because they are \nsquandering this opportunity.\n  We passed this bill, with 73 Senators--Republicans and Democrats \nalike joining to pass this bill--by an overwhelming margin. The least \nwe could do is not allow it to then languish without ever being brought \nup for final action so the President can either sign it or veto it.\n  We should have seized this opportunity to act on balanced, effective \njuvenile justice legislation. Instead, the Senate has been in recess \nmore than in session since the single ceremonial meeting of the \njuvenile crime conference. Just think of that. That is wrong. Let us go \nforward and pass this.\n  In fact, the Republican chairman of the House-Senate conference, at \nour one and only conference meeting in August 1999, said:\n\n       Our Nation has been riveted by a series of horrific school \n     shootings in recent years, which culminated this spring--\n\n  Remember, this was said last year--\n\n     with the tragic death of 12 students and one teacher at \n     Columbine High School in Colorado. Sadly, the killings at \n     Columbine High School are not an isolated event. In 1997, \n     juveniles accounted for nearly one-fifth of all criminal \n     arrests in the United States. Juveniles committed 13.5 \n     percent of all murders, more than 17 percent of all rapes, \n     nearly 30 percent of all robberies, 50 percent of all arsons. \n     While juvenile crime has dipped slightly in the last 2 years, \n     it remains at historically unprecedented levels. Such \n     violence makes this legislation necessary.\n\n  I agree with the Republican chairman of that conference that such \nviolence makes this legislation necessary. I absolutely agree with him. \nBut I do not agree with him then leaving that conference well over a \nyear ago and never coming back and never completing the work.\n  We have to finish this. We have to finish this bill. All we have to \ndo is bring the conference together. Ninety-eight percent of the bill \nwould be agreed to very quickly. If there is 2 percent remaining, then \nvote it up or vote on it.\n  During the course of Senate debate on the bill in May 1999 we were \nable to make to the bill better, stronger and better balanced. It \nbecame more comprehensive and more respectful of the core protections \nin federal juvenile justice legislation that have served us so well \nover the last three decades. At the same time we made it more \nrespectful of the primary role of the States in prosecuting criminal \nmatters.\n  I recognize, as we all do, that no legislation is perfect and that \nlegislation alone is not enough to stop youth violence. We can pass an \nassortment of new laws and still turn on the news to find out that some \nchild somewhere in the country has turned violent and turned on other \nchildren and teachers, with terrible results.\n  All of us--whether we are parents, grandparents, teachers, \npsychologists, or policy-makers--puzzle over the causes of kids turning \nviolent in our country. The root causes are likely\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nmulti-faceted. We can all point to inadequate parental involvement or \nsupervision, over-crowded classrooms and over-sized schools that add to \nstudents' alienation, the easy accessibility of lethal weapons, the \nviolence depicted on television, in movies and video games, or \ninappropriate content available on the Internet. There is no single \ncause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of \nyouth violence in our schools or in our streets. Nevertheless, our \nlegislation would have been a significant step in the right direction. \nAs the FBI Report released on September 6, 2000 entitled ``The School \nShooter'' points out, there are a number of factors that make a child \nturn violent.\n  The Senate bill, S. 254, started out as a much-improved bill from the \none reported by the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress. In fact, \na number of proposals that the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee \nspecifically voted down in 1997 were incorporated at the outset into \nthis bill. These are changes that I and other Democrats have been \nurging on our Republican colleagues for the past few years, and that \nthey have resisted until quietly incorporated into this bill.\n  I tried in July 1997 to amend the earlier bill to protect the State's \ntraditional prerogative in handling juvenile offenders and avoid the \nunnecessary federalization of juvenile crime that so concerns the Chief \nJustice and the Federal judiciary. Specifically, my 1997 amendment \nwould have limited the federal trial as an adult of juveniles charged \nwith nonviolent felonies to circumstances when the State is unwilling \nor unable to exercise jurisdiction. This amendment was defeated, with \nall the Republicans voting against it.\n  The Senate bill last year contained a new provision designed to \naddress these federalism concerns that would direct federal prosecutors \nto ``exercise a presumption in favor of referral'' of juvenile cases to \nthe appropriate State or tribal authorities, where there is \n``concurrent jurisdiction,'' unless the State declines jurisdiction and \nthere is a substantial federal interest in the case.\n  Yet, concerns remained that the bill would undermine a State's \ntraditionally prerogative to handle juvenile offenders.\n  The changes we made to the underlying bill in the Hatch-Leahy \nmanagers' amendment went a long way to satisfy my concerns. \nFor example, S. 254 as introduced would have repealed the very first \nsection of the Federal Criminal Code dealing with ``Correction of \nYouthful Offenders.'' This is the section that establishes a clear \npresumption that the States--not the federal government--should handle \nmost juvenile offenders [18 U.S.C. section 5001]. While the original S. \n254 would have repealed that provision, the Managers' amendment \nretained it in slightly modified form.\n\n  In addition, the original S. 254 would have required federal \nprosecutors to refer most juvenile cases to the State in cases of \n``concurrent jurisdiction . . . over both the offense and the \njuvenile.'' This language created a recipe for sharp lawyering. Federal \nprosecutors could avoid referral by simply claiming there was no \n``concurrent'' jurisdiction over the ``offense'' due to linguistic or \nother differences between the federal and state crimes. Even if the \njuvenile's conduct violated both Federal and State law, any difference \nin how those criminal laws were written could be used to argue they \nwere different offenses altogether. This was a huge loophole that could \nhave allowed federal prosecutors to end-run the presumption of referral \nto the State.\n  We fixed this in the Managers' Amendment, and clarified that whenever \nthe federal government or the State have criminal laws that punish the \nsame conduct and both have jurisdiction over the juvenile, federal \nprosecutors should refer the juvenile to the State in most instances.\n  Finally, I was concerned that, contrary to current law, a federal \nprosecutor's decision to proceed against a juvenile in federal court \nwould not be subject to any judicial review. The Managers' Amendment \npermitted such judicial review, except in cases involving serious \nviolent or serious drug offenses.\n  Federal Trial of Juveniles as Adults. Another area of concern had \nbeen the ease with which the original S. 254 would have allowed federal \nprosecutors to prosecute juveniles 14 years and older as adults for any \nfelony.\n  While I have long favored simplifying and streamlining current \nfederal procedures for trying juveniles, I believe that judicial review \nis an important check in the system, particularly when you are dealing \nwith children.\n  This bill, S. 254, included a ``reverse waiver'' proposal allowing \nfor judicial review of most cases in which a juvenile is charged as an \nadult in federal court. I had suggested a similar proposal in July \n1997, when I tried to amend the earlier bill before the Judiciary \nCommittee to permit limited judicial review of a federal prosecutor's \ndecision to try certain juveniles as adults. That prior bill granted \nsole, non-reviewable authority to federal prosecutors to try juveniles \nas adults for any federal felony, removing federal judges from that \ndecision altogether. My 1997 amendment would have granted federal \njudges authority in appropriate cases to review a prosecutor's decision \nand to handle the juvenile case in a delinquency proceeding rather than \ntry the juvenile as an adult.\n  Only three States in the country granted prosecutors the \nextraordinary authority over juvenile cases that the earlier bill had \nproposed. We saw the consequences of that kind of authority, when a \nlocal prosecutor in Florida charged as an adult a 15-year-old mildly \nretarded boy with no prior record who stole $2 from a school classmate \nto buy lunch. The local prosecutor charged him as an adult and locked \nhim up in an adult jail for weeks before national press coverage forced \na review of the charging decision in the case.\n\n  This was not the kind of incident I wanted happening on the federal \nlevel. Unfortunately, my proposal for a ``reverse waiver'' procedure \nproviding judicial review of a prosecutor's decision was voted down in \nCommittee in 1997, with no Republican on the Committee voting for it.\n  I was pleased that S. 254 contained a ``reverse waiver'' provision, \ndespite the Committee's rejection of this proposal three years ago. \nThough made belated, this was a welcome change in the bill. The \nManagers' amendment made important improvements to that provision, as \nwell.\n  First, S. 254 gave a juvenile defendant only 20 days to file a \nreverse waiver motion after the date of the juvenile's first \nappearance. This time was too short, and could have lapsed before the \njuvenile was indicted and was aware of the actual charges. The \nManagers' amendment extended the time to make a reverse waiver motion \nto 30 days, which begins at the time the juvenile defendant appears to \nanswer an indictment.\n  Second, S. 254 required the juvenile defendant to show by ``clear and \nconvincing'' evidence that he or she should be tried as a juvenile \nrather than an adult. This is a very difficult standard to meet, \nparticularly under strict time limits. Thus, the Managers' amendment \nchanged this standard to a ``preponderance'' of the evidence. These are \nall significant improvements over the version of this bill considered \noriginally in the 105th Congress.\n  Juvenile Records. As initially introduced, S. 254 would have required \njuvenile criminal records for any federal offense, no matter how petty, \nto be sent to the FBI. This criminal record would haunt the juvenile as \nhe grew into an adult, with no possibility of expungement from the \nFBI's database.\n  The Managers' amendment made important changes to this record \nrequirement. The juvenile records sent to the FBI would be limited to \nacts that would be felonies if committed by an adult. In addition, \nunder the Managers' amendment, a juvenile would be able after 5 years \nto petition the court to have the criminal record removed from the FBI \ndatabase, if the juvenile showed by clear and convincing evidence that \nhe or she is no longer a danger to the community. Expungement of \nrecords from the FBI's database would not apply to juveniles convicted \nof rape, murder or certain other serious felonies.\n  Increasing Witness Tampering Penalties. This bill, S. 254, also \ncontained a provision to increase penalties for witness tampering that \nI first suggested and included in the ``Youth Violence, Crime and Drug \nAbuse Control Act of 1997,'' S. 15, which was introduced in the first \nweeks of the 105th Congress, at the end of the last Congress in the\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\n``Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484, \nand again in S. 9, the comprehensive package of crime proposals \nintroduced with Senator Daschle at the beginning of this Congress. This \nprovision would increase the penalty for using or threatening physical \nforce against any person with intent to tamper with a witness, victim \nor informant from a maximum of ten to twenty years' imprisonment. In \naddition, the provision adds a conspiracy penalty for obstruction of \njustice offenses involving witnesses, victims and informants.\n\n  I have long been concerned about the undermining of our criminal \njustice system by criminal efforts to threaten or harm witnesses, \nvictims and informants, to stop them from cooperating with and \nproviding assistance to law enforcement. I tried to include this \nprovision, along with several other law enforcement initiatives, by \namendment to the earlier bill during Committee mark-up on July 11, \n1997, but this amendment was voted down by all the Republicans on the \nCommittee. At the end of the mark-up, however, this witness tampering \nprovision was quietly accepted and I am pleased that it is included in \nS. 254.\n  Eligibility Requirements for Accountability Block Grant. This bill, \nS. 254, substantially relaxes the eligibility requirements for the new \njuvenile accountability block grant. By contrast, the bill in the last \nCongress would have required States to comply with a host of new \nfederal mandates to qualify for the first cent of grant money, such as \npermitting juveniles 14 years and older to be prosecuted as adults for \nviolent felonies, establishing graduated sanctions for juvenile \noffenders, implementing drug testing programs for juveniles upon \narrest, and nine new juvenile record-keeping requirements. These \nrecord-keeping mandates would have required, for example, that States \nfingerprint and photograph juveniles arrested for any felony act and \nsend those records to the FBI, plus make all juvenile delinquency \nrecords available to law enforcement agencies and to schools, including \ncolleges and universities. We could find no State that would have \nqualified for this grant money without agreeing to change their laws in \nsome fashion to satisfy the twelve new mandates.\n  In 1997, I tried to get the Judiciary Committee to relax the new \njuvenile record-keeping mandates under the accountability grant program \nduring the mark-up of the earlier bill. My 1997 amendment would have \nlimited the record-keeping requirements to crimes of violence or felony \nacts committed by juveniles, rather than to all juvenile offenses no \nmatter how petty. But my amendment was voted down on July 23, 1997, by \nthe Republicans on the Committee. Finally, two years later, S. 254 \nreflects the criticism I and other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee \nleveled at the strict eligibility and record-keeping requirements.\n  Indeed, the Senate decisively rejected this approach when it defeated \nan amendment by a Republican Senator that would have revived those \nstraight-jacket eligibility requirements. Specifically, his amendment \nwould have required States to try as adults juveniles 14 years or older \nwho committed certain crimes. As I pointed out during floor debate on \nthis amendment, only two States would have qualified for grant funds \nunless they agreed to change their laws.\n  Moreover, the current bill removes the record-keeping requirements \naltogether from the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant. Instead, S. \n254 sets up an entirely new Juvenile Criminal History Block Grant, \nfunded at $75 million per year. To qualify for a criminal history \ngrant, States would have to promise within three years to keep \nfingerprint supported records of delinquency adjudications of juveniles \nwho committed a felony act. No more photographs required. No more \nrecords of mere arrests required. No more dissemination of petty \njuvenile offense records to schools required. Instead, only juvenile \ndelinquency adjudications for murder, armed robbery, rape or sexual \nmolestation must be disseminated in the same manner as adult records; \nother juvenile delinquency adjudications records may only be used for \ncriminal justice purposes. These limitations are welcome changes to the \nburdensome, over-broad record-keeping requirements in the prior version \nof the Republican juvenile crime bill.\n\n  The eligibility requirements for the Juvenile Accountability Block \nGrant now number only three, including that the State have in place a \npolicy of drug testing for appropriate categories of juveniles upon \narrest.\n  Core Protections for Children. Much of the debate over reforming our \njuvenile justice system has focused on how we treat juvenile offenders \nwho are held in State custody. Republican efforts to roll back \nprotections for children in custody failed in the last Congress. These \nprotections were originally put in place when Congress enacted the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (JJDPA) to \ncreate a formula grant program for States to improve their juvenile \njustice systems. This Act addressed the horrific conditions in which \nchildren were being detained by State authorities in close proximity to \nadult inmates--conditions that too often resulted in tragic assaults, \nrapes and suicides of children.\n  As the JJDPA has evolved, four core protections have been adopted--\nand are working--to protect children from adult inmates and to ensure \ndevelopment of alternative placements to adult jails. These four core \nprotections for juvenile delinquents are: Separation of juvenile \noffenders from adult inmates in custody (known as sight and sound \nseparation); Removal of juveniles from adult jails or lockups, with a \n24-hour exception in rural areas and other exceptions for travel and \nweather related conditions; Deinstitutionalizaton of status offenders; \nand to study and direct prevention efforts toward reducing the \ndisproportionate confinement of minority youth in the juvenile justice \nsystem.\n  Over strong objection by most of the Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee in the last Congress, the earlier bill would have eliminated \nthree of the four core protections and substantially weakened the \n``sight and sound'' separation standard for juveniles in State custody. \nAt the same time the Committee appeared to acknowledge the wisdom and \nnecessity of such requirements when it adopted an amendment requiring \nseparation of juveniles and adult inmates in Federal custody.\n  This bill, S. 254, was an improvement in its retention of modified \nversions of three out of the four core protections. Specifically, S. \n254 included the sight and sound standard for juveniles in Federal \ncustody. The same standard is used to apply to juveniles delinquents in \nState custody.\n  Legitimate concerns were raised that the prohibition on physical \ncontact in S. 254 would still allow supervised proximity between \njuveniles and adult inmates that is ``brief and incidental or \naccidental,'' since this could be interpreted to allow routine and \nregular--though brief--exposure of children to adult inmates. For \nexample, guards could routinely escort children past open adult cells \nmultiple times a day on their way to a dining area.\n\n  The Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment made significant progress on the \n``sight and sound separation'' protection and the ``jail removal'' \nprotection. Specifically, our amendment made clear that when parents in \nrural areas give their consent to have their children detained in adult \njails after an arrest, the parents may revoke their consent at any \ntime. In addition, the judge who approves the juvenile's detention must \ndetermine it is in the best interests of the juvenile, and may review \nthat detention--as the judge must periodically--in the presence of the \njuvenile.\n  The managers' amendment also clarified that juvenile offenders in \nrural areas may be detained in an adult jail for up to 48 hours while \nawaiting a court appearance, but only when no alternative facilities \nare available and appropriate juvenile facilities are too far away to \nmake the court appearance or travel is unsafe to undertake.\n  The Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment also significantly improved the \nsight and sound separation requirement for juvenile offenders in both \nFederal and State custody. The amendment incorporated the guidance in \ncurrent regulations for keeping juveniles separated from adult \nprisoners. Specifically, the Managers' amendment would require \nseparation of juveniles and adult inmates and excuse only ``brief and \ninadvertent or accidental'' proximity in non-residential areas, which\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\nmay include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, \nentry areas, and passageways.\n  I was pleased we were able to make this progress. I appreciate that a \nnumber of Members remain seriously concerned, as do I, about how S. 254 \nwould change the disproportionate minority confinement protection in \ncurrent law. This bill, S. 254, removes any reference to minorities and \nrequires only that efforts be made to reduce over-representation of any \nsegment of the population. I was disappointed that Senators Wellstone \nand Kennedy's amendment to restore this protection did not succeed \nduring Senate consideration of the bill and looked forward to continued \ndiscussion and progress on this issue in the conference.\n  Prevention. The bill included a $200 million per year Juvenile \nDelinquency Prevention Challenge Grant to fund both primary prevention \nand intervention uses after juveniles have had contact with the \njuvenile justice system. I and a number of other members were concerned \nthat in the competition for grant dollars, the primary prevention uses \nwould lose out to intervention uses in crucial decisions on how this \ngrant money would be spent. With the help of Senator Kohl, we included \nin the Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment a clear earmark that eighty \npercent of the money, or $160 million per year if the program is fully \nfunded, is to be used for primary prevention uses and the other twenty \npercent is to be used for intervention uses. Together with the 25 \npercent earmark, or about $112 million per year if that program is \nfully funded, for primary prevention in the Juvenile Accountability \nBlock Grant that was passed by the Senate in the Hatch-Biden-Sessions \namendment, this bill now reflects a substantial amount of solid funding \nfor primary prevention uses.\n\n  Prosecutors' Grants. I expressed some concern when the Senate passed \nthe Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment authorizing $50 million per year for \nprosecutors and different kinds of assistance to prosecutors to speed \nup prosecution of juvenile offenders. I pointed out that this amendment \ndid not authorize any additional money for judges, public defenders, \ncounselors, or corrections officers. The consequence would be to \nexacerbate the backlog in juvenile justice systems rather than helping \nit.\n  The managers' amendment fixed that problem by authorizing $50 million \nper year in grants to State juvenile court systems to be used for \nincreased resources to State juvenile court judges, juvenile \nprosecutors, juvenile public defenders, and other juvenile court system \npersonnel.\n  State Advisory Groups. The Senate bill incorporates changes I \nrecommended to the earlier version of the bill in the last Congress. I \nhave been working to ensure the continued existence and role of State \nAdvisory Groups, or SAGs, in the development of State plans for \naddressing juvenile crime and delinquency, and the use of grant funds \nunder the JJDPA. The Judiciary Committee in 1997 adopted my amendment \nto preserve SAGs and require representation from a broad range of \njuvenile justice experts from both the public and private sectors.\n  While, as introduced, S. 254 preserved SAGs, it eliminated the \nrequirement in current law that gives SAGs the opportunity to review \nand comment on a grant award to allow these experts to provide input on \nhow best to spend the money. In addition, while the bill authorizes the \nuse of grant funds to support the SAG, the bill does require States to \ncommit any funds to ensure these groups can function effectively. I am \npleased that we were able to accept an amendment sponsored by Senators \nKerrey, Roberts, and others, to ensure appropriate funding of SAGs at \nthe State level and to support their annual meetings.\n  Protecting Children from Harmful Internet Content. Over the past \ndecade, the Internet has grown from relative obscurity to an essential \ncommercial and educational tool. This rapid expansion has brought with \nit remarkable gains, but has also created new dangers for our children, \nprompting Congress to struggle with legislation that protects the free \nflow of information, as required by the First Amendment, while at the \nsame time shields our children from inappropriate material accessible \non the Internet.\n  I share the concern of many of my colleagues that much of the \nmaterial available on the Internet may not be appropriate for children \nand have joined in the search to find a solution that does not impinge \non any important constitutional rights or the free flow of information \non the Internet and avoids the pitfalls inherent in proposals such as \nthe Communications Decency Act and other pending proposals. \nSpecifically, Senators Hatch and I offered an amendment to S. 254, the \njuvenile justice bill, that was agreed to on May 13, 1999, by a vote of \n100 to 0. Our Internet filtering proposal would leave the solution to \nprotecting children in school and libraries from inappropriate online \nmaterials to local school boards and communities. The Hatch-Leahy \namendment would require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) with more \nthan 50,000 subscribers to provide residential customers, free or at \ncost, with software or other filtering system that prevents minors from \naccessing inappropriate material on the Internet. A survey would be \nconducted at set intervals after enactment to determine whether ISPs \nare complying with this requirement. The requirement that ISPs provide \nblocking software would become effective only if the majority of \nresidential ISP subscribers lack the necessary software within set time \nperiods.\n\n  Unfortunately, progress on this Internet filtering proposal has been \nstalled as the majority in Congress has refused to conclude the \njuvenile justice conference. This is just one of the many legislative \nproposals contained in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, \ndesigned to help and safeguard our children-- which is why that bill \npassed the Senate by an overwhelming majority over a year ago.\n  I commend Senator McCain for his leadership and dedication to this \nsubject. I hope that we can work together on this issue since we share \nan appreciation of the Internet as an educational tool and venue for \nfree speech, as well as concerns about protecting our children from \ninappropriate material whether they are at home, at school or in a \nlibrary.\n  Protecting Children From Guns. Significantly, the Senate amended this \nbill with important gun control measures that we all hope will help \nmake this country safer for our children. The bill, as now amended: \nbans the transfer to and possession by juveniles of assault weapons and \nhigh capacity ammunition clips; increases criminal penalties for \ntransfers of handguns, assault weapons, and high capacity ammunition \nclips to juveniles; bans prospective gun sales to juveniles with \nviolent crime records; expands the youth crime gun interdiction \ninitiative to up to 250 cities by 2003 for tracing of guns used in \nyouth crime; and increases federal resources dedicated to enforcement \nof firearms laws by $50 million a year. These common-sense initiatives \nwere first included in the comprehensive Leahy law enforcement \namendment that was tabled by the majority, but were later included in \nsuccessful amendments sponsored by Republican Senators. No matter how \nthese provisions were finally included in the bill, they will help keep \nguns out of hands of children and criminals, while protecting the \nrights of law abiding adults to use firearms.\n  In addition, through the efforts of Senators Lautenberg, Schumer, \nKerrey and others, we were able to require background checks for all \nfirearm purchases at all gun shows. After three Republican amendments \nfailed to close the gun show loophole in the Brady law, and, in fact, \ncreated many new loopholes in the law, with the help of Vice President \nGore's tie-breaking vote, a majority in the U.S. Senate voted to close \nthe gun show loophole.\n  Our country's law enforcement officers have urged Congress for more \nthan a year to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference \nreport. The following law enforcement organizations, representing \nthousands of law enforcement officers, have endorsed the Senate-passed \ngun safety amendments:\n  International Association of Chiefs of Police;\n  International Brotherhood of Police Officers;\n  Police Executive Research Forum;\n  Police Foundation;\n  Major City Chiefs;\n  Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\n  National Sheriffs Association;\n  National Association of School Resource Officers;\n  National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives;\n  Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association.\n  Our law enforcement officers deserve Congress' help, not the abject \ninaction that has ensued over that last two years.\n  I recount a few of the aspects of the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill \nto indicate that it was comprehensive and that it was the result of \nyears of work and weeks of Senate debate and amendment. I said at the \noutset of the debate last May 1999 that I would like nothing better \nthan to pass responsible and effective juvenile justice legislation. I \nwanted to pass juvenile justice legislation that would be helpful to \nthe youngest citizens in this country--not harm them. I wanted to pass \njuvenile justice legislation that assists States and local governments \nin handling juvenile offenders--not impose a ``one-size-fits-all'' \nWashington solution on them. I wanted to prevent juveniles from \ncommitting crimes, and not just narrowly focus on punishing children. I \nwanted to keep children who may harm others away from guns. This bill \nwould have made important contributions in each of these areas.\n  At the time the bill was considered by the Senate, in May 1999, the \nRepublican Manager of the bill, declared his support for the Senate \nbill and said:\n\n       Littleton was different. The need to do something about the \n     serious problem of youth violence has always been apparent. \n     The tragedy of a month ago gave us the ingenuity and \n     dedication to follow through. . . . I believe that the Senate \n     has crafted a consensus product and one which I intend to \n     support.\n\n  He called the Senate bill ``a testament to those who worked on it and \na product which, on the whole, will help our young people and do \nsomething significant about the problems of juvenile crime.'' He \nobserved:\n\n       People believe we are powerless to deal with violent \n     juvenile crime and that we are powerless to change our \n     culture. It is this feeling of powerlessness which threatened \n     our collective ambition for meaningful, penetrating solutions \n     in the wake of the Littleton tragedy. I believe the Senate \n     has taken a meaningful step towards shedding this defeatism.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Given the seriousness of our youth violence problem--and \n     the number of warning signs that tragedies will continue \n     unless all of us come together--we must move forward. We \n     should join together and pass this bill.\n\n  I deeply regret that the Republican leadership of this Congress will \nnot complete our work by holding the conference, meeting, voting, and \nreporting a final bill to the House and Senate and sending to the \nPresident a bill that would improve juvenile justice and school safety.\n  I commend the Administration for the numerous efforts it has made \nwithin the limitations of current law. Most recently, the Department of \nJustice has made available a Threat Assessment Perspective on school \nviolence developed by the Critical Incident Response Group and National \nCenter for the Analysis of Violent Crime of the FBI. This follows upon \nthe joint Justice and Education Department publication ``Early Warning, \nTimely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools,'' which was made available \nnationwide in 1998. In addition, the Department of Justice has provided \nimportant resources through the COPS in Schools Grant Program.\n  In closing, I thank our schools, teachers, parents, and children for \nall they have done in the past 2 years, without the Congress' help, to \nlower the level of violence in our schools. But I regret that this \nCongress has failed to do its work to provide the additional resources \nand reforms that would have been helpful and reassuring to our \nchildren, parents, grandparents, and teachers at schools. It can be \nbetter. It is unconscionable if we do not do better.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that my friend from \nMississippi, the distinguished majority leader, may propose a unanimous \nconsent request regarding the rural television loan guarantee bill \nwhich I have been working to get passed for many months. If the consent \nrequest actually offered is the one I have seen, I will have to object \nwhen that happens. I will explain why now so I don't hold up the \ndistinguished leader when he comes to the floor.\n  As a conferee last year on a major satellite television bill--the \nSatellite Home Viewer Improvement Act--I worked hard to include, along \nwith other Senators, a provision that would have assured that rural \nAmericans were not left out of the benefits of that Act. I teamed up \nwith other Senators to include a title that would have allowed USDA to \nprovide loan guarantees to companies that wished to offer local-into-\nlocal television to rural Americans. We wanted to do this so that rural \nfamilies would be able to receive their local network television \nstations over satellite, or other service, along with the full range of \nother programming. We wanted rural families to be able to get local \nnews, local weather warnings and local programming but recognized that \nwithout a loan guarantee program that might never happen.\n  In other words, we wanted to share the benefits of that bill that \nwould go to urban areas to rural Americans also through a loan \nguarantee program. I know many parts of rural America would not have \nthe benefits of it without a loan guarantee program. It is similar to \nwhat we did in my grandparents' time to bring telephone service and \nelectricity to rural areas.\n  As a Conferee, I originated the rural satellite guarantee program to \nbe administered by USDA when I was a conferee on the satellite TV bill. \nUnfortunately, one of the Senate committee chairmen objected to that \nprovision and insisted that it be pulled from the Conference Report. To \ndate, we have been unable to resolve this matter and regain the ground \nwe lost last year. I know the distinguished junior Senator from \nMontana, Senator Burns, took an early leadership role in this matter. \nHis colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from Montana, Senator \nBaucus, introduced legislation with me last year also on this issue. We \ndid this to show bipartisan support.\n  I want to work with all Members on this. The reason I would make such \nan objection, if it were done the way I have been told, is that to do \notherwise I would have to abandon rural America, and I don't intend to \ndo that. As a product of rural America, I feel my roots there very \ndeeply. Ironically enough, this could have already been law by today. \nThere is a simple solution. A lot of Republicans and Democrats agree on \nthis. We can send a great rural satellite loan guarantee bill to the \nHouse by working together. I think that could be passed by unanimous \nconsent. Or, we could enact a final bill by a Senate amendment to the \nHouse-passed bill. We could do that in the time it would take to get \nthe conferees together to meet.\n  I am concerned that a conference would delay this process until the \nend of the year and result in denying rural Americans local-into-local \ntelevision--the same kind of satellite local-into-local television \nurban residents now enjoy. I use as an example the electronic signature \nconference. That showed how difficult a conference can be and it shows \nhow long a conference can take. That conference took way more time to \nfinish than we have left to devote to any rural satellite conference. \nIn addition, the Congress has to pass at least ten major appropriations \nbills or else there could be another government shutdown. In this case, \nthe proposal would leave two key committees off the conference.\n  Regarding the e-signature conference, when we finally got the right \nmix of conferees and followed proper procedures, we still had many \nstruggles before we finished a strong e-signature bill that has been \napplauded by both businesses and consumers. However, this time around \nwe do not have time because the Congress is going out of session soon.\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\n  But we clearly have time to enact this rural satellite bill. My staff \nprovided draft language to many of the Republican and Democratic \noffices months ago in order to help resolve this matter. I urge the \nmajority leader and the Democratic leader to call a meeting so we can \nresolve this important issue and send a clean bill over to the House \nwithout wasting time. I suspect it would be passed very quickly, with \nvery strong support from the rural areas of our country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I want to very briefly continue a \ndiscussion that was held earlier on the floor today addressing an issue \nthat means not only a great deal to me but also to about 35 million \nseniors in this country as well as 5 million individuals with \ndisabilities. That is the issue of Medicare.\n  Our obligation, I believe, is to modernize Medicare and give those \nseniors and those individuals with disabilities what they deserve; that \nis, health care security as we know it is or should be in the year \n2000, not the sort of health care security that was appropriate for \n1956, back when Medicare began.\n  The challenge before us today as a body and the challenge before the \nAmerican people is really pretty clear; that is, how to best implement \na real plan for real people, those seniors and those individuals with \ndisabilities--not just a piece of legislation but a real plan that will \nmodernize Medicare in a way that will give them real health care \nsecurity.\n  A lot of individuals with disabilities and a lot of seniors out there \ndon't really realize how antiquated and out of date the current \nMedicare system is. I would like to make several points.\n  First of all, I believe modernization of Medicare today where it can \ntruly offer health care security is really a moral obligation that we \nhave to our seniors.\n  Second, under the leadership of Clinton/Gore, we have had really 8 \nyears where a lot of opportunities have been squandered, and they \nsimply have not led, if we look at this field of Medicare \nmodernization.\n  Third, we have to ask ourselves in terms of how best to modernize. If \nwe have an old jalopy that still is running along and still gets us \nfrom point to point, do we just want to put new gas in that car--we \nknow it is going to eventually fail--or do we want to go ahead and \nmodernize that car so that it will still get us from point to point but \nit will do so more efficiently and effectively in a way that will give \nus security and not just get us there but get us there with the very \nbest quality?\n\n  First of all, modernization of health care is a moral obligation. Why \ndo I say that?\n  If we look back to 1965 when Medicare began, Medicare was constructed \nto give health care security--inpatient care and some outpatient care--\nin a very effective way. For acute-care models, if you had a heart \nattack, you were taken care of essentially in the hospital. \nPrescription drugs were important but not nearly so important as they \nare today. We simply didn't know very much about preventive medicine in \n1965 and 1970. But all of that has changed. Now we know prescription \ndrugs are critically important to health care security. We know issues \nsuch as preventive health care can not only save money but, most \nimportantly, improve the quality of life--not just longer lives but a \nhigher quality of life.\n  The sad thing is that people don't know Medicare today has very \nlittle preventive care in it. I talk to seniors all over the State of \nTennessee in town meeting after town meeting. I say it has a little \npreventive care. They say: We didn't know that. When I talk about \nprescription drugs, it is surprising to many people today; not only \nseniors but others do not know that Medicare does not include \nprescription drugs.\n  I ask an audience of seniors or individuals with disabilities: How \nmuch do you think the Federal Government is helping you with your \nhealth care in terms of costs? If you are paying several thousand \ndollars a year for your health care, how much does the Government \nactually pay? They say 80 percent, initially, or they say 70 percent, \nor 60 percent. But in truth, on average, for seniors' health care \ncosts, only about 53 cents on the dollar is paid for by the money they \nhave paid in--by the Government and by the taxpayer. They are \nresponsible and end up paying about 47 cents on the dollar in spite of \nthe fact they paid into this Medicare trust fund over their lives.\n  Thus, I think we have a moral obligation if we are committed to \nhealth care security and to modernization of a system that we know will \nbe modern, that will include preventive care and prescription drugs.\n  That leads me to the second point. If that is the case and the \nfacts--and it is--where has our leadership been? Where has Vice \nPresident Gore been? Where has President Clinton been? They squandered \nan opportunity over the 6 years I have been in this body, and over the \nlast 8 years, to modernize that system; that is, that Medicare is built \non a 1965 model, 35 years ago. It is outdated; it is antiquated; it is \na car that is still moving and getting the care but not nearly as \nefficiently or as comprehensively as our seniors deserve.\n  The squandering of the opportunity is a pretty tough term to use, \nsaying that our leadership, through President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore, squandered this opportunity. Run down the list. We had \na National Bipartisan Medicare Commission that I had the opportunity to \nserve on with John Breaux, a Democrat, Bill Frist, Republican. We were \npretty evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. We had the \nprivate sector and public sector involved. In essence, the \nadministration, under President Clinton and Vice President Gore, walked \naway from the Commission's recommendations that were built on over 40 \nopen hearings with access to the very best experts in the United States \nof America. At the last minute, they walked away from the proposals \nwhich had bipartisan support. A majority of the Members supported it. \nAn opportunity squandered. The purpose of that Commission was to \nmodernize Medicare, to bring it up to date, to give our seniors the \nhealth care they deserve.\n  As to the Balanced Budget Act of 2 years ago, the Budget Committee in \nthis body, the U.S. Congress, said: Yes, we need to slow Medicare down, \nmake it fiscally responsible, make sure it is around 20 and 30 years \nfrom now. The way it was implemented under President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore, $37 billion less than we budgeted was spent--$37 \nbillion less.\n  What has that resulted in? It has resulted in facilities closing \ndown, over 200 hospitals--some urban hospitals serving the poor, some \nrural hospitals in Tennessee, and around the country--have closed.\n  As many as 20 percent of all Medicare-providing nursing homes are \neither at risk for bankruptcy or already have gone bankrupt because of \nthis excessive cut in spending--not intended by the U.S. Congress--\ncarried out by this administration.\n  We hear today there are hundreds of thousands of seniors who are \nlosing access today to prescription drug coverage because they were in \na plan called Medicare+Choice plans. Why are they leaving? Why are the \nplans not able to stay in business today? Because this administration, \nthrough the bureaucratic administrative load burden that sits on the \nshoulders of these plans--when placing the burden on the plans, it \nfalls down to the doctors. Basically, they cannot participate any \nlonger. Those are plans that are giving prescription drugs, making them \navailable. Another squandered opportunity by this administration.\n  On top of all of that, we had this demographic shift because of the \nbaby boom that we talk about. Yet because of a lack of leadership at \nthe Presidential level and the Vice Presidential level, we squandered \nanother opportunity. The demographic shift is the following: Over the \nnext 30 years, the number of seniors will double compared to what it is \ntoday. The number of people paying into this trust fund\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\nwill continue to go down. That demographic shift results in catastrophe \nif we don't make the system more efficient.\n  Modernization is a moral obligation, No. 1.\n  No. 2, our leadership in the executive branch has squandered the \nopportunity over the last 8 years to do something about it.\n  No. 3--and this is the fundamental question--do we want new gas \npoured into an old car, an old jalopy percolating along, or do we want \nto have a modern car that can operate efficiently, in a way that \nguarantees that health care security, that would have different \noptions, and the option might be preventive health care; it might be \nprescription drug coverage.\n  That is what we are faced with today. That is what we talked about a \nlittle bit on the floor today, and that is what the Presidential \nelection is all about.\n  With a little more gas, a broken down jalopy is going to fail. \nEverybody agrees because of the demographic shift there is no way to \ncontinue.\n  We have the various options out there that we know our seniors \ndeserve, thus the moral obligations that our individuals with \ndisabilities deserve.\n  Having blocked fundamental reform on this jalopy out there, Vice \nPresident Gore and President Clinton now, in terms of prescription \ndrugs, simply want to take off benefits and add them on to the system, \nwithout changing the system whatever. Using the old bureaucracy, the \nold broken down car, the Gore plan wants to take 8 years to pour the \ngas into that car. It will take 8 years before that prescription drug \nplan that the Vice President wants to add on to this antiquated, out-\nof-date Medicare system, to be fully implemented. Or do we want the new \ncar, want Medicare modernized to include prescription drug coverage, to \ninclude a modern choice of plans.\n  I think we have a unique opportunity. Today, workers really can say, \nunder a modern program, that every senior will be able to keep exactly \nthe same benefits they have today. Under a modern program, every senior \nwill be offered a choice of benefits that includes prescription drugs \nfor the first time, that will include preventive care for the first \ntime, and that every senior will be covered for catastrophic Medicare \ncosts.\n  I do urge my colleagues in this body and all Americans to recognize \nand to call for real health care security, a real plan for real people.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask Senator Frist if he would yield to me \nbefore he yields the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Frist for the good work that \nhe does on behalf of his constituents but also the entire Senate. He is \nthe only doctor we have in the Senate, a very outstanding heart \nsurgeon. He did quite an outstanding number of things before he ran for \nthe Senate, the first time he had ever run for office, and he has \nbecome a very valuable Member of this body. When he talks about health \ncare, health care delivery, he has seen it as a doctor; he has seen it \nfrom the standpoint of the patients with whom he has had to deal. He \nhas seen it from the standpoint of what hospitals do or can't do. He \nhas seen unbelievably magnificent technological medical advances that \nhave allowed our people to live longer and have a better quality of \nlife. He knows about heart, lung, and liver transplants. It is a \nmiracle.\n  We want to continue to improve health care in America. I think we \nhave to recognize that it is changing so fast, we have so many people \nliving so much longer with different kinds of needs, we have to be \nflexible and we have to make changes. He also understands that we could \nkill the goose that laid the golden egg. We still are blessed in this \ncountry to have the best health care, the most sophisticated, \ntechnologically advanced health care the minds of men have ever \nconceived in the history of the world. And we want to make sure that we \nprotect that, preserve it, and make it better.\n  A good way to begin to kill it is to turn it over to the Federal \nGovernment. The Government can kill the goose that laid the golden egg; \nit can take it down. That is why the American people and the Congress \ndidn't go along with the Government takeover of health care that was \nadvocated in 1993.\n  Senator Frist, as a doctor, has come in and has gotten involved. He \nis working on these issues. He has been involved in our debate on \nhealth issues. That is why I asked him to serve also on our Medicare \nBipartisan Commission. We had five or six Senators on that Commission: \nSenator Gramm of Texas, Senator Frist, Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nKerrey, and Senator Breaux of Louisiana was the chairman, the Democrat \nchairman of this Bipartisan Commission. I also was very pleased to have \na lady in her seventies from my State of Mississippi as one of the \ncommissioners. She was the only one with gray hair on the whole \nCommission. She was the only one not only eligible for Medicare, she \nwas the one person who dealt every day with Medicare, where the rubber \nhits the road, dealing with Medicare cases in my State office in \nJackson, MI--Eileen Gordon. Dr. Frist will tell you she was an \noutstanding member of the Commission, but she used to say during the \nmeeting: Let me tell you how this really works. Among all these \nexperts, all those theoreticians, there was one person dealing with it \non an individual basis who did a magnificent job.\n\n  That Commission did a good job. They came up with Medicare reforms \nwhich would preserve and improve the system, and it included a \nprescription drug component, with choice, with the private sector \ninvolved but prescription drug benefits for those with incomes up to \n135 percent of poverty. It was a good plan and a bipartisan plan.\n  I thought we should have moved it forward. I called and talked to \nPresident Clinton on Monday, I believe it was, of the week that they \nwere supposed to report, pleaded with him to take another look at it; \nnot shoot it down, in effect. He said he had a problem with this or \nthat.\n  I said: Mr. President, that has been changed. Please talk to John \nBreaux, the chairman of the Commission. Get the latest proposal. Let's \nkeep the process going. Let's let it come on up to the Finance \nCommittee. The Finance Committee can have hearings and look at it. \nLet's get this thing going. We can get some reforms; we can get \nprescription drug benefits.\n  As a matter of fact, he did call Chairman Breaux and he did take a \nlook at it. But he did walk out into the Rose Garden a day or two after \nthat and said: This is no good. We are not going to do it.\n  That was a magic moment missed. That was in the spring of 1999.\n  But they got it started in the right direction. Really, that is still \nwhere we should go. We should have prescription drug benefits available \nto those, the low-income elderly, who really need help who can't afford \nit, can't get it now, but not subsidize it for everybody. We don't need \nprescription drug benefit assistance for Donald Trump or Bill Gates or \nBill Frist. We need it for low-income elderly people such as my mother, \nwho has to live on $859 a month and pay her bills in an assisted care \nfacility, and pay her drug bills. She needs help. A lot of people like \nher need help. But they don't need it 15 months from now or 8 years \nfrom now. They need it now.\n  That is why I am pleased that Chairman Roth has come up with a \npackage that will do that. It doesn't have the Medicare reforms we \nought to have.\n  Senator Frist is right; if we just put more passengers on this ship \nthat is sinking, it is going to sink even faster. So we need to \npreserve Medicare. We need some improvements and reforms. We need to \nmake sure none of this money is used for anything but Medicare. Then we \nneed to have a very sensible prescription drug component aimed at the \nelderly poor who really need it.\n  I appreciate the time he spent in the Medicare commission. I think we \nought to reconstitute the Medicare commission. I hope the next \nPresident will reconstitute that group and say: You have 120 days. I \nwant to hear from you then. We are going to act on what you recommend; \nup or down, but we are going to act on it.\n  I hope Senator Frist will be willing to serve. But have I given an \naccurate assessment of what happened with the Medicare commission? Is \nthat a correct description of the prescription drug component of that \nbill?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response, the description is very \naccurate. When I say that opportunities have been squandered, I put \nthat first\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\nand foremost because it very much demonstrates the bipartisanship, \nworking together, not having roadblock after roadblock after roadblock \nplaced in front of good ideas; working together. That serves real \npeople, those seniors who are out there today.\n  Let me close and say the one other thing the leader mentioned, which \nis critically important--there can be all sorts of solutions proposed, \nwhether for prescription drugs or to save Medicare long term. The one \nanswer that was clear after a year of work on this bipartisan Medicare \ncommission, one idea that repeatedly came forward from the experts all \nover the United States of America, and even people coming in from other \ncountries, was that a one-size-fits-all system, dictated by Washington, \nDC, the beltway mentality, is the one thing that will be destructive to \nme delivering health care; whether it is Bill Frist as a heart \ntransplant surgeon or my father who practiced for 55 years, initially \ndown in Mississippi and then back up in Tennessee. The one thing that \nwill destroy quality is one-size-fits-all, which inevitably results in \nprice controls, which destroy creativity, research, innovation, the \nhope for cures for Alzheimer's, for stroke, for heart disease.\n  One last component. There are things we can do now, now in the next 6 \nmonths, on prescription drugs. We don't have to wait forever. We don't \nhave to wait for 8 years to have a program. The Gore proposal or \nClinton proposal takes 8 years to phase in. We can act now and get \nprescription drugs to the people who need it most within 6 months, 8 \nmonths, or 9 months.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his work. He is right. What we need \nis reform that provides results now, prescription drugs now for those \nwho really need it. We don't need more roadblocks. We are going to work \ntogether to see if we can make that happen.\n  I thank him for yielding.\n  Now, I believe, Mr. President, I ask for the floor on my own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

During his \ntraining at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center he was \nnicknamed ``100%'' after earning the first perfect score in the class \non an examination.\n  In 1980 he moved to the Senate Sergeant at Arms office as Supervisor \nof Administrative Operations. In 1985 he became Manager of Senate \nParking. The challenge of managing limited parking with ever increasing \nneeds has been skillfully maintained during the years under his watch. \nHis institutional knowledge of the Senate's history and operations will \nbe surely missed in this great institution.\n  Both Pete and his wife Jeanie are native Washingtonians. Pete \nattended P.G. Community College and the University of Maryland where he \nstudied Political Science. Pete and Jeanie recently moved to \nSpringfield, Virginia, after 20 years in Clinton, Maryland. He plans to \nspend his retirement enjoying his hobbies of photography, downhill \nskiing and electronics.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nshock at the recent statement of independent counsel Robert Ray in last \nweek's New York Times that he will shortly be releasing findings and \nconclusions in the Whitewater matter. Only the special court has the \nauthority to release the final report of an independent counsel or any \nportion of a final report, and the only authority the law gives an \nindependent counsel is to prepare a final report and file it with the \nspecial court. Mr. Ray has no legal authority to unilaterally release \nresults of his investigation, and if he does so, he is defying the law.\n  Section 594 of the independent counsel law lists the authority and \nduties of an independent counsel. And, although this law has expired \nwith respect to the appointment of new independent counsels, it is \nstill the applicable law with respect to already existing independent \ncounsels like Mr. Ray. And here's what the law says with respect to \nreports by independent counsels.\n\n       (h)(1) An independent counsel shall--\n       (A) [file 6 month expense reports with the special court] \n     and\n       (B) before the termination of the independent counsel's \n     office under section 596(b), file a final report with the \n     division of the court, setting forth fully and completely a \n     description of the work of the independent counsel, including \n     the disposition of all cases brought.\n\n  That section of the law then goes on to prescribe the process for \ndisclosing information in the final report, and here's what it says:\n\n       (h)(2) The division of the court may release to the \n     Congress, the public, or any appropriate person, such \n     portions of a report made under this subsection as the \n     division of the court considers appropriate. The division of \n     the court shall make such orders as are appropriate to \n     protect the rights of any individual named in such report and \n     to prevent undue interference with any pending prosecution. \n     The division of the court may make any portion of a final \n     report filed under paragraph (1)(B) available to any \n     individual named in such report for the purposes of receiving \n     within a time limit set by the division of the court any \n     comments or factual information that such individual may \n     submit. Such comments and factual information, in whole or in \n     part, may, in the discretion of the division of the court, be \n     included as an appendix to such final report.\n\n  As anyone can see from the plain language of the statute, we placed \nthe full responsibility for disclosure of the final report --or any \nportion of a final report--exclusively in the hands of the special \ncourt. We did this, in significant part, out of the concerns we had \nthat individuals named in the report be given an opportunity, out of a \nsense of fairness, to provide their comments to the public at the time \nthe report is released. That's why we gave the special court the \nauthority to make ``any portion of the final report . . . available to \nany individual named in'' the report prior to any release to the public \n-- so such individual could file comments or factual information for \nthe court to consider in deciding whether to make such report or \nportion of the report public and if so, to append such comments or \nfactual information to the report for distribution. Any public release \nof findings and conclusions would deny individuals named in the report \nthe opportunity to comment on the report prior to release as expressly \nintended by Congress.\n  Mr. Ray's statement that he intends to release findings and \nconclusions of his investigation into the Whitewater matter when he \nsends his final report to the special court is contrary to the \nrequirements of the law. Mr. Ray should reverse his stated course and \ncomply with the law. I have written to Mr. Ray to urge him to withhold \nreleasing findings and conclusions about the Whitewater matter until \npermitted to do so by the special court. I have also notified the \nAttorney General of my concerns and urged her, as the only one with \nsupervisory authority over independent counsels, to take the \nappropriate action to keep Mr. Ray's conduct within the parameters of \nthe independent counsel law. And finally, I have written to the special \ncourt to bring this to the court's attention and to urge the special \ncourt to enforce the law and their exclusive prerogative under the law \nto control any public release of the independent counsel's findings and \nconclusions.\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article of August 29, \n2000, appear in the Record immediately following my remarks as well as \ncopies of my letters to the Attorney General, the special court and Mr. \nRay.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2000.\n     Hon.

Thank you for your \n     attention to my concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2000.\n     Robert Ray, Esquire,\n     Office of Independent Counsel, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ray: The New York Times published an article on \n     August 29, 2000, (copy enclosed) which reported that you are \n     planning ``to issue [the] findings and conclusions'' of your \n     investigation into the Whitewater matter to the public at the \n     same time you file your final report on that matter with the \n     special court. If that is true, it would, in my opinion, \n     violate the requirements of the independent counsel law. I \n     urge you, therefore, to comply with the law and keep your \n     findings and conclusions nonpublic until, as the law \n     requires, the special court decides whether and, if so, when \n     to make the final report or any portion thereof available to \n     the public.\n       I write this letter to you for several reasons. First, as \n     one of the senators involved in the oversight and \n     reauthorization of the independent counsel law for these past \n     20 years I have a strong and longstanding interest in making \n     sure that the law is followed. The requirement for a final \n     report has been a controversial one, since federal \n     prosecutors do not prepare such reports and keep the results \n     of their investigations confidential, unless they proceed \n     with indictments or informations. But the law is clear on an \n     independent counsel's responsibility with respect to the \n     final report. Only the special court has the authority to \n     release the final report of an independent counsel or any \n     portion of a final report, and the only authority the law \n     gives an independent counsel is to prepare a final report and \n     file it with the special court. Section 594 (h)(2) of the \n     independent counsel law provides:\n       ``The division of the court may release to the Congress, \n     the public, or any appropriate person, such portions of a \n     report made under this subsection as the division of the \n     court considers appropriate. The division of the court shall \n     make such orders as are appropriate to protect the rights of \n     any individual named in such report and to prevent undue \n     interference with any pending prosecution. The division of \n     the court may make any portion of a final report filed under \n     paragraph (1)(B) available to any individual named in such \n     report for the purposes of receiving within a time limit \n     set by the division of the court any comments or factual \n     information that such individual may submit. Such comments \n     and factual information, in whole or in part, may, in the \n     discretion of the division of the court, be included as an \n     appendix to such final report.''\n       Second, one of our major concerns about making the report \n     public was that individuals named in the report be given an \n     opportunity, out of sense of fairness, to provide their \n     comments to the public at the time the report is released. \n     That's why we gave the special court the authority to make \n     ``any portion of the final report . . . available to any \n     individual named in'' the report prior to any release to the \n     public so such individual could file comments or factual \n     information for the court to consider in deciding whether to \n     make such report or portion of the report public and if so, \n     to append such comments or factual information to the report \n     for distribution. Any public release of your findings and \n     conclusions would deny individuals named in the report the \n     opportunity to comment on the report prior to release as \n     expressly intended by Congress.\n       As an independent counsel you have been given a tremendous \n     amount of discretion and power. The appropriate exercise of \n     the independent counsel law relies on your ability to \n     exercise such discretion and power in a fair, just and lawful \n     manner. I know of no one who worked on the independent \n     counsel law these past 20 years who contemplated an \n     independent counsel issuing the findings and conclusions of a \n     final report before the special court had reviewed such \n     report, had the opportunity to permit comment by persons \n     named in such report, and released such report to the public \n     on the court's order. I urge you to act in this matter in \n     accordance with both the law and Congressional intent.\n       On a related matter, during the Senate's consideration of \n     the 1994 reauthorization of the independent counsel law, the \n     Senate adopted an amendment by Senator Robert Dole to limit \n     the scope of the final report required of independent \n     counsels. Senator Dole offered his amendment to remove any \n     requirement that an independent counsel explain in the final \n     report the reasons for not prosecuting any matter within his \n     or her prosecutorial jurisdiction. While the provision not \n     prosecuting any matter within her prosecutorial jurisdiction. \n     While the provision requiring the final report was retained \n     to provide an accounting of the work of the independent \n     counsel, the amendment by Senator Dole was intended to \n     prohibit the expression of opinions in the final report \n     regarding the culpability of people not indicted.\n       The legislative history on this amendment by Senator Dole, \n     which was enacted into law, is instructive. Senator William \n     Cohen, who floor-managed the reauthorization bill with me, \n     explained the Dole amendment as follows: (November 17, 1993, \n     Congressional Record, page 29618):\n       ``Both Senator Levin and I feel that Senator Dole has \n     raised a valid point. We believe that that final report \n     should be a simple declaration of the work of the independent \n     counsel, obviously pertaining to those cases in which he or \n     she has sought indictments but with respect to cases in which \n     the independent counsel had determined that no such \n     indictment should be brought, to preclude that independent \n     counsel from expressing an opinion or conclusion as to the \n     culpability of any of the individuals involved. * * * So \n     the purpose of the amendment is quite clear, to restrict \n     the nature of the report to the facts without engaging in \n     either speculation or expressions of opinion as to the \n     culpability of individuals unless that culpability or \n     those activities rise to a level of an indictable offense, \n     in which case the independent counsel would be duty bound \n     to seek an indictment.''\n       The Conference Report for the 1994 reauthorization \n     summarized the purpose and scope of the amendment (Conference \n     Report, may 19, 1994, HR 103-511, page 19):\n       ``The power to damage reputations in the final report is \n     significant, and the conferees want to make it clear that the \n     final report requirement is not intended in any way to \n     authorize independent counsels to make public findings or \n     conclusions that violate normal standards of due process, \n     privacy or simple fairness.''\n       As you work on the final report, I hope you will pay close \n     attention to the change we made to the law in 1994 with \n     respect to the content of the final report as a result of the \n     Dole amendment.\n       I am also enclosing for your information copies of the \n     letters I have sent to the special court and the Attorney \n     General concerning the matters I have raised in this letter \n     as well as a copy of the statement I made to the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2000.\n     Hon.

Section \n     594(h)(2) of the law provides:\n       ``The division of the court may release to the Congress, \n     the public, or any appropriate person, such portions of a \n     report made under this subsection as the division of the \n     court considers appropriate. The division of the court shall \n     make such orders as are appropriate to protect the rights of \n     any individual named in such report and to prevent undue \n     interference with any pending prosecution. The division of \n     the court may make any portion of a final report filed under \n     paragraph (1)(B) available to any individual named in such \n     report for the purposes of receiving within a time limit set \n     by the division of the court any comments or factual \n     information that such individual may submit. Such comments \n     and factual information, in whole or in part, may, in the \n     discretion of the division of the court, be included as an \n     appendix to such final report.''\n       The law clearly places the full responsibility for \n     disclosure of the final report--or any portion of a final \n     report--in the hands of the court.\n       Moreover, one of our major concerns about making the report \n     public was that individuals named in the report be given an \n     opportunity, out of a sense of fairness, to provide their \n     comments to the public at the time the report is released. \n     That's why we gave the special court the authority to make \n     ``any portion of the final report . . . available to any \n     individual named in'' the report prior to any release to the \n     public so such individual could file comments or factual \n     information for the court to consider in deciding whether to \n     make such report or portion of the report public and if so, \n     to append such comments or factual information to the report \n     for distribution. Any public release of Mr. Ray's findings \n     and conclusions before release by the special court would \n     deny individuals named in the report the opportunity to \n     comment on the report prior to release as expressly intended \n     by Congress.\n       The independent counsel law also clearly gives you as \n     Attorney General, and you alone, the supervisory \n     responsibility to ensure that the law is faithfully executed. \n     The Supreme Court relied on this authority in upholding the \n     constitutionality of the statute. In Morrison versus Olson \n     the Court said:\n       ``(B)ecause the independent counsel may be terminated for \n     `good cause,' the Executive, through the Attorney General, \n     retains ample authority to assure that the counsel is \n     competently performing his or her statutory responsibilities \n     in a manner that comports with the provisions of the Act.'' \n     (At 692)\n       Later or in the opinion the Court reiterated this view when \n     it said:\n       ``(T)he Act does give the Attorney General several means of \n     supervising or controlling the prosecutorial powers that may \n     be wielded by an independent counsel. Most importantly, the \n     Attorney General retains the power to remove the counsel for \n     `good cause,' a power that we have already concluded provides \n     the Executive with substantial ability to ensure that the \n     laws are `faithfully executed' by an independent counsel.'' \n     (At 696)\n       Mr. Ray's announced release to the public of his findings \n     and conclusions in the Whitewater case before the special \n     court has ordered such release defies the requirements of the \n     independent counsel law and merits action on your part to \n     stop it. Since Mr. Ray apparently plans to release his \n     findings and conclusions in the next few weeks, I urge your \n     immediate attention to this matter.\n       I have enclosed a copy of the letters on this matter that I \n     sent to the special court and Mr. Ray as well as a copy of a \n     statement I made to the Senate.

Lewis)\n\n       Washington, Aug. 28.--Robert W. Ray, the Independent \n     counsel, said he expected to issue a statement of his \n     findings and conclusions about the Whitewater investigation a \n     few weeks before New York voters go to the polls to choose \n     between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. \n     Lazio, her Republican opponent for the United States Senate.\n       Mr. Ray, whose office has investigated President and Mrs. \n     Clinton on a range of issues for more than four years, also \n     said in an interview that he would announce his decision on \n     whether he would seek an indictment of Mr. Clinton in \n     connection with his affair with a White House intern shortly \n     after the President left office. The prosecutor suggested \n     that the announcement about the possible indictment of Mr. \n     Clinton would come within weeks after a new president is \n     inaugurated on Jan. 20. Mr. Ray has already issued two \n     reports, one essentially clearing the Clintons in the \n     collection of confidential F.B.I. files about Republicans and \n     another critical of Mrs. Clinton's role in the dismissal of \n     longtime employees in the White House travel office.\n       Setting out for the first time an explicit timetable on \n     those two matters in an interview on Friday and in comments \n     through a spokesman today, Mr. Ray also discussed some \n     considerations about the timing. Any criticism of Mrs. \n     Clinton from Mr. Ray in the final weeks of her campaign could \n     turn into a political issue. But Howard Wolfson, Mrs. \n     Clinton's campaign spokesman, said today in response to Mr. \n     Ray's plans: ``New Yorkers have already made up their minds \n     about this. They know there is nothing here.''\n       Mr. Ray refused to discuss what the Whitewater report might \n     contain. While it has long been known there will be no \n     recommendation of any criminal indictment, the statement is \n     almost certain to discuss how his findings compare with Mrs. \n     Clinton's assertions to investigators and to the public about \n     her role as a lawyer in connection with several real estate \n     dealings in Arkansas. ``It's my intention to issue those \n     findings and conclusions prior to the election,'' he said. \n     ``Right now I'm trying for mid-September.'' Mr. Ray said he \n     would issue his Whitewater conclusions the moment they are \n     ready and ``not a second later.'' He said it would be wrong \n     to delay disclosing them. ``Even withholding them could have \n     political repercussions,'' he said, ``and that could be \n     viewed as being manipulative.'' Mr. Ray said he believed that \n     issuing his statement a few weeks before the election would \n     provide enough time for anyone to respond to it and for the \n     public to fully absorb both his views and those of anyone who \n     disputed his findings.\n       He said that the one situation that might change his plans \n     would be if the statement was not ready until just a few days \n     before the election. If that were the case, he said, he would \n     consider withholding it. With regard to his decision about \n     Mr. Clinton and the possibility of bringing an indictment \n     after he leaves office, Mr. Ray said he had an obligation to \n     conclude the matter as soon as possible. ``It's time this \n     matter was brought to closure,'' he said, ``And it is coming \n     to closure.'' He added: ``I know the country is weary of \n     this. The country needs to get past this.'' Mr. Ray impaneled \n     a new grand jury on July 11 to consider whether Mr. Clinton \n     should be indicted in connection with his denials under oath \n     about whether he had a sexual relationship with Monica \n     Lewinsky, a onetime White House intern. He described the \n     decision-making process as largely ``a deliberative one now, \n     not an investigative one.'' Because the sole issue is whether \n     to charge the president after he leaves office, Mr. Ray said \n     he intended to take full advantage of the time until Mr. \n     Clinton left office to make up his mind. He said his \n     deliberations would require a few months. Mr. Ray also said \n     there were other factors to consider but declined to \n     elaborate.\n       One possible factor is whether Mr. Clinton is disbarred. A \n     state judge in Arkansas is considering a recommendation from \n     a special bar committee that Mr. Clinton be stripped of his \n     law license because of his denials under oath of a \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. A trial on the matter is \n     likely to be held this fall. Though Mr. Ray is an independent \n     counsel, he is obliged to follow Justice Department \n     guidelines that allow for prosecutors to show discretion and \n     decline to prosecute a case if the subject has already paid a \n     penalty--like disbarment or even suspension from the practice \n     of law. The Whitewater report that Mr. Ray is expected to \n     file with a special three-judge panel at the same time he \n     issues his statement of findings and conclusions will \n     probably be his last investigative report. He has already \n     filed two reports with the panel, one in March on allegations \n     that the White House, and particularly Mrs. Clinton, \n     collected hundreds of confidential F.B.I. files, many of them \n     of prominent Republicans, as part of a political \n     intelligence-gathering scheme. Mr. Ray concluded that the \n     improper acquisition was a bureaucratic foul-up involving \n     midlevel White House officials and that Mrs. Clinton had no \n     involvement, as she had asserted.\n       But in his second statement of findings and conclusions, \n     issued in June, about whether Mrs. Clinton played a role in \n     the firing of seven longtime White House travel office \n     employees, Mr. Ray was far more critical of her sworn \n     statements. He made a point of saying that despite Mrs. \n     Clinton's strong denials, he concluded that she had played a \n     substantial role in causing the employees to be dismissed. \n     The Whitewater report may well follow that model as it is \n     expected to explore what Mrs. Clinton did as a lawyer for \n     various Arkansas clients, and contentions that she tried to \n     conceal or minimize her role.\n       For example, one issue is a 1985 telephone call Mrs. \n     Clinton made on behalf of a client, Madison Guaranty and \n     Trust, to a senior Arkansas official who worked for her \n     husband, then the governor. She telephoned Beverly Bassett, \n     the state securities commissioner in Mr. Clinton's \n     administration, to discuss a proposal for Madison to float \n     preferred stock. Mrs. Clinton told investigators that she did \n     not remember whom she spoke with at the agency. She also said \n     she had only been trying to find out the appropriate official \n     for an associate at her firm, Richard Massey, to contact and \n     that she had not discussed the issue.\n       But the regulator recalled the conversation in detail when \n     she testified before the Senate Whitewater committee. She \n     said that Mrs. Clinton had spoken with her and discussed the \n     substance of the proposal. And Mr. Massey testified he had \n     already known whom to contact.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8277-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8277-S8283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n                    ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                       national ignition facility\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) is a \nmajor part of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which is a set of \nprograms and facilities that are designed to allow the United States to \nmaintain the safety and reliability of our nation's vital nuclear \ndeterrent.\n  It is hoped that at some point in 10 to 20 years that the stockpile \nStewardship Program can be a replacement for actual nuclear testing. \nThe jury is still out on whether it can in fact eventually accomplish \nthis goal. I support the Stockpile Stewardship Program because it will \nimprove our knowledge about our nuclear weapons. The fact is that, \ndespite our technical expertise, there is much we still do not \nunderstand about our own nuclear weapons. As C. Paul Robinson, Director \nof the Sandia National Laboratory has said, ``Some aspects of nuclear \nexplosive design are still not understood at the level of physical \nprinciples.''\n  America's nuclear weapons are the most sophisticated in the world. \nEach one typically has thousands of parts, and over time the nuclear \nmaterials and high explosive triggers in our weapons deteriorate and we \nlack experience predicting the effects of these changes. Some of the \nmaterials used in our weapons, like plutonium, enriched uranium, and \ntritium, are radioactive materials that decay, and as they decay they \nalso change the properties of other materials within the weapon. We \nlack experience predicting the effects of such aging on the safety and \nreliability of our weapons. We did not design our weapons to last \nforever. The shelf life of our weapons was expected to be about 20 \nyears. In the past, we did not encounter problems with aging weapons, \nbecause we were fielding new designs and older designs were retired.\n  As the Department of Energy said in its review of the Stockpile \nStewardship Program completed on November 23, 1999, ``The NIF is one of \nthe most vital facilities in the stockpile stewardship program.'' This \nfacility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California is \nroughly the same size as a stadium, and is designed to produce the \nintense pressures and temperatures needed to simulate in a laboratory \nthe thermonuclear conditions achieved in nuclear explosions. The NIF \nwill accomplish this goal by focusing 192 laser beams on a ``dime-\nsized'' piece of plutonium. When completed, the NIF will be the world's \nmost powerful laser facility, about 60 times more powerful than the \nnext largest DOE laser facility, the NOVA laser.\n  As a review conducted in 1994 by the so-called, JASON panel, a \nDefense Department panel of nuclear experts said ``The NIF is without \nquestion the most scientifically valuable of the programs proposed for \nthe Science Based Stockpile Stewardship program, particularly in regard \nto research and `proof-of-principle' for ignition, but also more \ngenerally for fundamental science. As such, it will promote the goal of \nsustaining a high-quality group of scientists with expertise related to \nthe nuclear weapons program.''\n  There is a consensus among the three national laboratories and at the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration that additional funding above \nthe level in the current version of the Energy and Water Appropriations \nbill for the NIF program needs to be increased. In a joint statement \ndated September 6, 2000, Dr. Bruce Tarter, the Director of the Lawrence \nLivermore National Laboratory, Dr. John Browne, the Director of the Los \nAlamos National Laboratory, Dr. Paul Robinson, the Director of Sandia \nNational Laboratory, and Madelyn Creedon, the Deputy Administrator for \nDefense Programs at the National Nuclear Security Administration \nstated.\n\n       NIF supports the SSP, and is a vital element of the SSP in \n     three important ways: (1) the experimental study of issues of \n     aging or refurbishment; (2) weapons science and code \n     development; and (3) attracting and training the exceptional \n     scientific and technical talent required to sustain the SSP \n     over the long term. NIF is an integral part of the SSP \n     providing unique experimental capabilities that complement \n     other SSP facilities including hydrotests, pulsed power, and \n     advanced radiography. NIF addresses aspects of the relevant \n     science of materials that cannot be reached in other \n     facilities.\n       We concur that the NIF offers a unique, critical capability \n     within a ``balanced'' SSP. As with other elements of the SSP, \n     its long-term role must be integrated within the overall \n     requirements of the Program. Options should not be foreclosed \n     or limited but should be maintained to allow for its further \n     development. At this critical juncture, we agree that in \n     order to maintain the NIF within a balanced program, an \n     additional $95 million [above the President's original budget \n     request] is necessary in FY 2001 for the NIF Project.\n\n  The NIF program has recently experienced delays and cost overruns. \nBut new management for the program is in place. The facility has \nundergone and passed intensive scientific and programmatic reviews that \nwere recently conducted. And the management problems and lack of \noversight that led to the earlier delays and cost overruns are \nunderstood and should therefore be preventable.\n  We are well along toward completion of the NIF facility. Construction \nof the facility to house the laser beams, a $260 million project \nitself, is about 90% complete. 80% of the large components for the \ninfrastructure for the laser beams has been procured and is either on \nsite or on the way. The NIF program at Lawrence Livermore Lab has 800 \nscientists and technicians on the project. Delaying the program, which \nwould result in a standing army of technicians, or canceling it, which \nwould prevent the achievement of the goals of the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram simply makes no sense.\n  There is bipartisan support for this program and the Administration \nsupports the program. Undersecretary of State John Holum said in a \nletter on June 12, 2000 that, ``I strongly support this essential \nnational security program. We must avoid the complacency of not doing \nenough in stewardship. We need to make a long-term commitment to use \nour scientific prowess to maintain a safe and reliable stockpile of \nnuclear weapons. . . . The problems with NIF are not scientific. . . . \nI urge you to support the program.''\n  The NIF is essential to our Stockpile Stewardship Program, which \nitself is an essential to maintain our nuclear weapons.\n\n\n                     dredging of the delaware river\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Senators from our neighboring state of Delaware, \nSenators Roth and Biden. Each of us has communicated with members of \nthe Appropriations Committee on a matter of deep concern to us and our \nconstituents that has been included in the FY 2001 Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations bill. The Army Corps of Engineers' Delaware \nRiver Deepening Project seeks to deepen over 100 miles of the Delaware \nRiver channel from the current authorized 40-foot depth to 45 feet. The \nproject would dredge 33 million cubic yards of bottom sediments, \nplacing some 23 million cubic yards in dredge disposal areas in New \nJersey, and 10 million cubic yards along Delaware shores.\n  This project continues to be highly controversial in our states for a \nnumber of reasons. First, there remain significant environmental \nconcerns regarding the material to be dredged and its ultimate disposal \nand impacts on the environment of the Delaware Bay. The Corps of \nengineers has been criticized for its method of evaluating toxic and \npolluted sediments--using an averaging method, which many believe can \nmask the potential impact of dredging toxic hot spots and more \nconcentrated polluted material. Our citizens continue to have strong \nconcerns about the impacts of dredging and disposal on water quality, \non drinking water supplies, on important recovering shellfish areas, \nand on the environment in the vicinity of proposed disposal areas.\n  A number of members of the New Jersey and Delaware congressional \ndelegations and state agencies have made requests to the Corps of \nengineers to address a number of these issues. Earlier this year, \nRepresentative Andrews and I made a request to the General Accounting \nOffice to conduct a review of the cost-benefit and environmental \nanalyses in light of many of the concerns that have been raised about \nthis project. In addition, Representatives Saxton and LoBiondo also \nsent a similar request to the GAO regarding the economic and \nenvironmental issues regarding the Delaware Deepening project. The GAO \nresponded that it could not conduct and complete the study as quickly \nas would be necessary for conclusions to assist in the consideration of \nthe FY 2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriation.\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\n  I want to state here that I intend to continue to pursue these issues \nand over the course of the next several months to engage the General \nAccounting Office, the Army Inspector General, the Army Corps of \nengineers, and any other appropriate agencies to get answers to the \nquestions that I believe are critical to my constituents. For the \nrecord, Mr. President, I would like to enter into the record copies of \nstudy requests made by members of the New Jersey delegation to the \nGeneral Accounting regarding the Delaware River Main Channel Deepening \nproject.\n  If I may address the distinguished senior Senator from Delaware, have \nyou not also made known your concerns to the Committee on \nAppropriations and to the Army Corps of Engineers?\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and I would answer \nhis question, indeed we have.\n  In May of this year, Senator Biden and I wrote to the Chairman of the \nenergy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, indicating that the response of \nthe Corps of Engineers to the list of concerns raised by the State of \nDelaware's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control \nregarding necessary permitting, environmental studies, and \nenvironmental protection has been entirely inadequate. In our letter, \nwe indicated that this project must not proceed until environmental \ninformation and permitting concerns raised by Delaware's Department of \nNatural Resources and Environmental Control are satisfactorily \naddressed by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  As a strong supporter of the Coastal Zone Management Plan, I am \nconcerned about the potential environmental impacts of the proposed \nchannel deepening. I strongly urge the Corps to continue negotiating in \ngood faith with the State of Delaware to resolve outstanding \ninformational and permitting issues through a legally enforceable \nagreement that will safeguard Delaware's natural resources. If an \nagreement cannot be reached through good faith negotiations, then the \nState of Delaware should pursue this matter in court.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator for that clarification. Does that \nalso describe the concerns and sentiments of the Senator from Delaware, \nSenator Biden?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey and the senior Senator \nfrom Delaware for their remarks, and wish to indicate my concurrence \nwith the points that they have made. I have had questions about this \nproject, the planning process, its economic justification, and the \npotential for environmental harm for a number of years. I further \nunderstand that the State of Delaware's capital bond bill committee in \nJuly indicated in writing its intention to withhold all state money for \nthe Deepening project until the State's Department of Natural Resources \nand Environmental Control is satisfied and necessary permits obtained.\n  I believe we need to continue to pursue a resolution to these \nenvironmental issues and that the Corps should not move forward to \nconstruction unless and until appropriate permits have been issued, and \nthe Congress has before it the information needed to determine that the \nproject is safe and truly justified.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record, several letters from \nthe Delaware DNREC which discuss the State's concerns.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2000.\n     Mr. David Walker,\n     Controller General, General Accounting Office, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Walker: We are writing to request that a cost-\n     benefit and environmental analysis be conducted as soon as \n     possible on plans by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) to \n     bring the depth of the Delaware River to 45 feet. This \n     channel deepening project was authorized as part of the Water \n     Resource Development Acts of 1992 (section 101(6)) and 1999 \n     (section 308).\n       The Plan is estimated to cost $311 million, two-thirds of \n     which would be provided by the federal government. Proponents \n     of the Plan argue that the channel needs to be deepened to \n     accommodate the next generation of cargo ships and that cost \n     saving benefits will be realized by area oil refineries. \n     However, many of our constituents have called into question \n     these benefits and the necessity of channel deepening in \n     keeping the port competitive. Therefore, we are eager to \n     identify the benefits of this project to the nation, and \n     whether these justify the taxpayer cost.\n       In addition to this central and legally mandated issue of \n     national benefit, we would like to request an analysis of \n     three additional issues by the General Accounting Office \n     (GAO).\n       First, there is a question as to whether the project \n     sponsors have complied with all of the provisions of the \n     National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Environmental \n     Impact Statement associated with this project appears to be \n     deficient in five ways: (a) there was no assessment of the \n     ecological issues pertaining to the disposal sites for \n     dredged materials because the sites were not identified when \n     the EIS was done: (b) there was no assessment of the impact \n     of any dredging of the private berths of the oil refinery (if \n     any takes place) which is functionally a part of this \n     project; (c) the habitat assessment part of the EIS may not \n     adequately assess the impact of the project on essential fish \n     and oyster habitats; (d) ``used mean values'' (averages) were \n     improperly used to assess the level of toxins in River \n     sediment and in so doing masked the existence of toxic ``hot \n     spots''; and (e) threats to drinking water supplies and water \n     quality have yet to be adequately analyzed and addressed.\n       Second, the Delaware dredging project reportedly will \n     produce 33 million cubic yards of dredged materials. Ten \n     million yards are scheduled to be used for beach restoration \n     in the State of Delaware. The remaining 23 million cubic \n     yards will simply be dumped on the New Jersey side of the \n     river.\n       With little effort, the planners of this project were able \n     to find a beneficial use for 10 million cubic yards of this \n     material. We are concerned that insufficient efforts has been \n     made to find more beneficial uses for the remaining 23 \n     million cubic yards and that New Jersey has been asked to \n     bear too great a burden in its disposal. Thus, we request \n     that the GAO look at both the environmental and economic \n     impacts of placing 23 million cubic yards of dredged \n     materials on the riverfront of these New Jersey communities.\n       Third, we also ask the GAO to investigate why almost no \n     commitments have yet been received from the businesses who \n     stand to benefit from this dredging. The argument has been \n     made that this project is necessary to keep shipping commerce \n     on the Delaware River. Yet few of these businesses have made \n     commitments to dredge their ports on the Delaware River to \n     match the depth of the main channel. If these businesses \n     truly need this project, we are curious as to why they are \n     not also working to make room for the larger ships this \n     project is meant to accommodate.\n       As you can see, there are still many questions to be \n     answered regarding this project. Time is of the essence. \n     Congress will consider as part of its FY 2001 Appropriations \n     cycle future funding for this project. It is imperative that \n     this project receive objective scrutiny by the GAO \n     immediately. We offer our assistance in any way possible to \n     facilitate a cost-benefit analysis and evaluation of \n     environmental impacts in a timely manner. Thank you in \n     advance for your efforts and we look forward to your report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Robert G. Torricelli,\n                                            United States Senator.\n                                                Robert E. Andrews,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     U.S. Environmental Protection\n\n\n                                             Agency, Region 2,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 30, 1999.\n     Mr. Robert Callegeri,\n     Director, Planning Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers/\n         Philadelphia District, Wanamaker Building, Philadelphia \n         PA.\n       Dear Mr. Callegeri: I am writing in reference to the \n     proposed Delaware River Main Channel Deepening Project. In \n     particular, we have recently become aware of potential issues \n     associated with the project through letters from the Delaware \n     River keeper, and discussions stemming from the April 16, \n     1999 forum facilitated by the Delaware River Basin \n     Commission, as well as the June 11, 1999 meeting convened by \n     Congressman Castle's office.\n       We have carefully considered these issues. For the most \n     part, we do not believe that they necessitate revising the \n     conclusions reached in the previous environmental impact \n     statement (EIS) process for the project. However, we believe \n     that the following two issues require further consideration \n     and effort prior to the project proceeding: the project's \n     benefit/cost (B/C) ratio and environmental issues raised \n     which may not have been fully evaluated or resolved during \n     the prior planning process.\n       With regard to the project's B/C ratio, the original \n     project scope included six petroleum facilities as project \n     beneficiaries. Consequently, the benefits to these facilities \n     were included in the project's B/C ratio. However, we have \n     seen no documentation that any of these facilities plan to \n     dredge their private channels. To the contrary, the limited \n     documentation we have indicates that one or more of the \n     petroleum companies believe that it is not in their best \n     economic interest to participate. Accordingly, we would like \n     to see additional documentation showing any commitments made \n     by the companies involved and more explanation of how their \n     participation (or lack thereof) affects the B/C ratio \n     calculations. Moreover, if these\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\n     facilities are not committed to participate, we would argue \n     that the scope of the project would be modified, which would \n     require the Corps' to recalculate the B/C ratio.\n       In addition to the economic questions, numerous \n     environmental concerns about the project continue to be \n     raised. While we believe that many of these concerns have \n     been adequately addressed through the prior EIS process, \n     there may be a need for additional environmental analyses for \n     certain issues not fully covered in the prior EIS \n     documentation. For example, impacts related to the dredging \n     of the private facilities discussed above and several port \n     facilities owned or operated by the local sponsors, and \n     potential impacts associated with the development of new \n     sites for dredged material disposal were not fully evaluated \n     in the original EIS. Accordingly, these activities will have \n     to be evaluated under NEPA.\n       Our final concern about the project relates to the \n     potential impacts associated with the dredging and disposal \n     operations. EPA, however, believes that these impacts can, \n     and should, be addressed through the development of specific \n     monitoring/management plans for the various dredging and \n     disposal phases of the project. The plans should be developed \n     to address specific goals and objectives designed to detect \n     and prevent adverse impacts from the proposed dredging and \n     disposal operations. At a minimum, monitoring for turbidity \n     changes using in situ recording devices during dredging and \n     disposal operations, bathymetry and sediment profiling \n     imagery at the aquatic disposal locations, and ground water \n     monitoring should be included. Additionally, the monitoring/\n     management plans should provide for appropriate contingency \n     actions in the event that unforeseen circumstances (e.g., \n     high levels of contaminants) are encountered during the \n     dredging and disposal operations. We are available to assist \n     as necessary in the development of monitoring/management \n     plans. At the very least, we request the opportunity to \n     review such plans as they are being developed. Furthermore, \n     the monitoring/management plans must be in place prior to the \n     start of any dredging activity.\n       We look forward to working with you as this project \n     progresses. Should you have any questions concerning this \n     letter, please contact Mark Westrate of my staff at (212) \n     637-3789.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Robert W. Hargrove,\n     Chief, Strategic Planning and Multi-Media Programs Branch.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2000.\n     Mr. David Walker,\n     Comptroller General of the United States, General Accounting \n         Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Walker: On May 2, 2000, Representative Robert \n     Andrews and Senator Robert Torricelli wrote to you requesting \n     the General Accounting Office (GAO) review the cost-benefit \n     and environmental analysis of the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineer's (USACE) project to dredge the Delaware River to 45 \n     feet. In addition, they asked you to evaluate whether the \n     Corps of Engineers has complied with all provisions of the \n     National Environmental Policy Act, the environmental and \n     economic impacts of placing 23 million cubic yards of dredged \n     materials on the New Jersey riverfront, and why almost no \n     commitments to deepen their side channels have been received \n     from the oil refineries who are identified as receiving 80% \n     of the projects benefits. We support the request by \n     Representative Andrews and Senator Torricelli, and ask that \n     you address several other critical issues dealing with the \n     accuracy of the USACE's study of this project.\n       Throughout this project, oil facilities located along the \n     Delaware have been identified as the major beneficiaries. \n     However, five of the six facilities have made no commitment \n     to invest the funds necessary to deepen their side-channels \n     and have indicated they are unlikely to do so. Therefore, we \n     request the GAO to recalculate the cost-benefit ratio of this \n     project if the oil facilities do not deepen their side-\n     channels.\n       The USACE has identified other potential beneficiaries of \n     the deepening project to include the Port of Philadelphia and \n     Camden. We ask that the GAO utilize its expertise in port \n     infrastructure and competitiveness and conduct a study \n     focusing on shipping trends in the North Atlantic Region. In \n     particular, we request the GAO to evaluate the viability of \n     the Port of Philadelphia and Camden becoming a major regional \n     hub port for deep draft container ships if the Delaware River \n     were deepened from 40 to 45 feet. There is no guarantee that \n     the new generation of container ships will ever call at the \n     Port of Philadelphia and Camden at a depth of 45 feet.\n       In addition, studies prepared by the USACE Waterways \n     Experiment Station (WES) to determine the potential for \n     saltwater flow into the C Canal and the Delaware River may \n     have reached inappropriate conclusions to minimize potential \n     environmental impacts of the project. The studies have since \n     been sent back to the WES for reanalysis. We ask that the GAO \n     investigate discrepancies between the studies and determine \n     how they came about. We would also like the GAO to examine \n     all current Corps studies on the Delaware River Deepening \n     Project to determine if similar discrepancies exist.\n       This information will be critical in helping Congress \n     determine whether the project's national economic benefits \n     are sufficient enough to invest over $200 million. Since \n     Congress will consider future funding for this project in the \n     FY2001 appropriations cycle, it is essential this project \n     receive objective scrutiny by the GAO immediately. We offer \n     our assistance in any way possible to facilitate a cost-\n     benefit analysis, evaluate of environmental impacts, and a \n     review of the accuracy of the USACE studies of this project \n     in a timely manner. Thank you for your efforts and we look \n     forward to your report.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Saxton,\n       Member of Congress,\n     Frank A. LoBiondo,\n       Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Natural Resources and Environmental \n           Control,\n                                        Dover, DE, March 31, 2000.\n     LTC Debra M. Lewis,\n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wanamaker Building, \n         Philadelphia, PA.\n       Dear Lieutenant Colonel Lewis: I am writing to follow up on \n     our numerous conversations and correspondence regarding the \n     proposed deepening of the Delaware River Main Channel. I \n     appreciate your willingness to address these issues and to \n     work constructively with the State of Delaware to ensure that \n     this project will not go forward unless it complies with our \n     environmental laws and that any environmental impacts from \n     this project will be minimal.\n       This letter summarizes the remaining environmental issues \n     that the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental \n     Control (DNREC) believes need resolution. In particular, it \n     is essential that the Corps demonstrate conclusively that the \n     project will comply with State of Delaware Surface Water \n     Quality Standards, the Wetlands Act, and the requirements of \n     the Subaqueous Lands Act. We also are beginning to formulate \n     the requirements for testing and monitoring that would apply \n     before, during, and after completion of the project should it \n     move forward.\n       As you are aware, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration regulations (15 CFR 930) require that this \n     project be consistent with the Delaware Coastal Management \n     Program (DCMP) policies. That program issued a conditional \n     Federal Consistency determination to the Corps on 1 May 1997. \n     The extensive scope of this project necessitated that DCMP \n     review the project in phases. Now that the final design and \n     specification phase is underway, it is an appropriate time to \n     address remaining issues regarding the project. The \n     conditional approvals did not obviate the need to meet the \n     substantive requirements of other state permits.\n       The outstanding issues include construction of material \n     placement facilities, placement of sandy dredged material on \n     beaches, the wetland creation project at Kelly Island, \n     various monitoring and reporting requirements, fisheries \n     concerns, and future maintenance burdens for the project.\n\n\n            I. Construction of Confined Disposal Facilities\n\n       Prior to any construction, it will be necessary to identify \n     and describe in detail the functions of all confined disposal \n     facilities (CDFs) to be used for the project--whether located \n     within the land area of the State of Delaware or discharging \n     into Delaware waters. It is our understanding that the only \n     Delaware-land sites slated for use are Reedy Point North and \n     South, both currently in existence. This list identifying the \n     disposal sites must include a description of the current \n     status of each site, expected future capacity, amount of \n     material to be deposited during the initial dredging cycle, \n     and ability to accept material for future maintenance cycles. \n     Additionally, there must be reasonable assurance that the \n     site is designed and operated in a manner which can ensure \n     compliance with Delaware State Water Quality Standards. The \n     rationale and justification supporting this assurance must be \n     provided in detail.\n       In addition, an Erosion and Sediment Control plan is \n     required from the Division of Soil & Water for any landward \n     disturbance of 5000 square feet or more. Several of the \n     principles regarding erosion and sediment control are \n     included for general reference:\n       An approved erosion and sediment control plan must be \n     followed. Any modifications to the plan must be approved as \n     revisions to the approved plan.\n       Any site or portion thereof on which a land-disturbing \n     activity is completed or stopped for a period of fourteen \n     days must be stabilized either permanently or temporarily \n     following the specifications and standards in the Erosion and \n     Sediment Control Handbook.\n       Unless an exception is approved, not more than 20 acres may \n     be cleared at any one time in order to minimize areas of \n     exposed ground cover and reduce erosion rates.\n       A land-disturbing activity shall not cause increased \n     sedimentation or accelerated erosion off-site. Off-site means \n     neighboring properties, drainageways, public facilities, \n     public rights-of-ways or streets, and water courses including \n     streams, lakes, wetlands, etc.\n       More specific criteria for vegetation and berm \n     stabilization can be found in the Delaware Erosion and \n     Sediment Control Handbook for Development.\n       The Corps must also comply with any additional requirements \n     of the State NPDES program. A permit regulating the discharge \n     of effluent from the CDFs is likely. Additional\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\n     NPDES Storm Water Regulations apply, since a NPDES \n     certification is required for land disturbing activities. \n     The ``Regulations Governing Storm Water Discharges \n     Associated with Industrial Activity, Part 2--Special \n     Conditions for Storm Water Associated with Land Disturbing \n     Activities'' (1998) states that ``Land disturbing \n     activities shall not commence and coverage under this Part \n     shall not apply until the Sediment and Stormwater \n     Management Plan for a site has been approved, stamped, \n     signed and dated . . .''.\n\n\n           2. Placement of sandy dredged material on beaches\n\n       To date, DNREC has not received official word of which \n     beaches have been chosen to receive sand from the southern \n     portion of the project. This information should be made \n     available as soon as it is determined so that we can evaluate \n     the permits and requirements needed. Please be advised that \n     DNREC expects that consideration be given to a number of \n     shoreline locations previously unnourished. A Section 401 \n     Water Quality Certification and State Subaqueous Lands permit \n     will be necessary for beach nourishment activities. Our \n     intent is to ensure that state Water Quality Standards are \n     met. DNREC also wants to ensure that beach replenishment \n     activities will not take place during critical horseshoe crab \n     spawning periods (April 15-June 30). Also, sand placement \n     activities should not use barriers (i.e. silt fences, \n     bulkheads, rocks, etc.) that would interfere with spawning.\n\n\n        3. Wetland creation/enhancement project at Kelly Island\n\n       DNREC anticipates coordinating with the Corps on the final \n     design and monitoring plan for Kelly Island at a meeting on 5 \n     April 2000. However, the following describes general \n     principles which would be applicable regardless of the \n     specific design criteria.\n       An Erosion and Sediment Control plan is required from the \n     Division of Soil & Water Conservation. The general \n     requirements are listed above under item 1.\n       The Corps must also comply with any additional requirements \n     of the State NPDES program. This includes the NPDES Storm \n     Water Regulations as well as the State Sediment and \n     Stormwater Regulations, since a NPDES certification is \n     required for land disturbing activities.\n       Because the beneficial use project at Kelly Island will \n     take place in an existing wetland area, a Wetlands Permit \n     will be required from the Division of Water Resources. In \n     addition, a Subaqueous Lands Lease will also be necessary. \n     There are several standard conditions for mitigation projects \n     which should apply to the wetland creation/enhancement taking \n     place at that site. For example, standard mitigation projects \n     must demonstrate 85% survival of the planted vegetation after \n     the second growing season. If 85% is not achieved then a \n     report outlining corrective action must be submitted. Other \n     parameters for stabilization and flow should be developed by \n     Corps engineers and submitted to DNREC for final review and \n     approval.\n       The Corps must also commit to maintaining the integrity of \n     the created site at Kelly Island and to do what is necessary \n     to evaluate and ensure the function of the new/enhanced \n     wetland area. In addition, the beach constructed at the \n     perimeter must be able to withstand a significant storm \n     event. The project should be examined and monitored annually \n     in order to ensure berm stability, vegetation viability, \n     flushing, and general ``success'' of revitalizing the wetland \n     habitat at that site. A monitoring report to this effect will \n     be required annually.\n       The DNREC, Division of Fish and Wildlife, has concerns \n     about increased silt load and sedimentation of adjacent \n     oyster habitat during construction of the perimeter sand sill \n     at Kelly Island and while the confined disposal area is being \n     filled. Seed beds of concern include ``Drum Bed,'' ``Silver \n     Bed,'' and ``Pleasanton's Rock,'' as these are the closest \n     seed beds to Kelly Island. Should an impact be noted on these \n     beds, it would indicate a need to monitor ``Ridge Bed'' which \n     is farther from the project area but has historically been \n     very productive.\n       Monitoring of oyster population conditions and habitat \n     quality should begin prior to construction and continue \n     throughout. Checking for changes in sedimentation patterns \n     should be extensive and focused at broad areas of each bed \n     rather than be limited to discrete sections. In addition, it \n     may be necessary to monitor oyster habitat on leased grounds \n     south of the Mahon River mouth as they may be impacted by \n     sediments moved south by ebb tide currents.\n\n\n                      4. Monitoring and reporting\n\n     Monitoring at confined disposal facilities\n       Monitoring of confined disposal facilities (CDFs) must be \n     performed to determine whether return flows from the CDFs \n     cause or contribute to violations of Delaware Surface Water \n     Quality Standards. This is an issue of concern for the \n     Department because CDFs often discharge return flows into \n     ecologically sensitive, shallow water habitats which have \n     limited dilution and dispersion capacity. To evaluate whether \n     return flows are causing or contributing to violations of the \n     Standards, the Corps will need to collect data on flow rate, \n     duration, concentration, and toxicity of CDF discharges and \n     then determine the resulting concentration and toxicity in \n     the receiving water through a combination of fate and \n     transport modeling and in-stream sampling. Both near-field \n     (i.e., mixing zone) and far-field (i.e., complete mix) \n     concentrations and toxicity resulting from the discharges \n     must be determined and compared to applicable Standards.\n       Sampling and analysis for the CDF should follow the general \n     approach taken by the Corps in evaluating the Pedricktown CDF \n     (i.e., ``Pedricktown Confined Disposal Facility Contaminant \n     Loading and Water Quality Analysis,'' June 1999). The Corps \n     will need to submit a sampling plan/scope of work to the \n     Department for review and approval prior to proceeding with \n     this work and prior to discharging from the CDFs. Close out \n     reports detailing the findings of the sampling and analysis \n     will also need to be submitted to the Department for review \n     and approval. If violations of applicable Standards are \n     identified, then the close out report should identify the \n     steps the Corps intends to take in order to eliminate future \n     violations. Based upon the findings of the initial studies, \n     the Department will determine the nature and extent of \n     subsequent testing that will need to be performed at the CDFs \n     in order to assess compliance with Delaware Surface Water \n     Quality Standards.\n       In addition to the testing described above, the Corps will \n     also need to collect contaminant data for surface sediments \n     in the CDFs and assess potential impacts to terrestrial and \n     avian species that may use the disposal areas. A plan to \n     accomplish this work should be submitted to the Department \n     for review and approval, as should a close out report. If \n     unacceptable risks are identified as a result of this \n     assessment, then the Corps will need to develop a plan to \n     limit access to the site.\n       Finally, the Corps will need to submit an annual letter to \n     the Department which summarizes the operational history and \n     structural integrity of any CDF used over the previous year. \n     The letter should address the following factors:\n       Condition of containment berms, dewatering and stormwater \n     weirs, and other structures.\n       Summary of disposal operations at the CDF over the past \n     year, including volumes of material placed into the CDF, as \n     well as volumes, mass loading, duration, and timing of return \n     flows.\n       Summary of maintenance and management activities conducted \n     at the CDF.\n       Summary of any material removed from the site.\n       Analysis of available remaining disposal capacity at the \n     site.\n       Summary of surface and groundwater monitoring programs not \n     otherwise covered in the study identified above.\n     Monitoring during dredging operation\n       It will be necessary to monitor during dredging operations \n     in order to ensure that the predictions of ``no significant \n     impacts'' are fulfilled. Therefore, the Corps should submit a \n     sampling plan to the Department for review and approval.\n       Measuring the exact position of the dredge at all times is \n     essential to ensuring that the channel and bends are deepened \n     based upon the footprint of the original project. Sampling in \n     the water column surrounding the excavation will require, at \n     a minimum, collection of data on total suspended solids \n     concentrations, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and any \n     contaminants of concern identified in the pre-dredge \n     evaluation. Suspended solids must be maintained between 25 \n     and 250 mg/l at the edge of a two-hundred foot regulatory \n     mixing zone in order to meet water quality standards, \n     according to the report Metal Contamination of Sediments in \n     the Delaware River Navigation Channel (Greene, 1999). The \n     results from all sampling data must be compared to applicable \n     Delaware Surface Water Quality Standards, and any exceedances \n     must be reported immediately.\n       The Corps must also work with DNREC to develop a protocol \n     that will come into effect if water quality violations are \n     identified. This would include events where total suspended \n     solids are higher than those determined to be sustainable \n     around the point of excavation.\n       Additionally, the Corps must follow established protocol if \n     turtles, sturgeon, or other species of concern are identified \n     in the dredge slurry or if there is indication that these \n     species are excessively impacted.\n       Standard best management practices should be used to the \n     extent practicable during the dredging operation in order to \n     minimize sediment suspension, impacts to aquatic organisms, \n     and water quality exceedances.\n       If the Corps intends to use the practice of economic \n     loading during the Main Channel Deepening project, this must \n     be discussed with the DNREC. Permission must be granted for \n     economic loading and will be limited by geographical location \n     and material characteristics. Additional monitoring will also \n     be required.\n     Bi-Annual Reporting\n       In addition to the annual reporting information stated \n     above, I request that the Secretary of DNREC receive a bi-\n     annual report detailing the progress of the Main Channel \n     Deepening project, including the locations dredged in the \n     previous twelve months, the status and capacity of CDFs, and \n     any unforeseen consequences and their remedies. I would \n     expect members of my staff to be in regular contact with \n     their peers at the Corps in order to ensure that the project \n     satisfies the requirements of the State of Delaware's \n     laws, regulations, and standards.\n\n\n               5. Fisheries and living resource concerns\n\n       Aquatic species of concern include sea turtles, several \n     species of whales, and shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon, along \n     with several others. The Corps must follow the recommended \n     dredging windows as established\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\n     by the Delaware River Basin Fish and Wildlife Cooperative and \n     as reported in the 1997 Supplemental Environmental Impact \n     Statement.\n       In addition, the following concerns from the Division of \n     Fish and Wildlife must be addressed:\n       Striped bass spawning is a concern from the Delaware \n     Memorial Bridge to Philadelphia April 15 to June 15. The \n     Delaware Basin Fish and Wildlife Cooperative May 1997 policy \n     entitled ``Seasonal restrictions for dredging, blasting and \n     overboard disposal in the mainstream of the Delaware River'' \n     should be followed in order to protect anadromous spawners \n     such as striped bass.\n       Atlantic sturgeon spawning sites are located over rocky \n     bottom in the deepest portion of the river. Spawning season \n     is April 15 to June 15. Because the eggs adhere to the hard \n     surfaces, rock should not be blasted or removed from the \n     river through the end of June to protect sturgeon eggs and \n     larvae.\n       Atlantic sturgeon wintering areas are located from \n     Artificial Island to Chester, Pennsylvania.\n       An observer should be placed on hopper dredges to monitor \n     for sturgeon impacts on overwintering fish in the wintering \n     areas.\n       The Corps will need an ``incidental take statement'' from \n     NMFS as required under the Endangered Species Act for sea \n     turtles and shortnose sturgeon. The Corps should ensure that \n     their agreement with NMFS reflects the most up-to-date \n     requirements. A copy of this statement should be provided to \n     the Division of Fish and Wildlife.\n       In addition, a turtle observer should be on board the \n     dredge during the period of the year when sea turtles are \n     known to be present in our area. The report from this \n     observer, as well as any identified turtle parts, should be \n     forwarded to the Division of Fish and Wildlife as well.\n\n\n                         6. Future Maintenance\n\n       If the Main Channel is deepened, there will be increased \n     volumes of material removed during each maintenance cycle in \n     order to achieve the project depth. This material will place \n     additional burden on existing disposal areas, causing them to \n     fill at a more rapid rate than with the forty-foot project \n     depth. As a result, new disposal facilities must be sited or \n     beneficial uses must be developed for the material currently \n     contained in the facilities. The Corps must be prepared to \n     address dredged material placement needs in the context of \n     future maintenance related to the proposed deepening.\n       We look forward to continuing our dialogue and working to \n     resolve the above issues before any plans for actual \n     construction take place. As the Department of Natural \n     Resources and Environmental Control, it is our mission to \n     ensure that projects are designed to avoid or minimize \n     adverse impacts on air and water quality, habitat, and living \n     resources. The above requests and requirements are in keeping \n     with this charge as it applies to the proposed deepening of \n     the Delaware River Main Channel.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Nicholas A. DiPasquale,\n     Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Natural Resources and Environmental \n           Control,\n                                         Dover, DE, July 14, 2000.\n     LTC Debra M. Lewis,\n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wanamaker Building, \n         Philadelphia, PA.\n     Re: Delaware River Main Channel Deepening Project\n       Dear Lieutenant Colonel Lewis: The Department of Natural \n     Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) has reviewed your \n     letter of June 9, 2000 and the updated matrix entitled \n     ``Assessment of Environmental Issues'' that you provided in \n     response to my March 31, 2000 letter regarding the deepening \n     of the Delaware River Main Channel. This letter also \n     addresses issues raised in your most recent correspondence to \n     me of July 9, 2000. Let me begin by thanking you and your \n     staff for meeting with me and members of my staff, discussing \n     our concerns and providing the organized response. Overall, \n     we appear to be in agreement on the means to resolve many \n     issues. Clarifications of DNREC requirements for specific \n     issues are outlined below. We still have several remaining \n     concerns.\n       The following are comments from the Department regarding \n     the matrix ``Assessment of Environmental Issues.'' Comments \n     are organized by section.\n\n     1.0  CONFINED DISPOSAL FACILITIES\n           1.1 & 1.2  The Corps will need to follow the \n             requirements for Delaware permit processing, \n             regardless of the eventual enforcement mechanism. \n             DNREC uses EPA Application Form 1--General \n             Information; EPA Application Form 2D--New Sources and \n             New Discharges and EPA Application Form 2E--\n             Facilities Which Do Not Discharge Process Wastewater \n             to collect information to control discharges such as \n             those from CDFs. These forms must be filled out and \n             submitted to the Division of Water Resources for all \n             discharges that could impact Delaware waters. Copies \n             are attached.\n           1.3  Procedures for effluent monitoring must be \n             submitted to DNREC for review and comment.

DNREC's \n             original comment reflected two concerns: potential \n             contaminant discharge during de-watering and \n             potential longer term impacts after de-watering. \n             These concerns need by addressed by the Corps before \n             the project commences.\n     2.0  SAND PLACEMENT ON DELAWARE BEACHES\n           2.1  See Attachment A for a list of Delaware's \n             preferred locations for sand placement.\n           The FEIS does not address the impacts of placing \n             material on Delaware beaches. The EIS will not be \n             complete until it is amended to address this issue.\n           2.2  It is unclear from your response whether you \n             intend to apply for Subaqueous Lands permits. Does \n             your acknowledgement of 401 Water Quality \n             Certification requirements include agreement on \n             Subaqueous Lands permits? A Subaqueous Lands permit \n             or its enforceable equivalent is needed.\n           2.3  DNREC is satisfied with the agreement regarding \n             horseshoe crab protection measures.\n     3.0  WETLAND CREATION/ENHANCEMENT\n           3.1  If tidal wetlands are to be impacted during the \n             construction of Kelly Island, the substantive \n             requirements of a State of Delaware wetlands permit \n             must be obtained before any work can commence.\n           If the de-watering of Kelly Island necessitates a \n             discharge into surface waters, the Crops will be \n             required to complete the same application forms \n             required for CDFs.\n           3.2  DNREC will continue working with the Corps until a \n             final wetland design plan can be approved. Work \n             cannot commence until this plan is finalized. \n             Regardless of what the Kelly Island project is \n             referred to, we are targeting the survival rates \n             outlined in the March 31, 2000 letter as measures of \n             success.\n           3.3  A post-construction monitoring plan to ensure \n             protection of water quality standards must be \n             developed by the Corps and submitted to DNREC for \n             review and approval before the project can commence. \n             In addition, the Corps must clarify how long it \n             intends to maintain the beach constructed in front of \n             the wetland area.\n           3.4  A Subaqueous Lands permit or its enforceable \n             equivalent is required.\n     4.0  OYSTER HABITAT MONITORING\n           DNREC is awaiting the final oyster-monitoring plan from \n             the Corps for review and comment.

This \n             plan is to include steps to be taken if TSS exceeds \n             250 mg/l.\n           Corps regulations require that an EIS address water \n             quality impacts in states adjoining areas where side \n             channels and berthing areas are to be dredged. The \n             Corps is to assist the states where this dredging is \n             to occur in obtaining Section 401 Water Quality \n             Certification from the State where there could be \n             adverse impacts on water quality. The Corps has not \n             done this for the dredging that will occur at Marcus \n             Hook.\n     6.0  ENDANGERED SPECIES\n           6.1  DNREC requires the submission of protocols for \n             monitoring potential impacts to sea turtles and \n             short-nose sturgeon for review and comment before the \n             project commences.\n           6.2  DNREC is satisfied with agreements regarding \n             protections of sea turtles.\n     7.0  DREDGING\n           7.1  DNREC is satisfied regarding adherence to dredging \n             windows.\n           7.2  DNREC is satisfied regarding adherence to dredging \n             windows for striped bass.\n           7.3  DNREC is satisfied regarding adherence to dredging \n             windows for Atlantic sturgeon.\n           7.4  DNREC is satisfied regarding adherence to dredging \n             windows for Atlantic sturgeon.\n           7.5  DNREC is satisfied regarding Atlantic sturgeon \n             overwintering monitoring for hopper dredge \n             activities.\n           7.6  The extent of economic loading needs to be \n             finalized and approved by DNREC before the project \n             can commence.\n           * Please note final comments regarding female \n             overwintering blue crabs.\n     8.0 REPORTING\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\n           8.1.  An outline for the CDF Annual Operational Report \n             must be submitted to DNREC for review and comment \n             before the project may commence.\n           A description of current CDF site conditions must also \n             be submitted.\n           8.2  DNREC is satisfied with agreements for bi-annual \n             progress reporting.\n           8.3  DNREC is satisfied with agreements for CDF \n             capacity for maintenance.\n\n       Please share with us as soon as possible the Corps' \n     proposed dredging schedule and dredging techniques. Over the \n     past years, we have discussed many dredging closure windows \n     and investigated the impacts of economic loading. If the \n     Corps plans to dredge the lower Delaware Bay during the \n     winter, we need to know what measures will be put in place to \n     avoid and reduce impacts to overwintering female blue crabs. \n     During cold winters female blue crabs hibernate in the \n     channel, particularly on the channel sides. They may be \n     torpid and unable to move away from the dredge as stated in \n     the Supplemental EIS. This, combined with the possibility of \n     economic loading depositing a burdensome amount of sediment \n     on top of them, should be accounted for and avoided. This \n     most important fishery must be protected.\n       Also, we have gotten conflicting information regarding the \n     final quality of rock available after blasting. As you may be \n     aware, our conditional consistency determination required the \n     Corps to make this rock available to Delaware for habitat \n     improvement. This rock is a resource that belongs to \n     Delaware. Placement of rock in Delaware's eleven permitted \n     reef sites could serve as partial mitigation for unavoidable \n     fisheries impacts sustained during the dredging process.\n       Additionally, a preliminary DNREC review of berthing area \n     sediment toxicity data has shown contamination levels of \n     concern. We are just now bringing this issue up because of \n     the length of time it took the Corps to provide the requested \n     data and the time it took our staff to convert the raw data \n     to an electronic format to facilitate analysis. I trust you \n     have shared this information with the state environmental \n     agencies of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It is our \n     understanding that Corps regulations and Section 401 of the \n     Clean Water Act require that an EIS address water quality \n     impacts in states adjoining areas where side channel berthing \n     areas are to be dredged and that the Corps is to assist \n     states to obtain Section 401 Water Quality Certification from \n     the affected state. DNREC requests that you document \n     potential effects to waters of the State of Delaware from \n     dredging activities in side channel/berthing areas in \n     adjoining states.\n       Finally, as previously discussed on numerous occasions and \n     as we have maintained over the past decade, the State of \n     Delaware continues to assert that the Corps is subject to \n     state permitting requirements for this project. We have \n     provided your legal and technical staff with appropriate \n     statutory and regulatory requirements and permit application \n     forms. Before we will entertain any further discussion about \n     alternative mechanisms for satisfying these remaining \n     environmental and regulatory requirements, the U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers must provide to the Delaware Department of \n     Natural Resources and Environmental Control a written legal \n     justification that articulates why the Corps should be exempt \n     from applying for required State of Delaware permits.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Nicholas A. DiPasquale,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n\n                 Solar and Renewable Energy Activities\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman and \nranking minority member of the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Subcommittee for including $43.617 million for Solar and \nRenewable Energy activities, and to discuss briefly a renewable energy \nproject in my home state of North Dakota.\n  One of the most abundant sources of energy in the Upper Great Plains \nregion is wind. My State of North Dakota ranks first in wind power \nproduction potential, and the Department of Energy has said that North \nDakota alone could capture enough wind energy to supply 36 percent of \nthe power needs of the lower 48 States. Not only does wind offer a \nclean and inexpensive form of energy, it also could provide our rural \nresidents with an important source of income. DOE estimates that a \n1,000-acre farm could earn as much as $80,000 per year in wind \nroyalties.\n  One wind energy initiative of particular interest to me is being \nconducted on the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation by the Center for \nNew Growth and Economic Development at the Turtle Mountain Community \nCollege. I had hoped that the Committee would have designated $1 \nmillion for this project, but the Subcommittee's current allocation was \nnot at a level to accommodate funding for new start-up projects in the \nrenewable energy accounts.\n  I recognize that it is difficult to speculate about what the final \nbudget allocation for this bill might allow, but I would ask the \nchairman and the ranking minority member to consider designating $1 \nmillion for this project in conference should additional funds for the \nprograms under the Subcommittee's jurisdiction become available.\n  Mr. REID. I recognize the importance of wind energy development not \nonly for North Dakota but also for the other states that might benefit \nfrom North Dakota's ability to harness this great resource. This \nproject discussed by the Senator from North Dakota is particularly \nunique since it is being conducted by Native Americans in an effort to \nreduce their dependence on fossil fuels and to become more financially \nself-sufficient. Although we do not know, as the Senator points out, \nwhat our final allocation may be, the Senator can be assured that I \nwill do my best to see that this initiative is funded, should the \nSubcommittee's allocation allow additional projects.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is my understanding that the funds being requested \nby the Senator would be used for a wind turbine and for educational \npurposes such as teaching others on the reservation and in the region \nhow to establish and maintain ``wind farms''.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, the Senator's understanding is correct. The Center \nfor New Growth and Economic Development will work with Turtle Mountain \nCommunity College to develop a curriculum on ``windsmithing'' so that \nothers can learn the trade of wind energy. The Turtle Mountain Chippewa \nReservation is located in the middle of a natural wind tunnel so this \nis a natural place to develop expertise relating to wind energy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for this \nexplanation, and agree that this Center has potential to provide an \ninnovative approach to an old technology--the windmill.\n\n\n       energy and water development appropriations bill, fy 2001\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nSenator Reid, the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Water \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I want to raise an issue and briefly discuss an amendment that I \nfiled regarding the University of Connecticut. The amendment requests \nthat the Department of Energy release $7.9 million that was originally \nappropriate in 1993 for the construction of an Advanced Technologies \nInstitute at the University of Connecticut. Because of initial problems \nwith the siting of the facility, the University was granted no-cost \nextensions for the award. The problems have since been resolved and the \nUniversity is ready to break ground. I believe that the University of \nConnecticut, like other institutions, may, without Congressional \naction, lose out on the receipt of money that was already set aside for \nthem. It is my understanding that the Senate, in its wisdom, has \nresolved similar situations in recent months. I would ask the chairman \nand ranking member to continue to work with me to try and rectify the \nsituation with the University of Connecticut.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nConnecticut has said. I would like to work with him on this issue as we \nmove to Conference on this bill. Several of our colleagues have had \nsimilar problems with other projects and I will continue to work with \nthe Senator from Connecticut as we move to Conference.\n\n\n            great lakes sediment tributary transport models\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes \nTask Force, the distinguished Senator from Michigan and myself want to \ntake this opportunity to reiterate our support for a program of great \ninterest to our colleagues from the Great Lakes states.\n  Section 516(c) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 \nauthorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to construct sediment transport \nmodels for major tributaries of the Great Lakes. This is a project \naimed at the prevention end of a complex of sediment-related problems \nin the Great Lakes region--problems which are costing this country \nmillions of dollars each year to remediate. The potential benefits of \nthese models are such that they will pay for themselves in terms of \nreduced dredging and disposal costs. The benefits of\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\nthe program are well-recognized nationally; the program is being used \nas a template for a similar authorization for the Upper Mississippi \nriver system. In addition to their uses to the Corps of Engineers in \nplanning for dredging needs of the region and development of cost-\neffective alternatives to dredging, the tributary transport models are \nmade available to local, state and federal partners involved in \nnonpoint source pollution control to help target their efforts to \nprevent erosion which results in sedimentation of harbors and channels. \nA total of approximately sixty Great Lakes tributaries qualify under \nthe authorization guidelines, 25 of which are considered high priority \nbased on their current dredging needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in each of fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1999 the \nCongress was able to provide $500,000 for this project--funds which \nwere spent to begin construction of models for six priority \ntributaries. Models of the Nemadji River, and Saginaw River have been \ncompleted, but lack of funding in fiscal 2000 has delayed completion of \nmodels of the Maumee River, Menominee River, Buffalo River, and Grand \nCalumet River. Plans to begin development of additional models for \npriority tributaries in Mill & Cascade Creeks, PA and Grand River, MI \nhave also been delayed. With the first models just finishing \ncompletion, we are already seeing the benefits of the program. In the \ncase of the Nemadji River model, the county government is starting to \nuse the model to explore potential effects of changes to forestry \npractices in the Nemadji River watershed to reduce bank erosion and \nsoil loss to Lake Superior. Preliminary analysis carried out on the \nMaumee model indicate that soil conservation can reduce future dredging \nand disposal costs.\n  We note that the House Committee has provided $500,000 in fiscal 2001 \nfunding for the modeling program and ask the distinguished ranking \nmember to make funding for this program a high priority in conference \nwith the House.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to thank our colleagues from the \nGreat Lakes states for highlighting the importance of this program and \nits potential for long-term cost. And to the extent that resources are \navailable, I will do my best to address the funding needs of this \nprogram in Conference.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the chairman for his consideration and \ncongratulate the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee for presenting the Senate with an Energy and Water \nDevelopment appropriations bill which addresses so many of this \nnation's water resources infrastructure needs.\n\n\n                            low lake levels\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to ask my distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico and Chairman of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Domenici, if he is aware of a serious \nproblem facing Ohio and the entire Great Lakes region. For the last 2 \nyears, water levels in the Great Lakes have been declining rapidly. \nThis year, the water level fell below low water datum for the first \ntime in nearly 35 years.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am aware of the extreme low water \nlevel problem and understand the difficulties that the Great Lakes \nregion is facing as a result.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, dredging in Great Lakes harbors and \nnavigation channels is authorized by reference to low water datum. \nDuring periods of extremely low water, like those today, lake levels \ndrop below low water datum. These low water levels not only threaten to \ncripple Great Lakes industries that depend on waterborne \ntransportation, but they also create a serious threat to the safety of \nthe thousands of recreational and commercial boaters on the Lakes. \nWould my colleague from New Mexico agree that the Corps should ensure \nminimal operation depths consistent with the original authorized depths \nand current use of the channels and harbors when Great Lakes water \nlevels are below the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that the corps should work \ntoward this goal recognizing the constrained nature of the operation \nand maintenance budget recommended for fiscal year 2001 and existing \ntraffic using the system.\n\n\n     great lakes remedial action planning assistance and sediment \n                 remediation technology demonstrations\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal Year \n2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriations, we would like to \nbring to the attention of the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nthe critical problem which the Great Lakes region faces in dealing with \na legacy of sediment contamination.\n  In 1987, the International Joint Commission designated 43 Areas of \nConcern on the Great Lakes where human use of the aquatic resources is \nseverely impaired. Of the 31 U.S. sites, none have been cleaned up to \nthe point of de-listing in the 13 years which have passed since \nlisting. In most cases, the remaining recalcitrant problem is sediments \nwhich are contaminated with persistent toxic substances.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the Army Corps of Engineers plays a key \nrole in addressing the contaminated sediments problem in the Great \nLakes region. Section 401 of the Water Resources Development Act of \n1990 authorized the Corps of Engineers to provide technical assistance \nto the Remedial Action Planning Committees for each of the Areas of \nConcern. This technical assistance is critical to developing a cost-\neffective and scientifically sound approach to cleanup. One of the \nlargest obstacles to cleanup of contaminated sediments in the Great \nLakes region is the lack of availability of alternative technologies \nfor remediation of contaminated sediments. The Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1996 amended Section 401 allowing technical \nassistance funds to be used for the development and demonstration of \npromising new remediation technologies.\n  Since 1990, Congress has provided a total of just $3.25 million for \nthe Section 401 program. Funding has never exceeded $500,000 in any \nfiscal year, a level far too low to support even a single technology \ndemonstration while maintaining key technical assistance capabilities.\n  We note that the House Committee has provided $600,000 in fiscal 2001 \nfunding for the Section 401 Program. While we welcome the prospect of \nthis increase, even at this level funding remains woefully short of the \namount needed for this key component of our regional battle to address \nthe problem of sediment contamination in the Great Lakes. We ask the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member to make funding for this \nprogram a high priority in conference with the House and within any \nadditional funding which may become available.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to thank our colleagues from the \nGreat Lakes States for highlighting the importance of this program. To \nthe extent that resources are available, I will do my best to address \nthe funding needs of this program in conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8283-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8283-S8284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GLOBAL AIDS AND TUBERCULOSIS RELIEF ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. On August 19, 2000, President Clinton signed into law \nbipartisan legislation that pledges more than $400 million to fight \nAIDS and other infectious diseases in Africa and around the world.\n  There are few greater crises that face us today than the AIDS \npandemic. Alarming statistics are reported from around the globe. In \nAfrica, more than 13 million people have died from AIDS, and an \nestimated 24.5 million are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus HIV. More than 1 in 3 adults in Botswana are HIV-positive. Burma \nand Cambodia have recently had the sharpest increases in the rate of \ninfection. In Haiti, more than 1 in 20 adults are infected.\n  The XIII International AIDS Conference in South Africa was defined by \nthe fact that 90 percent of those infected with HIV do not have the \nmeans to pay for the drugs to treat it. The epidemic is fueled by \npoverty, poor health, illiteracy, malnutrition, and gender bias. These \nare the same problems that developing nations have struggled with for \nmany years. But even more urgency becomes warranted as these factors \ncontribute to the exponential growth of an epidemic.\n  According to AIDS expert Peter Godwin, an epidemic requires specific \nresponses in three areas: long-term protection of vulnerable \npopulations; short-term relief and rehabilitation of those in crisis; \nand the strengthening\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\nof basic institutions against future shocks to come. Each of these \nresponses comprises an infinite number of sub-components.\n  The Senate's passage of this bill is remarkable. But our work has \njust begun. According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, \nAsia has reached a critical point in the development of the AIDS \nepidemic. Though India has a relatively low infection rate, it has more \nthan four million cases and is now the nation with the largest number \nof HIV cases in the world. In Africa, the U.N. has predicted that half \nof all 15-year-olds in the African countries worst affected by AIDS \nwill eventually die of the disease, even if the rates of infection drop \nsubstantially in the next few years. Sandra Thurman, the director of \nthe Clinton administration's anti-AIDS effort, put it best: ``We are at \nthe beginning of a pandemic, not the middle, not the end.''\n  On February 3, Mr. Feingold and I introduced S. 2032, the Mother-to-\nChild HIV Prevention Act of 2000. This bill has been included in this \nassistance package and will authorize $25 million to bolster \nintervention programs, which include voluntary counseling and testing, \nantiretroviral drugs, replacement feeding, and other strategies.\n  At the beginning of this year, a score of bills were introduced by my \ncolleagues in this body. Some proposals were more ambitious than \nothers. No single proposal would have been a complete solution. Neither \nis the relief package before us. But each was an approach that did not \nrequire waiting for a cure. And each could make a difference. I hope \nthis momentum will not face--but instead, grow internationally and \nexponentially--and that we will not become fatigued by this most \nformidable challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8284-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF SENATOR PAUL COVERDELL\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my esteemed \ncolleague, Paul Coverdell. I join with my colleagues in expressing \nsadness at his passing. He was a tremendous leader in the Senate and an \nasset for Georgians and the rest of the country. His years of exemplary \npublic service have included the military, the Peace Corps, the Georgia \nstatehouse, and finally the U.S. Senate. Senator Coverdell was an \neffective leader and demonstrated many times his unifying influence in \nthe Senate.\n  On a personal level, he was an unpretentious man who had a quiet \nsense of humor and good mind for details. He was instrumental in \nhelping me make the transition from the U.S. House to the Senate a \ncouple of years ago, and provided insight and advice in everything from \nhow to set up a Senate office to how to make time for my family. There \nis not a day that goes by that his influence in my Senate career has \nnot been felt.\n  Paul was a friend and a model statesman. He spent a lifetime of \nservice to his country. I will miss him dearly.

I \nask unanimous consent that the report which is now available be printed \nin the Congressional Record for the information of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate--September 1, 2000\n\n     S. 1612--Missouri River Basin, Middle Loup Division \n         Facilities Conveyance Act\n       As reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n           Resources on August 25, 2000\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       S. 1612 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \n     convey certain facilities, lands, and rights to the Farwell \n     Irrigation District, the Sargent Irrigation District, and the \n     Loup Basin Reclamation District, in the state of Nebraska. \n     Under the bill, these districts would pay the federal \n     government about $2.8 million for the Sherman Reservoir, \n     Milburn Diversion Dam, Arcadia Diversion Dam, related canals \n     and lands, and other associated rights and interests \n     currently owned by the United States.\n       Based on information from the Bureau of Reclamation, CBO \n     estimates that enacting S. 1612 would result in net receipts \n     of about $1.3 million over 2001-2005 period; $2.8 million in \n     asset sale receipts, offset by $1.5 million of forgone \n     offsetting receipts over that period.\n       Because enacting S. 1612 would affect direct spending, pay-\n     as-you-go procedures would apply. CBO estimates a net pay-as-\n     you-go cost of $1.5 million over the 2001-2005 period, \n     reflecting the forgone offsetting receipts. The asset sale \n     receipts would not count for pay-as-you-go purposes because \n     the sales of assets under S. 1612 would result in a net \n     financial cost (on a present value basis) to the federal \n     government.\n       CBO estimates that implementing this bill would have no net \n     effect on discretionary spending in 2001, but would result in \n     a very small decrease in discretionary spending each year \n     thereafter.\n       S. 1612 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). The conveyance provided for in this bill would be \n     voluntary on the part of the districts, and all costs \n     incurred by them as a result of the conveyance also would be \n     voluntary.\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 1612 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget function 300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        By fiscal year, in millions of\n                                                    dollars\n                                     -----------------------------------\n                                       2001    2002   2003   2004   2005\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n     CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nAsset Sale Receipts:\n  Estimated Budget Authority........    -2.8      0      0      0      0\n  Estimated Outlays.................    -2.8      0      0      0      0\nForgone Offsetting Receipts:\n  Estimated Budget Authority........     0.3    0.3    0.3    0.3    0.3\n  Estimated Outlays.................     0.3    0.3    0.3    0.3    0.3\nNet Changes:\n  Estimated Budget Authority........    -2.5    0.3    0.3    0.3    0.3\n  Estimated Outlays.................    -2.5    0.3    0.3    0.3    0.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n       For the estimate, CBO assumes that S. 1612 will be enacted \n     near the start of fiscal year 2001. We expect that the \n     project would be conveyed to the districts in fiscal year \n     2001. The bill would require the water districts to pay about \n     $2.8 million for the facilities that would be conveyed.\n       Currently, those districts have fixed repayment and water \n     service contracts with the Bureau. Those contracts result in \n     payments of about $300,000 a year through 2016 and about \n     $130,000 a year over the remaining life of the contract \n     (through 2042). Once the assets are conveyed to the \n     districts, those repayments would no longer occur, and would \n     result in a loss of offsetting receipts to the federal \n     government. In addition, customers of the Western Area Power \n     Administration (WAPA) are scheduled to pay a total of $29 \n     million to the government over the 2036-2042 period to assist \n     with the repayment of the cost of these facilities. Enactment \n     of S. 1612 would lead to a loss of these receipts as well.\n       S. 1612 would direct the Western Area Power Administration \n     (WAPA) to transfer $2.6 million of receipts from the sale of \n     electricity at the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin project to \n     the reclamation fund at the time of the transfer or as soon \n     as certain conditions are met. That intergovernmental payment \n     would represent the net present value of $29 million in \n     payments that WAPA customers owe to the government under \n     current law over the 2036-2042 period. The bill specifies \n     that WAPA shall not increase the electricity rates to offset \n     this payment; consequently, this provision would have no \n     budgetary effect.\n       Based on information from the Bureau of Reclamation, CBO \n     estimates that the agency currently spends less than $60,000 \n     each year for expenses related to the projects to be conveyed \n     under S. 1612. After the projects are conveyed, these \n     expenses would no longer be incurred, resulting in a small \n     savings to the government. However, in the year of the \n     conveyance, CBO expects that the bureau would spend about the \n     same amount to administer the conveyance, rsulting in not \n     change in discretionary spending in 2001.\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. Enactment of S. 1612 would result in \n     the loss of offsetting receipts of $0.3 million annually over \n     the 2001-2010 period, and additional amounts later. For the \n     purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects in the current year, the budget year, and the \n     succeeding four years are counted.\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                            By fiscal year, in mIllions of dollars\n                                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 2000        2001        2002        2003        2004        2005        2006        2007        2008        2009         010\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays..........................................           0         0.3         0.3         0.3         0.3         0.3         0.3         0.3         0.3         0.3         0.3\nChanges in receipts.........................................                                                             Not applicable\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Under the Balanced Budget Act (BBA), proceeds from \n     nonroutine asset sales (sales that are not authorized under \n     current law) may be counted for pay-as-you-go purposes only \n     if the sale would entail no financial cost to the government. \n     Under BBA, ``financial cost to the government'' is defined in \n     terms of the present value of all cash flows associated with \n     an asset sale. CBO estimates that the sale of the Sherman \n     Reservoir, Milburn Diversion Dam, Arcadia Diversion Dam, and \n     all other associated rights and interests as specified in S. \n     1612 would result in a net cost to the federal government of \n     about $0.4 million. Therefore, the proceeds of this sale \n     would not be counted for pay-as-you-go purposes. The forgone \n     offsetting receipts resulting from this asset sale--less than \n     $500,000 annually--would be counted for purposes of enforcing \n     pay-as-you-go procedures.\n\n\n        estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments\n\n       S. 1612 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in UMRA. The bill would require the districts to pay \n     approximately $2.8 million to receive title to federal \n     facilities, and would impose a number of other conditions. \n     The conveyance would be voluntary on the part of the \n     districts, however, and all costs incurred by them as a \n     result would be voluntary. The bill would impose no costs on \n     any other state, local, or tribal governments.\n\n\n                 estimated impact on the private sector\n\n       This bill contains no new private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA.\n\n\n                         previous cbo estimate\n\n       On September 1, 2000, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for \n     H.R. 2984, a bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior, \n     through the Bureau of Reclamation, to convey to the Loup \n     Basin Reclamation District, the Sargent River Irrigation \n     District, and the Farwell Irrigation District, Nebraska, \n     property comprising the assets of the Middle Loup Division of \n     the Missouri River Basin Project, Nebraska, as ordered \n     reported by the House Committee on Resources on June 21, \n     2000. These two pieces of legislation are similar and our \n     costs estimates are the same.\n       Estimate Prepared by: Federal Costs: Lisa Cash Driskill \n     (226-2860); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Marjorie Miller (225-3220); and Impact on the Private Sector: \n     Sarah Sitarek (226-2940).\n       Estimate Approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the time Senate Report No. 106-324 \nwas filed, the Congressional Budget Office report was not available. I \nask unanimous consent that the report which is now available be printed \nin the Congressional Record for the information of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, July 24, 2000\n\n     S. 2071--Electric Reliability 2000 Act\n       As passed by the Senate on June 30, 2000\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       S. 2071 would establish new standards and procedures for \n     regulating the reliability of the nation's electricity \n     transmission system. It would authorize the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) to adopt and enforce reliability \n     standards that would apply to all users of bulk power, \n     including federal agencies. The bill also would establish the \n     terms and conditions under which those regulatory functions \n     would be delegated to a private electric reliability \n     organization (ERO) and its regional affiliates. Rule adopted \n     by the ERO regarding reliability, governance, and funding \n     would be subject to FERC approval, and would be enforceable \n     by both the ERO and FERC.\n       S. 2071 would require membership in the ERO and the \n     appropriate regional affiliate for any company that operates \n     any part of the bulk power system in the United States. \n     Finally, costs incurred by the ERO and its regional \n     affiliates would have to be recovered by assessments that CBO \n     assumes would ultimately be paid by electricity consumers.\n       In CBO's view, the cash flows of the ERO and its regional \n     affiliates should appear in the federal budget because their \n     regulatory, enforcement, and assessment authorities would \n     stem from the exercise of the sovereign power of the federal \n     government. We expect that it would take about one year for \n     those cash flows to begin. Under S. 2071, CBO estimates that \n     over the 2002-2005 period, direct spending would total $420 \n     million and governmental receipts (revenues) would total $309 \n     million, net of income and payroll tax offsets. Because the \n     bill would affect direct spending and receipts, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply.\n       In addition, we estimate that implementing this bill would \n     cost $2 million annually, starting in 2002, subject to the \n     availability of appropriated funds. Those costs would be \n     incurred by the government's three power marketing \n     administrations (PMAs) that are funded by annual \n     appropriations.\n       S. 2071 contains three mandates that would affect both \n     intergovernmental and private-sector entities and an \n     additional intergovernmental mandate as defined in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). While there is some \n     uncertainty about how fees will be assessed, CBO estimates \n     that the costs of those mandates would begin in 2002 but \n     would not exceed the thresholds established in UMRA. (The \n     thresholds are $55 million for intergovernmental mandates and \n     $109 million for private-sector mandates in 2000, and are \n     adjusted annually for inflation).\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 2071 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget function 270 (energy).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2000   2001   2002   2003   2004   2005\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority....      0      0    102    104    106    108\nEstimated Outlays.............      0      0    102    104    106    108\n \n      CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated Revenues............      0      0     75     77     78     79\n \n      SPENDING SUBJECT TO\n         APPROPRIATION\n \nPMA Spending Under Current\n Law:\nEstimated Authorization Level     187    193    198    204    209    213\n \\1\\..........................\nEstimated Outlays.............    214    206    198    201    206    210\nProposed Changes:\\2\\\nEstimated Authorization Level.      0      0      2      2      2      2\nEstimated Outlays.............      0      0      2      2      2      2\nPMA Spending Under S. 2071:\nEstimated Authorization Level.    187    193    200    206    211    215\nEstimated Outlays.............    214    206    200    203    208    212\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2000 level is the amount appropriated for that year.

We also assume that the cash flows of \n     the ERO and it's regional affiliates would appear on the \n     federal budget because of the governmental nature of its \n     activities and the degree of governmental control over the \n     ERO.\n     Direct spending\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 2071 would result in new \n     direct spending by the ERO and its affiliates, and also would \n     affect the net outlays and receipts of the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority (TVA) and the Bonneville Power Administration \n     (BPA).\n       Electric Reliability Organization. S. 2071 would direct the \n     ERO and its affiliates to levy assessments to cover the cost \n     of their activities. Such assessments would be classified as \n     revenues (as explained below). Funds collected through such \n     assessments could be spent without further appropriation. \n     Hence, such outlays would be classified as direct spending.\n       Based on information from the North American Electric \n     Reliability Council (NERC), CBO estimates that the newly \n     formed ERO and its regional affiliates would spend between \n     $75 million and $150 million a year. For this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that spending by the ERO and its regional affiliates \n     would start at $100 million a year and increase by the rate \n     of anticipated inflation. NERC and its regional councils \n     currently spend about $45 million annually for voluntary \n     measures related to reliability in the United States, all of \n     which is covered by fees paid by most users of the bulk power \n     system. According to NERC, spending by the new ERO and its \n     affiliates would more than double because of the additional \n     workload associated with implementing mandatory reliability \n     standards, such as developing software, monitoring the \n     transmission grid, auditing companies, and writing and \n     enforcing standards. Costs also are expected to increase \n     because of the additional building space needed to \n     accommodate increases in staff.\n       Annual spending could exceed the $100-million level assumed \n     in this estimate, especially if the regional affiliates used \n     assessments to facilitate investments in facilities needed to \n     implement the reliability standards. For this estimate, \n     however, CBO assumes that infrastructure investments would \n     made by the private sector without the involvement of the ERO \n     or its affiliates.\n       Federal Power Agencies. CBO estimates that S. 2071 would \n     increase direct spending by TVA and BPA by $2 million a year \n     over the 2002-2005 period, but would eventually result in \n     higher offsetting receipts once those federal agencies adjust \n     their electricity prices to reflect any increase in fees \n     charged by an ERO or its affiliates.\n       Requiring TVA and BPA to pay higher assessments should have \n     no net effect on direct spending over time, but is likely to \n     increase spending in the near term because of the timing of \n     planned rate adjustments. Together, these two agencies \n     currently pay a total of about $1 million to NERC and its \n     regional affiliates. CBO assumes that, under this bill, the \n     agencies would pay fees to the\n\n[[Page S8286]]\n\n     ERO and its affiliates instead of NERC and that the net \n     increase in assessments would be about $2 million a year, \n     starting in 2002. Based on the agencies' current plans, we \n     expect that these added expenses would not be reflected in \n     TVA's or BPA's electricity prices until the next cycle of \n     rate adjustments, which are expected to occur after 2005.\n       Repayments of amounts appropriated for ERO fees paid by the \n     Western, Southwestern, and Southeastern PMAs should increase \n     offsetting receipts relative to current law, but those \n     changes are not included in this estimate because they would \n     be contingent upon an increase in discretionary spending.\n     Revenues\n       The bill would affect revenues by authorizing the ERO to \n     collect mandatory assessments from the electricity industry \n     to pay for activities related to the bill and by authorizing \n     the ERO and FERC to collect penalties for noncompliance with \n     reliability standards.\n       Mandatory Assessments. S. 2071 would require the ERO and \n     its regional affiliates to fund reasonable costs related to \n     implementation or enforcement of reliability standards \n     through assessments. CBO estimates that these organizations \n     would collect about $100 million in 2002, and similar \n     inflation-adjusted amounts in subsequent years. FERC would be \n     required to review the costs and allocation of such \n     assessments.\n       The amount of the assessments, however, do not represent \n     the total change to government receipts that would occur as a \n     result of the legislation. The assessments add to the costs \n     of the electricity industry, which is expected to pass them \n     forward to consumers in prices. But as long as the nation's \n     total output (gross domestic product, or GDP) remains at the \n     levels assumed in the budget resolution, consumers would have \n     to absorb the additional costs by spending less on other \n     goods and services in the economy. As less in spent in other \n     sectors of the economy, the overall effect would be a \n     reduction in the level of profits and wages paid relative to \n     total GDP. Corporate and individual income taxes and payroll \n     taxes would shrink accordingly. CBO estimates that the \n     decline in income and payroll tax receipts would equal 25 \n     percent of the total amount of the ERO assessments. Hence, \n     the net impact on receipts to the government from this change \n     would only be 75 percent of the amount.\n       Penalties. The bill would allow both the electric \n     reliability organization and FERC to charge civil penalties \n     for noncompliance with the new reliability standards. CBO \n     expects that the ERO and its regional affiliates would retain \n     and spend any penalties it collects and that any amounts \n     collected would be classified as government receipts. CBO \n     estimates that any increase in revenues resulting from these \n     civil penalties would not be significant.\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       The bill would impose new discretionary costs on FERC and \n     three of the Department of Energy's power marketing \n     administrations. The impact on FERC, however, would have no \n     budgetary impact because it collects fees to offset its \n     costs. CBO estimates that implementing S. 2071 would cost $2 \n     million a year, starting in 2002, for payments by the PMAs to \n     the ERO.\n       FERC. CBO expects that S. 2071 would increase FERC's \n     workload because of the additional regulatory and oversight \n     activities required by the bill. We also expect that FERC \n     would adopt and enforce interim reliability standards before \n     the ERO is established. Once the ERO is established, FERC \n     would have to review all proposed rules and changes to the \n     entity's governance and budget, and help enforce its actions \n     on users of the bulk power system. Based on information from \n     FERC, CBO estimates these new responsibilities would cost \n     about $5 million per year. Because FERC recovers 100 percent \n     of its costs through user fees, any change in its \n     administrative costs would be offset by an equal change in \n     the fees that the commission charges. Hence, we estimate that \n     the provisions affecting FERC's workload would have no net \n     budgetary impact. Because FERC's administrative costs are \n     limited in annual appropriations, changes to FERC's budget \n     under S. 2071 would not affect direct spending or receipts.\n       Federal Power Marketing Administrations. CBO expects that \n     all of the federal power agencies would pay assessments \n     levied by the ERO and its affiliates. For three of the PMAs--\n     Western, Southwestern, and Southeastern--such payments would \n     be funded by appropriations, but under current law those \n     costs would have to be repaid by the PMAs' proceeds from the \n     sale of electricity. Hence, such discretionary expenditures \n     would be offset, over time, by an increase in offsetting \n     receipts, which are classified as direct spending. Currently, \n     the three PMAs are members of NERC, the industry organization \n     that sets voluntary standards for reliability of the bulk \n     power system, and its regional councils. Fees paid by the \n     three PMAs to NERC and its regional councils currently total \n     about $1 million a year. CBO expects that, under this bill, \n     the PMAs would no longer pay those fees to NERC, but instead \n     would pay new higher fees to the ERO and its regional \n     affiliates. CBO estimates that implementing S. 2071 would \n     increase the net cost of those fees by about $2 million a \n     year, starting in 2002.\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       The Balance Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. CBO estimates that S. 2071 would affect \n     both direct spending and receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply. The estimated changes in outlays \n     and governmental receipts that are subject to pay-as-you-\n     go procedures are shown in the following table. For the \n     purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects in the current year, the budget year, and the \n     succeeding four years are counted.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                            By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 2000        2001        2002        2003        2004        2005        2006        2007        2008        2009        2010\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays..........................................           0           0         102         104         106         108         110         110         114         116         118\nChanges in receipts.........................................           0           0          75          77          78          79          81          82          84          85          87\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n              intergovernmental and private-sector impact\n\n       S. 2071 contains three mandates that affect both \n     intergovernmental and private-sector entities and an \n     additional intergovernmental mandate as defined in UMRA. CBO \n     estimates that the costs of those mandates would be incurred \n     beginning in 2002 but would not exceed the thresholds \n     established in UMRA. (The thresholds are $55 million for \n     intergovernmental mandates and $109 million for private-\n     sector mandates in 2000, and are adjusted annually for \n     inflation).\n       First, the bill would require all users of the bulk power \n     system to abide by standards set by the ERO, or until the ERO \n     is designated, by standards approved by FERC. The bill \n     defines `bulk power system user' as an entity that sells, \n     purchases, or transmits electric energy over the bulk power \n     system (i.e., the electric transmission grid); that owns, \n     operates, or maintains facilities or control systems within \n     that bulk power system; or that is a system operator. Users \n     of the bulk power system include intergovernmental entities \n     such as municipally owned utilities as well as private-sector \n     entities such as utilities, nonutility generators, and \n     marketers. Users who violate ERO standards would be subject \n     to financial penalties.\n       Currently, reliability is promoted through NERC, a \n     voluntary organization. According to the American Public \n     Power Association (APA), Edison Electric Institute, and the \n     Electric Power Supply Association, virtually all state and \n     local government entities and private-sector users of the \n     bulk power system included under the bill's definition of \n     `bulk power system user' voluntarily comply with NERC \n     standards. For those entities, the mandate to comply with \n     FERC or ERO standards would impose no significant additional \n     costs in the short term relative to current practice because \n     neither FERC nor the ERO is expected to significantly change \n     current standards. In the future, market conditions may \n     prompt the ERO to impose stricter standards to maintain \n     reliability. In that case, costs for entities that could \n     otherwise elect to disregard NERC standards could increase. \n     CBO cannot predict how or when the ERO might change its \n     standards.\n       Second, the bill would require each system operator (which \n     NERC interprets to be a transmission owner or an independent \n     controller of transmission) to become a member of the ERO and \n     any regional affiliate to which the ERO delegates its \n     authority. The mandate on the system operators to become a \n     member of the ERO and its regional affiliate would impose no \n     significant costs.\n       Third, the bill would direct the ERO and each regional \n     affiliate to assess fees sufficient to cover the costs of \n     implementing and enforcing ERO standards. Those fees would be \n     considered a mandate under UMRA. According to NERC and the 10 \n     current regional reliability councils, NERC and the regional \n     councils collected approximately $45 million in 2000 from \n     U.S. entities for reliability. (Their current budget, \n     including Canadian utilities, is $48 million.) Based on \n     information from NERC, CBO estimates that the newly formed \n     ERO and its regional affiliates would spend anywhere from $75 \n     million to $150 million a year. CBO estimates that the \n     combined annual budget for the ERO and the new regional \n     affiliates would be about $100 million in 2002 (and would \n     grow with inflation), to cover the additional \n     responsibilities created by the bill for compliance, \n     monitoring, and enforcement. However, the bill does not \n     specify who would pay these fees, only that the fees should \n     take into account the relationship of costs to each region \n     and reflect an equitable sharing of those costs among all \n     electric energy consumers.\n       While there is some uncertainty about how fees would be \n     assessed, the most likely scenario is that the ERO and its \n     regional affiliates would assess fees only on its members. \n     This is the current practice of NERC and the regional \n     councils, and NERC expects that ERO would assess fees only on \n     members under S. 2071. In that case, depending on how fees \n     are allocated among members, CBO estimates that of the \n     additional costs of the ERO and regional affiliates ($55 \n     million each\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\n     year), roughly 80 percent to 85 percent would be paid by \n     entities in the private sector and another 10 percent to 14 \n     percent would be paid by state and local government entities. \n     (The remainder would be paid by federally owned entities.)\n       Finally, the bill would preempt the authority of any state \n     to take action to ensue the safety, adequacy, and reliability \n     of electric service if NERC determines that action to be \n     inconsistent with ERO standards. To the extent that states \n     currently have jurisdiction to regulate electric service, the \n     preemption in S. 2071 would be a mandate under UMRA. Based on \n     information from APA and the National Association of \n     Regulatory Utility Commissioners, CBO estimates that this \n     preemption would impose no significant costs on state, local, \n     or tribal governments.\n       Estimate Prepared by: Federal Costs: Lisa Cash Driskill and \n     Kathleen Gramp; Federal Revenues: Mark Booth; Impact on \n     State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Victoria Heid Hall; and \n     Impact on the Private Sector: Gail Cohen.\n       Estimate Approved by: Peter H.

Mr. President, at the time Senate Report No. 106-173 \nwas filed, the Congressional Budget Office report was not available. I \nask unanimous consent that the report which is now available be printed \nin the Congressional Record for the information of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Congressional Budget Office, Pay-as-You-Go Estimate, July 14, 2000\n\n     S. 986--Griffith Project Prepayment and Conveyance Act\n       As cleared by the Congress on July 10, 2000\n       S. 986 would direct the Secretary of the Interior, acting \n     through the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau), to convey the \n     Robert B. Griffith Water Project to the Southern Nevada Water \n     Authority (SNWA). The transfer would occur after the SNWA \n     pays about $112 million to the Bureau to meet its outstanding \n     obligations under an existing repayment contract with the \n     federal government.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 986 would yield a net \n     increase in asset sale receipts of $103 million in 2001, but \n     that this near-term cash savings would be offset by the loss \n     of other offsetting receipts over the 2002-2033 period.\n       CBO's estimate of the impact of S. 986 on direct spending \n     is shown in the following table. The change in outlays \n     resulting from this legislation would fall within budget \n     function 300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                            By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 2000        2001        2002        2003        2004        2005        2006        2007        2008        2009        2010\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays..........................................           0        -103           9           9           9           9           9           9           9           9           9\nChanges in receipts.........................................  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........\nNot applicable\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Based on information from the SNWA and the Bureau, CBO \n     expects that the authority will make the prepayment during \n     fiscal year 2001, and that the formal project conveyance will \n     be completed during fiscal year 2002.\n       S. 986 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to sell \n     the Griffith Project to the SNWA for a one-time payment of \n     about $121 million. The legislation would allow the sales \n     price to be adjusted for any payments made after September \n     15, 1999, and before the project transfer is completed. \n     According to the Bureau, the SNWA has made a payment of about \n     $9 million during fiscal year 2000. Thus, CBO expects a \n     payment of about $112 million to occur during fiscal year \n     2001 and estimates that those receipts would be offset by the \n     loss of currently scheduled repayments of about $9 million a \n     year between 2001 and 2022 and $6 million a year between 2023 \n     and 2033.\n       Under the Balanced Budget Act, proceeds from nonroutine \n     asset sales (sales that are not authorized under current law) \n     may be counted for pay-as-you-go purposes only if the sale \n     would entail no financial cost to the government. Based on \n     information from the Bureau, CBO estimates that the sale \n     proceeds would exceed the present value of the repayment \n     stream currently projected to accrue from the Griffith \n     Project; therefore, selling the project would result in a net \n     savings for pay-as-you-go purposes.\n       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Megan Carroll. \n     This estimate was approved by Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy \n     Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8287-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, all over America, young people are \nback in schools. A record 53 million students are in our classrooms and \nteachers across the country are gearing up to prepare them for the new \nmillennium. In many ways, teachers are doing what they always have at \nthe start of a new school year--they are learning names, starting \ncurriculums, passing out text books and coaching athletic teams. There \nis nothing highly unusual about recent new school years except that \nteachers are more concerned for their safety than they were in the \npast.\n  Over the last few years, the number of high profile school \nshootings--in Jonesboro, Arkansas, Littleton, Colorado, and Mt. Morris \nTownship, Michigan--have changed Americans' perception of safety in \nschool. On the last day of school in Lake Worth, Florida, a 13 year old \nboy allegedly shot and killed his language arts teacher with a .25-\ncaliber handgun he brought to school.\n  Teachers in this country fear what may happen to them in the \nclassroom and for good reason. Listen to this middle school teacher in \nMichigan, who participated in a study conducted by Dr. Ron Astor, an \nassistant professor of\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\nsocial work and education at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \nThe teacher said:\n  ``A lot of us are afraid. You come in the morning and you're just \nafraid to even go to work. You're just so stressed out, because you're \nall tensed up, you can't feel happy and teach like you want to because \nyou've got to spend all of your time trying to discipline. You're \nscared somebody's going to walk in. We keep our doors locked. We have \nto keep our doors locked.'' Middle school teacher. (Meyer, Astor & \nBehre, 2000).\n  Teachers, students, and staff are fearful of the presence of firearms \nin school and those of us who feel strongly about education and school \nsafety feel we must do something to ease their fears. During the last \nfew years, we have continually tried to close the loopholes in our laws \nthat give young people access to firearms. In May of 1999, the Senate \npassed the juvenile justice bill with common sense amendments that \nwould have strengthened our gun laws. After the House passed its \nversion of the bill, the legislation went to a conference committee \nwhere Senators and Representatives were supposed to work out the \ndifferences between their two versions of the bill. Unfortunately, that \nconference committee has met only once and that was more than a year \nago.\n  In the United States, another ten young people are killed by firearms \neach day. Congress must pass sensible gun laws and help keep our \nschools safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8288-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DUQUESNE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PHARMACY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

The school accomplishes this through outcome competency-based \nprograms with an emphasis on appreciation for ethical and spiritual \nvalues. Moreover, the school conveys to students a foundation in the \npharmaceutical, administrative, social and clinical sciences which are \nthe bases for pharmaceutical care and research.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 28 \nindividuals with connections to the State of Michigan who will be \nrepresenting our Nation at the XXVII Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, \nAustralia. While I know that this is a very proud time for them and for \ntheir families, it is also a proud time for all Michiganians, and, on \nbehalf of my constituents, I congratulate these 28 men and women on \nhaving been selected to coach or to compete as part of the United \nStates Olympic Team.\n  I have many hopes for these individuals, Mr. President. My first hope \nis that while in Sydney they will do their best not only to bring home \na medal, but also to enjoy their experience as Olympians. It goes \nwithout saying that it is an incredible honor to be an Olympian, and \nthat these men and women have dedicated a great portion of their lives \nto attaining this goal, and also to winning a medal. I hope they will \nremember, however, that a medal is only one of many things they can \ntake away from their time in Australia.\n  Secondly, Mr. President, I hope that as they compete they do not \nforget the millions and millions of Americans who are offering their \nsupport from the other side of the world. More importantly, I hope they \ndo not forget the nearly 10 million Michiganians, myself included, who \nwill be cheering just a little bit harder than the rest of them.\n  My final hope, Mr. President, is that these 28 Olympians achieve \nabove and beyond the goals they have set for themselves and for their \nteams, whatever these goals might be, and I wish them the best of luck \nin doing so. With that having been said, I ask to print their names, \nhometowns, and the sports they will compete in or coach, in the Record:\n\n       Dave Simon, West Bloomfield, Rowing; Todd Martin, Lansing, \n     Tennis; Steven Smith, Detroit, Basketball; Kate Sobrero, \n     Bloomfield Hills, Soccer; Ann Marsh, Royal Oak, Fencing; \n     Shelia Taormina, Livonia, Triathlon; Nick Radkewich, Royal \n     Oak, Triathlon; Teodor Gheorge, Davison, Table Tennis; Jasna \n     Reed, Davison, Table Tennis.\n       Margo Jonker, Mt.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain irrigation facilities to the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation \nDistrict; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            nampa meridian irrigation district transfer act\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Crapo a bill to authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to transfer the Bureau of Reclamation's interests in portions \nof the Ridenbaugh Canal system of the Boise River to the Nampa Meridian \nIrrigation District. The public comment period for the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act process has not been completed, and it is my \nintent to request a Committee hearing to discuss any issues concerning \nthis transfer. Thus, any parties interested in this matter will have \nample opportunity to express their concerns related to title transfer.\n  The transfer of title is not a new idea. Authority to transfer title \nto the All American Canal is contained in section 7 of the Boulder \nCanyon Project Act of 1928. General authority is contained in the 1955 \nDistribution Systems Loan Act. Recently, Congress passed legislation \ndealing with a transfer to the Minidoka Irrigation Project and the \nBurley Irrigation District.\n  The Nampa Meridian Irrigation District diverts water from the Boise \nRiver into a system of canals and laterals known as the Ridenbaugh \nCanal system for delivery to lands in the district and provides \ndrainage for district lands. Since 1878 when the Ridenbaugh Canal was \nfirst constructed, Nampa Meridian Irrigation District has been \nresponsible for operating and maintaining the delivery and drainage \nsystem, and all project costs have been paid to the federal government.\n  Reclamation's interests consist of only five percent (5%) of the \ncanals, laterals and drains and associated fee title and easements in \ntheir delivery and drainage systems. These segments were constructed \nfor the delivery and drainage of irrigation water. The purposes and \nuses of Reclamation's interests in these segments are to access, \noperate, maintain, and repair Nampa Meridian Irrigation District's \nirrigation and drainage systems. Reclamation has never operated or \nmaintained any portion of the Nampa Meridian Irrigation District's \ndelivery or drainage systems.\n  This project is a perfect example of the federal government \nmaintaining only a bare title, and that title should now be transferred \nto the project recipients who have paid for the facilities and \ninterests of the Nampa Meridian Irrigation District.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nampa and Meridian \n     Conveyance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

and\n       (3) a ``customs simplification'' in 1999 which increased by \n     5 percent tariffs previously set at 0 percent, 10 percent, 20 \n     percent and 30 percent rates;\n       Whereas India's 1999/2000 Budget has further increased the \n     tariff on soda ash to 38.5 percent, making it the highest in \n     the world and creating an impossible trade barrier for \n     individual United States soda ash exporters to overcome in \n     order to remain competitive;\n       Whereas India has erected further barriers to United States \n     soda ash through the imposition of a ``temporary'' order by \n     India's Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission \n     (``MRTPC''), which precludes United States producers from \n     exporting to India through the American Natural Soda Ash \n     Corporation (``ANSAC''), an export trading joint venture \n     which operates in strict accordance with the provisions of \n     the Export Trade Promotion Act of 1917 (15 U.S. Code Sec. 61 \n     et seq.) and the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (15 U.S. \n     Code Sec. 4001 et seq.);\n       Whereas this MRTPC order effectively maintains a complete \n     and total de facto embargo on United States soda ash exports \n     to India;\n       Whereas it appears that the MRTPC order was issued at the \n     behest of Indian soda ash producers solely to protect their \n     local market monopoly, rather than for legitimate reasons;\n       Whereas, since 1995 the United States Trade \n     Representative's (``USTR'') National Trade Estimate Report to \n     Congress has identified India's denial of United States \n     access to its soda ash market as a high priority;\n       Whereas, in January 1999, in response to an ANSAC petition, \n     the USTR initiated a ``country practice'' petition to suspend \n     India's duty-free benefits under the Generalized System of \n     Preferences (``GSP'') program on the grounds that India, by \n     virtue of the foregoing tariffs and orders, fails to provide \n     the United States equitable and reasonable access to its soda \n     ash market;\n       Whereas, on February 14, 2000, U.S. Trade Representative \n     Barshefsky and Secretary of Commerce Daley issued a joint \n     press release concluding that ``U.S. soda ash is being shut \n     out of the Indian market;''\n       Whereas, in March 2000, in apparent response to ANSAC's \n     efforts to open India's soda ash market, the MRTPC issued a \n     ``show cause'' order why ANSAC representatives should not be \n     held in criminal contempt;\n       Whereas the basis for that show cause order were statements \n     made by ANSAC representatives during testimony before the \n     USTR's GSP Subcommittee at a hearing in Washington in March \n     1999, which statements characterized the Indian soda ash \n     market as closed and the actions of the MRTPC as unfair;\n       Whereas, the actions of the MRTPC appear to be designed to \n     ensure that India's market remains closed to United States \n     exports; and\n       Whereas the unfair closure of India's market to United \n     States soda ash exports runs counter to the concepts of fair \n     and free trade and to the interests of India's soda ash \n     consumers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that India's tariffs on \n     United States soda ash exports are excessive and are designed \n     solely to exclude unfairly United States producers from the \n     Indian market;\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\n       (2) the Senate strongly urges President Clinton, the USTR \n     and the Government of India to use the mid-September visit to \n     Washington of India's Prime Minister Vajpayee as an \n     opportunity to address and settle the soda ash dispute by \n     allowing United States soda ash equitable and reasonable \n     access to the Indian market through the ANSAC joint venture \n     at tariff reduced rates consistent with WTO normalization \n     levels; and\n       (3) the Senate calls on the President and the USTR, in the \n     absence of such a settlement, promptly to begin the process \n     of suspending India's GSP benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8293-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Reserving the right to object, we have this afternoon \nreceived the response from one of our Senators who believes this bill \nis very close, but that he has some problems with it. We would, \ntherefore, on behalf of this unnamed Senator, object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me urge Senator Reid and the leadership \nto work with us, if he would talk with that Senator and identify what \nthe problem might be. I know this bill has broad, I think almost \nunanimous, support.\n  I read what the bill does in its title. It would modernize the \nrequirements for manufactured housing construction. This is in the \ninterest of consumers. It will help the industry because it will \nclarify what the standards should be.\n  It is about safety; it is about manufactured housing construction. I \nhave a feeling the problem is not with this bill, that it is an \nunrelated issue. But I hope we can work through the objection and we \nwill come back on Monday or Tuesday of next week, I might say to \nSenator Reid, and see if we cannot get that worked out.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I think it is an important piece of \nlegislation. In Nevada, we depend very heavily on manufactured housing. \nWe will do everything we can to see if we can get this worked out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8293-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3615\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Most of us refer to it as the satellite bill. It \nis the bill that was developed as a result of an agreement last year to \nmake sure that there was some way for these loans to be available so \nsatellites could be put up in space, where those of us in rural States, \nsmaller communities, would have access to these satellites with dishes, \njust like the cities have. This is an effort to keep that commitment.\n  I know Senator Burns has worked very hard on this matter. I think \nSenator Baucus had a part in it. A number of Senators have worked on \nit. I thought this morning at 11:30 we had it cleared. I understand \nthere was some concern that maybe we would use this bill as a vehicle \nfor some other specific bill or bills. This is too urgent. It is too \nimportant to my State and other States such as mine to not get it done. \nSo there will not be any extraneous matter added to this bill. This \nbill will come out of conference clean. If any Senator has any \nreservations about that, if that is why there is an objection, if there \nis one, I assure the Senators and the leadership that that is not going \nto be the way it works.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we be able to take that legislation up \nunder the request I made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are \nreally about 9 months late on that. It is important. We have this board \nin place. It is bipartisan, and I am glad we have gotten it cleared. \nThere are other positions included here where we have Republicans and \nDemocrats, both being cleared.\n  I hope we will use this effort to look at the Executive Calendar and \nsee if there are not other nominations that can be cleared, are \nnoncontroversial or can be matched in terms of partisan divide and \nmaybe even other nominations. I hope we do not just refuse to move any \nnomination at this point. There are people who need to be considered, \nand we will try to work on that. This was a good-faith effort on my \npart and Senator Daschle's part.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it adjourn until the hour of 12 noon on \nMonday, September 11. I further ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, \nthe morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two \nleaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then \nresume debate on H.R. 4444, the China PNTR bill, with the Byrd \namendment regarding subsidies pending to be debated under a previous \norder.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority leader, \nare we going to try to do an appropriations bill next week?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond, we will be working with \nthe chairman and the ranking member on that. Thank goodness, we were \nable to get the energy and water appropriations bill completed. I \nbelieve the DC appropriations bill will not be ready until the week \nafter next. We still have the Commerce-State-Justice and the HUD-VA \nappropriations bills on which we have to make a decision as to which \none will go first. There is a problem with the level of funding, the \ncap on funding. We are going to have to work that out.\n  We are looking next week at, once again, possibly dual tracking with \nthe China PNTR during the day and an appropriations bill at night. The \nprincipal focus next week, I believe, has to be on completing work on \nthe China PNTR bill. We are about halfway there, but we still have, I \nbelieve, about 11 or 12 amendments that have been identified that may \nvery well require votes.\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\n  It appears I will still have to file cloture on Tuesday. I want to do \nwhatever is necessary to try to complete that bill by Friday of next \nweek. It may not be possible, but if it means staying on that bill \nduring the day and night, we will look at that option, and I will \nconsult with the leadership on the other side for the need to do that \nif it appears it is necessary.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to my friend, we keep hearing that 11 \nappropriations bills have not been passed. That is true. But the fact \nis, we have completed action on more than the three bills. Just because \nwe did one last night does not mean we have only done three.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the majority leader, while we are \nworking on PNTR, I would hope that there is a concerted effort to get \nmore money to solve the funding cap. We could work out a lot of these \nin conference. That is what we are waiting to do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. REID. I think the sooner we do that the better off we will be.\n  Mr. LOTT. As the Senator knows, we are hoping that early next week \nthe House will take up the legislative appropriations bill coupled with \nthe Treasury-Postal Department appropriations bill. It would be done in \nsuch a way that both sides find it acceptable. It is my understanding \nthat the administration would sign it. So that would move two bills to \nthe President. We hope to have that acted on in the Senate next week, \nhopefully by Thursday. So if that is done, that would put us then at 10 \nappropriations bills having been acted on by the Senate, leaving only \nthree.\n  I will be working, again, as I said, with the chairman about which we \nwould do next week, the HUD bill or CJS. And I don't know whether the \nHUD bill has come out of committee yet. So we are still working on \nthat. We are still committed to getting through these appropriations \nbills, hopefully getting them all done through the Congress, going into \nconference, and hopefully down to the President before the end of the \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a couple more housekeeping matters.\n  I say to the majority leader, are we going to have any votes Monday?\n  Mr. LOTT. It is possible that we would have votes on Monday. But if \nwe are making good progress--like this week, we didn't force votes on I \nguess it was Tuesday or Wednesday because we had debate, and we were \nable to get on the bill. We were able to get amendments done. But I \nwould say this: If there are votes Monday, it will depend on--we were \nnot able to get work done on amendments to the point where they could \nget a vote today. Votes will not occur before 5:30 or 6 o'clock. We \nwill consult on the time. But it could be that the next votes will not \noccur until Tuesday morning. It just depends on whether we can get one \nracked up and in order.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, Mr. President, I say through you to the majority \nleader, I also hope, in the limited things that you have to do next \nweek, that you would give some consideration to the problems that \nSenator Levin and Senator Harkin have regarding judges. Both of these \nSenators have talked to Senator Daschle and me and are very concerned.\n  I know they have been in conversation with you and Senator Hatch. We \nhope that there can be some progress made on the requests of these two \nfine Senators.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just spent the last few minutes with \nSenator Levin. I understand his interest. The problem they are both \ninterested in is in the Judiciary Committee. We will be working to see \nif anything could be done. It will be very hard at this point. I \nunderstand their interest. I know there is no desire to block the \naction of the Senate at this time. It is going to be difficult, but I \ncertainly am going to listen to them and see what might be done. If we \ncould keep working on it, maybe something can be worked out.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. on Monday, \nSenator Thompson be recognized to offer an amendment to H.R. 4444, and \nthat Senator Helms be recognized at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday to offer an \namendment to the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I really had hoped that we could find a way \nto consider Senator Thompson's amendment, or bill, as a separate issue. \nI worked throughout the month of July to do that. I even tried as late \nas yesterday to have it considered separately. But I was told that \nthere would be an objection to taking it up. Then we would have to file \ncloture under a motion to proceed, and it would take days. If it took \nall that time, it actually could have displaced the China PNTR bill.\n  So I think that Senator Thompson has no option but to offer his \namendment on China PNTR. It is a very serious matter. Chinese nuclear \nweapon proliferation is something about which we have to be concerned. \nAnd I am convinced it continues to this day. We need a way to monitor \nit. And there should be a way to impose sanctions if that continues.\n  So that issue will come up on this bill and we will have to see how \nit works out. I think this is going to be the toughest issue we have to \nface on China PNTR. There is opposition by some for other reasons, but \nthis is one that will test the will of the Senate, I believe, in \ngetting the work completed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, having looked at the votes on this issue, the \nThompson amendment, I think it would be in everyone's interest if this \ncould be worked out so there is a separate vote on this issue, separate \nfrom this legislation. Senator Thompson should know that there are a \nnumber of people who have a basic support for his legislation but would \nvote against it because it is on this legislation. He has worked so \nhard on this, so I hope he can have a separate up-or-down vote on the \nmerits, not complicated by the PNTR issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have spent a lot of time trying to find a way to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/08/senate-section/article/S8295-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
