Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It has been raised whether or not that is a good idea. As \nI understand the unanimous-consent request, it is to the extent \npossible we will try to alternate between Democrat and Republican, \nopponents and proponents. That is the same as saying, with one \nexception, for and against. I do not expect that to mean that we\n\n[[Page S12258]]\n\nwould not engage each other in colloquy and debate so we don't just \nhave statement after statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. That is precisely why I framed it the way I did.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. KYL. It would not be appropriate to say Republican and Democrat, \nsince I know Senator Specter would like to speak not in opposition.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I hope the \nSenator would not put forth any unanimous-consent request. I hope we \nwould simply have an agreement among the two leaders in the Chamber \nthat they will alternate back and forth. The difficulty with a \nunanimous-consent agreement is you may get a circumstance where you \nhave no one on one side and three or four speakers on the other side.\n  I think it is practical to manage it the way the Senator has \nsuggested.\n  Mr. KYL. With the understanding that Senator Biden and I just \nreached, and the Senator just articulated, I withdraw the request, and \nI assume we can proceed in that fashion.\n   Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I strongly oppose the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty that has been submitted to the Senate for \nits advice and consent.\n  I think the words of six distinguished Americans who formerly bore \nthe responsibility for safeguarding our nation's security as Secretary \nof Defense frame the issue before the Senate quite well. In a letter to \nthe majority leader this week, James Schlesinger, Dick Cheney, Frank \nCarlucci, Caspar Weinberger, Donald Rumsfeld, and Melvin Laird who \nserved as Secretaries of Defense in the Reagan, Bush, Ford, and Nixon \nadministrations, stated:\n\n       As the Senate weighs whether to approve the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), we believe Senators will be obliged \n     to focus on one dominant, inescapable result were it to be \n     ratified: over the decades ahead, confidence in the \n     reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile would inevitably \n     decline, thereby reducing the credibility of America's \n     nuclear deterrent.\n\n  For this reason, these former Secretaries of Defense conclude that \nthe CTBT is ``incompatible with the Nation's international commitments \nand vital security interests . . . Accordingly, we respectfully urge \nyou and your colleagues to preserve the right of this nation to conduct \nnuclear tests necessary to the future viability of our nuclear \ndeterrent by rejecting approval of the present CTBT.''\n  I couldn't agree more with the considered judgment of these \ndistinguished Americans who have had the awesome responsibility of \nmaintaining the U.S. nuclear deterrent throughout the cold war and \nbeyond.\n  Before discussing some of the flaws of the CTBT and how it will \nundermine the credibility of our nuclear deterrent, a few words on the \nimportance of nuclear deterrence, and the limits of arms control I \nthink are in order.\n  As my colleagues recall, during the cold war, the Soviet Union \nenjoyed a tremendous advantage in conventional military forces in \nEurope. The United States was able to offset this advantage in \nconventional forces, and to guarantee the security of Western Europe \nuntil the cold war ended peacefully, through the maintenance of a \ncredible nuclear deterrent. Our nuclear ``umbrella,'' as it is called, \nwas extended to our allies in other parts of the world as well.\n  Since the end of the cold war, some have argued that nuclear \ndeterrence is an outdated concept, and the U.S. no longer needs to \nretain a substantial nuclear weapons capability. However, deterrence is \nnot a product of the cold war and has been around since the beginning \nof diplomacy and war. Over 2,500 years ago, the Chinese philosopher Sun \nTzu wrote about the value of deterrence stating, ``To win one hundred \nvictories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue \nthe enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.''\n  Furthermore, the end of the cold war does not mean national security \nthreats to the United States have evaporated. James Woolsey, President \nClinton's first Director of Central Intelligence, aptly described the \ncurrent security environment when he said, ``We have slain a large \ndragon [the Soviet Union]. But we live now in a jungle filled with a \nbewildering variety of poisonous snakes.''\n  Rogue nations like North Korea, Iran, and Iraq have weapons of mass \ndestruction programs and are hostile to the United States. China is an \nemerging power whose relationship with the United States has been rocky \nat best. And Russia retains significant military capabilities, \nincluding over 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads.\n  The gulf war is an excellent case study of the continuing importance \nof nuclear deterrence in the post-cold-war world. In that conflict, the \nmaintenance of a credible nuclear weapons capability, coupled with the \nunderstanding that it was possible that the United States would respond \nwith nuclear weapons if attacked with other weapons of mass \ndestruction, saved lives by deterring such an attack.\n  As my colleagues recall, Iraq possessed a large arsenal of chemical \nweapons that it had used against its Kurdish population, and against \nIranian troops during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. It is widely \nacknowledged that Iraq did not use chemical weapons against the United \nStates-led coalition during the gulf war because we possessed a \ncredible nuclear deterrent.\n  Prior to the start of the gulf war, U.S. leaders practiced the art of \ndeterrence by issuing clear warnings to Saddam Hussein. Secretary of \nDefense Dick Cheney stated:\n\n       He [Saddam Hussein] needs to be made aware that the \n     President will have available the full spectrum of \n     capabilities. And were Saddam Hussein foolish enough to use \n     weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. response would be \n     absolutely overwhelming and it would be devastating. He has \n     to take that into consideration, it seems to me, before he \n     embarks upon a course of using those kinds of capabilities.\n\n  President Bush also sent a strongly worded message to Saddam Hussein \nwhich said:\n\n       Let me state, too, that the United States will not tolerate \n     the use of chemical or biological weapons. . . . The American \n     people would demand the strongest possible response. You and \n     your country will pay a terrible price if you order \n     unconscionable acts of this sort.\n\n  Iraqi officials have confirmed that these statements deterred Baghdad \nfrom using chemical and biological weapons. In 1995, Foreign Minister \nTariq Aziz reported to Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the U.N. commission \ncharged with inspecting Iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities, \nthat Iraq was deterred from using its arsenal of chemical and \nbiological weapons because the Iraqi leadership had interpreted \nWashington's threats of devastating retaliation as meaning nuclear \nretaliation.\n  Aziz's explanation is corroborated by a senior defector, General \nWafic Al Sammarai, former head of Iraqi military intelligence, who \nstated:\n\n       Some of the Scud missiles were loaded with chemical \n     warheads, but they were not used. We didn't use them because \n     the other side had a deterrent force. I do not think Saddam \n     was capable of taking a decision to use chemical weapons or \n     biological weapons, or any other type of weapons against the \n     allied troops, because the warning was quite severe, and \n     quite effective. The allied troops were certain to use \n     nuclear arms and the price will be too dear and too high.\n\n  Mr. President, as these statements show, a credible nuclear deterrent \nremains vitally important to our nation. I would hope that we could \nbegin this debate on the CTBT by agreeing that a strong U.S. nuclear \ndeterrent remains essential and that the Senate should reject any \nactions that would undermine the credibility of this deterrent.\n  To the second preliminary point, the fallacy of arms control:\n  Unfortunately, the CTBT negotiated by the Clinton administration \nwould do just that. This is not surprising since the Clinton \nadministration has sought to protect our national security with a \nfixation on arms control that columnist Charles Krauthammer aptly calls \n``Peace through Paper.''\n  Of course, arms control is not a new idea. After all, in the year \n1139, the Roman Catholic Church tried to ban the crossbow. Like so many \nother well-intentioned arms control measures, this one was doomed to \nfailure from the start.\n  And who can forget the Kellog-Briand treaty, ratified by the United \nStates in 1929, that outlawed war as an instrument of national policy. \nThis agreement and others spawned in its wake left the United States \nand Britain unprepared to fight and unable to deter World War II.\n\n[[Page S12259]]\n\n  Yet despite these and many other notable failures, the Clinton \nadministration still looks to arms control as the best way to safeguard \nour security. Under Secretary of State John Holum explained this \nphilosophy during a speech in 1994, stating.\n\n       The Clinton Administration's policy aims to protect us \n     first and foremost through arms control--by working hard to \n     prevent new threats--and second, by legally pursuing the \n     development of theater defenses for those cases where arms \n     control is not yet successful.\n\n  The administration continues to cling tenaciously to the ABM \nTreaty, which prevents us from defending ourselves against missile \nattack, and numerous other arms control measures have been proposed by \nsenior officials like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, such as \nbans of shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, laser weapons, anti-\nsatellite weapons, landmines, and even a proposal to limit the \navailability of assault rifles.\n\n  As George Will has said of the administration's arms control \nphilosophy, ``The designation `superstition' fits because the faith of \nbelievers in arms control is more than impervious to evidence, their \nfaith is strengthened even by evidence that actually refutes it.''\n  There is enduring wisdom in President Reagan's statement of ``Peace \nthrough strength.''\n  In 1780, our Nation's first President, George Washington said, \n``There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to \nmeet an enemy.'' Two hundred years later another President, Ronald \nReagan, called this doctrine ``Peace Through Strength.''\n  I urge Senators to think about the enduring wisdom of these \nstatements in the coming days as we debate the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty and the negative effects its ratification would have on our \nNation's security.\n  Let me turn now to a discussion of the CTBT's many flaws.\n  America's nuclear weapons are the most sophisticated in the world. \nThis was the point of the letter of the former Secretaries of Defense. \nThey pointed out that each one typically has thousands of parts, and \nover time in nuclear materials and high-explosive triggers in our \nweapons deteriorate, and we lack the experience predicting the effect \nof these changes.\n  Some of the materials used in our weapons, like plutonium, enriched \nuranium, and tritium, are radioactive materials that decay, and as they \ndecay they also change the properties of other materials within the \nweapon. We lack experience predicting the effects of such aging on the \nsafety and reliability of our weapons.\n  We did not design our weapons to last forever. The shelf life of our \nweapons was expected to be about 20 years. In the past, we did not \nencounter problems with aging weapons, because we were fielding new \ndesigns and older designs were retired. But under the CTBT, we could \nnot field new designs to replace older weapons, because testing would \nbe required to develop new designs.\n  Remanufacturing components of existing weapons that have deteriorated \nalso poses significant problems. Over time, manufacturing processes \nwill change, some chemicals previously used in the production of our \nweapons have been banned by environmental regulations, and our \ndocumentation of the technical characteristics of older weapons, in \nsome cases, is incomplete. Furthermore, as James Schlesinger--who \nformerly served as Secretary of defense and Secretary of Energy--has \ntestified to the Senate, the plutonium pits in some of our weapons are \napproaching the end of this life-span. According to Dr. Schlesinger, \none of our national laboratories estimates the pits used in some of our \nweapons will last 35 years. Since many of the pits used in the current \narsenal are about 30 years old, this means that we will soon need to \nreplace these pits. But without testing, we will never know if these \nreplacement parts will work as their predecessors did.\n  As the former Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, \nDr. John Nuckolls said last month in a letter to me:\n\n       Key components of nuclear warheads are ``aging'' by \n     radioactive decay and chemical decomposition and corrosion. \n     Periodic remanufacture is necessary, but may copy existing \n     defects and introduce additional defects. Some of the \n     remanufactured parts may differ significantly from the \n     original parts--due to loss of nuclear test validated \n     personnel who manufactured the original parts, the use of new \n     material and fabrication processes, and inadequate \n     specification of original parts. There are significant risks \n     of reducing stockpile reliability when remanufactured parts \n     are involved in warhead processes where there are major gaps \n     in our scientific understanding.\n\n  The fact is that, despite our technical expertise, there is much we \nstill do not understand about our own nuclear weapons. As C. Paul \nRobinson, Director of the Sandia National Laboratory has aid, ``some \naspects of nuclear explosive design are still not understood at the \nlevel of physical principles.''\n  These gaps in our knowledge do not merely present a theoretical \nproblem. As President Bush noted in a report to Congress in January \n1993, ``Of all U.S. nuclear weapons designs fielded since 1958, \napproximately one-third have required nuclear testing to resolve \nproblems arising after deployment.''\n  Furthermore, in 1987, Lawrence Livermore Lab produced a report titled \n``Report to Congress on Stockpile Reliability, Weapon Remanufacture, \nand the Role of Nuclear Testing'' in which it extolled the importance \nof testing, noting that ``. . . there is no such thing as a `thoroughly \ntested' nuclear weapon.'' The report also goes on to state that of the \none-third of weapons designs introduced into the stockpile since 1958 \nthat have required testing to fix, ``In three-fourths of these cases, \nthe problems were discovered only because of the ongoing nuclear \ntesting.'' This report went on to say that ``Because we frequently have \ndifficulty understanding fully the effects of changes particularly \nseemingly small changes on the nuclear performance, nuclear testing has \nbeen required to maintain the proper functioning of our nation's \ndeterrent.''\n  Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger summed this point up nicely in \n1986 when he said:\n\n       The irreducible fact is that nuclear testing is essential \n     to providing for the safety and security of our warheads and \n     weapons systems. It also is essential if we are to maintain \n     their reliability. This is not a matter of conjecture, but a \n     lesson learned through hard experience. For example, in the \n     case of one nuclear system--the warhead for the Polaris \n     [SLBM]--testing allowed us to fix defects that were suddenly \n     discovered. Until corrected, these defects could have \n     rendered the vast majority of weapons in our sea-based \n     deterrent completely inoperable.\n\n  The importance of testing to the maintenance of any complex weapon or \nmachine cannot be underestimated. As the six former Secretaries of \nDefense noted in this letter opposing the CTBT,\n\n       The history of maintaining complex military hardware \n     without testing demonstrates the pitfalls of such an \n     approach. Prior to World War II, the Navy's torpedoes had not \n     been adequately tested because of insufficient funds. It took \n     nearly two years of war before we fully solved the problems \n     that caused our torpedoes to routinely pass harmlessly under \n     the target or to fail to explode on contact. For example, at \n     the Battle of Midway, the U.S. launched 47 torpedo aircraft, \n     without damaging a single Japanese ship. If not for our dive \n     bombers, the U.S. would have lost the crucial naval battle of \n     the Pacific war.\n\n  The Clinton administration has proposed a program that it hopes will \nreplace actual nuclear tests with computer simulations and a much \ngreater emphasis on science-based experiments. It is called the \nStockpile Stewardship Program. According to the Fiscal Year 2000 \nStockpile Stewardship Plan Executive Overview, released by the \nDepartment of Energy in March this year:\n\n       The overall goal of the Stockpile Stewardship program is to \n     have in place by 2010 . . . the capabilities that are \n     necessary to provide continuing high confidence in the annual \n     certification of the stockpile without the necessity for \n     nuclear testing.\n\n  I support the Stockpile Stewardship Program because it will improve \nour knowledge about our nuclear weapons. But as former Secretary of \nState Henry Kissinger, former National Security Advisor Brent \nScowcroft, and former CIA Director John Deutch said in a letter this \nweek, ``the fact is that the scientific case simply has not been made \nthat, over the long term, the United States can ensure the nuclear \nstockpile without nuclear testing.''\n  First, the Stockpile Stewardship Program faces tremendous technical \nchallenges. As the Director of Sandia National Laboratories, Dr. \nRobinson has said, ``the commercially available and\n\n[[Page S12260]]\n\nlaboratory technologies of today are inadequate for the stockpile \nstewardship tasks we will face in the future. Another hundred-to-\nthousand-fold increase in capability from hardware and software \ncombined will be required.''\n  Dr. Victor Reis, the architect of the stewardship program, said this \nabout it during a speech in Albuquerque:\n\n       Think about it--we are asked to maintain forever, an \n     incredibly complex device, no larger than this podium, filed \n     with exotic, radioactive materials, that must create, albeit \n     briefly, temperatures and pressures only seen in nature at \n     the center of stars; do it without an integrating nuclear \n     test, and without any reduction in extraordinarily high \n     standards of safety and reliability. And, while you're at it \n     downsize the industrial complex that supports this enterprise \n     by a factor of two, and stand up critical new manufacturing \n     processes.\n       This within an industrial system that was structured to \n     turn over new designs every fifteen years, and for which \n     nuclear explosive testing was the major tool for \n     demonstrating success.\n\n  Senior officials at the Department of Energy and our nuclear labs are \ngenerally careful in how they couch their remarks about the Stockpile \nStewardship Program. They typically state that the stewardship program \nis the best approach to maintaining our weapons in the absence of \ntesting. But they are also careful not to guarantee that, despite the \nunquestioned brilliance of the scientists, the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram will succeed in replacing testing.\n  In fact, the Stockpile Stewardship Program has already experienced \nsetbacks. For example, the National Ignition Facility, which is the \nlinchpin of the program, has recently fallen behind schedule and is \nover budget. It still faces a critical technical uncertainty about a \nmajor goal of its design: will it be able to achieve thermonuclear \nignition?\n  Another problem with relying on computer simulation to replace \ntesting is the increased risk of espionage. Former Lawrence Livermore \nNational Lab Director John Nuckolls made this point in his letter to me \nas well: ``Espionage is facilitated when U.S. progress is frozen, and \nclassified information is being concentrated and organized in \nelectronic systems.'' In short, in order to achieve the vast increases \nin computing power required for the stewardship program, much of the \ncomputer code required for the program will be written by hundreds of \npeople at participating universities and colleges--in many cases by \npeople who are not even American citizens.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that a credible nuclear deterrent \nis just too important to put all our eggs in the stewardship basket.\n  In addition to impairing the reliability of our nuclear arsenal, the \nCTBT will prevent us from making our nuclear weapons as safe as they \ncan be. This is extraordinarily important.\n  Nuclear weapon safety has always been a paramount concern of the \nUnited States. Throughout the history of our nuclear weapons program, \nwe have made every effort to ensure that even in the most violent of \naccidents there would be the minimum chance of a nuclear explosion or \nradioactive contamination. The results of such an accident would be \ncatastrophic.\n  That's why President Clinton's Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, \nopposed a test moratorium when he was a Senator. During debate on an \namendment imposing a moratorium on testing, August 3, 1993, then-\nSenator Cohen said,\n\n       A vote to halt nuclear testing today is a vote to condemn \n     the American people to live with unsafe nuclear weapons in \n     their midst for years and years--indeed until nuclear weapons \n     are eliminated. Not just a few unsafe nuclear weapons, but a \n     nuclear stockpile in which most of the weapons do not have \n     critical safety features.\n\n  I digress a moment to note when he was asked about this statement \nthis week, now-Secretary Cohen said, we have replaced those weapons \nwith weapons in our inventory now that are safe.\n  I know defense Secretary Cohen would agree, that is not a correct \nstatement. All of the weapons in our current inventory lack one or more \nof the essential safety features that we have been talking about here.\n  As the Director of Los Alamos National Lab, Dr. Sig Hecker, indicated \nin a letter to me in 1997, ``with a CTBT it will not be possible to \nmake some of the potential safety improvements for greater intrinsic \nwarhead safety that we considered during the 1990 time frame.'' The \nreason is that nuclear tests must be done in many cases to confirm that \nonce new safety features are incorporated, the weapons are reliable and \nstill operate as intended. The CTBT makes it pointless to try to invent \nnew, improved safety features because they could not be adopted without \nnuclear testing. Even worse, the CTBT eliminates the possibility of \nimproving the safety of current weapons through the incorporation of \nexisting, well understood safety features.\n  Safety features include items such as insensitive high explosive and \nfire resistant pits. Insensitive high explosive in the primary of a \nnuclear weapon is intended to prevent the premature detonation of the \nhigh explosive trigger, resulting in a potential nuclear explosion \nshould the weapon be subjected to unexpected stress, like being dropped \nor penetrated by shrapnel or a bullet. Fire resistant pits are intended \nto prevent the dispersal of plutonium resulting in radioactive \ncontamination of an area should the weapon be exposed to a fire, such \nas an accidental blaze during loading of a weapon on an aircraft.\n  Unfortunately, few people know that many of our current weapons do \nnot contain all the safety features that already have been invented by \nour National Laboratories. Only one of the nine weapons in the current \nstockpile incorporates all six available safety features. In fact, \nthree of the weapons in the stockpile--the W78 warhead, which is used \non the Minuteman III ICBM, and the W76 and W88 warheads, which sit atop \nmissiles carried aboard Trident submarines--incorporate only one of the \nsix safety features. Another weapon, the W62 warhead, does not have any \nof the six safety features incorporated into its design.\n  The bottom line is that a ban on nuclear testing prevents us from \nmaking our weapons as safe as we know how to make them and creates a \ndisincentive to making such safety improvements.\n  Mr. President, another point I think is extraordinarily important as \nwe debate this CTBT is that the purpose of the treaty cannot be \nachieved by its ratification. In addition to undermining our nuclear \ndeterrent, as I have just spoken to, the treaty will not achieve its \ngoal of halting nuclear proliferation.\n  Supporters of the treaty say the United States must lead by example, \nand that by halting nuclear tests ourselves, we will persuade others to \nfollow our example. Yet the history of the last eight years shows this \ntheory is false. Since the United States halted testing in 1992, India, \nPakistan, Russia, China, and France have all conducted tests.\n  Furthermore, the CTBT will not establish a new international norm \nagainst nuclear weapons testing or possession. The Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty, the NPT ratified by 185 countries has already \nestablished such a norm. The NPT calls for parties to the treaty, other \nthan the five declared nuclear powers--the United States, the United \nKingdom, Russia, China, and France--to pledge not to pursue nuclear \nweapons programs.\n  Yet North Korea and Iraq, to name two who are parties to the NPT, \nhave, of course, violated it. They have pursued nuclear weapons \nprograms despite their solemn international pledge never to do so. The \nCTBT will not add anything useful to the international nonproliferation \nregime since these nations, in effect, would be pledging not to test \nthe nuclear weapons they have already promised never to have under the \nNPT. So much for the international norm.\n  Nor will the CTBT pose a significant impediment to the acquisition of \nnuclear weapons by rogue nations since, although nuclear testing is \nessential to maintaining the sophisticated nuclear weapons in the U.S. \narsenal today, it is not required to develop relatively simple first-\ngeneration nuclear devices, like those needed or being developed by \nIran and Iraq. For example, the United States bomb dropped on Hiroshima \nwas never tested, and the Israeli nuclear arsenal has been constructed \nwithout testing.\n  Incidentally, the Clinton administration does not dispute this point. \nIn Senate testimony in 1997, CIA Director George Tenet stated:\n\n       Nuclear testing is not required for the acquisition of a \n     basic nuclear weapons capability (i.e. a bulky, first-\n     generation device\n\n[[Page S12261]]\n\n     with high reliability but low efficiency.) Tests using high-\n     explosive detonations only ([with] no nuclear yield) would \n     provide reasonable confidence in the performance of a first \n     generation device. Nuclear testing becomes critical only when \n     a program moves beyond basic designs to incorporate more \n     advanced concepts.\n\n  I believe Director Tenet is absolutely correct, based on the letter \nof the Secretary of Defense that I quoted earlier. We can't afford to \nunderestimate the weapon described by Director Tenet--a ``bulky, first \ngeneration device with high reliability but low efficiency'' is a lot \nlike the bomb we dropped on Hiroshima to change world history. It is a \nstrategic weapon--if North Korea or Iran were able to deploy such a \nweapon, they could--to put it mildly--severely reduce our ability to \nprotect our interests in East Asia or the Persian Gulf. These are \nweapons that would be designed to intimidate and kill large numbers of \npeople in cities, not destroy purely military targets, as the United \nStates weapons are designed to do.\n  Another problem with the CTBT is that it is totally unverifiable. It \ncannot be verified despite the vast array of expensive sensors and \ndetection technology being established under the treaty, so it will be \npossible for other nations to conduct militarily significant nuclear \ntesting with little or no risk of detection. Effective verification \nrequires high confidence that militarily significant cheating will be \ndetected in a timely manner. The United States cannot now, and will not \nin the near future, be able to confidently detect and identify \nmilitarily significant nuclear tests of one kiloton or less by the way, \nthat is roughly 500 times larger than the blast which destroyed the \nMurrah Building in Oklahoma City. We cannot detect a test of that \nmagnitude.\n  What is ``militarily significant'' nuclear testing? Definitions of \nthe term might vary, but I think we'd all agree that any nuclear test \nthat gives a nation information to maintain its weapons or to develop \nnewer, more effective weaponry is militarily significant.\n  In the course of U.S. weapons development, nuclear tests with yields \nbetween 1 kiloton and 10 kilotons have generally been large enough to \nprovide ``proof'' data on new weapons designs. Other nations might have \nweaponry that could be assessed at even lower yields. As we know, crude \nbut strategically significant weapons, like the bomb we dropped on \nHiroshima, don't need to be tested at all. But for the sake of \nargument, let's be conservative and assume that other nations would \nalso need to conduct tests at a level above 1 kiloton to develop a new \nnuclear weapon design.\n  The verification system of the CTBT is supposed to detect nuclear \nblasts above 1 kiloton, so it would seem at first glance that it will \nbe likely that most cheaters would be caught. But look at the Treaty's \nfine print--the CTBT's International Monitoring System will be able to \ndetect tests of 1 kilotons or more if they are nonevasive. This means \nthat the cheater will be caught only if he does not try to hide his \nnuclear test.\n  But what if he does want to hide it? What if he conducts his test \nevasively?\n  It is a very simple task for Russia, China, or others to hide their \nnuclear tests. One of the best known means of evasion is detonating the \nnuclear device in a cavity such as a salt dome or a room mined below \nground. Because it surrounds the explosion with empty space, this \ntechnique--called decoupling--reduces the noise, or the seismic signal, \nof the nuclear detonation.\n  The signal of a decoupled test is so diminished--by as much as a \nfactor of 70--that it will not be possible to reliably detect it. For \nexample, a 1,000-ton hidden test would have a signal of a 14-ton open \ntest. This puts the signal of the illicit test well below the threshold \nof detection.\n  Decoupling is a well-known technique and is technologically simple to \nachieve. In fact, it is quite possible that Russia and China have \ncontinued to conduct nuclear testing during the past 7 years, while the \nUnited States has refrained from doing so. They could have done so by \ndecoupling.\n  There are also other means of cheating that can circumvent \nverification. One is open-ocean testing. A nation could put a device on \na small boat or barge, tow it into the ocean, and detonate it \nanonymously. It would be virtually impossible to link the test to the \ncheater.\n  While evasive techniques are expensive and complex, the costs are \nrelatively low compared to the expense of a nuclear weapons program, \nand no more complicated than weapons design. Further, established \nnuclear powers are well positioned to conduct clandestine testing to \nassure the reliability and undertake at least modest upgrades of their \narsenals. Russia and China do not have good records on compliance with \narms control and nonproliferation commitments. In addition, according \nto the Washington Times, United States intelligence agencies believe \nChina conducted a small underground nuclear test in June and Russia is \nbelieved to have conducted a nuclear test earlier this month. While \nneither country has ratified the CTBT, both have signed the treaty and \nhave promised to adhere to a testing moratorium. Again, so much for the \nnorm.\n  The bottom line is that a determined country has several means to \nconceal its weapons tests and the CTBT is not effectively verifiable.\n  Let me stress here that my assessment is not based on opinions. Our \ninability to verify a whole range of nuclear testing is well-known and \nhas been affirmed by the U.S. Intelligence Community. As the Washington \nPost reported earlier this week, our intelligence agencies lack the \nability to confidently detect low-yield tests. We would be \nirresponsible in the extreme to ratify an unverifiable arms control \ntreaty--especially when that treaty will inevitably reduce our \nconfidence in our own nuclear deterrent.\n  President Clinton's first Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, James Woolsey, summed up the problems with verification of the \ntreaty stating in Senate testimony that,\n\n       I believe that a zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     is extraordinarily difficult, to the point of near \n     impossibility--and possibly to the point of impossibility--to \n     verify from afar.\n\n  In addition to the negative consequences that would result from \ntreaty ratification, I would also point out that this accord is very \npoorly crafted. The CTBT is weakest at its very foundation--it actually \nfails to say what it bans. Nowhere in its 17 articles and 2 annexes are \nthe terms ``nuclear weapon test explosion'' or ``nuclear explosion'' \ndefined or quantified and these are the terms used in the treaty's \nbasic obligations.\n  Acting Under Secretary of State John Holum admitted this point in \nresponses to questions for the record on June 29 of this year stating:\n\n       The U.S. decided at the outset of negotiations not to seek \n     international agreement on a definition of ``nuclear weapon \n     test explosion'' in the Treaty text. The course of \n     negotiations confirmed our judgment that it would have been \n     extremely difficult, and possibly counterproductive, to \n     specify in technical terms what is prohibited by the Treaty.\n\n  May I read that again:\n\n       The course of negotiations confirmed our judgment that it \n     would have been extremely difficult, and possibly \n     counterproductive, to specify in technical terms what is \n     prohibited by the Treaty.\n\n  But another nation might choose to apply a less restrictive \ndefinition and conduct very low-yield testing, what we call \nhydronuclear testing. While the United States interprets the treaty to \nban all nuclear explosives testing--that is why they call it a zero ban \ntest--other nations could conduct very low-yield testing, as I said, \nwhich we could not verify but which they would consider in compliance \nwith the treaty. This so-called hydronuclear testing is very useful to \nnuclear weapons programs by helping improve the understanding of \nfundamental nuclear weapons physics, develop new weapons concepts, \nascertain existing weapons' reliability, and exercise the skills of \nscientists, engineers, and technicians. The nuclear energy released in \na hydronuclear test can be less than the equivalent released by four \npounds of conventional high explosives. This is virtually nothing, and \nsuch a low-yield test would almost certainly escape detection.\n\n  This is where the treaty's vagueness is actually harmful to our \ninterests. Even if we were able to detect it, the nation conducting a \nhydronuclear test could simply argue that it was legal under the \ntreaty. And they would have the historical CTBT negotiating record on \ntheir side. Many drafts of the CTBT\n\n[[Page S12262]]\n\nprior to the Clinton administration allowed for low-yield ``permitted \nexperiments.''\n  The verification regime of the CTBT--centered around the \nInternational Monitoring System, or IMS--will not be able to detect \ntests with far greater yields than hydronuclear tests. These tests can \nbe conducted with virtually no risk of detection by either the IMS \nsystem or U.S. technical means.\n  There is much more to say about this treaty, but I believe I have \noutlined the primary reasons why the only prudent course for the Senate \nis to reject the CTBT. It will jeopardize rather than enhance our \nnational security. It will undermine our vital nuclear deterrent by \njeopardizing the reliability of our nuclear stockpile. It will prevent \nus from making our weapons as safe as they can be. It will not stop \nnuclear proliferation, and it is not verifiable. It is not worthy of \nSenate approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am anxious to respond point by point to \nmy friend. I suggest, to believe his arguments, as the old saying goes, \nrequires the suspension of disbelief. I find them to be well intended \nbut half true. I will be very specific about each one of them, \nbeginning with this notion of the value of deterrence.\n  I find it fascinating, my colleagues talk about these other nations \ncan have a Hiroshima-type bomb and build without testing and that would \nradically affect our security; yet we cannot rely in the future on our \ncertainty of 6,000 sophisticated nuclear weapons in the stockpile. I \nurge my friends to read today's New York Times and Washington Post \nwhere our allies are apoplectic about the fact my colleagues are going \nto reject this treaty.\n  The absolute notion that this idea is--don't let them kid you about \nthis debate, folks, anybody watching this. You do not have to be a \nnuclear scientist to understand. You do not have to be a sophisticated \nforeign policy specialist to grasp what is at stake.\n  Think of it this way when they tell you the security of our nuclear \nstockpile is going to become so unreliable over time, that, as Dr. \nSchlesinger has said and my friend from Arizona has alluded, our \nenemies are going to know we do not have confidence in it and that is \ngoing to embolden them, and our allies such as Germany and Japan are \ngoing to go nuclear because they cannot count on us.\n  That is fascinating. Why did all of our allies sign and ratify this \ntreaty? Why are they apoplectic about the prospect that we will not \nsign this treaty? I ask my colleagues when is the last time they can \nremember the Prime Minister of Great Britain or the President of France \nsaying publicly: My Lord, I hope the Senate doesn't do that.\n\n  You cannot have it both ways. This is an argument that I find \nabsolutely preposterous. Although one can technically make it, it does \nrequire the suspension of disbelief in order to arrive at that \nconclusion.\n  One has to be an incredible pessimist to conclude that the 6,000 \nnuclear weapons configured in nine different warheads are going to \natrophy after spending $45 billion over the next 10 years, and after \nhaving been able to certify without testing for the last 3 years that \nit is in good shape, that some nation is going to say: We got them now, \nguys; I know they don't believe their system is adequate; maybe one of \nthose bombs won't go off, maybe 10 of them, maybe 100 of them, maybe \n1,000 of them, maybe 3,000 of them.\n  We still have 3,000 left. Back when the Senator from Nebraska and I \nwere kids and Vietnam was kicking up, we used to see bumper stickers: \nOne atom bomb can ruin your day.\n  I am going to go into great detail on every point my friend raised \nand talk about, for example, the idea we cannot modernize these weapons \nwhen we find a defect; we cannot deal with them without testing.\n  Dr. Garwin yesterday--one of the most brilliant scientists we have \nhad, who has been involved in this program since 1950--says, you can \nreplace the whole physics package without changing.\n  By the way, I am going to yield to my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  Names are mentioned here: Dr. Robinson, of Sandia; Victor Reis, the \narchitect of the program, whom I spent 2\\1/2\\ hours with the other day. \nThey do not tell you the end of the sentence. The end of the sentence \nis: They both are for this treaty. They both are for this treaty, along \nwith 32 Nobel laureates in physics. I ask unanimous consent that the \nlist be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 A Letter From Physics Nobel Laureates\n\n     To Senators of the 106th Congress:\n       We urge you to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       The United States signed and ratified the Limited Test Ban \n     Treaty in 1963. In the years since, the nation has played a \n     leadership role in actions to reduce nuclear risks, including \n     the Non-Proliferation Treaty extension, the ABM Treaty, \n     STARTs I and II, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     negotiations. Fully informed technical studies have concluded \n     that continued nuclear testing is not required to retain \n     confidence in the safety, reliability and performance of \n     nuclear weapons in the United States' stockpile, provided \n     science and technology programs necessary for stockpile \n     stewardship are maintained.\n       The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is central to future \n     efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. Ratification \n     of the Treaty will mark an important advance in uniting the \n     world in an effort to contain and reduce the dangers of \n     nuclear arms. It is imperative that the CTBT be ratified.\n\n         Philip W. Anderson, Princeton University, 1977 Nobel \n           Prize; Hans A.

Mr. President, this idea that the stockpile is not going \nto be reliable, that you can't--we have thousands of parts, and the \nRussians have missiles with bombs with only 100 parts, and that has \nsome significance. I have said it before.\n  I will yield now. I used to practice law with a guy named Sidney \nBalick--a good trial lawyer. Every time he would start a jury trial, he \nwould start off by saying: I want you to take a look at my client. I \nwant you to look at him. They're going to tell you he's not such a good \nlooking guy. He's not. They're going to tell you you would not want to \ninvite him home for dinner to meet your daughter. I wouldn't either. \nThey're going to tell you--and he would go on like that. But he would \nsay: I want you to keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on the \nball. Follow the bouncing ball. Did he kill Cock Robin? That is the \nquestion.\n  The question is, At the end of the day, if we reject this treaty, are \nwe better off in terms of our strategic interest and our national \nsecurity or are we better off if we accept and ratify the treaty that \nall our allies have ratified? Which is better? Keep your eye on the \nball.\n  I will respond, as I said, in due time to every argument my friend \nhas made, from ``the safety features argument'' to ``the purpose can't \nbe achieved'' to ``nations that don't have sophisticated weapons are \ngoing to be able to cheat,'' and so on and so forth. But in the \nmeantime, out of a matter of comity, which is highly unusual, because I \nshould do a full-blown opening statement, I will yield to my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania because he has other commitments. Then I will come \nback to a point-by-point rebuttal of the statement by my friend from \nArizona.\n  How much time is the Senator seeking?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think I can do it in 20 minutes. It might take a \nlittle longer.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It can't take any longer. I will yield 20 minutes to the \nSenator.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Patrick Cottrell be able to be on the \nfloor for the remainder of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Delaware for yielding me time \nat this time.\n  Mr. President, this debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may \none day be classified as a historic debate. The issue which is being \nframed today, in my opinion, is the most important treaty issue, \ninternational issue which has faced this Senate since the Treaty of \nVersailles, which was rejected by the Senate, setting off an era of \nisolationism and, for many, enormous international problems resulting \nin World War II.\n  It is my hope this treaty will be ratified. I do not expect it to be \nratified in a vote on Tuesday because the picture is clear that there \nare not enough Senators to provide the two-thirds constitutional \nbalance. But it is my hope before that scheduled vote arises on Tuesday \nthat we will have worked out an operation to defer the vote on this \ntreaty.\n  I agree with my distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, \nthat a nuclear deterrent is vital for the national security of the \nUnited States. When he cites the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as being \nnegotiated by the Clinton administration--really an idea of the Clinton \nadministration--I would point to the statements of President Eisenhower \nmore than 40 years ago when he articulated the national interest in a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty.\n  In a speech on August 22, 1958, President Eisenhower said this:\n\n       The United States . . . is prepared to proceed promptly to \n     negotiate an agreement with other nations which have tested \n     nuclear weapons for the suspension of nuclear weapons tests. \n     . . .\n\n  In a very succinct statement in a letter to Bulganin, on January 12, \n1958, President Eisenhower said:\n\n       . . . that, as part of such a program which will reliably \n     check and reverse the accumulation of nuclear weapons, we \n     stop the testing of nuclear weapons, not just for two or \n     three years, but indefinitely.\n\n  It is hard to give a more emphatic bipartisan flavor than President \nEisenhower's specific statements.\n  When the Senator from Arizona cites a list of six preeminent former \nSecretaries of Defense, I say that is, indeed, impressive. I would look \nto the assurances which we have today from Gen. Hugh Shelton, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense, \nWilliam Cohen, in analyzing the two basic issues which have been set \nforth in the parameters by Senator Kyl. And they are: Can we assure \nstability of our stockpile? Can we reasonably verify compliance by \nothers?\n  There is a balance of risks. There is no test which will be absolute \nin its terms. But the essential question on balancing the risks and \nbalancing the judgment is whether we would be better off with the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty or without it.\n  The United States has an enormous lead on nuclear weapons. We have \nthe nuclear deterrent. We have seen other nations--India and Pakistan--\nstarting the test process. We have reason to be gravely concerned about \nNorth Korea's capacity with nuclear weapons. We worry about rogue \nnations such as Iraq, Iran, Libya, and others. So that, at least as I \nassess the picture, on a balance of risks, we are much better off if we \nlimit testing than if we proceed to have testing.\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program, I think, is reasonably effective. \nIs it perfect? No, it is not. The issue of verification, I think, is \nreasonably effective. It does not get some of the low-yield weapons. \nAnd activities are underway to try to solve that.\n  Secretary of Energy Richardson was in Moscow within the past week \nworking with the Soviets on the so-called transparency test--\nillustrative of one of the efforts among many being undertaken to \nnarrow the gap on verification. But again, it is a matter of balancing \nthe risks. With or without the treaty, where are we better off?\n  I had an occasion to talk to Gen. Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, earlier this week. I asked General Shelton the details \nof these questions, about the stability of our nuclear stockpile and \nthe verification procedures. General Shelton said that we were in good \nshape on both issues.\n  Then I asked General Shelton the obvious question: Was his view, was \nhis judgment colored to any extent by being in the administration of \nPresident Clinton as President Clinton's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff? It is not unheard of for even four-star generals to be a \nlittle concerned about what the Commander in Chief might prefer. \nGeneral Shelton looked me in the eye and said: Senator, these are my \nhonest views. If they weren't, I wouldn't state them; and rather than \nstate views I didn't believe in, I could always retire.\n  I had occasion to talk at some length with Secretary of Defense \nWilliam Cohen. It is true, as the Senator from Arizona outlines, at one \npoint then-Senator Cohen had a different view. And as Secretary Cohen \ntestified in hearings this week, a number of factors have led him to a \ndifferent conclusion.\n  The question might also be raised as to whether the Commander in \nChief of the Secretary of Defense might color, to some extent, his \nviews. I am satisfied that Bill Cohen, with whom I worked in this body \nfor some 16 years, would not put America at risk if he didn't believe \nwhat he said, that this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, balancing all \nconsiderations, was appropriate.\n  Once moving beyond the study of the treaty, which I have done, having \nannounced my support for the treaty some time ago, after study and \nafter looking at some of the experts, the question, in my judgment, is \nessentially a political question. I believe the lessons of history \nsupport arms control. That is a view I have held for some time.\n  I started my own personal studies of the United States-Soviet \nrelations as a college senior, majoring in international relations at \nthe University of Pennsylvania, and wrote my college thesis on United \nStates-U.S.S.R. relations. One of the first resolutions I offered, \ncoming to the Senate in early 1982, was a resolution for arms control. \nIn 1982, Senators were pretty well lined up on philosophical grounds, \nthose who favored arms control and those who did not favor arms \ncontrol.\n  I recall that as a very tough debate against the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, John Tower. Who\n\n[[Page S12265]]\n\nis Arlen Specter to tell the President what to do in pushing for a \nsummit agreement? Senator Tower put me through the paces, so to speak, \nand we talked about our nuclear deterrence.\n  Fortunately, I had been to Grand Forks, ND, taken a look at the \nMinuteman silo, absolutely terrified to see that enormous missile, \nlooked down; about 100 feet into the ground it went. I had gone to \nCharleston, SC, to take a look at our nuclear submarines. I had been to \nEdwards Air Force Base to take a look at some of our latest bombers. \nThe Senate decided with my position, on a vote of 90-8, we ought to \nhave a summit. President Reagan was a major proponent of arms control, \nand President Reagan then pushed the summit concept. So the idea of \narms control is not an idea which has originated with President \nClinton, with President Eisenhower, President Reagan foursquare behind \nit.\n  I have not hesitated to buck the arms control concept if I thought \nthe United States had some technical advantage to be gained by stepping \nout on our own, if that would promote our national security. Attending \nthe Geneva arms control talks in the mid-1980s, I became persuaded that \nthe Strategic Defense Initiative was a sound proposition, though very \ncontroversial, that turned on our ability to develop the SDI, the \nStrategic Defense Initiative, as to whether the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty was subject to the broad interpretation or the narrow \ninterpretation.\n  There were some very heated debates on the floor of the Senate. \nSenator Moynihan was involved. Senator Nunn, a leading expert in the \nentire field, argued very strenuously for the narrow interpretation of \nthe Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. I argued for the broad \ninterpretation, which I thought was legitimate, because it would give \nleave to develop the strategic arms initiative. That was a complex \nissue. Many people said it was Star Wars, spy in the sky, couldn't be \ndone.\n  I recollected, historically, that Vanevar Bush, a leading expert in \nthe field, testified before Congress during World War II, actually in \n1945, that it would be ``impossible to develop intercontinental \nballistic missiles.'' Fanciful as it may have been in 1945, we now know \nthey have been developed.\n  Then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara said, in 1945, that the \nUnited States had such a tremendous lead, the Soviets could never catch \nus. He was wrong, too. They caught us and surpassed us. We know the \nstory that is not apocryphal, that a clerk in the Patent Office \nresigned at the turn of 19th century because there was nothing new to \nbe discovered. I agreed with President Reagan's vision on the Strategic \nDefense Initiative that we spent a lot of money on it, and I don't \nthink the money was wasted because we still are working and, more \nrecently, with some success on missile defense.\n\n  In that context, President Reagan had an idea for control. President \nReagan spoke out about sharing what we would learn with the Soviets to \ngive them our defense system so there would not be an imbalance, so the \nnuclear deterrence on both sides, that balance of power, would not be \naffected.\n  I had occasion to have a long discussion with President Reagan on \nSeptember 17, 1987, the 200th anniversary of the signing of the \nConstitution of the United States. President Reagan went to my \nhometown, Philadelphia. We had a long plane ride and a fair-sized car \nride. I asked the President how he could see to it that the Soviet \nUnion had our secrets when it really wouldn't be a matter during his \nPresidency and really it is a matter up to Congress. Candidly, \nPresident Reagan had no absolute answer to that point. But it was his \nvision that we would have the Strategic Defense Initiative and that we \nwould share it with the Soviet Union.\n  When we take a look at the specifics and the technicalities, my sense \nis, there are reasonable assurances but it is a matter of balancing the \nrisks.\n  We had a remarkable closed session of 5 hours in S-407 upstairs, \nwhich is the room where we have our secret briefings. After 5 hours, \nthere was no doubt that it is a complicated subject. The distinguished \nchairman of the Arms Services Committee, Senator Warner, came to the \nRepublican luncheon caucus on Tuesday and said there is an adequate \nrecord to assure a negative vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nI later had a chance to discuss with my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia the converse question. May the Record show he is on the floor \nnow; nothing behind his back.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, no, indeed; I am right here. At such point \nas the Senator will entertain a question, I will be happy to put it to \nmy colleague.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We may come to that.\n  I will repeat the assurances that Senator Warner gave me, that while \nhe said there was an adequate record for a negative vote, he also said \nthere was an adequate record for an affirmative vote, depending on how \none looked at the evidence. So my view is, it comes down to a judgment \ncall. It comes down to an issue which is essentially a political \nquestion as to how the national security of the United States is better \nserved by relying on our superiority today and stopping other nations \nfrom achieving superiority.\n  I believe the United States would be well advised to move ahead to \nratify this treaty and to show the world we still have a preeminent \nrole of world leadership in moral terms as well as in armament terms.\n  We have the unprecedented event just this morning, where we have the \nop-ed piece appearing in the New York Times with the Prime Minister of \nBritain, the President of France, Chancellor of Germany, all urging \nthis Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty.\n  I had occasion to travel to Ukraine in August; I talked to the \nPresident of Ukraine, Foreign Minister, and other ranking officials. \nThe ratification of the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty was high on their \nagenda. Ukraine has taken a unique attitude in giving up nuclear \nweapons. Many nations around the world seek nuclear weapons as a sign \nof their national power. Ukraine is prepared to give them up. I asked \nthe leader of that country why. President Kuchma responded: Well, we \nprefer the Japanese model of economic strength. Also, we have had the \nterrible experience at Chernobyl, and we do not want to have nuclear \nweapons for fear of what happened at Chernobyl. But high on the agenda \nof the Ukraine top officials is ratification by the United States.\n  Senator Hank Brown and I had occasion to travel to the subcontinent \nin 1995. We talked to Indian Prime Minister Rao.\n  He told us that he would be very interested in seeing the \nsubcontinent nuclear free. A day or two later, we were in Pakistan \ntalking to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and we related to Prime \nMinister Bhutto what Premier Rao had to say. She said, ``Did you get it \nin writing?'' We thought it was a little flip, perhaps.\n  We said, ``No,'' and countered with, perhaps, an equally flip \nquestion: ``When was the last time you talked to the Prime Minister of \nIndia?'' She said, ``We don't talk.'' Senator Brown and I said, ``Well, \nwe think you should.''\n  The next day, August 28, we had departed for Damascus. Senator Brown \nand I sent a letter to the President urging him to call into the Oval \nOffice the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Pakistan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 28, 1995.\n     The President\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your \n     personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator \n     Hank Brown and I have had in the last two days with Indian \n     Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto.\n       Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested \n     in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen \n     years including renouncing first use of such weapons. His \n     interest in such negotiations with Pakistan would cover \n     bilateral talks or a regional conference which would include \n     the United States, China and Russia in addition to India and \n     Pakistan.\n       When we mentioned this conversation to Prime Minister \n     Bhutto this morning, she expressed great interest in such \n     negotiations. When we told her of our conversation with Prime \n     Minister Rao, she asked if we could get him to put that in \n     writing.\n       When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last \n     talked to Prime Minister Rao, she said that she had no \n     conversations with him during her tenure her tenure as\n\n[[Page S12266]]\n\n     Prime Minister. Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had \n     initiated a contact through an intermediary but that was \n     terminated when a new controversy arose between Pakistan and \n     India.\n       From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime \n     Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United \n     States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     systems.\n       I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment. I \n     am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. There is great power in the Oval Office. No one declines \nan invitation to the Oval Office--at least, I don't know of anybody who \nhas declined an invitation to the Oval Office. I had occasion to speak \nto the President about it later in 1995, and he said he thought it was \na good idea, but he wanted to defer it until after the 1996 election. I \ntalked to him after the 1996 election, and he said he still wasn't \nready to do it, and what would happen with China and India.\n  I am not going to criticize the President for not calling them in. I \nhope he will yet. But I think when India and Pakistan tested nuclear \nweapons in the spring of 1998, it was a very dangerous sign for the \nworld. How can the United States ask India and Pakistan not to test \nnuclear weapons when we won't ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty? \nIt simply doesn't make any sense. And that is why I think the national \nsecurity of the United States would be enhanced on a balance of risks. \nIt may not be perfect on verification, or it may not be perfect on the \nstability of our stockpiles, but whatever risk is involved there, I \nbelieve it is minimal. It is a small risk compared to having India and \nPakistan test nuclear weapons and set off an arms race there that can \nbe duplicated around the world.\n  The failure of the United States to ratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban \nTreaty has caused a ripple around the world. People wonder why the \nUnited States has not ratified this treaty. But if the Senate were to \nreject the treaty on a Senate vote, there would be a wave around the \nworld, and it would be a tidal wave. What is now a ripple of wonderment \nwould turn into a tidal wave of disbelief and could cause a chain \nreaction, which would be----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 20 minutes yielded to the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. With great pleasure. We are listening and learning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will ask for an additional minute on our \nside, to be charged to our time, to ask a question of my good \ncolleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The entire debate is evenly divided. There are \nmany hours on each side.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I think the Senator from Virginia will have all the \ntime he wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania may continue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. To repeat my last thought, which might have been lost in \nthe UC request, the failure of the United States, up to date, to ratify \nthe Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty has caused a ripple of wonderment. A \nvote by the Senate rejecting the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty would \ncause a tidal wave of astonishment. It might set off a chain reaction \naround the world, which would be even more serious than the chain \nreaction of the atomic bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima.\n  When we take a look at what is scheduled for next Tuesday, where we \nhave the vote, it is my hope that we will find a way yet to work our \nway out of the unanimous consent request. I believe that a vote of \nrejection on Tuesday--and I have used this word before, and I use it \nadvisedly, but I think it is accurate--I think rejecting the treaty \nwould be catastrophic.\n  We are in a situation where our distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Lott, is unwilling to defer the vote if he is going to have to \nface a crescendo of demands during next year. Senator Lott did not want \nto schedule the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty vote at this time. I know \nbecause I had asked him to do so. I had asked him to do so in private \nconversations. When he had given me his reasons, I awaited his \njudgment. There was substantial urging, maybe even agitation, maybe \neven goading on the Senate floor by some that Senator Lott should \nschedule this vote. He finally responded to it. He responded to it in a \ncontext where the treaty is assured to be defeated.\n\n  President Clinton held a dinner last Tuesday evening, which was \nattended by a number of people here, including Senators Warner, Biden, \nHagel, myself, and others. I think it is fair to comment, as it has \nbeen in the media.\n  The President declined to ask that the vote be deferred on the \ncondition that the President not ask that it be taken up all during the \nyear 2000. I think the President felt that would signify backing off, \nand he thought some events might develop where he had to call for the \ntreaty to be ratified. He said, candidly, he would have a hard time \nexplaining it to our allies.\n  Well, I can understand Senator Lott not wanting to see this matter \nbecome a political football in the year 2000. It has that potential, \nwhether the parties intend it or not. If there is a crescendo of demand \nfor the treaty to be ratified, taken up in the spring, fall, or summer \nof next year, it could have an affect on the election in 2000. I think \nit is realistic to take it out of the election.\n  Senator Levin, the distinguished ranking member of Armed Services, \nmade a public comment in the hearings that he thought the treaty should \nnot come up for ratification before the election. I think that is a \nsound judgment. There may be a way out of that dilemma by scheduling \nthe treaty debate and vote on November 15 of the year 2000. That will \ntake it out of the election cycle and it would allow President Clinton, \nwho has advocated the treaty, to be a spokesman and have it decided on \nhis watch.\n  There is another alternative, which is not as good as doing it in \nNovember of 2000, but that would be to schedule the debate and vote \nbetween January 3 and January 20 of 2001. We would not have a lame duck \nSenate, and it would be out of the election cycle.\n  I think it is very important to take this treaty out of politics and \nout of partisanship. There is an overhang that we should not ignore--a \npartisan overhang to this debate. All 45 Democrats are said to be in \nfavor of the treaty. The number of Republicans is unknown precisely, \nbut very, very limited. That is bad for America and that is bad for the \nworld. When we had the vote on the use of force in the Gulf in January \nof 1991, it was largely partisan, where 42 Republicans and only 10 \nDemocrats backed a Republican President. When we had a vote on the use \nof airstrikes in Yugoslavia earlier this year, it was 58 to 41. Only 17 \nof 55 Republicans joined the Democrats. That partisanship is highly \nundesirable.\n  I ask for one additional minute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will do that. We have 7 hours of debate, \nand we have 31 people. This is the last minute, and not one second \nover. I love him, but I will object.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Love doesn't last very long if it is only up to a \nminute.\n  I think there ought to be a recognition of another problem, which I \nwill state in 20 seconds. There is a certain lack of trust between \nCapitol Hill and the White House, and that is a fact that we have to \ntake into account in our calculations. Within 20 seconds, I can't \nrecount why.\n  In conclusion--the two most popular words in any speech--I think we \nought to avoid playing nuclear roulette with the Comprehensive Test-Ban \nTreaty. Russian roulette is a great sport, played with a revolver in \nwhich one chamber has the bullet.\n\n  But I think in this matter, we are playing with nuclear roulette if \nwe go to a vote next Tuesday and reject this treaty.\n  I urge my colleagues to work hard to find a way to debate and vote \nthis issue at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on the time allocated to those in \nopposition, I want to ask my good friend a question.\n  First, we joined this institution at about the same time a number of \nyears\n\n[[Page S12267]]\n\nago. I very much respect the Senator. So much of the Senator's career \nhas been devoted to international relations, and he reflects very \nwarmly one of the great teachers he had, and that was Senator Tower, \nformer chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  But I want to go back to a particular reference that the Senator made \nin his opening remarks to the support by the uniformed officers of the \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs and others for this treaty. It is true \nthat there is a division of opinion between the Joint Chiefs. I don't \nspeak in terms of those in opposition today, but I mean those who \nprecede.\n  We have letters on both sides pointing out how men and women of good \nconscience--men and women who have had extensive experience in these \nfields--are different on this treaty. But the question I put to my good \nfriend relates to the President's letter of transmittal of this treaty \non September 22, 1997. I am reading from that document which \naccompanied the treaty to the Senate. There is a provision in there \ncalled ``the safeguards.''\n  I recite a sentence of that.\n\n       The understanding that if the President of the United \n     States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Energy (DOE)--advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, \n     and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command--that a high \n     level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear \n     weapon type that the two Secretaries consider to be critical \n     to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the \n     President, in consultation with the Congress, would be \n     prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard \n     ``supreme national interests'' clause in order to conduct \n     whatever testing might be required.\n\n  Speaking for myself--and I have in the course of the last several \ndays as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee dealt extensively with \nthis entire issue before the Senate today--I have time and time again \nreferred to the fact that it is my conclusion, drawn from talking with \na number of these senior military officers who have given their \nsupport, and who in years past have given their support, that it is \nthis clause that is the foundation for their opinion of support.\n  But I say to my good friend that were we to ratify this treaty, and \nif it would go into force, then many nations could rely on the act of \nthe United States--as a matter of fact, one of the principal reasons \nfor this treaty is to induce other nations to follow--and then 8, 10, \nor 15 years down the road we exercise the right under this, what \nhappens to those nations? They are left out there stripped of \nprotection that they could, with their own systems, have developed. \nAnd, worse yet, if we were ever compelled to announce to the world that \nwe have concern about the credibility and safety of our nuclear \narsenal, that would send a frightening message across the land that \nwhat we have had in place these 50 years, referred to as the ``nuclear \numbrella,'' which umbrella preserved the peace from major conflict in \nEurope for 50 years, is now in doubt.\n  Mr. President, as you talk about who is supporting the treaty, let's \ngo back and examine the reasons.\n  I say that the military relied very heavily on that clause. In my \njudgment, if that clause were ever utilized, this country would be in a \nfar worse position than if the Senate were to exercise its right and \nwithhold the advice and consent on ratification.\n  I ask my good friend, if that clause were invoked, what would be the \nreality among the world's community of nations? What would be the \nreality of the signal going out that our credible deterrent is in \nquestion?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am delighted to respond to that \nquestion from the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee on a number of levels.\n  First of all, the clause is there, so that when the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs and others support the treaty because of the presence of \nthat clause, that is a very important factor. And that clause is worth \nrelying upon.\n  That is the reason, if there should be a problem either with the \nstability of our stockpile, or with the verification, and we felt it \nwas necessary for national security to invoke that clause and withdraw, \nthat we would do so.\n  With respect to other nations which might ratify the treaty based on \nour leadership, they do so with the full knowledge that that clause is \npresent, and that we have the right to withdraw in our supreme national \ninterest, so that if we should exercise the right of this entire affair \nin our dealings with those nations because they have known from the \nvery outset that is a distinct possibility, there is nothing hidden \nabout that.\n  When you ask the pointed question at the very end of the series of \nimplicit questions, when you ask the question, how would it look for \nour national security if we made a concession that we had a test, and \nwithdrew from the treaty, I would say to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Virginia that is no worse than if we did not have the treaty and \nwe started to test.\n  The only reason we would exercise that clause and withdraw from the \ntreaty would be so that we could start to test.\n  Assume that we don't have the treaty. Assume down the road that we \nstart to test. That is going to be a loud signal, an explosive signal, \nto the world that we are not satisfied with the status quo when we have \nto test.\n  I think that exercising that clause would be no more emphatic or no \nmore of a problem for the United States than not doing so.\n  But I think when you take a look behind General Shelton, and other \nChairmen of the Joint Chiefs--General Shalikashvili, Colin Powell, \nDavid Jones, Bill Crowe, only Admiral Vessey, Chairman Vessey, was on \nthe other side.\n  I think that is a very weighty consideration.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply focus your attention on one or \nmore nations, should this treaty be ratified, saying there is no \nnecessity for us to launch our own program because there stands the \nUnited States, the leader. And nowhere in the history of the United \nStates have we ever exercised such a clause as this, I say to my good \nfriend. I don't think there is a precedent in our 200-year history of \never pulling out. But, nevertheless, we could be faced with those \nfacts. Otherwise, there would have been no reason to have put that \nclause in there.\n  It was a real situation to the President at that time in transmitting \nthe treaty to the Senate that these conditions could arise, and he put \nthat clause in. I daresay it was put in there such as the military \nuniformed community could lend their support.\n  But what happens to that nation that did not start this program and \n10 or 12 years hence is left out there? Take, for example, Japan. It \nhas the capacity to generate a program in a matter of a few years. They \nhave relied in many respects on our nuclear deterrent. But if that is \never put in doubt, that nation and others would want to start this \nprogram. But it would take a decade for them--perhaps not Japan but \nmost nations--to put into place any credible nuclear deterrent.\n  I say to my good friend--I know other Senators want to speak; it is \nimportant, and we are going to have a good debate today--in my opinion, \nyou jeopardize substantially the world community if at any time you say \nwe might pull out pursuant to that clause.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond briefly, I think that \nJapan is well advised to rely on the United States and our nuclear \ndeterrent for whatever risk there may be of pulling out. But Japan has, \nup to the present time, as the Senator from Virginia knows, relied upon \nthe United States. Japan has had ample opportunity to develop whatever \nnuclear system they could have wanted. They have made the decision to \nthe present time not to. There is no reason to believe they are about \nto change, regardless of what the United States does.\n\n  However, when we talk about the withdrawal provision, that is not \nunique to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We have debated repeatedly \non the floor of this Senate the provisions of the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty which allows withdrawal on notice--again, for supreme \nnational interests. So the insertion of this clause in the treaty is no \nsignal that we are considering using it. I think that is a standard \nprovision.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in fairness to other Senators, we must \nyield the floor. However, I hope at some point this issue is revisited \nwith my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S12268]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 2 minutes, and then I yield to my friend \nfrom New York.\n  First, the very essential safeguards the chairman indicated all \nmilitary guys want, I find it fascinating that the Republican \nleadership would not allow the Senate to include those in the treaty. \nThat indicates what a stacked deck this is and how outrageous is this \napproach of how we are proceeding on this is.\n  The very things all the Joint Chiefs and the President of the United \nStates said they wanted in the treaty as the six safeguards when we \nbrought this up in the unanimous consent agreement, we were not allowed \nto include those as part of the treaty. I think that is telling.\n  The second point. The Senator says, Have we ever exercised this \nclause? The appropriate question is, Have we ever needed to? The answer \nis, we have never concluded we needed to. Such a clause, or a \nvariation, is in every treaty the United States of America signs. This \nis a bit of a red herring. In every treaty we sign of consequence \nrelating to our national security, there is a supreme national interest \nclause. The reason we haven't exercised it is that no President has \nconcluded there was a need.\n  The third point I make, if my friend is concerned--as I know he is--\nabout our friends at one point not being able to rely upon the United \nStates and deciding to go their own route, I ask him why Tony Blair and \nJacques Chirac are making a personal appeal to the President of the \nUnited States, for goodness sake, pass this treaty. Japan and Germany \nare saying please, please, pass a treaty. We signed it; we ratified it.\n  How much time does the Senator from New York require?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to yield 20 minutes to my friend from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, to continue on the point made by our \ndistinguished ranking member that the leaders of Britain, France, and \nGermany are appealing to the Senate this very day to sign this treaty, \nI make a point to the Senate which I don't know has ever been made. \nThat is that in the aftermath of the Cold War we find ourselves the one \nnation on Earth that has the power to shape events all over the Earth.\n  Coral Bell, of the Australian National University, wrote about this \nin an article in the recent issue of ``The National Interest,'' called \n``American Ascendancy.'' There is a striking passage. She writes:\n\n       During the 1990s, the United States has mostly tiptoed \n     through the current unipolar structure of the society of \n     states with a sort of ponderous tact, like a benign \n     Ferdinand-type bull making its way delicately around a china \n     shop of unknown value. That prudence has been well justified: \n     the situation is still quite new and of uncertain import to \n     all the world's policymakers. History is not much help, for \n     no equal degree of unipolarity has existed since the high \n     point of the Roman world, almost two millennia ago.\n\n  I repeat, there has been no such unipolarity since the high point of \nthe Roman world, two millennia ago.\n\n       The central balance of power had seen the main agenda of \n     world politics for more than five centuries.\n\n  We think of the Congress of Vienna of 1815, of the British role in \nthe balance of power in Europe, and such the like.\n\n       Bell continues, ``. . . this `intermission,' even for a \n     time whose length remains a matter of speculation, is a truly \n     transformatory event.''\n\n  A truly transformatory event. Nothing such has happened in two \nmillenia.\n  As if evidence were required, in this morning's New York Times, \nJacques Chirac, the President of France, and Tony Blair, Prime Minister \nof Britain, and Gerhard Schroeder, Chancellor of Germany, wrote an op-\ned article pleading with the Senate to ratify this treaty. I ask \nunanimous consent to have that article printed after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. At any time in our history, can anyone imagine the \neffective heads of the Governments of the United Kingdom, France, and \nGermany pleading with the Senate in our own press to do what we had led \nthe world to do in the first place.\n  The point has been made that the idea of a Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty was first proposed by President Eisenhower in 1958. I note that \nwhen we finally got around to drafting one, the United States was the \nfirst signatory on that same day in New York. The other four of the \nfive declared nuclear powers also signed. However, we were the first to \npropose it, as we were the first to develop nuclear power as a weapon; \nthe first to propose ending tests to continue expanding our arsenals; \nand now the first to sign such a treaty, almost a generation after \nEisenhower proposed it.\n  There were increments along the way. I was in the Kennedy \nadministration at the time the Atmospheric Test Ban Treaty was signed. \nIt seemed such a large event, and it was.\n  Governor Harriman was a negotiator in Moscow and made the point--I \nhad served him in Albany, and we talked about this--he said that when \nhe arrived, the Soviets had already decided to sign this treaty, but of \ncourse we had to have days of intense negotiations to reach the point \nwhere they would agree to do what they had already decided to do. The \nSoviets had said yes, there is too much danger to mankind.\n  That was something they had not previously concerned themselves over \nmuch with, save as a revolutionary state.\n  Just a line from the article by the three heads of government:\n\n       The decisions we take now will help determine, for \n     generations to come, the safety of the world we bequeath to \n     our children. As we look to the next century, our greatest \n     concern is proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \n     chiefly nuclear proliferation. We have to face the stark \n     truth that nuclear proliferation remains the major threat to \n     world safety.\n\n  They are speaking to us in this near-empty Chamber. Some of our most \ndistinguished authorities in these matters are here. Most Senators are \nnot. The powers that dominated the last 500 years of politics: England, \nFrance, Germany--Spain somehow not there for the moment--pleading with \nus.\n  May I be specific, if I can, on the matter of particular interest? \nYou may be sure it was on the minds of the leaders who have written to \nus today, and that is the situation in the subcontinent, which is to \nsay India and Pakistan. I was Ambassador to India in 1974 when the \nIndians set off what they called a ``peaceful nuclear explosion.'' They \nintended it as such. In conversations with Prime Minister Gandhi, she \nwas persuasive that they were not going to build a bomb; they simply \nwanted to establish that they had the capacity to do so. It was a \nmatter of prestige. It was a matter of reminding Westerners that Indian \nphysicists, such as Satyendranath Bose, had been as much a part of the \ngreat era of discovery early in the century as the Europeans, and more \nthan Americans.\n  A quarter century goes by. The Congress Party with its universalist \ntendencies and professions has gone into a minority. A new party, a \nHindu party, as it calls itself, the BJP, came to power in March of \n1998. Two months later, India set off a series of five nuclear \nexplosions. That was followed almost instantly with Pakistan doing the \nsame. At the same time, they demonstrated a missile, probably of North \nKorean origin, which they named the Ghauri, in honor of the first \nIslamic invader of Hindu India.\n  Here you have all those things that conspire to destruction. This \nspring there was a Pakistan offensive in the Kargil mountains of \nKashmir. The Indian Government quite successfully held it back and \nrepulsed it, I believe, but not before Pakistani military officers had \nsaid: Keep this up and there are other options available to us.\n  Those other options of course include the nuclear option.\n  Here an important distinction is to be made. In India, to its great \ncredit, nuclear development is a matter directly under the control of \nthe Prime Minister and is not under the control of the military. The \nIndian military have been very apolitical, kept out of politics, and \nhave followed civilian command from the beginning. Not so Pakistan. The \nPakistan bomb is in the armamentarium of the Pakistan military.\n  Here, if I can make a point on which I do have total confidence, but \nI believe is a shared judgment: It is not clear that the Indian tests \nlast year were all\n\n[[Page S12269]]\n\nthat successful. They probably did not achieve a hydrogen bomb as they \nproclaimed. Even the 1974 test was exaggerated in its volume. The \nIndians have kept the military out of nuclear matters, but their \nscientists know they have not sufficiently succeeded, and they want to \ntest more.\n  In the report from India in this morning's press announcing the BJ \nParty has been returned to office with a very solid coalition, it was \nnoted that the outgoing government, which will now be coming back in, \nhad committed itself to further testing. They need to do that because \nthey are, obviously, at a disadvantage as regards their adversary, the \nPakistanis. They need, as it were, to show the Pakistanis they have the \nweapons that they have claimed to have. In turn, the Pakistanis will \nrespond.\n  Pakistan is not a stable country, not a country with civil authority \nvery secure, and an impoverished country, a country that will be \nselling nuclear weapons. They will be selling them to the Middle East. \nA Saudi prince has recently visited Pakistan and was shown nuclear \nfacilities. We have to expect this migration. It is ineluctable, unless \nwe get this treaty.\n  The point I finally make is we dare not reject the treaty but we need \nnot instantly ratify it. The treaty, very carefully drawn, provides \nthat 44 states must have ratified this treaty before it goes into \neffect--44. As of today, of the 44 states required, 41 have signed the \ntreaty but only 26 have ratified it, which is to say another 18 \ncountries, including the United States, have to do so before it goes \ninto effect. Of these countries, the most significant clearly are India \nand Pakistan. I assure you--well, I withdraw that remark--I prophesy \nthat, should we turn this treaty down, the forces in New Delhi and in \nIslamabad will say: ``You see, there are the Western imperialists \ndemanding their own liberties to do anything they wish--tests, they \nhave already the 1,030 tests--and they want now to deny them to us? No. \nThat day is over.''\n  Can we not listen to our closest friends and allies? We cannot ratify \ntoday. Someday we will, but we must not reject this treaty. It would be \nsending a ruinous signal. The complexities of our procedures in the \nSenate are not understood abroad, and they need not be in that sense. \nThe word will be we said no, just as in 1919 we said no to the Treaty \nof Versailles, we would not become involved in the affairs of Europe. \nAnd how many years was it until D-Day when we had to land our forces \nthere?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question on \nmy time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am happy to do so and honored.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had some discussions with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New York, as have others, on the \nquestion of the timing of the Senate's final deliberation of the \ntreaty. Indeed, I think our leadership and all of us are looking at \nthis in a very serious way. But it seems to me--and this is my \njudgment--that an element of such consideration has to be a recognition \nthat under our Constitution, next year elections are held across this \nNation for the Office of the Presidency, one-third of the Senate, and \nthe entire House. To inject a treaty which, in the minds of many--not \nthis Senator, but I respect the views of others--is so vital to our \nsecurity interests into that atmosphere and the dynamics of an election \nyear, in my judgment, would not give a fair and objective opportunity \nfor this treaty to be considered solely on its merits. I use the phrase \n``solely on its merits.'' Does my colleague agree with me?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I entirely agree with the Senator, if we can preface \nhis remarks by the statement that we do not have the votes to ratify \nthe treaty today.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my friend, I will work during the course of the \nday, and he has indicated a willingness to join me in this venture.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I most certainly have.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor because I know \nothers are anxious to speak.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I shall be honored to work with the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Delaware. This may be a very productive \nmoment in what looks like a perilous time.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken at some length. I am happy to yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 8, 1999]\n\n                          A Treaty We All Need\n\n          (By Jacques Chirac, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroder)\n\n       During the 1990's, the United States has made a vital \n     contribution to arms control and nonproliferation. Thanks to \n     the common resolve of the world's powers, we have achieved a \n     substantial reduction in nuclear arsenals, the banning of \n     chemical weapons, the indefinite and unconditional extension \n     of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and, in 1996, the \n     conclusion of negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty. South Africa, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus have \n     renounced nuclear weapons in the same spirit.\n       The decisions we take now will help determine, for \n     generations to come, the safety of the world we bequeath to \n     our children. As we look to the next century, our greatest \n     concern is proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \n     chiefly nuclear proliferation. We have to face the stark \n     truth that nuclear proliferation remains the major threat to \n     world safety.\n       Failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will be \n     a failure in our struggle against proliferation. The \n     stabilizing effect of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, extended \n     in 1995, would be undermined. Disarmament negotiations would \n     suffer.\n       Over half the countries that must ratify the new treaty to \n     bring it into force have now done so. Britain, France and \n     Germany ratified last year. All the political parties in our \n     countries recognize that the treaty is strongly in our \n     interests, whether we are nuclear powers or not. It enhances \n     our security and is verifiable.\n       The treaty is an additional barrier against proliferation \n     of nuclear weapons. Unless proliferators are able to test \n     their devices, they can never be sure that any new weapon \n     they design or build is safe and will work.\n       Congress realized this in 1992 when it compelled the United \n     States Presidential Administration to seek the conclusion of \n     a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by 1996. It was a welcome \n     move for the world's strongest power to show the way.\n       The treaty is effectively verifiable. We need have no fear \n     of the risk of cheating. We will not be relying on the good \n     will of a rogue state to allow inspectors onto its territory. \n     Under the treaty, a global network of stations is being set \n     up, using four different technologies to identify nuclear \n     tests. The system is already being put in place. We know it \n     will work.\n       Opponents of the treaty claim that, without testing, it \n     will not be possible to guarantee the continuing safety and \n     reliability of nuclear weapons. All nuclear powers, including \n     the United States, Britain and France, examined this issue \n     carefully. All reached the same conclusion. With the right \n     investment and modern technology, the necessary assurance of \n     safety and reliability can be maintained without further \n     nuclear tests.\n       Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the \n     pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to \n     ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to \n     proliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental \n     divergence within NATO.\n       The United States and its allies have worked side by side \n     for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty since the days of \n     President Eisenhower. This goal is now within our grasp. Our \n     security is involved, as well as America's. For the security \n     of the world we will leave to our children, we urge the \n     United States Senate to ratify the treaty.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, what is the objective of a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty? What is the objective of what we are about? The objective is to \nstop nuclear proliferation. The objective is to make the world safer \nfor mankind. Unfortunately, this noble effort now must be rescued from \npartisan politics. We are trapped in a political swamp as we attempt to \ncompress a very important debate on a very important issue.\n  A few minutes ago, there was an exchange about timing. We only have a \nfew hours to debate. My goodness, is that any way to responsibly deal \nwith what may, in fact, be the most critical and important vote any of \nus in this Chamber will ever make? It is not. We cannot have a serious \ndebate about nuclear proliferation when artificial timelines prevent \nthat important debate. Unfortunately, the political environment has \ncaptured this issue.\n  Aside from all the technical debate that will go on, as has begun \nthis morning, and rightfully so, about this treaty, this treaty is \nsymbolic. It represents 50 years of America's leadership throughout the \nworld in dealing with our allies and, yes, our adversaries, in trying \nto curb nuclear proliferation.\n\n[[Page S12270]]\n\n  Much has been said this morning by my distinguished colleagues about \nour allies, Great Britain and France. They moved forward in good faith \nlast year and ratified this treaty. Consequently, they are dismantling \ntheir nuclear testing facilities. What do we say to them if we defeat \nthis treaty? What do we say to the rest of the world, and what is that \nsymbol, what is the message we project?\n  We are far better off to take the time necessary to work our way \nthrough the critical questions and issues. This debate needs to be \ntaken down many layers, many levels in the questions that are relevant. \nWe have forced hearings this week in three committees. The committee on \nwhich I serve, Foreign Relations, had more than 6 hours of hearings \nyesterday. They were informative and important. There is a great amount \nof doubt and question and concern about the governance language in this \ntreaty: Who governs the implementation of this treaty, who is in \ncharge, aside from all the technical questions. We could take days on \nthe provisions for site inspections alone, and we should.\n  What are the consequences of us pulling out of this treaty? I hear \nfrom a number of my friends: If it is a bad treaty, we sign it and go \nahead, and if the President of the United States says in the supreme \nnational security interests of America we will pull out of the treaty--\nmy goodness, do we think it is that easy to arbitrarily pull out of a \ntreaty we led for over 50 years under the leadership of President \nEisenhower, that was further anchored by the actions of President \nKennedy with the first ban on nuclear testing in 1963? Do we think the \npolitical environment would be such that we could just arbitrarily pull \nout when we wanted? Do we not understand the consequences of that?\n  What about side agreements? We learned yesterday, for example, in the \nForeign Relations Committee hearings that there are side agreements. \nThat does not mean it is bad, but what are those side agreements? How \ndo they affect us? What is the management? What is the governance? Who \nmakes the deal? Do those side agreements have force behind them? What \nhappens in 10 years when there are new governments?\n  My colleagues understand and share with me the same fundamental \nresponsibility to this country, and that is, America's security is \nparamount; nothing else is more important. That is our premier \nresponsibility as Senators as we debate this issue. The fundamental \nprinciple we must follow is not to jeopardize the security of our \npeople and our country.\n\n  The U.S. nuclear deterrent has prevented a worldwide conflagration \nfor over 40 years. As former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger \nsaid yesterday in the hearings, that effective deterrence depends \nentirely on the assurance that our nuclear arsenal will work when it \nneeds to work. It is a huge issue, a huge question. The safety and \nreliability of the nuclear arsenal, therefore, must be maintained above \nall.\n  We might be able to do that with computers and other means, other \nthan testing. That may well be feasible. But I want to be assured a lot \nmore than I am now that, in fact, can be done without jeopardizing the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  We heard much about intelligence reports in all three committees that \nheld hearings this week. The administration says those intelligence \nreports are not yet complete. Why are we rushing to a vote when we do \nnot have all the intelligence, when we do not have all the information? \nWhy is there this arbitrary test timeline that we must have a vote?\n  What about the next administration? There will be a new \nadministration, Democrat or Republican. I read this morning Donald \nTrump is interested in a Trump administration. There may be a Jesse \nVentura administration, I say to Senator Biden. We do not know.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Certainly.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Never mind; I withdraw it.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I suspect his contribution would not be relevant to the \ndebate. The very serious fact is, we will have a new administration.\n  Is this treaty, essentially born 50 years ago from Eisenhower \nforward, relevant to the challenges of today?\n  Is it relevant to the new challenges of this next new century, the \nnew challenges that this new administration, this new President will \nhave to deal with? Are we boxing in this new administration? Shouldn't \nthis new administration coming in, in January 2001, have an opportunity \nto review arms control, look at what those needs are, what is relevant?\n  The world has changed. It has changed in 10 years. The world used to \nbe rather simple when we took this issue up 50 years ago, 20 years ago, \n10 years ago: Two superpowers, the Soviets, the Americans; they were \nthe ones with the nukes. Therefore, we created a structure, a protocol, \na treaty that dealt with that. That has changed.\n  I strongly urge the President of the United States, as I did the \nother night--telling him directly, and my leader and the Democratic \nleader, and all of my colleagues--to not allow us to get into a box we \ncannot get out of and take a vote on Tuesday. It is irresponsible. It \nwill surely go down. There will be consequences for that vote. It is \nthe wrong thing to do for America. It is not responsible governance.\n  What do we do? Why not continue to hold hearings on this very \nimportant issue, take this down to as many levels as we need, get the \nanswers? Maybe we have to restructure; I don't know. But the way it is \nnow, we are not prepared to vote. Why not inform the American public? \nWhy not allow the American public to understand what we are doing? Why \nnot allow all of our Senators to understand a little bit more than we \ndo now about this issue?\n  The tough questions must be asked, the consequences played out. We \nmust not allow ourselves to get trapped again in a timeline.\n  I heard this morning, Why not take a vote right after the election \nnext year? That is interesting. Why not float it out? Why not do this \nup or down? But why force an artificial timeline? If the political \nenvironment is not right to have an honest, open, legitimate debate, it \nis not right. That is a fact of life. But do not rush something that is \ngoing to have dire consequences for the future of the world to satisfy \nsome political dynamic or someone's interest in driving a timeline or \ndriving a political determination. That is irresponsible.\n  Regrettably, I must say to my colleagues, if that vote is held on \nTuesday, I will have to vote against this treaty. That will be \nregrettable because I would like to have more time to ask more \nquestions, to understand what we are doing, because I, as do all my \ncolleagues, take this responsibility very seriously. I say again, this \nvote, if it does come Tuesday or next year or in 2001, may in fact be \nthe most critical vote any of us ever cast.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I surely will, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Do I take it, from what the Senator so ably set forth \nabout his concerns on both sides, that he would be receptive to a \nproposal to put off this vote?\n  Mr. HAGEL. That is correct, I say to the Senator. I think it is a \nwise course of action. I so informed the President the other night at \nthe White House. I so informed my colleagues. I again say, as I did, if \nI have to vote Tuesday, I will vote against it. That will be \nregrettable because I believe arms control, the focused management of \nnuclear proliferation, is a responsibility this country has had.\n  We have taken the lead position on that for 50 years. I am proud of \nthat. You are proud of that. To box ourselves in, surely knowing the \nimpending defeat, I think would be a catastrophe for our leadership in \nthe world.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I agree ``catastrophic'' is not too strong a term. And \nthe Senator would be receptive to postponing a foregone catastrophe on \nTuesday?\n  Mr. HAGEL. I would, sir.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Arizona for \ngiving me this valuable time because we do not have a lot of time.\n\n[[Page S12271]]\n\n  First of all, let me say I respect the Senator from Nebraska so much, \nand yet I have to disagree with him. I respect certainly the senior \nSenator from New York as well as the Senator from Delaware. But the \nreason I disagree with them is, it is not as if this came up all of a \nsudden and we did not have any time to look at it. This treaty has been \nhere for 2 years. We could read it. We could study it. We could prepare \namendments. We could spend time evaluating it, talk to the experts. I \nhave been doing this. I assume many of my colleagues have been doing \nthis.\n  So procedurally let me just explain, so there is no misunderstanding \nwhere we are, what my position is.\n  We had a unanimous-consent request propounded--it was agreed to a few \ndays ago--that said we were going to have possibly up to two \namendments, not necessarily, but if we did, it would be 4 hours of \ndebate equally divided. Then we would have a vote on the treaty. There \nwould be 14 hours of debate, which we are in the process of having \nright now.\n  This was done by unanimous consent. That means any one of these \nSenators we have been listening to this morning could have objected to \nthat unanimous-consent request. Certainly, the senior Senator from New \nYork could have done it, the Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from \nDelaware. Anyone could have done it. Only one Senator has said he would \nnot have done it if he had been on the floor or if he had been aware of \nit. That was the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  That is the way the Senate is run. It is run by unanimous consent. So \nanyone could have stopped it. And they did not do it. But they could \nhave.\n  It takes unanimous consent to vitiate that unanimous consent \nagreement. If this happens, I made an announcement yesterday and the \nday before, sitting on the Armed Services Committee--with such \ndistinguished witnesses as our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen; as \nGeneral Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; as the \nDirectors of all the labs, all three of them--and I said in the event \nsomeone asks for a unanimous-consent agreement to delay this vote, I \nwill object. I want everybody to know right now, I will object to that.\n  There may be some parliamentary maneuvering where they can figure out \na way to get around my objection. If they do, I am sure it will have to \nbe passed on by the Parliamentarian. And that might happen. I might \nlose this thing.\n  But we have been looking at this right now for over 2 years. \nCertainly we have had ample time to study it and digest it. It is not \nsomething that just jumped up. Any Senator, of 100 Senators, could have \nstopped the vote that is supposed to take place on Tuesday or Wednesday \nwhen the debate time expires. So let me just serve notice I will be \nhere to object to that, so we get down to it. The reason is, we do not \nneed to keep delaying and delaying this thing.\n  The President has been yelling for 2 years: Bring it up. Bring it up. \nWe want to bring this up for a vote. Yet now that it is up and he \nknows--he suspects; he does not know--he suspects he does not have the \nvotes for ratification, he wants to bring it back. So anyway, that is \nwhere we are today.\n  Let me just respond to a few of the comments that have been made on \nthe floor. The distinguished Senator from Delaware talked about the \ndistinguished list of supporters of this test ban treaty. I would like \nto submit for the Record a list of those who are opposed to the \nratification of this treaty. They include six former Secretaries of \nDefense--Schlesinger, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Laird, Carlucci, Weinberger--\nand several former Directors of Central Intelligence; 13 generals, \ncommanding generals, who are now retired.\n  In fact, I would suggest--I might be challenged on this so I will say \nprobably most of the military officials who are supporting the \nratification of this treaty now are serving in the capacity in which \nthey are serving at the will of the President.\n  So I ask unanimous consent this distinguished list of some 33 leaders \nsaying we should oppose and vote down this treaty be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   Partial List of Opponents of CTBT\n\n       Jim Schlesinger (Former Secretary of Defense); Dick Cheney \n     (Former Secretary of Defense); Don Rumsfeld (Former Secretary \n     of Defense); Melvin Laird (Former Secretary of Defense); \n     Frank Carlucci (Former Secretary of Defense); Caspar \n     Weinberger (Former Secretary of Defense); Jim Woolsey (Former \n     Director of Central Intelligence); Bob Dole; Governor George \n     W. Bush; Elizabeth Dole; Judge William Clark (Reagan National \n     Security Adviser); Richard Allen (Reagan National Security \n     Advisor); Jeane Kirkpatrick (Former US Ambassador to the \n     United Nations); William Graham (Reagan Science Adviser); \n     Gen. Russ Dougherty, USAF (Former Commander, Strategic Air \n     Command).\n       Gen, Louis Wilson (Former Commandant, US Marine Corps); \n     Gen. Jim Johnson (Former Commanding General, 1st US Army); \n     Gen. Albion Knight (Former Director, Atomic Energy \n     Commission); Gen. Larry Skantze (Former Vice Chief of Staff, \n     US Air Force); Gen. Tom Kelly (Former Director for \n     Operations, Joint Chiefs of Staff); Gen. Jack Singlaub \n     (Former Chief of Staff, US Forces in Korea); Gen. Mike Loh \n     (Former Commander, Air Combat Command); Gen. Fred Kroesen \n     (Former Commander, US Army in Europe); Gen. Don Starry \n     (Former Commander, US Readiness Command); Gen. Milnor Roberts \n     (Former Chief, US Army Reserve); Gen. Lewis Wagner (Former \n     Commander, Army Materiel Command); Gen. Joseph Went (Former \n     Assistant Commandant, US Marine Corps); Admiral Jerry Miller \n     (Former Deputy Director, Strategic Planning Staff); Troy Wade \n     (Former Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs); \n     Edwin Meese (Former Attorney General); William Middendorf \n     (Former Secretary of the Navy); Midge Decter (Former \n     President, Free World Committee); Norman Podhoretz (Former \n     Editor, Commentary Magazine).\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Secondly, the Senator from Delaware is talking about our \nallies--I am very sensitive to our allies--and our allies have signed \nthis treaty, so if our allies have signed this treaty, we have to do \nit.\n  Frankly, I am not concerned about our allies. I am concerned about \nour adversaries. I am not at all concerned that Great Britain is going \nto send a missile over to the United States. I am concerned about China \nand Russia and now North Korea. Right now, as we speak, the President \nis sending money and making promises to North Korea so they will not \ntest a missile they have called a Taepo Dong 2 that will reach \nWashington, DC, from anyplace in the world, take 35 minutes to get over \nhere, and we do not have any defense against this thing. So those are \nthe ones about whom I am concerned. Have they ratified this treaty? No, \ncertainly not China, not Russia, not North Korea. North Korea hasn't \neven signed it. Those are the ones about whom I am concerned.\n\n  Thirdly, certification. Certification doesn't mean we have weapons we \nknow will be operative at any point in the future. It merely says we \ndon't know that they won't be; we don't know of any. We can certify we \ndon't know of any problems. How can they know of problems, if they are \nnot testing them? I think that is a very weak argument.\n  Lastly, I would like to address the reference made by the Senator \nfrom Delaware to Dr. Paul Robinson. He is the Director of the Sandia \nLaboratory. He is the one the Senator from Delaware talked about as \nbeing, apparently, a credible source, or he would not have mentioned \nhis name in his opening statement. Dr. Robinson says:\n\n       We know today that a test ban cannot prevent states from \n     acquiring nuclear weapons if they are determined to do so. \n     Credible nuclear weapons can be constructed without nuclear \n     testing, as several nations, including South Africa, have \n     demonstrated. The underground nuclear tests by India and \n     Pakistan in 1998 are another example. These events were not \n     developmental tests. They were demonstrations of nuclear \n     capability that had been developed much earlier with little \n     or no testing.\n       Those who claim that by ending nuclear testing we will \n     close off the threat of terrorist development and use of \n     nuclear explosives mislead themselves. Congress should not \n     accept such arguments as a basis for endorsing the test ban.\n\n  Further, Dr. Paul Robinson said:\n\n       It is indeed correct that the United States would be ill-\n     advised to place a sophisticated nuclear explosive design \n     into the stockpile that had not been previously tested and \n     validated. There is no question that actual testing of \n     designs to confirm their performance is the desired regimen \n     of any high technology device, from cars and airplanes to \n     medical equipment and computers. For a device as highly \n     consequential as a nuclear weapon, testing of the complete \n     system, both when it is first developed and periodically \n     throughout its lifetime to ensure that aging effects do not \n     invalidate its performance, is also the preferred \n     methodology. I and others who are or have been responsible \n     for the\n\n[[Page S12272]]\n\n     safety and reliability of the United States stockpile for \n     nuclear weapons have testified to this obvious conclusion \n     many times in the past. To forgo that validation through \n     testing is, in short, to live with uncertainty.\n\n  I don't want to live with uncertainty. There is no way of knowing \nthat we have a nuclear deterrent if we have to live with uncertainty.\n  There is no one I respect more highly than Secretary Bill Cohen, our \nSecretary of Defense. I served with him on the Armed Services Committee \nof the Senate, and he is certainly a most knowledgeable individual. I \ndo have to say this: He has certainly changed his story since he was in \nthe Senate. I am going to quote what Secretary Cohen said in 1992, when \nat that time he was the most vigorous opponent of a ban on nuclear \ntesting we had in the Senate. This is Secretary Bill Cohen when he was \na Senator:\n\n       Many of these nuclear weapons which we intend to keep in \n     our stockpile for the indefinite future are \ndangerously unsafe. Equally relevant is the fact that we can make these \nweapons much safer if limited testing is allowed to be conducted. So \nwhen crafting our policy regarding nuclear testing, this should be our \nprincipal objective--to make the weapons we retain safe. The amendment \nthat was adopted last week [speaking of 1992] does not meet this test, \nbecause it would not permit the Department of Energy to conduct the \nnecessary testing to make our weapons safe.\n\n  When I asked that question, there was some suggestion that maybe we \nare talking about different weapons. We are not talking about different \nweapons. These are the nine weapons we are talking about today. These \nsame nine weapons were there in 1992, the same ones to which Secretary \nCohen alluded.\n  This chart tells us that there are five tests for safety features. \nThese are the five tests. The most significant ones are the intensive \nhigh explosive and the fire resistance pit. That is to make sure they \ndon't inadvertently explode during use or during storage; the same with \nthe fire. If we look right here, we see that only one of these \nweapons--that is the W84--has any type of safety. I guess all five of \nthe hazards are listed. The W62 has none. So this was true in 1992. It \nis true again today.\n  Some people have said, well, in the worst-case scenario, if something \nhappens to the safety of this thing, we have a way of getting out of \nthis thing. It is called safeguard F. Safeguard F is one sentence in \nthe treaty. That sentence says that there is a way out in the event \nthat it becomes a supreme national interest to get out. So that would \nbe interpreted by our Commander in Chief or President, whoever is \nPresident at that time. I have often said--I don't think anyone is \ngoing to refute it--that we have a President who has a very difficult \ntime telling the truth. Let us assume he is telling the truth. This is \nwhat he said his interpretation would be in his application of \nsafeguard F: In the event that I were informed by the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of Energy, advised by the Nuclear Weapons \nCouncil, the directors of the Energy Department's nuclear weapons labs \nand the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command that a high level of \nconfidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapons type, \nwhich the two Secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear \ndeterrent, could no longer be certified, I would be prepared, in \nconsultation with Congress, to exercise the supreme national interest \nunder the CTBT in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.\n  He is saying, even if these five people; that is, everyone who has \nanything to do with or any knowledge of these nuclear weapons, even if \nall of them insist on it, he didn't say he would do it. He said he \nwould be prepared to do it. That is a very weak statement. It doesn't \nmean he would do it at all. I don't find any comfort at all in what he \nstated.\n  Coming close to the end of my time, let me share a couple other \nthoughts about which I do have strong feelings. We had all three \nDirectors of our three labs before our committee yesterday. All three \nof them testified that we have to test these nuclear weapons in order \nto make sure they will continue to work if called upon. These are the \nones who are responsible for doing that. Verification has to be talked \nabout.\n  It is kind of interesting. I will read an article in the paper a \ncouple of days ago. It was an article in the Washington Post by Robert \nSuro, entitled ``CIA Unable to Precisely Track Testing.'' This was last \nSunday, I believe, talking about something that might have occurred on \nSaturday, less than a week ago right now. Again, it was entitled ``CIA \nUnable to Precisely Track Testing.'' Among the troubling facts \nuncovered:\n\n       According to senior officials, the CIA has concluded that \n     it cannot monitor low-level nuclear tests by Russia precisely \n     enough to ensure compliance with the CTBT. . . . Twice last \n     month, the Russians carried out what might have been nuclear \n     explosions at its Novaya Zemlya testing site in the Arctic. \n     The CIA found that the data from the seismic sensors and \n     other monitoring equipment were insufficient to allow \n     analysts to reach a firm conclusion about the nature of the \n     events.\n\n  Having read that and then having had Gen. Henry Shelton and Secretary \nCohen on the same panel, I asked them the question: Can you sit here \nand tell us that the Russians did not conduct those tests just a few \nmonths ago referred to in the article in last Sunday's Washington Post? \nThey said: No, we can't.\n  We asked the same question of the Directors of the lab. They said: \nNo, there is no way of knowing it.\n  Verification has always been a real serious problem with me.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 5 more minutes. I think that will be \nacceptable. The time I am asking for is from our side.\n  Mr. KYL. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. INHOFE. About 4 minutes should be enough.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask that the Senator from Oklahoma conclude his remarks in \n4 minutes, after which the time would go to that side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I wonder what \nthe other timetable is. I have a flight I have to catch at 12:15. Is \nthere a short time that would be available to me soon?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we have been alternating. We have had two \nRepublicans, and the Senator from Michigan needs additional time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If it is all right with the others in line, that is all \nright with me.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator is brief, we will be happy to yield to you. \nThat will have been three Republicans in a row, but to accommodate, we \nare happy to do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, after the Senator from Texas goes ahead of \nus--which is fine if she has to catch a flight--could there be two \nDemocrats at that point?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have no objection to that. Senator Allard \nis waiting. Unfortunately, about three people have gone ahead of him. \nHe has also presided. Maybe he can have some time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would not want to lose my time. I have an appointment I \nneed to attend, so I hope I can get out of here by 1:30.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, after their two speakers, Senator Allard will \nbe next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will conclude in less time than that. I want to \naccommodate the wishes of others who want to be heard.\n  As I look at this, if we allow ourselves to be put in a situation \nwhere we do not know whether we have a nuclear deterrent, that is \nnothing short of unilateral disarmament. I know there are differing \nphilosophies around here. I believe in the White House they honestly \nbelieve that if we all stand in a circle and hold hands and disarm, \neverybody is going to be happy. But I am not at all satisfied with \nthat. I believe we need to have a nuclear deterrent.\n  Right now, we are faced with a situation where, because of the vetoes \nof this President, we don't have a national missile defense system. \nThat is to say, if they should deploy one of these missiles from North \nKorea, China, or Russia, which takes 35 minutes to get here, we have no \nway of knocking it down. We would be dependent upon a nuclear stockpile \nto have something to send back that is more significant. And not \nknowing whether or not those weapons would work would be worse than \nknowing they would not work.\n\n[[Page S12273]]\n\n  So the time is here to do it. I have applied this to my ``wife \ntest,'' which I often apply to things. I asked, ``Can we take a chance \non not being able to fire missiles?'' She agrees with me, and she is \nnever wrong.\n  Seeing the junior Senator from Texas, I recall something the senior \nSenator from Texas has said many times, which I think is very \nappropriate to quote at this time:\n\n       We have to remain strong. We all wish for the day and hope \n     for the day when the lion and the lamb can lie down together. \n     But when that day comes, I want to make sure we are the lion.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues across the aisle \nfor allowing me to go forward.\n  This is such an important debate. It is an important issue for our \ncountry but also for the world. There is no question the cold war ended \nwith communism in full retreat and democracy on the rise throughout the \nworld largely because the United States maintained an awesome military \ncapability that deterred war.\n  No American should forget that our stockpile of safe and reliable \nnuclear weapons has deterred nuclear conflict for these past 50 years. \nWhen Saddam Hussein threatened to use weapons of mass destruction prior \nto Desert Storm, it was the certain knowledge that the United States \nwould respond overwhelmingly that prevented Saddam Hussein from \nunleashing his own chemical and biological weapons.\n  This is a question of whether or not we, as a nation, intend to \nmaintain our nuclear deterrent capability--so vitally important to us \nover the last 50 years in maintaining peace in the world--or if we \nintend to unilaterally disarm. Make no mistake, that is the question \nbefore us.\n  Our founders purposely made it hard to enter into treaties and \nrequired a two-thirds majority in the Senate for ratification. Thomas \nJefferson wrote, ``We had better have no treaty than a bad one.''\n  I am afraid this test ban treaty is a bad one and it would be better \nnot to have it. A treaty is permanent. It requires great vision and \ncaution. Ratification of this test ban treaty would ultimately endanger \nour national security. I hope our citizens are paying close and careful \nattention.\n  There are really two questions before us: First, if we ratify this \ntreaty, will the United States be able to maintain a safe, reliable, \nand credible nuclear capability? Second, will we be able to verify that \nthis treaty is being enforced by other countries that have joined us? \nUnless both questions can be answered ``yes,'' then we cannot possibly \nratify this treaty.\n  On the issue of reliability, nuclear tests are the only proven method \nto assure confidence in the reliability and safety of our nuclear \nweapons. We have heard testimony to this effect from scientists and \nother experts. They worry that as we make advances in material science \nand component technology for these very complex weapons, the inability \nto test these advances through actual detonations will leave us with \ndoubt about whether they will work if used.\n  This treaty prohibits all nuclear tests, even of the lowest yield. \nThe new diagnostic tools are still unbuilt and unproven. Scientists \nadmit with humility that actual tests have often radically altered \ntheir chalkboard theories drawn out in the laboratory. At this point, \nanything short of testing is not sufficient to assure reliability and \nsafety. Reliability of our weapons means they will work as intended. So \nit is clear that reliability is key to our national strategy.\n  My second concern is that once the United States ratifies this \ntreaty, we will stop testing our weapons because we abide by treaties, \nbut rogue nations will not. Several countries that signed the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, agreeing not to produce nuclear weapons, \nviolated the treaty. They built the nuclear weapons anyway. Now we are \nexpecting them to sign this treaty and agree not to test.\n  I agree with Dr. Kathleen Bailey of Lawrence Livermore Labs, who \nnoted in testimony before the Armed Services Committee that this treaty \nexpects nations to ``agree not to test weapons they previously agreed \nnot to acquire.''\n  The Secretary of Defense has acknowledged in his own testimony that \n``we would not be able to detect every evasively conducted test.''\n  In fact, I pursued this direct line of questioning with former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Shalikashvili, in Defense \nappropriations hearings on March 5, 1997. He was the Joint Chiefs \nChairman at the time, and he did his best. But even then, he could not \nsay he would guarantee the safety.\n  General Shalikashvili said, ``With each year that goes by and we are \nfurther and further away from having done the last test, it will become \nmore and more difficult. That is why it is very important that we do \nnot allow the energy budget to slip, but continue working on this \nscience-based stockpile verification program and that we get this thing \noperating. But even then, Senator, we won't know whether that will be \nsufficient not to have to test. What we are talking about is the best \njudgment by scientists that they will be able to determine the \nreliability through these technical methods.''\n  I then asked him, ``Do you think we should have some time at which we \nwould do some testing just to see if all of these great assumptions \nare, in fact, true?''\n  General Shalikashvili responded, ``I don't know. I won't pretend to \nunderstand the physics of this enough. But I did meet with the nuclear \nlaboratory directors and we talked about it at great length. They are \nall convinced that you can do that. But when I ask them for a \nguarantee, they cannot give it to you until all of the pieces are stood \nup.''\n  He continued, ``Obviously if we stand it up and we cannot do that, \nthen we will have to back the President and say we will have to test. \nHopefully it will work out. But we are still a number of years away \nbefore we will have that put together so that we can tell you for sure \nit will not work or it will.''\n  I said, ``Well, mark one Senator down as skeptical.''\n  General Shalikashvili responded, ``Mark one Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff joining in that skepticism. I just don't know.''\n  Mr. President, ``just don't know'' is being unsure. Close is not good \nenough. It is not good enough when you are talking about a permanent \ntreaty and when it comes to nuclear safety.\n  The recent letter to the majority and minority leaders from six \nformer Secretaries of Defense of both parties was even more chilling. \nThis letter from six former Secretaries of Defense from both parties:\n\n       As the Senate weighs whether to approve the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), we believe Senators will be obliged \n     to focus on one dominant, inescapable result were it to be \n     ratified: over the decades ahead, confidence in the \n     reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile would inevitably \n     decline, thereby reducing the credibility of America's \n     nuclear deterrent.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The nuclear weapons in our nation's arsenal are \n     sophisticated devices, whose thousands of components must \n     function together with split-second timing and scant margin \n     for error. A nuclear weapon contains radioactive material, \n     which in itself decays, and also changes the properties of \n     other materials within the weapon. Over time, the components \n     of our weapons corrode and deteriorate, and we lack \n     experience predicting the effects of such aging on the safety \n     and reliability of the weapons. The shelf life of U.S. \n     nuclear weapons was expected to be some 20 years. In the \n     past, the constant process of replacement and testing of new \n     designs gave some assurance that weapons in the arsenal would \n     be both new and reliable. But under the CTBT, we would be \n     vulnerable to the effects of aging because we could not test \n     ``fixes'' of problems with existing warheads.\n\n  I think it is clear from the experts, from former Secretaries of \nDefense and from former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs that they cannot \ngive us a guarantee.\n  We are talking about nuclear safety. We are talking about the major \ntool we have for deterrence. We are talking about the security of the \nUnited States of America, and we have a treaty before us that is \npermanent.\n  How could we go forward with a treaty such as this with these kinds \nof questions? Close is not good enough when we are talking about \npermanence, and when we are talking about our own national security.\n  In fact, when it came to a test-ban treaty, President Reagan and \nother\n\n[[Page S12274]]\n\nCold War Presidents supported a ban only on high-yield nuclear tests. \nThese tests would be of sufficient explosive power to be detected and \nidentified by the sophisticated equipment designed to monitor \nunderground explosions.\n  Under that proposal, lower yield tests would be permitted, to help \nensure that our weapons were reliable. It makes sense not to ban low-\nyield tests because they're too small to detect and identify with the \nmonitoring equipment. That was a sensible approach that has \nunfortunately been discarded by the Clinton Administration.\n  In fact, just last month, it appears the Russians may have conducted \nlow-level nuclear tests at an Arctic test site. I say ``may have'' \nbecause the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that seismic \nsensors and other monitoring equipment simply can not provide the data \nneeded to know for sure.\n  Supporters of the treaty say it will result in a more extensive \nmonitoring program, including inspections by experts. But a more \nextensive inspection system is not going to increase our capability to \ndetect violations in advance. And having the right to request on-site \ninspections of test facilities doesn't give any added assurance of \nverification either. Let's face it: We've had that right in Iraq for \nthe last eight years, and it's not worth the paper it's printed on.\n  Look at recent events in North Korea as an example of this \nAdministration's policy of buying compliance with treaties and \nagreements. That policy has actually promoted nuclear and missile \nproliferation.\n  When the administration became convinced North Korea was building a \nnuclear device, in violation of their commitments under the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, it threatened a variety of sanctions.\n  The North Koreans responded that sanctions were tantamount to a \ndeclaration of war and soon we were at the negotiating table with this \nrogue nation. Prior to their possession of a nuclear weapon, it had \nbeen a tenet of our foreign policy for over 40 years that the United \nStates would not negotiate directly with the North Koreans without our \nSouth Korean allies at the table.\n  However, once it became clear that North Korea was trying to enter \nthe nuclear club, we began to negotiate. We set a lavish buffet of \nincentives--cash transfers, fuel, helping them build safer nuclear \nreactors. This began a dangerous cycle in which the North Koreans \nthreaten to act badly and we bribe them not to.\n  After that pattern, despite our warnings and threats, Pakistan soon \nthereafter tested a nuclear weapon and claimed membership in the \nnuclear club.\n  As former Majority Leader Bob Dole has pointed out, ``We refer to \nstates as rogue regimes because they regularly violate international \nlaw and refuse to be held accountable to international norms. The best \nway to deal with them is to deter them.''\n  This treaty will not end nuclear testing. A ``feel good treaty'' \ndoesn't make the world a safer place. The world is safer only when \nAmerica is strong. A critical element of our military strength is a \ncredible nuclear capability. This treaty will not result in a nuclear \nweapons free world. It will only result in a nuclear weapons free \nAmerica, and that would be a much more dangerous world.\n  I urge my colleagues not to go forward with this treaty that we will \nhave to abide by, on a permanent basis, not knowing if we will be able \nto keep our arsenal up to date and safe. This is a chance we cannot \nafford to take as the stewards of the national defense of our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this treaty if it does come \nforward.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I thank Senator Allard from Colorado, \nSenator Levin, Senator Dorgan, and all who have allowed me to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I wish to begin also by thanking the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, for holding 3 days of hearings on \nthe Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. These hearings were well \nbalanced and very informative. They were also very much overdue. But at \nleast we have begun the process of exploring this treaty.\n  What do we know after 3 days of those hearings?\n  We know the best professional judgment of our senior military leaders \nis that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is in our Nation's \nnational security interest. The best professional judgment of our \nsenior military leaders, civilian and uniform, is that we are better \noff with this treaty than without it. We know after these hearings that \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will make it harder and more \nexpensive for other countries to maintain existing stockpiles. We know \nthe treaty would make it harder and more expensive for nations that do \nnot yet have nuclear weapons to develop and deploy those weapons. We \nknow that the treaty, as all treaties, is not perfectly verifiable. But \nwe also know that tests conducted below our level of detection would \nnot militarily disadvantage the United States.\n  That doesn't come from me, although I believe it. It comes from our \nsenior military leaders.\n  We know that our overall monitoring and verification capabilities are \nvery capable today and will improve with the entry into force of the \ntreaty. We know, despite a 7-year moratorium on nuclear testing, that \nthe U.S. nuclear stockpile remains safe and reliable today. We haven't \ntested in 7 years. We have relied on our Stockpile Stewardship Program. \nThat program is up and running. We rely on it every year for a \ncertification that our stockpile is safe and reliable.\n  This isn't some future concept that is being discussed. It is a \nStockpile Stewardship Program that is, of course, not finished. It may \nnever be finished. But it has made significant progress. We rely on it. \nWe have invested billions in it. And our lab Directors have said three \ntimes, based on a Stockpile Stewardship Program that we now have up and \nrunning, that our nuclear inventory is safe and reliable. Without that \nstewardship program, they cannot make those certifications now on which \nwe so heavily rely.\n  So the Stockpile Stewardship Program is already serving as a basis \nfor certifying safety and reliability of this stockpile. We also know \nthat its capabilities will improve substantially in the future, but \nthat if at any point in the future the Stockpile Stewardship Program is \nnot adequate to certify the safety and reliability of our stockpile at \nthat point under the guarantees that are in the letter from the \nPresident--and that we will write into the ratification resolution--\nthen the United States will exercise its supreme national interest \nclause and begin testing again.\n  We have informed every signatory that is what we will have the right \nto do. We have put all the parties on notice as to what our supreme \nnational interest is. We have said that if we can't certificate safety \nand reliability without testing--and we believe that we can do it \nwithout testing--we will then return to testing.\n  We also know there is no military requirement for the United States \nto resume testing at the present time and there are no plans to resume \ntesting with or without a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  Most important of all, we know that if we do not ratify this treaty, \nwe will miss an opportunity, which is a historic opportunity, to stem \nthe tide of nuclear proliferation, and we will instead be encouraging a \nnew and possibly worldwide nuclear arms race.\n  Prohibition of nuclear weapons tests have been the goal of Presidents \nsince President Eisenhower. It was President Eisenhower who said almost \n40 years ago that not achieving a nuclear test ban, in his words, \n``would have to be classed as the greatest disappointment of any \nadministration of any decade of any time and of any party.''\n  The whole world, including nuclear weapons powers and countries that \nmight want to become nuclear weapons powers, will be watching what the \nSenate does with this treaty. Our action is going to affect the \nwillingness of other nations to ratify the treaty and our ability to \npersuade other nations to refrain from future nuclear testing. \nRejection of this treaty will have a profound negative impact on the \nbattle against proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\n[[Page S12275]]\n\n  We urge other countries--particularly, most recently India and \nPakistan--to give up nuclear testing, to sign this treaty. India and \nPakistan test weapons and we say: Stop it for your sake, for the \nworld's sake. It is a road you should no longer walk. It is a road \nwhich could lead to your mutual total destruction and could spread to \nother parts of the world.\n  We make those pleas to India, Pakistan, and other countries. How in \nthe world can we expect other countries to refrain from nuclear testing \nif we are unwilling to do so? How will we have any standing to ask \nIndia, Pakistan, China, and other countries to stop nuclear testing for \nthe sake of the world, for the sake of our kids, and their kids? How \nwould we have the gall to ask other countries to refrain from testing \nif we, ourselves, are unwilling to do so?\n  Our Secretary of Defense, our Joint Chiefs, four former chairmen of \nthe Joint Chiefs--including General Shalikashvili, General Powell, \nAdmiral Crowe, General Jones--have reviewed this treaty and have told \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee that they also support this test \nban treaty. General Shalikashvili's name was brought in by the Senator \nfrom Texas. I want to read what General Shalikashvili said this week. \nWe heard what he said 2 years ago; now let's see what he says today. By \nthe way, it is even stronger than where he was leading 2 years ago.\n\n       In short, the chief and I have supported this treaty, \n     together with the safeguards package, because it answered our \n     military concerns and because our country is better off with \n     this treaty than it is without it.\n\n  That is General Shalikashvili putting in a nutshell what the issue \nis: Is this country better off with or without this treaty? His answer \nis, it is.\n  General Shelton, who is the current Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, \ntestified as follows before our committee:\n\n       This treaty will help limit the development of more \n     advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability of \n     more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. It is true that \n     the treaty cannot prevent proliferation or reduce current \n     inventory, but it can restrict nuclear weapons progress and \n     reduce the risk of proliferation.\n\n  In short, our top uniform military official says the world will be a \nsafer place with the treaty than without it, and it is in our national \nsecurity interests to ratify the treaty.\n  Secretary Cohen, at the same hearings this week, testified that the \ntreaty would restrain other nations from creating and building nuclear \narsenals. He said:\n\n       By banning nuclear explosive testing, the treaty removes a \n     key tool that a proliferator would need in order to acquire \n     high confidence in its nuclear weapons design. Further, the \n     treaty helps make it more difficult for Russia, China, India \n     and Pakistan to improve existing types of nuclear weapons and \n     to develop advanced new types of nuclear weapons. In this \n     way, the treaty contributes to the reduction of the global \n     nuclear threat. Thus, while the treaty cannot prevent \n     proliferation or reduce the current nuclear threat, it can \n     make more difficult the development of advanced new types of \n     nuclear weapons and thereby help cap the nuclear threat.\n\n  Opponents of ratification have raised two major arguments. They \ncontend other nations could cheat because a low-yield nuclear test \nmight not be picked up by our sensors; and second, we need to conduct \nnuclear tests in order to maintain the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear stockpile.\n  General Shelton and Secretary Cohen, on the basis of current \nintelligence information, have said that we would be able to detect any \nmilitarily significant level of nuclear testing. Secretary Cohen \nexplained the conclusion this way:\n\n       Is it possible for States to cheat on the treaty without \n     being detected? The answer is, yes. We would not be able to \n     detect every evasively conducted nuclear test, and from a \n     national security perspective we do not need to.\n\n  This is his conclusion.\n  Secretary Cohen said:\n\n       I believe that the United States will be able to detect a \n     level of testing, the yield and the number of tests by which \n     a state could undermine the U.S. nuclear deterrent.\n\n  General Shelton also pointed out that the treaty, if it comes into \neffect, will increase our ability to observe and monitor tests because \nit will create an international monitoring system of over 300 \nmonitoring stations in 90 countries.\n  Some refer to information developed by the intelligence community \nover the last 18 months. I specifically asked the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs and the Secretary of Defense whether or not their testimony, \ntheir opinion, includes consideration of all of the intelligence \ncommunity's information that has been gathered in the last 18 months \nand before.\n  Secretary Cohen states:\n\n       I have been apprised of all the developments. I am not \n     aware of any information at this point that would call into \n     question our ability to maintain our strong nuclear \n     deterrent, that any balance has shifted or would call into \n     question our ability to defend ourselves.\n\n  With regard to the safety of the stockpile, it is now safe, it is \ncertified as safe, even though we have done no testing since 1992.\n  The answer of the heads of our laboratories--when I directly asked \nthem this question: Are you signed on to this treaty?--was:\n\n       Yes, provided the safeguards are written into the \n     ratification resolution and providing there is robust funding \n     of our safeguards and our stockpile security program.\n\n  The lab Directors are, in the words of one of them, ``on board'' \nunder those conditions and those conditions now exist.\n  My friend from Virginia apparently has a question, and I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Earlier, my distinguished colleague referred to General \nPowell. I have had the opportunity to be counseling with General \nPowell, soliciting his views, and he has been soliciting mine for some \nseveral days. He just telephoned me because he is watching this debate. \nHe authorized me to say the following, that in view of the mounting \nconflicting testimony--primarily before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in the course of the three hearings which my colleague is now \naddressing and I shall address at some point here--in view of the \nmounting conflict of testimony, particularly as it relates to the \ncredibility of this deterrent and, indeed, safety issues--we need only \nlook at the testimony by the lab Directors yesterday--he has authorized \nme to say at this time he joins those who recommended the delay of \nfinal consideration of the treaty at this point in time.\n\n  That should be clearly understood. He feels it should not be killed \nbecause he thinks, hopefully, if it is modified in certain ways, that \nit can be another brick in our walkway leading towards nonproliferation \nand stronger arms control regimes. However, at this time, he wishes to \nbe on record as saying the Senate should not act and should not act \nbecause of the mounting conflicting testimony on the key essential \nelements that he and other uniformed officers--I addressed this earlier \nin the safeguards provision and likewise, which says at some point in \ntime a President could withdraw from this treaty because of information \nbrought to his attention.\n  So that is an important part of the treaty. It is under the \n``supreme'' clause, which is in all of our treaties, but it is \namplified. So I just wanted to correct the record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. You are not correcting the record at all. You are \namplifying the record, if I may say to my good friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. You said he supported the treaty but at this point in \ntime----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I said he supported the treaty; and I am glad to hear he \nsupports delay in the vote, and I hope our colleagues will listen to \nboth of his statements, both that we should not now vote on this \ntreaty--because he is correct for many reasons--and also I hope they \nwill listen to his statement of January 27, 1998, when he, along with \nGeneral Shalikashvili, former Chairman Crowe, and former Chairman Jones \nsaid the following:\n\n       On September 22, 1997, President Clinton submitted the \n     Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban (CTB) Treaty to the United \n     States Senate for its advice and consent, together with six \n     Safeguards that define the conditions under which the United \n     States will enter into this Treaty. These Safeguards will \n     strengthen our commitments in the areas of intelligence, \n     monitoring and verification, stockpile stewardship, \n     maintenance of our nuclear laboratories, and test readiness. \n     They also specify the circumstances under which the President \n     would be prepared, in consultation with Congress, to exercise \n     our supreme national interest rights under the CTB to conduct \n     necessary testing if the safety or reliability of our nuclear \n     deterrent could no longer be certified.\n\n  This is his conclusion, General Powell, on January 27, 1998:\n\n\n[[Page S12276]]\n\n\n       With these Safeguards, we support Senate approval of the \n     CTB Treaty.\n\n  Those are his words. I am glad to have this printed in the Record and \nI am happy to hear at this point, at least, General Powell does support \nthe delay in the vote. I think that is a wiser course to take for three \nreasons, and I will conclude with those reasons.\n  Mr. WARNER. The reasons he gave me are in view of the conflicting \ntestimony that has evolved since the point in time at which he made \nthat statement. That is the predicate on which he now thinks the vote \nshould be delayed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are at least three predicates I would support for \ndelaying this treaty. I am glad to hear he reaches the same conclusion \nfor whatever reason he wants to give now.\n  Mr. WARNER. They are very important reasons, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not going to comment on his reasons. I am delighted \nhe reached the conclusion he did. I disagree with his reasoning as to \nhow he reached his conclusion because I think the evidence is \noverwhelming, and the testimony, if anything, has grown stronger. In \nfact, one of the arguments against this treaty is that we need somehow \nto defeat it in order to protect our allies; that they are relying on \nour deterrent--which, of course, they are--that somehow or other our \nallies would be disadvantaged if we ratified this treaty.\n  Yet three key allies have taken an unusual step. I do not remember \nwhen this has ever happened, when the heads of three states closely \nallied with us have urged this Senate directly to ratify a treaty. Yet \nthat is what they are now doing.\n  We have heard arguments for the last few days: Look how important our \nstrategic deterrent is, not just to us, which it is, but to our allies, \nwhich it has been and will continue to be.\n  What does President Chirac say and what does Prime Minister Blair say \nand what does Chancellor Schroeder say? They say: We need this treaty, \nSenate. They are directly addressing the U.S. Senate. I do not remember \nthat ever happening.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Never.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Directly, directly asking the U.S. Senate to ratify the \ncomprehensive test ban.\n  What do they say:\n\n       Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the \n     pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to \n     ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to \n     proliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental \n     divergence within NATO.\n       The United States and its allies [they say] have worked \n     side by side for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty since the \n     days of President Eisenhower. This goal is now within our \n     grasp. Our security is involved as well as America's. For the \n     security of the world we will leave to our children, we urge \n     the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaty.\n\n  So much for the argument that somehow or other defeating this treaty \nis not only good for us but it is good for our allies. Not in their \nview, it is not. Not in my view, it is not. And I hope not in the view \nof the majority of this Senate.\n  But I want to go back to the delay, and I am going to wind up because \nI do happen to agree, we should not vote on this treaty at this time--\nfor a number of reasons.\n\n  First of all, because it would be tragic to reject this treaty, and \nif it comes to a vote now, it is going to be rejected. It would be \ntragic for our security--that is our top military leaders saying that, \nand I feel that keenly. It would be tragic for the world for us to \ndefeat this treaty. It would reverse the direction in which we are \nheading, which is an ongoing effort to try to reduce the threat of \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. That effort, which I hope all of us \nshare, will be damaged severely if we reject this treaty. And because \nwe will reject this treaty if it comes to a vote, I think we should \ndelay it.\n  No. 2, this treaty should not be involved in any way in Presidential \npolitics, partisan politics, political meanderings, conflicts. We ought \nto be looking at this treaty based on its merits without this political \nenvironment being heeded. We cannot and are not doing that at this \nmoment. It is a good reason to delay this treaty.\n  We delayed the Chemical Weapons Convention. The reason we delayed our \nvote, even though it was scheduled--and I tell my good friend who is \npresiding, even though we had actually scheduled a vote on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, by unanimous consent I believe, too--when Senator \nDole came out against that Chemical Weapons Convention shortly before \nwe were voting, and while he was running for President, we decided as a \nSenate we would delay that vote until after that Presidential election.\n  We then, taking calm deliberation, adding conditions, reservations--\nwe then ratified that treaty. We took the time to do it. In fact, we \nspent a lot of time in the Old Senate Chamber, as I remember, as part \nof that deliberation. We should do that here.\n  The third reason we should not proceed to vote at this time is that \nwe as a Senate have a responsibility to deliberate on a treaty. We put \nourselves in a position, through a unanimous consent agreement, where \nwe could not do that adequately. I think that was a mistake. But we do \nnot have to compound our mistakes and make a worse mistake by voting on \nit just because we agreed to a unanimous consent agreement that we \nwould begin the debate on it. That does not force us to proceed to vote \non that treaty.\n  We have done some good with this unanimous consent agreement already, \nalthough I believe, looking back, it was a mistake to constrain \nourselves as we did--that we could not add amendments other than one on \neach side, could not add reservations, could not add conditions, and so \nforth. What we have done as an institution is to put ourselves in a \nstraitjacket with this unanimous consent reservation, which is not in \nkeeping with the great traditions of the Senate. Senator Byrd, Senator \nMoynihan, and others made that point. I think they made it eloquently. \nI keenly believe it. We have a responsibility here to deliberate on a \ntreaty, to be open to considering conditions, qualifications, \nreservations, statements--to complete our committee work.\n  My good friend from Virginia knows--in fact he was the one, I think, \nwho brought this out--we are currently in the middle of receiving a \nnational intelligence estimate which is not yet completed. We should \nsee that completed. We should have whatever hearings are needed.\n  By the way, we should have a committee report. I cannot remember a \ntreaty which has ever come to the floor of the Senate--at least of this \nmagnitude--without a committee report. On the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, we had a committee report of 350 pages for consideration by \nthis body. We do not have one page from any of the committees.\n  So it seems to me it makes the most sense for us, under these \ncircumstances--I am going to be perfectly candid; one of the reasons \nthat compels me is that I believe if we voted now, this would be \ndefeated. I think that would be a tragic setback in the fight against \nproliferation. But there are other very important institutional \nreasons, which I hope will appeal to others, that we should not ever as \na body put ourselves in a position where we need to vote, or have to \nvote, on something which is not ready to be voted on.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on our time. The \ndistinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee and I, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations and Senator \nMoynihan--a group of us are trying to work on a framework for the \npurpose of our two respective leaders, and, indeed, the President is \ninvolved.\n  Yesterday, in the course of our hearings, I addressed my concern--I \nsupport the delay of the final consideration, as now under the UC, but \nI am also very concerned that whenever the Senate resumes consideration \nof this treaty it be done in a time period after careful records have \nbeen created on this treaty and questions that concern General Powell \nabout the conflict of testimony have been resolved to the best of our \nability, and that it not be done under the dynamics of the U.S. \nconstitutional process of electing a President and the Members of the \nCongress. That is the thing that concerns me. Those dynamics might, in \nall fairness, affect the outcome of this treaty which could be adverse \nto the national security interests of this Nation and our allies who \ndepend upon us.\n  In searching for the format of a consensus to move off the UC consent \nof\n\n[[Page S12277]]\n\nhaving the vote next week, we need to address that issue. Will my dear \ncolleague say exactly what he did in open session yesterday about how \nhe basically endorses my concerns over the year of the national \nelections under our Constitution?\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I said yesterday, indeed, the day before, in the \nabsence of circumstances that I cannot foresee----\n  Mr. WARNER. Primarily, Mr. President, international intervention of \nsome type.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, I do not limit it to that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Each Senator has an opportunity to address that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. But in the absence of circumstances I \ncannot foresee, I would oppose bringing this treaty up next year for \nthe reasons I have given. In conclusion, at a minimum, I believe we \nshould do no harm. At least let us do no harm in the battle against \nproliferation. Bringing this treaty up now for a vote--not for debate, \nwhich we are doing under a UC, but for a vote--in my judgment, would do \nharm to the battle against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I hope \nwe will be able to find a way that we not reach that vote. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I concur in my good friend's comments. In \nother words, I have been urging him to say these things for some time. \nI thank him because this is very helpful as I and other Senators, \nhopefully with him, continue to work to provide our leadership with a \nframework within which this can be achieved.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I can have 10 more seconds, I have not been reluctant \nat all to say this over the last few days. I have been very open about \nmy feelings on this issue and that bringing this treaty to a vote now \nwould do harm. I join my friend from Virginia in that belief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if it will help my colleagues, we have been \ntrying to equalize this. I am about to yield to Senator Dorgan for 15 \nminutes, but I say to Democrats who are waiting to speak, we have \nTuesday as well. I will be yielding in the 5-to-7-minute range for \npeople who wish to speak after this, if people want to speak. We will \nreserve enough time at the conclusion of this debate.\n  I yield 15 minutes to Senator Dorgan who has been, quite frankly, the \nleader on our side of this issue who has been trying very hard for a \nyear to get us to this point of debate. I yield 15 minutes to my friend \nfrom North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for all the anxiety that is expressed in \nthis Chamber about when we might vote and the consequences of that \nvote, I at least observe that we are finally on the right subject. This \nis an important issue. This is an important matter for the Senate to \nconsider. There are big issues and then there are small issues. There \nare important issues and some not so important. Stopping the spread of \nnuclear weapons, in my judgment, is a big, important issue.\n  Will the United States of America be a leader, will it assume its \nmoral responsibility in the world to provide leadership to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons and reduce the risk of nuclear war? That is \nthe question before the Senate.\n  Sadly, some in this Chamber answer that question by saying: No, not \nus, not now. In fact, some, if you look at their record on arms control \nagreements say: Not us, never.\n  This treaty is not so difficult to understand, despite the \nprotestations of some.\n  Forty years ago, President Eisenhower called for a treaty of this \ntype. Seven years ago, the United States decided we would unilaterally \nstop the testing of nuclear weapons. Nearly 5 years ago, our country \nwas a leader in convening nations to negotiate a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty. Two years ago, that Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was sent to \nthe Senate for ratification. Not 1 day of hearings was held in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee in 2 years--not 1.\n  Then abruptly, 10 days ago, we were told there would be 14 hours of \ndebate and 10 days hence we would have a vote on the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  That was not and is not a thoughtful way for the Senate to deal with \nthis issue, especially an issue of this importance.\n  Now to the debate. Mark Twain once said when asked if he would \nparticipate in a debate: Absolutely, provided I can take the negative \nside.\n  They said: We have not told you what the debate is about.\n  He said: It doesn't matter, you don't need time to prepare for the \nnegative side.\n  I will not ascribe those motives to those who are strongly in \nopposition to this treaty, but some of the charges and allegations made \njust seem, to me, to be preposterous. I heard an hour or so ago in this \nChamber the term ``unilateral disarmament'' applied to the U.S. \nratifying this treaty. What a preposterous charge, unilateral \ndisarmament.\n  Let's look at who supports this treaty. I heard a discussion about \nGen. Colin Powell. Gen. Colin Powell supports this treaty. He said so. \nWe have the date, the time, the place, the statement. He now, \napparently, in a telephone call he said he would like to defer the vote \nbecause of questions raised in hearings, hearings that were 2 years in \nthe making. Gen. Colin Powell, General Shalikashvili, the last four \nChairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Shelton, the present \nChairman and the Secretary of Defense--all of whom say they support \nthis treaty. Why? Because they believe this treaty protects this \ncountry's security interests. They believe this treaty is in this \ncountry's interest.\n  I will read some statements because those who come to the floor \ntalking about the military consequences of this treaty need to \nunderstand to what all the senior military leaders in this country now \ntestify.\n  The Joint Chiefs, the senior military leaders in this country, say:\n\n       In a very real sense, one of the best ways to protect our \n     troops and our interests is to promote arms control. . . . In \n     both the conventional and nuclear realms, arms control can \n     reduce the chances of conflict. . . . Our efforts to reduce \n     the number of nuclear weapons coincide with the efforts to \n     control testing of nuclear weapons. . . . The Joint Chiefs \n     support the ratification of this treaty.\n\n  Colin Powell and others in January 1998 said:\n\n       We support Senate approval of the CTBT.\n\n  Gen. Colin Powell supports the ratification of this treaty. We are \ntold he wants the vote delayed. So that does not change the fact that \nhe is on record saying he supports the ratification of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  What about monitoring? We hear all this noise about if we ratify this \ntreaty, countries will cheat.\n  Our military leaders--and certainly the scientists--but especially \nour military leaders say that if we ratify this treaty, we will have \nmonitors all around the world.\n  I show the situation on these charts: Here are the monitors without \nratification; here are the monitors with ratification. The number of \nmonitors is dramatically enhanced. The ability to detect nuclear tests, \ndetect cheating will be dramatically enhanced. No one that I know of \ncan credibly or thoughtfully argue that we are not enhancing our \ncapability in this country by ratifying this treaty.\n  What about the scientists? Thirty-two Nobel laureates in physics and \nchemistry, the most powerful intellects in this country were at the \nWhite House a couple of days ago. One who testified yesterday worked on \ndeveloping the first nuclear bomb; one who testified the day before \ninvented radar and then invented the laser--what do these scientists \ntell us about this treaty? They say: Ratify this treaty. This treaty is \nin the country's best interest.\n  Scientifically, they tell us that we can safeguard our nuclear \nstockpile; we can more effectively monitor tests around the world. They \nsay, without equivocation: Ratify this treaty. That is from scientists.\n  What about the American people? Surveys show 80 percent of the \nAmerican people say: Ratify this.\n  It is interesting to me, military leaders do not count; scientists do \nnot count; the American people do not count. There is this cold war \nmentality, I guess, that nothing has changed. Some who have never \nsupported an arms control agreement are back here again today saying \nthis will not work either.\n  Other arms control agreements have worked, and we know it. We have \nseen\n\n[[Page S12278]]\n\nthe destruction of nuclear weapons by sawing wings off bombers, by \ndestroying missiles and warheads, and not by hostility but by arms \ncontrol agreements that call for reducing the numbers of nuclear \nweapons. That has happened. These arms control agreements have been \nsuccessful. This treaty will be successful if this Senate will ratify \nit.\n  The support of military leaders and scientists--and, for that matter, \nthe American people--seems to matter little in this Chamber. The \nscientific opinion of the most respected scientists in the world are \nsecond-guessed by those who believe they can understand this issue in a \nmatter of a day or two.\n  Thirty-two Nobel Prize winners, two seismology organizations, three \ncurrent weapons lab Directors, the Secretary of Energy, the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense all have a common \nposition on this country's ability to solve the scientific and \ntechnical tasks required in this test ban treaty; and all of them say \nthat this treaty is in the country's interests.\n  The spread of nuclear weapons, that is what all this is about--\nstopping the spread of nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan detonated \nnuclear weapons not too long ago under each other's chin. These are two \ncountries that do not like each other. Ought that not send some fear \nall around the world about the proliferation of nuclear weapons?\n  Or maybe some do not understand nuclear weapons. They think that they \nare just bombs. There is an Indian author named Arundahti Roy who is \none of the most acclaimed young authors in the world right now. She \nwrites about a nuclear attack and nuclear weapons. Let me read some of \nthis for a moment. She talks about the sentiments of survivors of a \nnuclear attack:\n\n       What shall we do then, those of us who are still alive? \n     Burned and blind and bald and ill, carrying the cancerous \n     carcasses of our children in our arms, where shall we go? \n     What shall we eat? What shall we drink? What shall we \n     breathe?\n       . . . There's nothing new or original left to be said about \n     nuclear weapons. . . . (But) under the circumstances, silence \n     would be indefensible. Let's not forget that the stakes we're \n     playing for are huge. Our fatigue and our shame could mean \n     the end of us.\n\n  We have a responsibility as a country. Those who raise arguments I \nhave heard today--I wonder how can they sleep at night, if they believe \nour nuclear weapons are unsafe.\n  A physicist yesterday said: We have had them for 40 and 50 years. We \nknow how they work. We know how to safeguard them. We know how to keep \nthem over time. Yet we have people on the floor of the Senate talking \nabout the fact that the stockpile may not be safe.\n  One of my colleagues said: Drop some of them on your State. You think \nthey'd work? Of course they would. You would not, in a million years, \nguess about whether it would detonate on your State if a nuclear weapon \nwere aimed at your State. We know our stockpile works and is maintained \nat great cost.\n  Cannot monitor? Nonsense. That does not even deserve much of a \nresponse. Everybody says our monitoring will be enhanced.\n  Unilateral disarmament? Rubbish. There is nothing here that suggests \nthat. This country already decided we were not going to test 7 years \nago.\n  The question now is, Will we give others a green light to test? We \ndecide that we won't test, but we will refuse to ratify a treaty that \nsays to others: We don't want you to test either.\n  It is a curious set of circumstances by which this comes to the \nfloor.\n  Every other arms control issue has been dealt with seriously.\n  The ABM Treaty: 8 days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings, and \n18 days of Senate debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  The Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1988: 23 days of committee \nhearings in the Foreign Relations Committee; 2 days of Senate floor \nconsideration.\n  START I: 19 days of hearings; 5 days on the Senate floor.\n  START II: 8 days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings; 3 days on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Chemical weapons: 14 days of hearings; 3 days on the Senate floor.\n  NATO enlargement: 7 days of hearings; 8 days on the floor.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty: 2 years it was here. Not 1 day of \nhearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during 2 years; and \nthen we are told, 14 hours of debate.\n  The New York Times today has the spectacle--welcomed from my \nstandpoint, by the way--but the spectacle of the leaders of England, \nFrance, and Germany asking us to assume our role as a leader, asking us \nto ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  No one ought to ask us to do what we have a responsibility to do. We \nought not to be in the position of having other countries have to ask \nus to assume leadership in trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons \nand reduce the risk of nuclear war. We ought to be leading on this \nissue, not following.\n  Omar Bradley, that great general said some many years ago, and it \napplies especially today, it seems to me:\n\n       The world has achieved a brilliance without conscience. \n     Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. If we \n     continue to develop our technology without wisdom or \n     prudence, our servants may prove to be our executioner.\n\n  Everyone in this Chamber knows our responsibility. Our duty--as the \nnuclear superpower on this Earth--our duty is to lead. And we cannot \nand we must not shrink from that duty ever.\n  There is great anxiety about what happens at the end of 14 hours, and \nwhat if, as some now speculate, many Senators, especially on the other \nside of the aisle, decide they cannot support this treaty. Some say \nthat would be a chilling, chilling result, with devastating results \naround the rest of the world.\n  I know this: This is a difficult, uncertain time, with many countries \nwishing to possess and acquire nuclear weapons. It is a difficult time, \nwith India and Pakistan detonating nuclear weapons. It is a difficult \ntime, with rogue nations and terrorist groups that want to threaten \nmuch of civilization.\n  We have unloosed the nuclear genie, and we must assume responsibility \nin providing an opportunity for the entire world to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons. One way to do that--an important and effective way to \ndo that--is to decide as a Senate to ratify this treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Allard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Chair will notify me when I have a minute left, I \nwould appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the patient Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, there are three areas I will respond to, \ncontained in previous comments made on the floor. One has to do with \nthe number of hearings we have had in relation to this issue. Another \nis what previous Presidents have accepted. Another is our ability to \nmonitor what has happened as far as nuclear testing is concerned.\n  We have had hearings in the Armed Services Committee. I have served \non that committee. I have been there personally. I know they have been \nthere. We have had hearings in the Intelligence Committee. To make a \nstatement that this has been brought to the floor without a hearing and \ndiscussion in committee is false. We have had those hearings. I believe \nI have been adequately briefed, as a Member of the Senate, on the pros \nand cons of moving ahead with the ratification of this particular \ntreaty.\n  As far as previous Presidents pushing for a nuclear test ban, none of \nthe Presidents, except for this President, has worked for zero \ntolerance. That is unprecedented. Because of that zero tolerance, it \ncreates special problems for this country when it comes to monitoring. \nWe have shown, through our own scientific testing, that it is possible, \nwith low-level nuclear testing, it can be camouflaged. One can let off \na low-level test without any kind of detection. When we get to a zero-\ntolerance level, this all becomes a problem, as far as monitoring. We \ndo have real problems with monitoring.\n  This week we have begun the very important debate regarding the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, better known as the CTBT, and whether \nits ratification is in the best interest of\n\n[[Page S12279]]\n\nthe United States. I believe this debate is timely. I have been \nstudying the issue during the course of the last year; attended as many \nof the hearings as possible; carefully reviewed much of the record; and \nI listened closely to all my colleagues and the experts with their many \nvaried opinions. After all this, I have come to the conclusion that the \nCTBT is not in the best interest of this country at this time.\n  As we move into the 21st century, America is confronting new and \nimproved threats. More countries have acquired and are attempting to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction. This despite all the treaties in \nplace today. Unfortunately, the reality of this threat means that the \nUnited States needs not a weakened nuclear deterrent but a stronger and \nmore reliable nuclear deterrent.\n  During the cold war, we were in a bi-polar strategic stance. It was \nthe U.S. versus the Soviet Union. When we signed up to treaties, we \nwere really only negotiating with the USSR. However, with the fall of \nthe USSR, we are in a completely different strategic situation. Our \nmain threats are rogue states whose goals are completely different than \nthe former Soviet Union. I do not believe that these rogue states--\nIran, Iraq, North Korea, and the like--really care if we ratify the \nCTBT. They will do what they believe is in their best interest.\n  For example, what do we do if we ratify the treaty and Iraq conducts \na nuclear test? Some would say that we can punish them or shame them. \nHow? Are we going to bomb them? Are we going to place heavy economic \nsanctions on them? To me, this treaty will do nothing to stop the \npeople we want to stop from testing. While we do not need to go ``mano \ny mano'' anymore with another state in numbers of warheads, we do need \nto have a strong nuclear deterrent and to do this we need the \ntechnology and industrial base capable of assuring that our weapons \nstay strong. I believe we use the deterrent approach until we have the \ntechnology available to destroy a nuclear threat over the country of \norigin at which time it becomes a liability to the rogue country.\n  These requirements cannot be confidently met if the United States is \nobliged to adhere to a zero-yield and permanent CTBT. Despite what we \nhave heard, no other administration has called for this treaty. \nPresident Eisenhower proposed a test ban but only for a limited \nduration. Neither President Kennedy nor President Johnson supported a \nzero yield test ban. President Nixon agreed to limit test above 150 \nkilotons and President Carter sought only a ten year ban with tests up \nto two kilotons. Presidents Reagan and Bush did not pursue a test ban \nat all.\n  The permanent zero-yield treaty has only been sought by President \nClinton. And from my understanding, this has not been the position for \nthe entirety of his administration. As recently as 1995, the Department \nof Defense position was that it could support a CTBT only if tests of \nup to 500 tons were permitted. However, the military chiefs were \noverruled by the civilian leadership after President Clinton agreed to \na zero yield test ban.\n  This treaty prohibits all underground nuclear tests, even those so \nlow that they cannot be confidently detected. If this treaty is \nratified, we would be permanently prohibited from conducting the sorts \nof tests we have relied upon in the past to assure the safety, \nreliability, and effectiveness of our nuclear people.\n  Some of the CTBT proponents believe that the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram is the antidote to nuclear testing. This program supposes to be \nable to simulate nuclear explosions through the use of computer \nmodeling. The estimate is that the program will cost at least $4.5 \nbillion a year over 10 years. While Stockpile Stewardship may be the \nanswer in the future, the problem is that with any scientific \nexperiment you must have a comparable element, and in this case a \nnuclear test. The best way to ensure that the Stockpile Stewardship \nprogram is working is to ensure that the results of the model match the \nresults of a test. We must be able to caliberate the model before we \nshould end all testing. I believe this is the height of \nirresponsibility.\n  With this being said, let me stress one major concern I have about \nthe treaty, and regarding the 6 safeguards proposed by the President.\n  First, as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed \nServices Committee, I believe the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nsubmitted to this Senate by President Clinton is not verifiable. This \nmeans that, despite the vast array of expensive sensors and detection \ntechnology being established under the treaty, it will be possible for \nother nations to conduct militarily significant nuclear testing with \nlittle or no risk of detection.\n  What is militarily significant nuclear testing? The definitions of \nthe term might vary, but I think we'd all agree that any nuclear test \nthat gives a nation information to develop newer, more effective \nweaponry is military significant.\n  In the case of the United States, nuclear tests will yields between \nbetween 1,000 tons and 10,000 tons are generally large enough to \nprovide ``proof'' data on new weapons designs. Other nations might have \nweaponry that could be assessed at even lower yields. For the sake of \nargument, however, lets be conservative and assume that other nations \nwould also need to conduct tests at a level above 1,000 tons to develop \na new nuclear weapon design.\n  The verification system of the CTBT is supposed to detect nuclear \nblasts above 1,000 tons, so it would seem at first glance that it will \nbe likely that most cheaters would be caught. We need to look at the \nfine print, however. In reality, the CTBT system will be able to detect \ntests of 1,000 tons or more if they were nonevasive and take place at \nknown test sites. This means that the cheater will be caught only if he \ndoes not try to hide his nuclear test. But, what if he does want to \nhide it? What if he conducts his test evasively?\n  From the hearings I have attended, it seems that evasive testing may \nbe a very simple task for Russia, China, or others. One of the best \nknown means of evasion is detonating the nuclear device in a cavity \nsuch as a salt dome or a room mined below ground. This technique--\ncalled decoupling--reduces the noise, or the seismic signal, of the \nnuclear detonation.\n  The change in the signal of a decoupled test is so significant--it \ncan be reduced by as much as a factor of 70-- that it will be \nimpossible for any known technology to detect it. For example, a 1,000-\nton evasive test would have a signal of a 14-ton nonevasive test. This \nputs the signal of the illicit test well below the threshold of \ndetection. Decoupling is a well-known technique and is technologically \nsimple to achieve. In fact, it is quite likely that Russia and China \nhave continued to conduct nuclear testing during the past 7 years, \nwhile the United States has refrained from doing so.\n  If the CTBT were not going to affect U.S. capabilities, it would not \nbe important whether the treaty were verified or not. The fact is, \nhowever, that the CTBT will freeze the U.S. nuclear weapons program and \nwill make it impossible to assess with high confidence whether \nmodifications made to the current stockpile will function as intended. \nAnd because there are limits to verifying compliance with the treaty, \nit will not effectively constrain other nations in the same way. That \nmeans they will ultimately be able to gain advantage, at the expense of \nthe United States and our defensive posture.\n  Second, I want to touch on an issue that does not regard the text of \nthe treaty, but the so-called six safeguards. I will not be able to get \ninto detail on all of them, but it seems these safeguards have been \ndiscussed as if they were part of the treaty itself. In reality, these \nsafeguards are just promises made by President Clinton. Even if they \nare contained in the Resolution of Ratification, these safeguards are \nstill subject to congressional and budgetary pressures.\n  For instance, safeguard A states that the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram must be able to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety \nand reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile. My concern \nis, what if the program runs into budgetary programs and a few \nCongressmen decide we are spending too much money on the program and \nattempt to kill the program?\n  Also, I know there are special interest groups that support the CTBT \nbut oppose the Stockpile Stewardship Program and will put domestic \npolitical pressure on all of us to reduce and end\n\n[[Page S12280]]\n\nthe Stockpile Stewardship Program and instead fund other programs.\n  Another example of budgetary and political pressures can be \nassociated with a safeguard E. This safeguard insists on the continuing \ndevelopment of a broad range of intelligence gathering and analytical \ncapabilities. This safeguard is already being tested. This \nadministration already attempted to cancel the WC-135 aircraft, citing \nfunding considerations. The WC-135 is essential to U.S. monitoring of \nnuclear tests. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I fought for \nits continued funding. If safeguard E were taken seriously by this \nadministration, they would not be attempting to cancel a program that \nis essential to monitoring, but would be fully funding these important \nprograms.\n  For these reasons and many others, I must oppose this treaty --not \nbecause I want testing, but for the fact that I cannot yet rely upon an \nuntested future program for the safety of our nuclear deterrent. Maybe \none day I can support a zero-yield plan. But now is not the time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to ask my friend one question \non my time, if he is willing.\n  Does the Senator believe that if we defeat this treaty and allow for \ncontinued testing, there will be the consensus in this Congress, or in \nany future Congress, to spend $4.5 billion a year for the next 10 years \nto fund the Stockpile Stewardship Program?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I think that, right now, we have the desire within this \nCongress to continue to fund the stockpile program. I think many of us \nbelieve it is an option. It needs to be scientifically developed. We \ndon't have the science there. I personally have that commitment. I also \nbelieve we are developing the technology where we can take our own \ndefense systems--we can take our own rocket and meet it with another \nrocket that has a nuclear warhead on it, intercept it. Lately, we have \nbegun to demonstrate our ability to do that.\n  I think ultimately we will be able to stop nuclear proliferation when \nwe eliminate the threat of the nuclear warhead going over any other \ncountry other than the country from which it was shot. So if we shoot \nit off over the country from which the missile was launched, then the \nonly hazard is to the country that has the warhead. When we develop \nthat technical capability, then I think we will have a real deterrence. \nAnd I don't believe that is far away, by the way.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, regarding that, I point out to my friend \nthat the ability to do that is in direct proportion to the lack of a \nMIRV'd capability on the part of other countries--that is, other \ncountries being able to put multi-reentry nuclear missiles on a vehicle \nto fire at us.\n  All of the technology and testimony from all sources has indicated \nthat for countries that don't have that capability now to be able to \nmove to that capability, which requires them to have a much lighter \nphysics package, or nuclear package on top of a missile--it must be \nlighter, and it must have a boost capacity--in order for them to \ndevelop that, they will have to have testing which is detectable beyond \nanybody's doubt.\n  So I make the point that the ability to establish a credible missile \ndefense is directly dependent upon the ability of us to keep other \nnations from developing the ability to have MIRV'd reentry vehicles.\n  I yield 10 minutes now to my friend from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my father, Leon Wellstone, was born in \nOdessa in the Ukraine. His family moved several times to stay ahead of \nthe pogroms. Most of his earlier years he spent in Khabarovsk, Siberia, \nFar East Russia. He came to our country in 1914. He fled persecution. \nHe never could go back home. In all likelihood, his parents were \nmurdered by Stalin.\n  Mr. President, my father spent most of his life in our country in \nWashington, DC, and during the night of August 7, 1945, he wrote this \nessay to himself:\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On the day after Hiroshima, I endlessly wandered around \n     town, dazed, lost, adrift. Like a man who suddenly lost all \n     his earthly possessions, his family, his hopes; who is \n     completely and inconsolably bereft; who is stupefied with \n     misery of a depth and poignancy beyond words; who no longer \n     knows where he is going to or why; who can think of nothing \n     but appalling ruin, and nothing save the keenest anxiety and \n     travail and death.\n       Then, too tired to walk any more, I headed for an old hotel \n     downtown and came in and sat down. Some months ago I had \n     discovered its lobby. It was shabby and ancient, full of old \n     and creaky furniture that spoke of in numerable years of \n     service bolstered by many fixings and patchings and new coats \n     of paint.\n       Everywhere was evidence of age and wear and tear and \n     fatigue. And yet, for all that, the lobby radiated an air of \n     confidence and determined survival.\n       Whatever else was in question--an endless list!--one thing \n     at least had appeared certain: that, though changing with the \n     years in manner and pace, life would go on. It was infinitely \n     comforting and appealing to think that it would.\n       Now that thought was rudely and cruelly shaken by the blast \n     of a bomb. It was a thing we had only imagined in myths and \n     fables. A fiery augury of the world's end. A revelation, \n     stunning and merciless and naked, that this seemingly solid \n     and enduring world of iron, brick, concrete, flesh and bone \n     can vanish as quickly as a sizzling drop of moisture on a hot \n     stove.\n       Try as I might I could not rid myself of direst \n     premonitions, nor halt my urgent questionings, nor feel a \n     measure of security any longer, nor imagine how the outlook \n     might brighten, nor decide how some peace of mind could be \n     recaptured.\n       I sat there miles deep in searching thought, unaware of \n     time's passing, hating to return to normal duties. What was \n     the sense of hurrying now? Or the need or purpose to any \n     activity? Why was I, of all men, so shocked and grieved? A \n     life of doubt is possible. But a life of the keenest distress \n     is not. I had found life and the society of men greatly \n     wanting. I had been a pessimist. but now all this was \n     pointless, irrelevant, outlandish.\n       Only he finds life wanting who also loves it. The idea that \n     this world might soon be no more was an outrage on all logic. \n     It made no sense that a thing of such scope and infinite \n     variety should be doomed to final erasure. I did not care \n     about my own life; I have lived most of it and might not live \n     much longer. But there were the children. And natural beauty. \n     And pictures in the galleries. And fine musical scores. And \n     great books.\n       I thought of all this and looked about. Never had I felt \n     the lobby so quaint, dear, beguiling. Now I liked its \n     creaking chairs--music to my ears. I liked the shabby walls \n     that have watched so long people drift in and out. I liked \n     the ridiculous pictures on the walls with their flavor of \n     bygone days. I liked the wornout rugs.\n       Why should I care if the world were turned to cinders? I, \n     who had in the past thought on occasion that it had \n     abundantly merited such a fate? Yet I cared--fiercely, \n     greatly, vehemently. And I could not still my indignation or \n     contain my bitter revulsion.\n       Finally I left the lobby. I could see nothing ahead but \n     ruin. But outside, on the street, life was astir as ever. Oh, \n     the wonder, stimulation, the comfort of the living scene when \n     you had just thought of charred nullity!\n       There were tears in my heart.\n\n  Many people then were cheering after they dropped that bomb. I think \nmy father was profound.\n  Leon, your words are part of the official Congressional Record, part \nof the Senate deliberations, and I believe your words have a poignancy \nand a relevancy to this historic debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, three years ago, President Clinton became the first \nworld leader to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. On that day, \nthe President praised the treaty as the ``longest-sought, hardest-\nfought prize in the history of arms control.''\n  We as a nation cannot afford to lose this valuable prize. With the \nratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we have a unique \nopportunity in the Senate to help end nuclear testing once and for all. \nRatification is the single most important step we can take--here and \nnow--to reduce the threat of nuclear war, which is what my father was \ntalking about.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is in the interest of the American \npeople and it has widespread public support. It will strengthen our \nnuclear nonproliferation efforts by reassuring non-nuclear weapon \nstates that states with nuclear weapons will be unable to develop and \ndeploy new types of nuclear weapons. It will keep non-nuclear countries \nfrom deploying advanced nuclear weapons systems even if they have the \ncapability to design them. Further, it will improve our ability to\n\n[[Page S12281]]\n\ndetect any nuclear weapons test, with other countries paying 75 percent \nof the bill for the International Monitoring System.\n  Ratification will help push India and Pakistan to sign and ratify the \nTest Ban Treaty. This may be one of the few steps taken to bring these \ntwo countries back from the brink of nuclear war, until there is a \nresolution of the terrible conflict in Kashmir. Further, ratification \nby the Senate will encourage Russia, China, and other states to follow \nsuit, just as we witnessed when the United States first ratified the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  Some say ratification of the treaty is a bad idea because it would be \ntoo risky. They say the treaty is too risky because countries might \ncheat. As Secretary Albright said yesterday in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, ``By approving the treaty, what exactly would we be risking? \nWith no treaty, other countries can test without cheating, and without \nlimit.''\n  In 1963, President Kennedy negotiated the landmark Limited Test Ban \nTreaty with the Soviet Union to ban tests in the atmosphere. That year, \nhe spoke of his vision of a broader treaty in his commencement address \nat American University. As he said:\n\n       The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, \n     would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most \n     dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a \n     position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest \n     hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of \n     nuclear arms. It would increase our security--it would \n     decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is \n     sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, \n     yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole \n     effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital \n     and responsible safeguards.\n\n  These words are as true today as they were in 1963. Some of the \ngeopolitical circumstances have changed, the Soviet empire has \ncollapsed, as have the names and the faces of those on the floor \ndebating today. But, in other very important ways, the debate today is \nquite similar:\n  Then, as now, there were concerns about our ability to maintain a \nstrong nuclear deterrent under the treaty;\n  Then, as now, there were questions about whether Moscow would cheat; \nand,\n  Then as now, there were concerns about the ability of the United \nStates to effectively verify the Treaty.\n  Fortunately, the forces in favor of nonproliferation won that battle. \nThe story since 1963 has been one in which our deterrent posture did \nnot suffer, even though we gave up certain types of testing. Further, \nwe gained the respect of the world for reining in the nuclear arms \nrace. That achievement led five years later to U.S. diplomatic success \nin negotiating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the treaty \nbanning nuclear weapons in Latin America--treaties that have been \nprofoundly successful in constraining the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Like our colleagues in the Senate in 1963, we must put away partisan \npolitics and ratify the treaty before us. This Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty is a good treaty. It is not perfect, but no treaty produced by \nover a hundred countries will ever be. The benefits outweigh the risk. \nWe must act on it.\n  I hope my colleagues who now oppose the CTBT, or who are undecided, \nwill think hard about what the consequences would be if the treaty were \nnot approved. I believe it is not an exaggeration to say that there \nwill be jubilation among our foes and despair among our friends. North \nKorea, Iran, and Iraq will feel entirely without constraints in \npursuing their nuclear aspirations. With China, we will have thrown \naway a valuable tool for slowing the modernization of its nuclear \narsenal. We will have reduced our credibility on nonproliferation \nissues with Moscow when we have continually urged it to take \nproliferation seriously.\n  No matter what some of my colleagues in this body might believe, we \ncannot do this alone. We need cooperation from our European allies in \ncontrolling exports if we are to prevent states from acquiring nuclear \nweapons. France, for instance, which has ratified the CTBT, will be \neven less inclined to listen to us, if we walk away from the treaty, \nwhen we implore them to contain Iraq and Iran.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to think carefully before voting, put \npartisan politics aside, and to cast your vote on behalf of a safer \nworld, and in favor of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a series of \nletters be printed at an appropriate place in the Record.\n  These are letters from the six former secretaries of defense, former \nmajority leader, Bob Dole, and Dr. Edward Teller, among others.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: We write to express the strong \n     opposition of our organizations and the millions of Americans \n     we represent to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n       As conservatives, we believe that the first responsibility \n     of government is to provide for the common defense. This \n     treaty will make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain \n     the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent--a \n     military capability that has for fifty years been central to \n     our defense, and that is likely to continue to do so for the \n     foreseeable future.\n       President Clinton has explicitly embraced a policy he and \n     former Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary have called ``denucle-\n     arization.'' In a 1996 report issued by the House National \n     Security Committee, its chairman, Rep. Floyd Spence, warned \n     that the effect of this policy is ``erosion [of our nuclear \n     deterrent] by design.''\n       Were the United States to become party to a binding \n     prohibition on nuclear testing, this policy would be made \n     practically irreversible and its insidious effects \n     accelerated. Unfortunately, nations whose nuclear weapons \n     programs cause us concern (e.g., Russia, China, North Korea, \n     Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, etc.), however, would likely not be \n     similarly affected. They generally are less concerned than we \n     about the need for safety and effectiveness that has driven \n     America's nuclear arsenal to be comprised of the world's most \n     sophisticated weapons. Alternatively, they can always cheat \n     without fear of detection, thanks to the CTBT's \n     unverifiability.\n       We are also troubled by the evidence that many proponents \n     of the CTBT seem to have more than unilateral American \n     disarmament in mind. In a manner all to reminiscent of the \n     nuclear freeze movement of the 1980s, left-wing activists and \n     their allies appear intent on using the effort to compel the \n     Senate to approve this Treaty as a device for energizing \n     their political base. The stakes associated with this \n     misbegotten accord are too great for it to be addressed in \n     such a cynical way.\n       For all these reasons, we commend you for your strong \n     opposition to the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty. We urge your colleagues to join you in taking the \n     steps necessary to ensure that a safe and reliable nuclear \n     deterrent remains a key ingredient in our common defense.\n           Sincerely,\n         Frank J.

Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n                                                    Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: As the Senate weighs \n     whether to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), \n     we believe Senators will be obliged to focus on one\n\n[[Page S12282]]\n\n     dominant, inescapable result were it to be ratified: over the \n     decades ahead, confidence in the reliability of our nuclear \n     weapons stockpile would inevitably decline, thereby reducing \n     the credibility of America's nuclear deterrent. Unlike \n     previous efforts at a CTBT, this Treaty is intended to be of \n     unlimited duration, and though ``nuclear weapon test \n     explosion'' is undefined in the Treaty, by America's \n     unilateral declaration the accord is ``zero-yield,'' meaning \n     that all nuclear tests, even of the lowest yield, are \n     permanently prohibited.\n       The nuclear weapons in our nation's arsenal are \n     sophisticated devices, whose thousands of components must \n     function together with split-second timing and scant margin \n     for error. A nuclear weapon contains radioactive material, \n     which in itself decays, and also changes the properties of \n     other materials within the weapon. Over time, the components \n     of our weapons corrode and deteriorate, and we lack \n     experience predicting the effects of such aging on the safety \n     and reliability of the weapons. The shelf life of U.S. \n     nuclear weapons was expected to be some 20 years. In the \n     past, the constant process of replacement and testing of new \n     designs gave some assurance that weapons in the arsenal would \n     be both new and reliable. But under the CTBT, we would be \n     vulnerable to the effects of aging because we could not test \n     ``fixes'' of problems with existing warheads.\n       Remanufacturing components of existing weapons that have \n     deteriorated also poses significant problems. Manufacturers \n     go out of business, materials and production processes \n     change, certain chemicals previously used in production are \n     now forbidden under new environmental regulations, and so on. \n     It is a certainty that new processes and materials--\n     untested--will be used. Even more important, ultimately the \n     nuclear ``pits'' will need to be replaced--and we will not be \n     able to test those replacements. The upshot is that new \n     defects may be introduced into the stockpile through \n     remanufacture, and without testing we can never be certain \n     that these replacement components will work as their \n     predecessors did.\n       Another implication of a CTBT of unlimited duration is that \n     over time we would gradually lose our pool of knowledgeable \n     people with experience in nuclear weapons design and testing. \n     Consider what would occur if the United States halted nuclear \n     testing for 30 years. We would then be dependent on the \n     judgment of personnel with no personal experience either in \n     designing or testing nuclear weapons. In place of a learning \n     curve, we would experience an extended unlearning curve.\n       Furthermore, major gaps exist in our scientific \n     understanding of nuclear explosives. As President Bush noted \n     in a report to Congress in January 1993, ``Of all U.S. \n     nuclear weapons designs fielded since 1958, approximately \n     one-third have required nuclear testing to resolve problems \n     arising after deployment.'' We were discovering defects in \n     our arsenal up until the moment when the current moratorium \n     on U.S. testing was imposed in 1992. While we have \n     uncovered similar defects since 1992, which in the past \n     would have led to testing, in the absence of testing, we \n     are not able to test whether the ``fixes'' indeed work.\n       Indeed, the history of maintaining complex military \n     hardware without testing demonstrates the pitfalls of such an \n     approach. Prior to World War II, the Navy's torpedoes had not \n     been adequately tested because of insufficient funds. It took \n     nearly two years of war before we fully solved the problems \n     that caused our torpedoes to routinely pass harmlessly under \n     the target or to fail to explode on contact. For example, at \n     the Battle of Midway, the U.S. launched 47 torpedo aircraft, \n     without damaging a single Japanese ship. If not for our dive \n     bombers, the U.S. would have lost the crucial naval battle of \n     the Pacific war.\n       The Department of Energy has structured a program of \n     experiments and computer simulations called the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program, that it hopes will allow our weapons to \n     be maintained without testing. This program, which will not \n     be mature for at least 10 years, will improve our scientific \n     understanding of nuclear weapons and would likely mitigate \n     the decline in our confidence in the safety and reliability \n     of our arsenal. We will never know whether we should trust \n     Stockpile Stewardship if we cannot conduct nuclear tests to \n     calibrate the unproven new techniques. Mitigation is, of \n     course, not the same as prevention. Over the decades, the \n     erosion of confidence inevitably would be substantial.\n       The decline in confidence in our nuclear deterrent is \n     particularly troublesome in light of the unique geopolitical \n     role of the United States. The U.S. has a far-reaching \n     foreign policy agenda and our forces are stationed around the \n     globe. In addition, we have pledged to hold a nuclear \n     umbrella over our NATO allies and Japan. Though we have \n     abandoned chemical and biological weapons, we have threatened \n     to retaliate with nuclear weapons to such an attack. In the \n     Gulf War, such a threat was apparently sufficient to deter \n     Iraq from using chemical weapons against American troops.\n       We also do not believe the CTBT will do much to prevent the \n     spread of nuclear weapons. The motivation of rogue nations \n     like North Korea and Iraq to acquire nuclear weapons will not \n     be affected by whether the U.S. tests. Similarly, the \n     possession of nuclear weapons by nations like India, \n     Pakistan, and Israel depends on the security environment in \n     their region, not by whether or not the U.S. tests. If \n     confidence in the U.S. nuclear deterrent were to decline, \n     countries that have relied on our protection could well feel \n     compelled to seek nuclear capabilities of their own. Thus, \n     ironically, the CTBT might cause additional nations to seek \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Finally, it is impossible to verify a ban that extends to \n     very low yields. The likelihood of cheating is high. ``Trust \n     but verify'' should remain our guide. Tests with yields below \n     1 kiloton can both go undetected and be militarily useful to \n     the testing state. Furthermore, a significantly larger \n     explosion can go undetected--or be mistaken for a \n     conventional explosion used for mining or an earthquake--if \n     the test is ``decoupled.'' Decoupling involves conducting the \n     test in a large underground cavity and has been shown to \n     dampen an explosion's seismic signature by a factor of up to \n     70. The U.S. demonstrated this capability in 1966 in two \n     tests conducted in salt domes at Chilton, Mississippi.\n       We believe that these considerations render a permanent, \n     zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty incompatible with \n     the Nation's international commitments and vital security \n     interests and believe it does not deserve the Senate's advice \n     and consent. Accordingly, we respectively urge you and your \n     colleagues to preserve the right of this nation to conduct \n     nuclear tests necessary to the future viability of our \n     nuclear deterrent by rejecting approval of the present CTBT.\n           Respectfully,\n     James R. Schlesinger.\n     Frank C. Carlucci.\n     Donald H. Rumsfeld.\n     Richard B. Cheney.\n     Caspar W. Weinberger.\n     Melvin R. Laird.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                  October 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Trent: I am responding to your October 4 letter, in \n     which you ask for my views on the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty (CTBT).\n       As you know, I believe that matters of foreign policy and \n     national security should be approached from a nonpartisan \n     perspective. As such, I have supported a number of Clinton \n     administration initiatives when I believed them to be in the \n     national interest--for example, NATO action in Kosova and \n     ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. \n     Unfortunately, in this substance, I cannot support President \n     Clinton's effect to secure Senate approval of the CTBT.\n       In my view, ratifying the CTBT would endanger the national \n     security of the United States, primarily by preventing \n     nuclear testing essential to maintaining the safety and \n     reliability of our nuclear deterrent. It is through explosive \n     testing that the United States has maintained its confidence \n     in the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile \n     and, thus, the credibility of our nuclear arsenal. Without \n     explosive testing, the credibility of our arsenal will, with \n     time, erode. As credibility erodes, the deterrent effect of \n     our nuclear force erodes, leaving not only America \n     increasingly vulnerable, but also our allies who depend on \n     the American nuclear umbrella.\n       While the Stockpile Stewardship program is worth pursuing, \n     it should be viewed as a complement to our nuclear testing \n     program--not a substitute for it. Explosive nuclear testing \n     is a proven method of identifying stockpile problems. The \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program is not yet in place and is \n     therefore unproved. Deciding in 1999 to forego testing and \n     instead to rely on a program that will be in place in 2010--\n     it all goes well--is, in short, irresponsible.\n       Furthermore, agreeing to the CTBT would most certainly lead \n     to a false sense of security. The Administration has argued \n     that by embracing the CTBT, the United States will persuade \n     other countries, including notable proliferators such as \n     North Korea, to halt their quest for nuclear weapons and the \n     means to deliver them. If a regime like Pyongyang has been \n     susceptible to moral suasion or felt bound by international \n     norms, it would never have violated the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). The idea that rogue regimes \n     are persuaded by American or broader international \n     adherence to legal obligations is wishful thinking. These \n     regimes are called rogue regimes for the very reason that \n     they regularly violate international law and refuse to be \n     held accountable to international norms. The only way to \n     deal effectively with threats from rogue states is to \n     deter them.\n       There should be no doubt that the best way to protect the \n     United States from the consequences of proliferation is to \n     develop and deploy effective missile defenses. There is no \n     arms control treaty that can protect American territory from \n     nuclear attack. And, with each day, America's enemies come \n     closer to acquiring the capabilities to attack the United \n     States with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The \n     best deterrents are a credible nuclear stockpile and a \n     national missile defense system.\n       Neither President Reagan nor President Bush pursued a zero-\n     yield test ban treaty of unlimited duration, and for good \n     reason. The CTBT is an ill-conceived and misguided arms \n     control agreement, the ultimate result of which will be the \n     de-nuclearization by other means, of the United States. This \n     treaty is hardly the ``longest sought, hardest fought\n\n[[Page S12283]]\n\n     prize in arms control history,'' as claimed by this \n     Administration.\n       I support arms controls that increase the security of the \n     United States, not ones that increase the vulnerability of \n     our nation to terrorists and regimes bent on nuclear \n     proliferation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Garrison, MN,\n\n                                                  October 5, 1999.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: If the news reports are correct, the \n     Armed Services Committee will be addressing the proposed \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in the next few days. \n     Although I will not be able to be in Washington during the \n     hearings, I want you to have at least a synopsis of my views \n     on the matter.\n       I believe that ratifying the treaty requiring a permanent, \n     zero-yield ban on all underground nuclear tests is not in the \n     security interest of the United States.\n       From 1945 through the end of the Cold War, the United \n     States was clearly the preeminent nuclear power in the world. \n     During much of that time, the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet \n     Union surpassed ours in numbers, but friends and allies, as \n     well as potential enemies and other nations not necessarily \n     friendly to the United States, all understood that we were \n     the nation with the very modern, safe, secure, reliable, \n     nuclear deterrent force which provided the foundation for the \n     security of our nation and for the security of our friends \n     and allies, and much of the world. Periodic underground \n     nuclear tests were an essential part of insuring that our \n     nuclear deterrent force remained modern, safe, secure, \n     reliable and usable. The general knowledge that the United \n     States would do whatever was necessary to maintain that \n     condition certainly reduced the proliferation of nuclear \n     weapons during the period and added immeasurably to the \n     security cooperation with our friends and allies.\n       Times have changed; the Soviet Union no longer exists; \n     however, much of its nuclear arsenal remains in the hands of \n     Russia. We have seen enormous political, economic, social and \n     technological changes in the world since the end of the Cold \n     War, and these changes have altered the security situation \n     and future security requirements for the United States. One \n     thing has not changed. Nuclear weapons continue to be with \n     us. I do not believe that God will permit us to ``uninvent'' \n     nuclear weapons. Some nation, or power, will be the \n     preeminent nuclear power in the world, and I, for one, \n     believe that at least under present and foreseeable \n     conditions, the world will be safer if that power is the \n     United States of America. We jeopardize maintaining that \n     condition by eschewing the development of new nuclear weapons \n     and by ruling out testing if and when it is needed.\n       Supporters of the CTBT argue that it reduces the chances \n     for nuclear proliferation. I applaud efforts to reduce the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons, but I do not believe that \n     the test ban will reduce the ability of rogue states to \n     acquire nuclear weapons in sufficient quantities to upset \n     regional security in various parts of the world. ``Gun type'' \n     nuclear weapons can be built with assurance they'll work \n     without testing. The Indian and Pakistani ``tests'' \n     apparently show that there is adequate knowledge available to \n     build implosion type weapons with reasonable assurance that \n     they will work. The India/Pakistan explosions have been \n     called ``tests'', but I believe it be more accurate to call \n     them ``demonstrations'', more for political purposes than for \n     scientific testing.\n       Technological advances of recent years, particularly the \n     great increases in computing power coupled with improvements \n     in modeling and simulation have undoubtedly reduced greatly \n     the need for active nuclear testing and probably the size of \n     any needed tests. Some would argue that this should be \n     support for the United States agreeing to ban testing. The \n     new technological advantages are available to everyone, and \n     they probably help the ``proliferator'' more than the United \n     States.\n       We have embarked on a ``stockpile stewardship program'' \n     designed to use science, other than nuclear testing, to \n     ensure that the present weapons in our nuclear deterrent \n     remain safe, secure and reliable. The estimates I've seen are \n     that we will spend about $5 billion each year on that \n     program. Over twenty years, if the program is completely \n     successful, we will have spent about $100 billion, and we \n     will have replaced nearly every single part in each of those \n     complex weapons. At the end of that period, about the best \n     that we will be able to say is that we have a stockpile of \n     ``restored'' weapons of at least thirty-year-old design that \n     are probably safe and secure and whose reliability is the \n     best we can make without testing. We will not be able to say \n     that the stockpile is modern, nor will we be assured that it \n     is usable in the sense of fitting the security situation we \n     will face twenty years hence. To me that seems to foretell a \n     situation of increasing vulnerability for us and our friends \n     and allies to threats from those who will not be deterred by \n     the Nonproliferation Treaty or the CTBT, and there will \n     surely be such states.\n       If the United States is to remain the preeminent nuclear \n     power, and maintain a modern safe, secure, reliable, and \n     usable nuclear deterrent force, I believe we need to continue \n     to develop new nuclear weapons designed to incorporate the \n     latest in technology and to meet the changing security \n     situation in the world. Changes in the threat, changes in \n     intelligence and targeting, and great improvements in \n     delivery precision and accuracy make the weapons we designed \n     thirty years ago less and less applicable to our current and \n     projected security situation. The United States, the one \n     nation most of the world looks to for securing peace in the \n     world, should not deny itself the opportunity to test the \n     bedrock building block of its security, its nuclear deterrent \n     force, if conditions require testing.\n       To those who would see in my words advocacy for a nuclear \n     buildup or advocacy for large numbers of high-yield nuclear \n     tests, let me say that I believe we can have a modern, safe, \n     secure, reliable and usable nuclear deterrent force at much \n     lower numbers than we now maintain. I believe we can keep it \n     modern and reliable with very few actual nuclear tests and \n     that those tests can in all likelihood be relatively low-\n     yield tests. I also believe that the more demonstrably modern \n     and usable is our nuclear deterrent force, the less likely \n     are we to need to use it, but we must have modern weapons, \n     and we ought not deny ourselves the opportunity to test if we \n     deem it necessary.\n           Very respectfully yours,\n\n                                               John W. Vessey,\n\n                                              General, USA (Ret.),\n     Former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                  October 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: The Senate is beginning \n     hearings on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (``CTBT''), \n     looking to an October 12 vote on whether or not to ratify. We \n     believe, however, that it is not in the national interest to \n     vote on the Treaty, at least during the life of the present \n     Congress.\n       The simple fact is that the Treaty will not enter into \n     force any time soon, whether or not the United States \n     ratifies it during the 106th Congress. This means that few, \n     if any, of the benefits envisaged by the Treaty's advocates \n     could be realized by Senate ratification now. At the same \n     time, there could be real costs and risks to a broad range of \n     national security interests--including our non-proliferation \n     objectives--if Senate acts prematurely.\n       Ratification of the CTBT by the U.S. now will not result in \n     the Treaty coming into force this fall, as anticipated at its \n     signing. Given its objectives, the Treaty wisely requires \n     that each of 44 specific countries must sign and ratify the \n     document before it enters into force. Only 23 of those \n     countries have done so thus far. So the Treaty is not coming \n     into force any time soon, whether or not the U.S. ratifies. \n     The U.S. should take advantage of this situation to delay \n     consideration of ratification, without prejudice to eventual \n     action on the Treaty. This would provide the opportunity to \n     learn more about such issues as movement on the ratification \n     process, technical progress in the Department of Energy's \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program, the political consequences of \n     the India/Pakistan detonations, changing Russian doctrine \n     toward greater reliance on nuclear weapons, and continued \n     Chinese development of a nuclear arsenal.\n       Supporters of the CTBT claim that it will make a major \n     contribution to limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. This \n     cannot be true if key countries of proliferation concern do \n     not agree to accede to the Treaty. To date, several of these \n     countries, including India, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran, \n     Iraq, and Syria, have not signed and ratified the Treaty. \n     Many of these countries may never join the CTBT regime, and \n     ratification by the United States, early or late, is unlikely \n     to have any impact on their decisions in this regard. For \n     example, no serious person should believe that rogue nations \n     like Iran or Iraq will give up their efforts to acquire \n     nuclear weapons if only the United States signs the CTBT.\n       Our efforts to combat proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction not only deserve but are receiving the highest \n     national security priority. It is clear to any fair-minded \n     observer that the United States has substantially reduced its \n     reliance on nuclear weapons. The U.S. also has made or \n     committed to dramatic reductions in the level of deployed \n     nuclear forces. Nevertheless, for the foreseeable future, the \n     United States must continue to rely on nuclear weapons to \n     contribute to the deterrence of certain kinds of attacks on \n     the United States, its friends, and allies. In addition, \n     several countries depend on the U.S. nuclear deterrent for \n     their security. A lack of confidence in that deterrent might \n     itself result in the spread of nuclear weapons.\n       As a consequence, the United States must continue to ensure \n     that its nuclear weapons remain safe, secure, and reliable. \n     But the fact is that the scientific case simply has not been \n     made that, over the long term, the United States can ensure \n     the nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing. The United \n     States is seeking to ensure the integrity of its nuclear \n     deterrent through an ambitious effort called the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program. This program attempts to maintain \n     adequate knowledge of nuclear weapons physics indirectly by \n     computer modeling,\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\n     simulation, and other experiments. We support this kind of \n     scientific and analytical effort. But even with adequate \n     funding--which is far from assured--the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program is not sufficiently mature to evaluate the extent to \n     which it can be a suitable alternative to testing.\n       Given the absence of any pressing reason for early \n     ratification, it is unwise to take actions now that constrain \n     this or future Presidents' choices about how best to pursue \n     our non-proliferation and other national security goals while \n     maintaining the effectiveness and credibility of our nuclear \n     deterrent. Accordingly, we urge you to reach an understanding \n     with the President to suspend action on the CTBT, at least \n     for the duration of the 106th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Brent Scowcroft.\n     Henry A. Kissinger.\n     John Deutch.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to take just a couple of minutes \nuntil Senator Coverdell arrives, at which point I will suspend my \nremarks so that he can make some comments.\n  I want to talk a little bit about a common thread of the remarks of \nmany of the people who are in opposition to the treaty; that is, that \nit is difficult for the United States to sustain our position as the \nworld leader, that many in the international community would find it \nobjectionable if the United States rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, and that this would hurt our ability to lead with respect to \nproliferation of nuclear weapons in the world.\n  Let me quote from a newspaper story today in the Washington Post, the \nheadline of which is, ``U.S. Allies Urge Senate To Ratify Test Ban.''\n  It is certainly true that they have done that. There are a variety of \nthem that made comments hoping we would adopt the treaty, not defeat \nit. Let me quote a couple of things.\n\n       International anxiety also has been compounded by new \n     worries over U.S. efforts to escape constraints imposed by \n     the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which limits the \n     ability of the United States to build systems to defend \n     against missile attack.\n       Russia and China say it would destabilize the strategic \n     balance if the United States built a missile defense system, \n     because Washington could be tempted to attack others if it \n     felt invulnerable to retaliation.\n       Jayantha Dhanapala, the U.N. under secretary for \n     disarmament affairs, said many countries agree to a permanent \n     inspection regime four years ago only on the basis of a \n     written guarantee by the nuclear powers to negotiate and \n     ratify a worldwide test ban as one of several key steps \n     toward nuclear disarmament.\n\n  I read two parts of the Washington Post story to suggest the world \ncommunity, which does not want the United States to develop a ballistic \nmissile defense, which doesn't want the United States to do anything \nthat requires an amendment to the ABM Treaty, and some of which is very \nmuch in favor of total nuclear disarmament and has agreed to \nparticipate in this treaty only after leaders promised them this \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty would be one of several key steps toward \nnuclear disarmament, all of those people in the world, I submit, are \nnot people who we want to make U.S. national defense policy. Their \ngoals are not the same as our goals.\n  We have an obligation as the leader of the free world to ensure our \nnuclear deterrent is safe and reliable; they don't. We may have to do \nthings they could never dream of doing, including nuclear testing to \nensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. They don't \nhave to worry about that, but we do. While they can lament the fact \nthat the United States is not willing to sign onto the treaty, they \ndon't have the same responsibility as we do, just as they can call for \nus not to amend the ABM Treaty or to build a national missile defense \nor even theater missile defenses without the obligations that The \nUnited States has.\n  The United States has to defend our troops around the world--which \nmost of these countries don't have to do--to defend allies around the \nworld and, of course, even to defend the United States. I, frankly, \ndon't care much if people around the world who don't want the United \nStates to defend itself against ballistic missile attack are going to \ncriticize the Senate for rejecting a flawed unverifiable ineffective \nCTBT.\n  Finally, quoting from the last two paragraphs of this article:\n\n       I don't like to talk about any country exercising world \n     leadership, but in this case we see that the United States \n     must play a special role, Sha Zukang, China's top arms \n     control official, said in an interview. Sha added that China \n     is even more alarmed by U.S. efforts to develop a regional \n     missile defense system than by the Senate's reluctance to \n     approve a test ban treaty.\n\n  So I presume that next, in order to assuage the concerns of the \nChinese, we will forego the development of a regional missile defense \nsystem because it would upset them if we proceeded with that. Why would \nit upset them? Because, of course, they wouldn't be able to threaten \nTaiwan. We have obligations that other countries don't have. If we are \nto be the great leader that people on this side of the aisle have urged \nthe United States to be, then we have to exercise leadership. Sometimes \nthat means doing things other people in the world are uncomfortable \nwith.\n\n       Boris Kvok, Russia's deputy chief of disarmament issues, \n     said the U.S. decision on the test ban treaty would not \n     affect the deliberations of Russia's parliament on the pact \n     or alter his country's test moratorium. ``But if the U.S. \n     moves ahead with ballistic missile defense, it would be a \n     disaster . . . and we would have to start developing new \n     weapons. . . .''\n\n  He is saying we don't really care about the CTBT in terms of what we \nare going to do, but if the United States moves ahead with ballistic \nmissiles, that would be a disaster. I presume next we hear people come \nto the Senate floor and say international opinion says we should not \ndevelop a missile defense to protect the people of the United States so \nwe should not move forward with that.\n  My point is this: The United States cannot be held hostage to world \nopinion. We have obligations they don't have, and if they don't care \nabout building a defense for their people, we need to because we can be \na target of rogue nations whereas other countries may not be. They are \nnot making the decisions and actions in the world that may cause these \nterrorists or rogue states to want to retaliate against them. However, \nthe United States, by taking a world leadership role, has put itself in \nthat position.\n  It is not a political issue; it is a physics issue. We have to have \nconfidence in our nuclear stockpile.\n  The whole world thought Ronald Reagan was wrong, that he had left his \nsenses when he said no to Mikhail Gorbachev at Reykjavik. They both \ntalked about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons. When Gorbachev \nsaid the price of that agreement was that the United States would have \nto forego the development of the Strategic Defense Initiative, Reagan \nsaid no. All of the world leaders gasped--except Margaret Thatcher. But \nthe rest of the world leaders gasped and said: Mr. President, you \nshould reconsider that.\n  All of the arms control advocates said it was a bad mistake for \nPresident Reagan to have said no. Of course, it later transpires that \nGeorge Shultz mentioned the fact that Mikhail Gorbachev told him that \nwas the turning point of the cold war. That is when Gorbachev concluded \nthat he could not win the cold war and called it the turning point.\n  Ronald Reagan, in calling the Soviet Union the evil empire, upset a \nlot of the world leaders, but he stood his ground and history has \nproven him correct. I submit that history will prove us correct if we \nreturn this flawed treaty and say let's go back to the drawing board.\n\n  We can do better. We can persuade world leaders it is in the best \ninterest of long-term peace that we do better than this flawed treaty.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself a few minutes to respond. I \nwill take no more than 3 minutes.\n  I hope all Members have observed why my friend from Arizona is such a \ngood lawyer. He did get your eye off the ball. He started off talking \nabout England and France and our allies and Japan and then shifted to \nSri Lanka, China, and Russia and talked about why we should not yield \nto international opinion. No one has suggested we yield to Sri Lanka, \nChina, and Russia in international opinion.\n  The suggestion made is exactly stated: Allies urge ratifying a test \nban treaty. Why? Because they believe it is in their critical interest. \nThey don't lack confidence in our ability to maintain our stockpile. \nThey signed and ratified the treaty.\n  This circular argumentation going on is we should not ratify because \nwe\n\n[[Page S12285]]\n\nwon't be able to protect our allies; but our allies say you should \nratify because we want you to ratify, we feel fully protected.\n  Who do you believe? Our allies saying they want us? They signed; we \nwant to sign.\n  Second, I point out this missile defense rests upon our allies in \nGreat Britain and in France and in Norway allowing us to be able to put \nsensors in their country in order to be able to have a missile defense. \nThat is the way it will work.\n  What will happen is, we turn down this treaty that they signed, that \nthey think is in their interests, and now we go to them and say: By the \nway, we want you to help us with a missile defense for our country--not \nyours, a theater missile defense for our country. How about it, \nfellows, what do you think?\n  The third point I would make is: China can only be a threat to our \ntheater missile defense. They have about 18 weapons right now. They can \nonly be a threat to us if they are able to MIRV their missiles, if they \nare able to get sophisticated. Under this agreement, the intelligence \ncommunity uniformly concludes that we could detect anything they are \ndoing to get to the point where they were MIRVing those missiles, \ntaking any of the stolen data they have gotten from us and using it. So \nwhat are we going to do? We reject this treaty, thereby giving a green \nlight to them to do what they want to do without violation of any \ninternational law, thereby putting in jeopardy the very missile defense \nsystem my friend from Arizona thinks is so critical for our security.\n  I find it fascinating. Keep your eye on the ball.\n  I yield the floor. I see the leader. Welcome, leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will have a full statement on Tuesday. But \nI did want to get into the Record today some of the facts I think are \nvery important for Senators to have access to, some views of a number \nof important experts.\n  I would entitle this statement with these words, a quote from \nChurchill: Facts are better than dreams. And the facts in this case \nargue against this treaty. The underlying premise of this treaty is \nflawed. The argument is, if we ratify this Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, then the rest of the world will be nice and follow suit.\n  Do you really believe that is applicable to North Korea, Iraq, Iran, \nIndia, Pakistan, China, Russia? We are going to act on faith? There are \nthose who will say we must lead, we must show the way, but that is a \nvery dangerous thing to do when you are dealing with something of this \nimportance.\n  Just in the last 2 days, in hearings before the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee, it has become apparent \nthat this treaty is flawed, should not be ratified now or in the \nforeseeable future. When you look at yesterday's testimony of the \nleaders of the country's three nuclear weapons laboratories, it makes \nit very clear that, as far as safety and reliability are concerned, \nwithout testing at this time we do not have the ability to make sure \nour weapons are safe and would be reliable if there were a need for \nthem.\n  The headline, even in the New York Times, says, ``Experts Say Test \nBan May Impair Nuclear Arms Safety.'' That is a fact. That is a scary \nfact. Do the American people want us to have nuclear arms that are not \ntested, that are not safe? I do not think so. So I think we need to be \nvery careful about going forward with a treaty that has the problems \nthis treaty has now, in terms of what it would do and the fact that we \ndo not have the ability to detect or verify what other countries may be \ndoing. Just this past week, the CIA said they could not guarantee they \ncould detect low-level testing in Russia. Then you add to that the \ntestimony of the labs experts. We should defeat this treaty.\n  Let me correct the record, or remind our colleagues and the country a \nlittle bit about why we are where we are. Why is this up? Why did we \nget a unanimous consent agreement to bring up this treaty, debate it, \nand have a vote? The President has been demanding it for 2 years. In \nhis State of the Union Addresses and on other occasions, he has been \nsaying: Call it up, have a debate, and vote. Quote after quote I have \nhere with me. The President said in remarks on the 50th anniversary of \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, August 9, 1999:\n\n       I ask the Senate . . . to vote for ratification as soon as \n     possible.\n\n  He has said:\n\n       . . . give its advice and consent to the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty this year.\n\n  In his State of the Union Address in 1998, he said:\n\n       . . . approve the CTBT this year.\n\n  That was last year.\n  The Vice President, Mr. Gore has said:\n\n       The U.S. Congress should act now to ratify the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n  ``Act now.'' That was July 23, 1998.\n  Forty-five Democrats sent a letter to Senator Helms saying a number \nof things, but basically this is the upshot of it: Give the Senate the \nopportunity to consider ratification of the CTBT before the conference \nbegins. That is a conference of ratifying states. That conference is \nunderway now. They wanted to have it up. We got it up and started the \ndebate today. They were demanding that it be called up and considered \nbefore then.\n\n  The minority leader has said:\n\n       [W]e are certainly willing to have a debate and have the \n     vote.\n\n  Not call it up and pass it; he said have a debate, have a vote.\n  On September 30, 1999, he said:\n\n       I still think, one way or the other, we ought to get to \n     this treaty, get it to the floor, debate it, and vote on it.\n\n  What I am saying is for 2 years there has been this agitation to get \nthis treaty up and have a vote on it. So finally they got what they \nsaid they wanted, and then they didn't want what they said they wanted.\n  Then they said: Wait a minute, wait a minute, no, we didn't mean \n``now.'' Like this thing was just sprung on us. For 2 years we have \nbeen hearing about it. Senators are not uninformed on this treaty. \nThere are hearings underway right now, excellent hearings by the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, and the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Helms. What happened was they \nfound, when they actually got what they said they wanted--that is, the \ntreaty was going to come up--that the treaty is flawed and it is going \nto be defeated. This treaty is not going to be ratified. It is not \ngoing to happen. They say: Wait, wait, wait; not now; it's too quick; \nwe need more time; it is being given short shrift.\n  I have some interesting facts on that, too. You talk about the amount \nof time. When we get through with this treaty and have a vote, we will \nhave probably somewhere around 16 to 18 hours discussing it, debating \nit, listening to each other, excellent statements on both sides, men \nand women very serious about this, treating it the way it should be \ntreated. Today, the problem has not been to get speakers. It is that we \nhave so many people who want to speak. We are going to have a good \ndebate today. But let's compare it to other treaties in the past.\n  The CFE, the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, we debated for 6 \nhours and voted on. The START treaty, 9\\1/2\\ hours; START II, 6 hours; \nChemical Weapons Convention--which I know a lot about and showed, \nduring the debate on that issue and the vote, that I was willing to do \nwhat I thought was right for the country even under a lot of pressure \nopposing it. I still get criticized for that.\n  But when you come to treaties of this magnitude of international \nimport, you have to look at the substance and you have to do what is \nright for your country, for the world situation, and for your children. \nActually, it should be in the reverse order: For your children and your \ngrandchildren. We spent 18 hours on it, and we voted on it.\n  The CFE flank agreement, 2 hours. As a matter of fact, we are going \nto have more time spent debating this issue, when it is over, than any \nrecent treaty, with the exception of chemical weapons, which I presume \nwould be about the same time.\n  So that is how we got to where we are. Because it was demanded. \nSenators were threatening to hold up Senate floor action if we did not \nhave a vote. Senators had resolutions they wanted to offer with regard \nto this\n\n[[Page S12286]]\n\ntreaty that were unrelated to other matters being considered on the \nfloor, including the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill.\n\n  So I really thought, in view of the demands and the discussion that \nhad gone on and the overall best interests of the Senate and the \ncountry, that this treaty should come up. So we got a unanimous consent \nagreement. It was not one that was sprung on anybody. I suggested it on \nWednesday. We did not get it finally agreed to and locked in until \nFriday. So the discussions went on for 2 days. Nobody was surprised. \nThe White House knew full well what we were about to agree to. Now they \nsay set it aside.\n  I am very worried; should this issue not be voted on now, it might be \nset aside to be brought back next year and that it become much more of \na political issue. And it should not be. We have for a long time worked \ntogether in this Senate on a bipartisan basis, and bicameral, and with \nadministrations, on trying to do the right thing on arms control. We \nshould continue to do that. This treaty should not come up next year \nduring a Presidential campaign and be used for political purposes on \neither side. So I called this up, as was demanded. We got a reasonable \ntime agreement, more than was usually granted for treaties.\n  There have been hearings underway. The Senators are not uninformed. \nSenators know what is in this treaty as they get to know more and \nlisten to experts, such as Senator Lugar yesterday who had a six-page \nstatement about how this treaty was wrong.\n  To my colleagues I say, we have done what was requested by the \nPresident and by Senators. Let's have this debate and, as for myself, I \nam ready to vote.\n  Mr. President, proponents and opponents of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty find themselves in agreement on the starting point for this \ndebate: That nuclear deterrence is fundamental to the national security \nof the United States. In his May of 1997 report entitled ``A National \nSecurity Strategy for a New Century,'' President Clinton states, and I \nquote, ``The United States must continue to maintain a robust triad of \nstrategic forces sufficient to deter any hostile foreign leadership \nwith access to any nuclear forces and to convince it that seeking a \nnuclear advantage would be futile.'' While the United States must be \nprepared for the prospect that nuclear deterrence may not always work, \nin no way does the possibility of failure render deterrence valueless.\n  Nuclear deterrence was crucial to U.S. security in the past, and will \ncontinue to be in the future.\n  It was, for example, nuclear deterrence which helped guarantee the \nsecurity of Western Europe from the late 1940s until the Soviet Union \ncollapsed and the cold war ended peacefully. President Eisenhower \ncalled on the U.S. nuclear deterrent to stop Chinese attacks against \nthe islands of Quemoy and Matsu in 1958. In 1962 it was the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent that enabled President Kennedy to demand that the \nSoviet Union peacefully withdraw its nuclear missiles from Cuba. Again, \nPresident Nixon called on the U.S. nuclear deterrent to stop Soviet \narmed intervention into the Middle East during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. \nAnd, most recently, the U.S. nuclear deterrent was essential in \npersuading Saddam Hussein not to use chemical or biological weapons \nduring the 1991 gulf war, undoubtedly saving thousands of lives. Time \nand again nuclear deterrence has effectively protected U.S. security \nwithout a shot being fired, and, along with the President and many \nothers, I expect our deterrent to continue to be vital for the \nindefinite future.\n  Credibility is the key to deterrence. Our nuclear deterrent must be \ncredible not only to would-be aggressors, but also to America's \nleaders. To contemplate the use of nuclear weapons, our leaders must be \nconfident in the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. Our \nadversaries must believe that U.S. leaders possess the will to use the \nnuclear force if need be, and must also believe that our nuclear \nweapons can be used--that they are safe and reliable enough for U.S. \nleaders to consider seriously the possibility of their use. Without \nthese conditions American threats of retaliation become less than \ncredible, and the contribution of nuclear deterrence to the national \nsecurity strategy of the United States would be unacceptably eroded.\n  It is the paradox of the nuclear age that ensuring nuclear weapons \nare never used depends on ensuring they can be used.\n  It is through testing of the U.S. nuclear stockpile that the United \nStates has maintained its confidence in the safety and reliability of \nour nuclear weapons. In 1987 the Lawrence Livermore Lab produced a \nreported entitled Report to Congress on Stockpile Reliability, Weapon \nRemanufacture, and the Role of Nuclear Testing. This report, though 12 \nyears old, remains the single best explanation of the need for nuclear \ntesting.\n  According to the Livermore report, and I quote, ``. . . there is no \nsuch thing as a `thoroughly tested' nuclear weapon.'' The report gives \nseveral reasons for testing, to include, and I quote, ``. . . testing \nis done to maintain the proper functioning of the current stockpile of \nweapons,'' and, ``testing is done to modernize the existing stockpile \nfor enhanced safety, security, or effectiveness. . . .''\n  Moreover, on many occasions the Labs have discovered problems with \nweapons only because of testing. According to the Livermore report,\n  Nuclear weapons are fabricated from chemically and radiologically \nactive materials. Much as a piece of plastic becomes brittle when it is \nleft in the sunlight, nuclear weapons age and their characteristics \nchange in subtle, often unpredictable ways. Testing is sometimes \nrequired to find problems and to assess the adequacy of the fixes that \nare implemented. Experience has shown that testing is essential. One-\nthird of all the weapon designs introduced into the stockpile since \n1958 have required and received post-deployment nuclear tests to \nresolve problems related to deterioration or aging or to correct a \ndesign that is found not to work properly under various conditions. In \nthree-fourths of these cases, the problems were discovered only because \nof the ongoing nuclear testing. Because we frequently have difficulty \nunderstanding fully the effects of changes, particularly seemingly \nsmall changes on the unclear performance, nuclear testing has been \nrequired to maintain the proper functioning of our nation's deterrent.\n  Accordingly to Dr. John Nuckolls, Director Emeritus of the Lawrence \nLivermore Lab, in a September 2, 1999, letter to Senator Jon Kyl, \n``Nuclear testing has been essential to the discovery and resolution of \nmany problems in the stockpile.'' Testing has been important in \nensuring that our weapons work and are safe. It has been important in \nfinding problems in our weapons. It has been important in certifying \nthe solutions to the problems that have been found.\n  It is because of this testing that the United States has been able to \nmaintain its confidence in the safety and reliability of the nuclear \nstockpile, which is a fundamental requirement of nuclear deterrence.\n  In promoting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Clinton \nadministration asserts it can assure the requisite level of confidence \nin the safety and reliability of America's nuclear stockpile--that is, \nof the weapons comprising our deterrent, upon which nuclear deterrence \nis based--without testing.\n  To do this the administration has embarked upon the ``Stockpile \nStewardship Program.'' According to the Fiscal Year 2000 Stockpile \nStewardship Plan Executive Overview, released by the Department of \nEnergy in March of 1999, and I quote, ``The overall goal of the \nStockpile Stewardship program is to have in place by 2010 * * * the \ncapabilities that are necessary to provide continuing high confidence \nin the annual certification of the stockpile without the necessity for \nnuclear testing.''\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program is an excellent program, and my \ncomments should not be misunderstood as criticism of the program, per \nse. In fact, the United States has always had some form of stockpile \nstewardship even while testing. The fundamental question with respect \nto this program, however, is whether and when it will provide the \nrequisite confidence in the safety and reliability of the stockpile \neven if it meets all of its design goals. As stated by the Department \nof Energy in the FY 2000 Stockpile Stewardship\n\n[[Page S12287]]\n\nPlan Executive Overview, ``At the heart of the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram is the issue of confidence.''\n  To their credit, senior officials at the Department of Energy and the \nnuclear labs are generally careful in how they couch their remarks \nabout the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The usual formulation is to \nstate the belief in Stockpile Stewardship as the ``best approach'' in \nthe absence of testing. That is a responsible reply, as it would be \nunreasonable to argue that the Department of Energy or our labs should \nbe able to guarantee the success of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. \nThe scientists and engineers at the heart of stockpile stewardship are, \nin many cases, engaged in activities that are at the cutting edge of \nthe science and technology of nuclear weapons. They can't guarantee \nsuccess.\n  According to the administration's estimates, it won't even be \ncompletely in place until the year 2010. But proponents of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty are willing to put the Stockpile \nStewardship cart before the nuclear horse, willing to gamble that the \nUnited States can give up nuclear testing now in the hope that \nStockpile Stewardship will work in the future. Proponents try to \nreassure us by saying that if the Stockpile Stewardship Program ends up \nbeing insufficient, the United States can exercise the ``supreme \nnational interest'' clause in the treaty to resume testing. Given the \nunwillingness of administrations to make use of this standard clause in \nother arms control agreements even when compelling facts exist, there \nis little reason to believe it would be used with the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty.\n  It may surprise some that we cannot be certain of the future success \nof the Stockpile Stewardship Program. But we should all understand that \nthis lack of certainty comes from a lack of detailed knowledge of many \nof the key processes in our nuclear weapons, even after all these years \nof studying, designing, building, and testing nuclear weapons. \nAccordingly to the FY 2000 Stockpile Stewardship Plan Executive \nOverview, ``The science and engineering of nuclear weapons are \nextremely complex, requiring the integration of over 6,000 components. \nThere are many parameters and unknowns that greatly influence the \nperformance of nuclear warheads.'' This report goes on to state, \n``There are many areas of warhead operation that cannot be adequately \naddressed with existing tools and the current knowledge base of the \nweapons scientists and engineers.'' Thus the need for the several \ncomponents of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, each of which is, in \nits own right, a major program.\n\n  The importance of major components of Stockpile Stewardship being on \nschedule and on budget is made clear in the administration's FY 2000 \nStockpile Stewardship Plan Executive Overview. This report states that \nthe success of the Stockpile Stewardship plan is, ``dependent on a \nhighly integrated and interdependent program of experimentation, \nsimulation, and modeling. . . .'' The report also states, ``The success \nof this strategy depends on the effective integration of every major \nactivity described in this Executive Overview . . .'' and, ``Full \nimplementation of the Stockpile Stewardship Program is required to \nsustain a safe and reliable nuclear deterrent. . . .'' Simply put, this \nmeans that each of the major parts of the Stockpile Stewardship Program \nmust work if, as stated by the administration, our country can do \nwithout nuclear testing while ensuring the safety and reliability of \nour nuclear deterrent.\n  I will not go through each part of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, \nbut I will take a moment to discuss the National Ignition Facility, \nwhich has been described by senior Department of Energy officials as \none of the key elements of Stockpile Stewardship. In fact, a senior \nEnergy Department official has briefed Senate staff that the Stockpile \nStewardship Program cannon succeed if the National Ignition Facility \ndoes not succeed.\n  The purpose of the National Ignition Facility, being built by the \nLawrence Livermore National Lab, is to achieve a better understanding \nof the part of the nuclear weapon known as the ``primary.'' The primary \nis the first and most critical stage in a nuclear explosion, and also \nhappens to be the least understood part of our nuclear weapons. While \nother problems can affect the reliability of our nuclear weapons, we \nknow that a nonfunctioning or deficient primary means that the weapon \nwill either not work or not work as planned. In either case, this would \nbe a major problem for our nuclear deterrent, and, hence, for our \nstrategy of nuclear deterrence.\n  Senate staff were briefed at length on the National Ignition Facility \nduring a visit to the Livermore Lab last January. During this briefing \nthey were told explicitly that the National Ignition Facility was on \nschedule for completion in October of 2003 and on budget. This program \nat that time was estimated to cost $1.2 billion.\n  We have recently learned that the National Ignition Facility is not \non schedule and budget, contrary to the representations that were made \nlast January to staff. The same representation was made in testimony in \nMarch of 1999 to the Senate Armed Services Committee by Dr. C. Bruce \nTarter, Director of the Lawrence Livermore Lab, when he stated, ``I am \npleased to report that NIF [National Ignition Facility] construction is \non budget and on schedule.'' In fact, however, the Washington Post \nreported on September 6, 1999, that, ``Energy Department officials said \nmismanagement may cause the project's cost to soar as much as $350 \nmillion above the originally projected $.2 billion and delay completion \nby as much as two years,'' Dr. Tarter's statement demonstrates that \neach part of the Stockpile Stewardship Program is a complex \nundertaking, the success of which cannot be assured, whether for \nreasons of technological or managerial deficiencies.\n  It shouldn't be a surprise that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is \nhaving difficulties. After all, nearly every aspect of this program is \nattempting to push the borders of our scientific and engineering \nknowledge of nuclear weapons. Additionally, the Department of Energy's \nrecord of successful completion of major programs leaves much to be \ndesired. According to the General Accounting Office, ``From 1980 \nthrough 1996, DOE terminated 9 of 18 major Defense Program projects \nafter spending $1.9 billion and completed only 2 projects--one behind \nschedule and over budget with the other behind schedule but under \nbudget. `Schedule slippages' and cost overruns had occurred on many of \nthe remaining 7 projects ongoing in 1996.'' In the FY 2000 Stockpile \nStewardship Plan Executive Overview Dr. Vic Reis states, ``Maintaining \nthe U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing will \ncontinue to challenge DOE's best capabilities.''\n\n  Mr. President, there are many other reasons to be concerned about \nwhether the Stockpile Stewardship Program is a sufficient alternative \nto testing. I will not address these questions in detail, but hope \nother Senators will.\n  First, even if Stockpile Stewardship works as planned, and on time, \nand is affordable, is it good enough?\n  Second, will Stockpile Stewardship accurately tell us about the \neffects of aging on nuclear weapons, which is one of the key challenges \nin stockpile whose weapons are being extended far beyond their design \nlife? Will it tell us for example, what happens to plutonium as it \nages? The issue of aging and its effects on the nuclear stockpile is \nparticularly important, and is recognized as such in the FY 2000 \nStockpile Stewardship Plan Executive Overview, which makes the \nfollowing important statements about aging,\n  1. ``The DOE has never before had large numbers of 30 to 50 year-old \nwarheads in the stockpile. Until last year, the average age of a \nstockpile warhead had always been less than 13 years. As a result, new \ntypes of aging-related changes and problems in these older warheads are \nexpected to be encountered.''\n  2. ``Some changes may have little or no effect, whereas others could \nmake a major difference.''\n  3. ``Nuclear warheads are not static objects. Materials change over \ntime (e.g., radioactive decay, embrittlement, corrosion). Some of these \nchanges do not adversely affect warhead safety or reliability, but \nothers may. In addition, not all changes have reached current detection \nthresholds, but nonetheless may potentially impact safety or \nreliability.''\n  4. ``* * * warheads will remain in the stockpile well beyond their \nanticipated design life and beyond DOE's base of experience.''\n\n[[Page S12288]]\n\n  Third, will Stockpile Stewardship be good enough to certify the many \nnew manufacturing processes, to include those for new plutonium pit \nproduction? And how will we know that the Stockpile Stewardship \ncertifications of new manufacturing processes are accurate?\n  Fourth, will Stockpile Stewardship enable the United States to make \nits weapons as safe as the technology allows, which used to be the \nstandard against which nuclear weapons safety was measured? We have \nalready received testimony, for example, that insensitive high \nexplosives--an important safety measure--cannot be put in all of our \ndeployed nuclear weapons without testing.\n\n  Fifth, how will we know the answers to any of these questions without \ncalibrating the finished Stockpile Stewardship product, if or whenever \nwe get to that point, against actual tests of aged weapons currently in \nthe stockpile? Though the United States performed 1,030 nuclear tests, \nmuch of the data is of such low quality or on weapons no longer in the \nstockpile that it can't be used in Stockpile Stewardship.\n  The Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative, one of the major parts \nof the Stockpile Stewardship Program, has made impressive advances in \nsupercomputing capability. But it still must improve the capabilities \nof its supercomputers by many orders of magnitude above what it has \nalready attained. If this can be affordably accomplished--something \nthat has not yet been determined--the United States will still be in \nthe position of then having to rely upon computer simulations to \nintegrate all the data being produced out of the other pieces of \nStockpile Stewardship. As we all know, computer simulations can always \nbe made to work; the question is whether they faithfully model reality. \nAnd without calibrating these models against actual tests of weapons \ncurrently in the stockpile, the United States will be forced into the \nposition of hoping its models and simulations are accurate.\n  Sixth, will Stockpile Stewardship incorporate and replace the \nexperience base in Department of Energy and Lab personnel as most of \nthe scientists and engineers with design, manufacturing, and test \nexperience retire in the next 10 years? According to the FY 2000 \nStockpile Stewardship Plan Executive Overview, ``Many of the scientists \nand engineers with actual weapons design, production, and test \nexperience have already retired, and most of those remaining will \nlikely retire within the next decade. A new generation of weapons \nscientists and engineers must be trained and their competence validated \nbefore the current generation leaves the workforce.''\n  Seventh, is Stockpile Stewardship's funding sufficient and \nsustainable? This question is asked because the lab directors \noriginally told the administration they needed $4.8 billion per year, \nbut were told to design a $4.5 billion per year program. After doing so \nthey were then told the $4.5 billion per year would be in current \ndollars, and would therefore not be adjusted over time for inflation. \nAnd most recently, the labs were told that the cost of producing \ntritium would have to be accommodated within the $4.5 billion per year, \nthough it was not included by the labs in their $4.5 billion per year \nbudget. In testimony before the Senate Assistant Secretary of Energy \nVic Reis stated, ``A production source of tritium would be in addition \nto'' the $4.5 billion per year for Stockpile Stewardship. Dr. Reis, \nhowever, is directly contradicted by the FY 2000 Stockpile Stewardship \nPlan Executive Overview, which states, ``FY '00 funding for the tritium \nsource is included within this level'' of $4.5 billion. Thus, the labs \nare getting less than they said they needed for the Stockpile \nStewardship Program; they're sustaining funding reductions because of \ninflation; and, their program is being further reduced by having \nadditional requirements levied upon Stockpile Stewardship without the \nprovision of additional resources.\n  Finally, and most important, since Stockpile Stewardship is supposed \nto tell us about problems, many of which we've never seen before--such \nas those caused by aging--how will we know if Stockpile Stewardship \n``works''? How will we know we're finding problems that we've never \nseen before?\n\n  According to the President's statement of August 11, 1995, ``I am \nassured by the Secretary of Energy and directors of our nuclear labs \nthat we can meet the challenge of maintaining our nuclear deterrent \nunder a CTB through a science-based stockpile stewardship program \nwithout nuclear testing.''\n  The directors of the labs have not ``assured'' the President that the \nStockpile Stewardship Program will maintain the U.S. nuclear deterrent, \nin the President's words, ``without nuclear testing.'' What the lab \ndirectors actually have said in quite different: that Stockpile \nStewardship represents the best chance to maintain the deterrent \nwithout testing. But there was absolutely no assurance given the \nPresident by the lab directors concerning Stockpile Stewardship. They \nhave never said, individually or collectively, ``we can maintain the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear weapons without testing.'' In a \nletter to Senator Jon Kyl of September 24, 1997, the director of the \nLos Alamos Lab, Dr. Sigfried Hecker, stated, ``We agreed with the \nDepartment of Energy that without nuclear testing, the SSMP [Stockpile \nStewardship and Management Program] provides the most logical approach \nfor certifying the stockpile today and decades from now. We said that \nwe could not guarantee that the SSMP would work, although we had \nreasonable confidence that it would * * *.'' That certainly doesn't \nsound like an ``assurance'' to me.\n  Recognizing that the eventual success of the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram is not a self-evident fact, during a visit to the Los Alamos \nNational Lab on February 3rd, 1998, President Clinton said, ``* * * I \ndon't think we can get the Treaty ratified unless we can convince the \nSenate that the Stockpile Stewardship Program works * * *.'' As good as \nthis program is, we do not know if Stockpile Stewardship will be good \nenough. We do not know when, if ever, the Stockpile Stewardship Program \nwill be good enough, particularly as its promised completion is still \nover a decade away. And until we know, it would be irresponsible to \nforeswear nuclear testing. Stockpile Stewardship is simply not a proven \nalternative to nuclear testing. Nuclear deterrence is too important to \nthe security of the United States for our nuclear deterrent to be \npropped up by hopes instead of set in a foundation of facts.\n  The CTBT purports to ban an activity it does not define.\n  My opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is not derived \nsolely from the questions emanating from the unfinished Stockpile \nStewardship Program, though these uncertainties constitute more than \nsufficient grounds to object to the treaty. The CTBT is itself \nseriously flawed in many ways, four of which I will discuss.\n  First, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty purports to ban an activity \nit does not define. Nowhere in the treaty can the definition of \n``test'' be found. That is not to say that negotiators didn't spend a \nsignificant amount of time trying to define this most fundamental of \nterms. They did, but left the word undefined purposely because they \nsimply found it too difficult to reach consensus on its meaning.\n  So, the Senate is being asked to render advice and consent to \nratification of a treaty that not only bans an activity, but does so \ncomprehensively. We just don't quite know what activity is being \nbanned.\n\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty does state in Article I, ``Each \nState Party undertakes not to carry out any nuclear weapon test \nexplosion or any other nuclear explosion * * *.'' The Clinton \nadministration has interpreted this to mean the CTBT is a ``zero-\nyield'' treaty, so one could expect that the treaty bans nuclear \nexplosions from which a nuclear yield is derived. Unfortunately, the \ntruth is not that simple, which is why the word ``test'' in the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty is undefined.\n  In fact, for the first two-and-a-half years of the Clinton \nadministration, negotiators pursued a comprehensive test ban treaty \nthat would allow some level of yield from tests; that is, the Clinton \nadministration's position was to negotiate a comprehensive test ban \nthat would allow low-yield testing. Until August 11, 1995, when \nPresident Clinton decided to pursue a zero-yield CTBT, the Defense \nDepartment position was that it could agree to a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty only if it permitted tests with nuclear yields of\n\n[[Page S12289]]\n\nup to 500 tons. Other parts of the administration resisted a zero-yield \ntreaty because they knew such a treaty couldn't be verified. But the \nnuclear weapon states couldn't agree on how much yield should be \nallowed, and the non-nuclear weapon states viewed this approach as an \nattempt by members of the nuclear club to enjoy the rhetorical benefits \nof being part of a nuclear test ban treaty while continuing to have the \nability to improve their nuclear arsenals. So ultimately, in large part \nbecause some believed the indefinite extension of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty hung in the balance, the United States endorsed \na zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty while leaving the meaning of \n``test'' undefined and ``zero-yield'' ambiguous. In fact, the phrase \n``zero-yield'' is not even in the treaty.\n  Hydro nuclear testing is a perfect example of this problem. \nHydronuclear testing is very low-yield testing, and is particularly \nuseful in assessing nuclear weapon safety issues. Until the Clinton \nadministration adopted its ``zero-yield'' position, it held that \nhydronuclear tests would be permissible under a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty. After the administration adopted zero-yield as its position, \nthough, American representatives declared hydronuclear testing to be \ncontrary to this standard. Other countries, such as Russia, however, \nhave declared hydronuclear testing to be consistent with its \nunderstanding of the treaty. Victor Mikhailov, formerly the Russian \nMinister of Atomic Energy and currently the First Deputy Minister at \nthat ministry, stated on April 23, 1999, that the Russian nuclear \nprogram has to focus on, in his words, ``three basic directions'' in a \nCTBT environment: ``new computer equipment, non-test-site `simulation' \nexperiments, and so-called test-site hydronuclear experiments, where \nthere is practically no release of nuclear energy.'' Neither Russia \nnor, for that matter, China, has agreed even to the U.S. definition of \nwhat constitutes a hydronuclear test.\n  After Russia signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, \nArzamas-16, one of Russia's two nuclear weapons labs, published a book \nin 1997 entitled Nuclear Tests of the USSR. According to this book, \n``Explosive experiments with nuclear charges in which the amount of \nnuclear energy released is comparable to energy of the HE [high \nexplosive] charge, belong to the category of hydronuclear tests, and \nthey also are not nuclear tests * * *.'' In plain English this means \nthat one of Russia's two nuclear design labs does not consider low-\nyield testing to be a violation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  The Russian position is not without merit, as the treaty's failure to \ndefine the meaning of the word ``test'' or even to include the phrase \n``zero-yield'' gives rise to these kinds of fundamental ambiguities. \nIndeed, in testimony to the Senate, Mr. Spurgeon Keeny, President of \nthe Arms Control Association, stated that during President Eisenhower's \nnuclear testing moratorium of 1958-1961, the President authorized a \nnumber of hydronuclear tests, ``. . . related to some very specific \nsafety problems that existed at the time.'' So during President \nEisenhower's zero-yield nuclear testing moratorium he authorized the \nconduct of tests which this administration says would violate today's \nzero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It's not hard to see why \nother nations could think hydronuclear tests are permissible.\n  This ambiguity will lead to greater tensions as some accuse others of \nviolating the treaty. It will enable some countries to improve their \nweapons and cloak the activities of other nations as they pursue \nacquisition of nuclear weapons, while the United States abides strictly \nby the treaty. While arms control proponents suggest that arms control \ntreaties enhance relations between nations, the failure to define the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty's most fundamental term can hardly be \nexpected to build confidence between nations; instead, it's likely to \ncreate discord.\n  There is no evidence that the CTBT will reduce proliferation.\n  The second key problem with the treaty is that, contrary to \nassertions by treaty proponents, there is no evidence that the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty will reduce proliferation.\n  Nations acquire nuclear weapons to enhance their national security. \nWill America's failure to test change that? The evidence indicates not. \nIndeed, though the United States hasn't tested since 1992--and didn't \nresume testing even after France and China conducted their tests in the \nmid-1990s--India and Pakistan chose to conduct nuclear tests in the \nspring of 1998. Each country did this for the simple reason that they \nfound such conduct to be consistent with their national security \ninterests.\n  The idea that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will be an effective \nnonproliferation barrier should be examined in the context of the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT. Except for the United States, \nBritain, France, Russia and China--the so-called ``P-5''--the NPT \nestablishes a norm against the development or acquisition of nuclear \nweapons. Yet, despite the establishment of this norm more than 30 years \nago, nations other than the P-5 have continued to seek and acquire \nnuclear weapons. This pursuit and acquisition of nuclear weapons has \noccurred by both members and non-members of the NPT. Thus, while some \nof these nations, by virtue of their NPT membership, have explicitly \nviolated the terms of that treaty--North Korea and Iraq immediately \ncome to mind--the rest, though not NPT members, have flouted the NPT-\nestablished international norm.\n  So, the CTBT-established ``norm'' against testing is essentially \nsuperfluous. To violate this norm, nations, except for the P-5, must \nfirst violate the NPT-established norm against acquiring nuclear \nweapons. And if they are willing to violate the first norm, why not the \nsecond, and lesser, CTBT-established norm? Nations willing to violate \nthe NPT norm to acquire the weapon in the first place can hardly be \nexpected not to violate the CTBT norm of testing their ill-\ngotten weapon. Mr. Spurgeon Kenny, President of the Arms Control \nAssociation, even testified to the Senate that the NPT, ``is the \nprincipal constraint on testing by non-nuclear weapon states.'' Which \nwould seem to make the CTBT extraneous.\n\n  Nonetheless, CTBT proponents contend the treaty will be an effective \ntool against ``horizontal proliferation''--that is, against the \nacquisition of nuclear weapons by nations that don't already have \nthem--and also against ``vertical proliferation,'' or the improvement \nof nuclear arsenals by those nations already possessing these weapons.\n  According to Dr. Kathleen Bailey, the former Assistant Director of \nthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and now retired from the \nLawrence Livermore Laboratory, in testimony before the Senate, ``It is \nquite feasible for a nation to develop a device that will work as long \nas it does not matter if the yield is exactly known and there are no \nexacting specifications which must be met.'' Nations that do not now \nhave nuclear weapons can build relatively unsophisticated nuclear \nweapons. The knowledge necessary to build these weapons is readily \navailable, in textbooks, classrooms, libraries, and on the Internet. \nTreaty proponents do not dispute this; in testimony before the Senate, \nMr. Keeny of the Arms Control Association, said, ``. . . a rogue state \ncould develop a first generation nuclear weapon without testing.''\n  For proliferating nations seeking a nuclear weapon capability, first \ngeneration nuclear weapons need not be tested for the user to have \nadequate confidence in their utility. The United States would not have \nsufficient confidence in an untested or marginally tested weapon \nbecause of its requirements for weapon safety and reliability, but \nother nations will not necessarily have the same stringent \nrequirements. Even if a country has low confidence that its relatively \nunsophisticated nuclear weapon will work if used militarily, in a \ncrisis the United States cannot take the chance that another country's \nweapon, however unsophisticated, won't work. In this respect, mere \npossession of a nuclear weapon could be enough to dissuade the United \nStates from acting. As a minimum, this possession will be enough to \nconstrain America's options in time of crisis.\n  With respect to ``vertical'' proliferation, were the CTBT to receive \nconsent to ratification by the Senate I am confident it would constrain \nthe ability of\n\n[[Page S12290]]\n\nthe United States to modernize its nuclear arsenal. But other nations \nthat already possess nuclear weapons will improve their arsenals--by \nexploiting the ambiguity inherent in the treaty's failure to define \n``test,'' or embarking upon testing which we can't detect though it \nprovides militarily useful data, or by espionage, as we have already \nseen in the case of China. China's acquisition of information on our \nmost modern nuclear warhead, the W-88, demonstrates that some nuclear \npowers can improve their arsenals without extensive testing.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty could also have the perverse effect \nof engendering proliferation. There are several advanced nations, most \nof which are U.S. allies, that decided to forego their own nuclear \narsenals for the explicit reason that their safety would be guaranteed \nunder the American nuclear umbrella. If these allies lose their \nconfidence in the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, \nthen they could also lose faith in the idea of finding their own \nprotections within America's extended deterrent. These nations could \nthen decide it to be in their own national security interests to \nacquire nuclear weapons; at a minimum, U.S. participation in the CTBT \nwould require them to examine the question of whether they need their \nown nuclear deterrent.\n\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty's supposed nonproliferation \nbenefits are based on hope, not fact. The CTBT adds nothing to the NPT. \nThe evidence simply does not support the assertion that the CTBT would \nbe an effective nonproliferation tool.\n  The CTBT verification scheme will have little effect.\n  The third significant deficiency of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nis its verification provisions. As the treaty is supposed to be a \n``zero yield'' test ban, this is particularly troubling. While it is \nreasonable to hope that a nation's assumption of treaty obligations is \nsufficient to bind it by the treaty's terms and conditions, it is an \nunfortunate fact that some nations violate arms control treaties when \nconvenient. The Senate recognized this problem, for example, when it \nprovided advice and consent to ratification of the START II agreement, \ndeclaring its concern about, ``. . . the clear past pattern of Soviet \nnoncompliance with arms control agreements and continued cases of \nnoncompliance by the Russian Federation. . . .'' This is why effective \nverification of arms control treaties is so important, and I will \nexplain three of the ways the CTBT's verification regime is deficient.\n  First, treaty supporters hope that the International Monitoring \nSystem set up under the CTBT will enable detection with high confidence \nof very low yield nuclear tests. We know, however, that it is possible \nto conduct a nuclear test with the intention of evading systems \ndesigned to detect the explosion's telltale seismic signature. This can \nbe done through a technique known as ``decoupling,'' whereby a nuclear \ntest is conducted in a large underground cavity, thus muffling the \ntest's seismic evidence. In a speech to the Council on Foreign \nRelations last year, Dr. Larry Turnbull, Chief Scientist of the \nIntelligence Community's Arms Control Intelligence Staff, said,\n\n       The decoupling scenario is credible for many countries for \n     at least two reasons: First, the worldwide mining and \n     petroleum literature indicates that construction of large \n     cavities in both hard rock and salt is feasible, with costs \n     that would be relatively small compared to those required for \n     the production of materials for a nuclear device; second, \n     literature and symposia indicate that containment of \n     particulate and gaseous debris is feasible in both salt and \n     hard rock.\n\n  So not only is this ``decoupling'' judged to be ``credible'' by the \nIntelligence Community, but, according to Dr. Turnbull, the technique \ncan reduce a nuclear test's seismic signature by up to a factor of 70. \nThis means a 70-kiloton test can be made to look like a 1-kiloton test, \nwhich the CTBT monitoring system will not be able to detect. And a 70-\nkiloton test, even much less than a 70-kiloton test, can be \nextraordinarily useful both to nations with nuclear weapons and to \nnations seeking nuclear weapons. Bear in mind that the first atomic \nbomb used in combat had a yield of only 15 kilotons.\n  The final verification problems I will discuss is one that is present \nin, though not particular to, this treaty, and has to do with the \nability of proliferators to utilize information gained from the \nverification system. In short, the verifications regime could serve as \na training ground for those who wish to use the treaty to mask their \ncontinued pursuit of new or improved nuclear weapons. We have seen this \nproblem in the past, and the aftermath of the Gulf War provides an \nexcellent example.\n\n  Dr. David Kay, the first head of the UNSCOM inspection team in Iraq, \nhas recounted on various occasions his experiences in searching for the \nIraqi missile and weapons of mass destruction programs. One such \nexperience involves UNSCOM's search for Iraq's nuclear weapons program. \nThe UNSCOM inspectors searched long and hard, knowing the evidence was \nwell hidden, and over many months, despite the best efforts of Iraq to \nfrustrate UNSCOM's efforts, gradually uncovered much information about \nthe broad scope of the Iraqi nuclear program.\n  The UNSCOM inspectors were particularly interested in learning how \nIraq had managed to fool the International Atomic Energy Agency for so \nlong. According to Dr. Kay, the response they received from the \ndirector of Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission ``Nuclear Safeguards \nDepartment''--someone who had repeatedly lied to UNSCOM inspectors \nuntil he was confronted with incontrovertible evidence--was that he had \nlearned how to beat the IAEA system of inspections from his experience \nas an IAEA inspector. After all, Iraq is a member of the NPT, and \nIraqis therefore have every right to work at the IAEA.\n  Mr. President, we must expect that the same will happen under the \nCTBT. The treaty's own implementation mechanisms could teach some \ncountries how to appear to be adhering to this treaty while actually \nusing it to shield the advancement of their clandestine nuclear \nprograms.\n  It is important to understand that our ability to verify a treaty is \nconfined to the limits and fallibility of intelligence collection and \nanalysis. In a 1998 speech to the National Defense University \nFoundation, Dr. Kay, stated, ``We ought to remember in the case of \nIraq, we [UNSCOM] found in the nuclear area a program that had sucked \nup $10 billion in the 1980s; 15,000 people working on it; 25 sites of \nproduction of various components, 12 really major ones; elaborate \ndeception and denial operations . . . Can you imagine, if you had the \nDCI in here and asked him, `Is there a country that can engage over ten \nyears in a program to build nuclear weapons, spend $10 billion, have \n15,000 people working in it, five major avenues of enriching uranium, \nand get within 18 months of building the program and you will not have \ndetected it?' '' Sometimes, unfortunately, our Intelligence Community \nwill miss even very large clandestine programs.\n  The CTBT verification problem is compounded by the fact that it is \nsupposed to be a ``zero-yield'' treaty. Commenting on this in testimony \nthis year before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, James Woolsey, \nPresident Clinton's first Director of Central Intelligence, stated, ``I \ndo not believe that the zero level is verifiable. Not only because it \nis so low, but partially because of the capability a country has that \nis willing to cheat on such a treaty, of decoupling its nuclear tests \nby setting them off in caverns or caves and the like. . . . And to my \nmind, that makes it a worse than a weak reed on which to rely.'' Mr. \nWoolsey is correct; the false assurance of the CTBT's verification \nsystem is in many ways worse than no assurance at all. The treaty's \nverification flaws alone are sufficient reason to vote against the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  The CTBT prevents the United States from making our weapons safer and \nfrom adapting our nuclear stockpile to new threats.\n  The fourth major deficiency of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is \nthat it will prevent the United States from both improving its current \narsenal and building new types of weapons, should the need arise. \nThough treaty proponents view this as a positive development, I will \nbriefly explain why it is in fact a problem.\n  Dr. Robert Barker recently retired from the Lawrence Livermore \nNational Lab after spending his entire professional life as part of the \nU.S. nuclear complex, as a weapon designer, tester, and as the \nAssistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy for three\n\n[[Page S12291]]\n\ndifferent secretaries. According to Dr. Barker, the safety standard for \nU.S. nuclear weapons has always been to make these weapons as safe as \nour technology will permit. This means that as technology improves, so \ntoo should the safety features of our nuclear weapons.\n  But some safety features, such as insensitive high explosives, cannot \nbe added to some of the weapons in our stockpile without testing. \nTherefore, the effect of the CTBT on the U.S. nuclear stockpile is to \nmake it less safe than it otherwise would be. According to Dr. Barker \nin testimony to the Senate, ``The history of U.S. nuclear weapon \ndevelopment is that with the design of each new weapon, efforts were \nmade to incorporate the latest safety features in a steadily evolving \ntechnology of safety. When weapons remained in the stockpile so long \nthat their safety features were too deficient with respect to then \ncurrent standards, these systems were retired solely because of this \ndeficiency.''\n  So because the CTBT does not allow testing for safety or for any \nother reason, the United States will face the dilemma of fielding \nweapons that aren't as safe as they should be or doing without the \nweapons. For those whose ultimate objective is the denuclearization of \nthe United States, this is a good reason to support the treaty. But it \nis not a good reason for those of us who understand the continuing \nnecessity of nuclear deterrence to the national security of the United \nStates.\n  It is also risky to insist that the United States will not have a \nfuture need for new types of nuclear weapons. Our nuclear deterrent \nmust be configured such that it contains weapons to meet all \nconceivable needs. Over the years, in fact, one of the reasons the \nUnited States has continued to produce new types of weapons has been to \nrespond to new requirements. Assuming the immutability of the current \nU.S. nuclear weapon requirements is, in my view, an unacceptable \ngamble. According to an unclassified March 1999 report by the Los \nAlamos Nuclear Laboratory entitled The U.S. Nuclear Stockpile: Looking \nAhead, ``[The] CTBT has reduced our flexibility and options to meet \nfuture nuclear deterrent requirements.''\n  The major problem with an outmoded nuclear stockpile is that it \nreduces the credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent and, hence, \nundermines America's strategy of nuclear deterrence. As new threats \ndevelop for which the United States has no weapon that can be used, our \nadversaries will grow to view U.S. deterrent threats as less than \ncredible. Obviously no one wants to use our nuclear weapons; but \nensuring nuclear weapons are never used depends on ensuring they can \nbe  used. When they become unusable, or when we are faced with a \nsituation for which we don't have the proper weapon, the American \nnuclear deterrent will have lost its relevance. This is good news for \nthose who view the CTBT as an important step on the path to \ndenuclearization, but bad news for everyone who understands the \ncontinuing importance of nuclear deterrence to America's national \nsecurity.\n\n  The four deficiencies I have just discussed are by no means the only \nfaults of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but I will leave it to \nothers to examine additional treaty shortcomings. While I'm sure some \nwill take issue with my characterization of the CTBT as replete with \nproblems, the simple fact of the matter is that even President Clinton \nrecognizes that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is brimming with \nserious deficiencies. This is why the President announced that the \nUnited States would sign the CTBT subject to the establishment of so-\ncalled ``safeguards,'' and this is why the administration and treaty \nsupporters are asking that these safeguards be made part of the \nresolution of ratification. What these safeguards tell us is that the \nadministration does not want the Senate to consider the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty on its own; that the administration does not believe \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to be capable of standing on its own \nmerits.\n  These so-called ``safeguards'' are themselves deficient.\n  On August 11, 1995, President Clinton released a statement which \nsaid, ``The United States will now insist on a test ban that prohibits \nany nuclear weapons test explosion, or any other nuclear explosion. I \nam convinced this decision will speed the negotiations so that we can \nachieve our goal of signing a comprehensive test ban next year. As a \ncentral part of this decision, I am establishing concrete, specific \nsafeguards that define the conditions under which the United States \nwill enter into a comprehensive test ban.''\n  This announcement marked President Clinton's decision to seek a zero-\nyield test ban treaty, and part of what the President said is worth \nrepeating, ``As a central part of this decision, I am establishing \nconcrete, specific safeguards that define the conditions under which \nthe United States will enter into a comprehensive test ban.''\n  The six conditions that President Clinton announced are not part of \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but entirely separate from the \ntreaty. The safeguards were announced for the simple reason that the \ntreaty is itself inadequate, or there would have been no need for the \nso-called safeguards. Indeed, the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nfor the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is conditioned on these \nsafeguards. As stated in their Posture Statement of February 2, 1999, \n``The Joint Chiefs of Staff support the ratification of this Treaty, \nwith the safeguards package, that establishes conditions under which \nthe United States would adhere to the Treaty,'' So the Joint Chiefs \nsupport the ratification of the treaty only with the safeguards \npackage. And the President supports U.S. entry into the CTBT with the \nsafeguards package. But the fact of the matter is that the safeguards \npackage, upon which the President and the Joint Chiefs have invested so \nmuch importance, is not part of the treaty.\n  The secret of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is that it does not \nstand on its own merits, but is propped up by this ``safeguards \npackage'' which has been accepted by no other nation that has signed or \nratified the CTBT. So the Senate is being asked, essentially, to \nprovide advice and consent to ratification of this treaty because of \nwords that are not in the treaty. The Senate is being asked to provide \nits consent to something that no other nation understands to be the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Even worse, the so-called ``safeguards \npackage'' is itself inadequate in several ways, three of which I will \nnow describe.\n\n  Safeguard A calls for, ``The conduct of a Science Based Stockpile \nStewardship Program to insure a high level of confidence in the safety \nand reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile. . . .'' I \nhave already explained why this safeguard is inadequate.\n  Safeguard C calls for, ``The maintenance of the basic capability to \nresume nuclear test activities prohibited by the CTBT should the United \nStates cease to be bound to adhere to this treaty.'' But when Senate \nstaff visited the Nevada Test Site earlier this year they found funding \nand personnel problems which call into question the sincerity of this \nsafeguard.\n  Safeguard F calls for,\n\n       The understanding that if the President of the United \n     States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Energy (DOE)--advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories \n     and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command--that a high \n     level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear \n     weapon type which the two Secretaries consider to be critical \n     to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the \n     President, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared \n     to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard ``supreme \n     national interests'' clause in order to conduct whatever \n     testing might be required.\n\n  This safeguard is particularly important. Each of the nuclear weapons \nlab directors has testified that this safeguard is of critical \nimportance to them because it reassured them that President Clinton was \nnot eliminating the possibility of resuming testing despite agreeing to \na comprehensive, and in his interpretation zero-yield, test ban treaty. \nAccording to Dr. C. Bruce Tarter, the director of the Lawrence \nLivermore National Lab, in a letter to Senator Jon Kyl of September 29, \n1997, ``I regard of utmost importance the ability to exercise the \n`supreme national interest' clause of the CTBT to address concerns that \nI have outlined here in my answers. This option mitigates the risks in \npursuing a no-nuclear-testing strategy. We must be prepared for the \npossibility that a significant problem could arise in the stockpile \nthat we\n\n[[Page S12292]]\n\nwill be unable to resolve. The fact that the President's Safeguard F \nspecifically cites this provision reinforces its importance.''\n  In essence, the lab directors rendered their technical judgment on \nentering into the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty based upon a political \ncommitment. But the fact is that Safeguard F isn't even a commitment; \nit doesn't say the United States will resume testing if the lab \ndirectors can't certify a high level of confidence in the safety or \nreliability of a weapon in our nuclear stockpile. It doesn't say the \n``supreme national interest'' clause will be invoked to resume testing \nif a problem is found which requires testing. Rather, it says that \nseveral different  levels of interested parties all have to agree that \nthere is a problem, and that they have to agree that the problem is in \na weapon that the United States can't do without. So this opens the \ndoor for responding to a problem in our nuclear stockpile by deciding \nto eliminate from our stockpile entire types of our nuclear weapons. \nRemoving weapons types with problems is a convenient way, after all, of \neliminating problems from the stockpile. But it ignores the fact that \nwe have these weapons in the stockpile because we need them.\n\n  Furthermore, Safeguard F is of little, if any, value because it \ndoesn't commit to resume testing even if a problem is found in a weapon \nthat it is determined the United States cannot do without. Safeguard F \nonly makes this commitment: That, ``. . . the President, in \nconsultation with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT \nunder the standard `supreme national interests' clause in order to \nconduct whatever testing might be required.''\n  To my knowledge, the United States has never made use of this clause \nin any treaty. But more importantly, we must recognize that neither the \nlab directors nor the United States Senate has received a commitment \nunder this safeguard that testing will be resume if necessary. The only \ncommitment here is that the President will consult with Congress and be \nprepared to leave the treaty to test. This safeguard should reassure no \none.\n  It is a falsehood to say that this CTBT is ``The longest sought, \nhardest fought prize in arms control history.''\n  President Clinton has said that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is, \n``The longest sought, hardest fought prize in arms control history.'' \nThe phrase has a nice ring to it; unfortunately, it is not true.\n  President Eisenhower, who imposed a testing moratorium from 1958 to \n1961, supported the idea of a comprehensive test ban treaty. Except \nthat the test ban he proposed was of limited duration (four to five \nyears), and would have allowed low-yield testing. And during the 1958-\n1961 moratorium President Eisenhower authorized Hydro nuclear low-yield \ntests for safety reasons, which the Clinton administration maintains \nwould violate the CTBT now before the Senate.\n  During the Kennedy administration the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which \nbanned nuclear testing in the atmosphere, space, or underwater, was \nnegotiated. No serious attempt was made to negotiate a comprehensive \ntest ban treaty; this was also the case during the Johnson \nadministration.\n  President Nixon's administration negotiated the Threshold Test Ban \nTreaty, but also didn't make any serious attempt to negotiate a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty. There was no activity on this subject \nduring the Ford administration.\n  During the Carter administration, the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion \nTreaty was signed. Serious consideration was given to a comprehensive \ntest ban treaty, though, in Senate testimony in 1997, Dr. James \nSchlesinger, President Carter's Secretary of Energy, stated, ``[when] \nPresident Carter dealt with the issue of the CTBT, it was at a time \nwhen we were seeking a 10-year treaty and the yields of up to two \nkilotons would be permissible.'' In other words, President Carter \nfavored a limited-term treaty that allowed for low-yield testing.\n\n  Neither President Reagan nor President Bush pursued a comprehensive \ntest ban treaty. In fact, responding to the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell \namendment on testing in the Fiscal Year 1993 Energy and Water \nAppropriations Act, President Bush stated in a report to Congress,\n\n       . . . the administration has concluded that it is not \n     possible to develop a test program within the constraints of \n     Public Law 102-377 [the FY '93 Energy and Water \n     Appropriations Act] that would be fiscally, militarily, and \n     technically responsible. The requirement to maintain and \n     improve the safety of our nuclear stockpile and to evaluate \n     and maintain the reliability of U.S. forces necessitates \n     continued nuclear testing for those purposes, albeit at a \n     modest level, for the foreseeable future. The administration \n     strongly urges the Congress to modify this legislation \n     urgently in order to permit the minimum number and kind of \n     underground nuclear tests that the United States requires, \n     regardless of the action of other States, to retain safe, \n     reliable, although dramatically reduced deterrent forces.\n\n  Only the Clinton administration has actively sought an unlimited \nduration comprehensive test ban treaty. And only the Clinton \nadministration has sought a zero-yield test ban treaty, though until \nAugust of 1995--two and a half years into President Clinton's first \nterm--even his administration's proposals in the Conference on \nDisarmament allowed for low-yield testing.\n  President Clinton's statement that ``The CTBT is the longest sought, \nhardest fought prize in arms control history'' is false. I hope my \ncolleagues will not be misled by the administration's transparent \nattempt to imbue this treaty with historical legitimacy it does not \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that nuclear deterrence continues to be \nessential to the national security strategy of the United States. Where \nproponents and opponents of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty begin to \ndiverge is over the question of whether nuclear testing continues to be \nvital to ensure the safety and reliability of America's nuclear \ndeterrent.\n  The administration says that Stockpile Stewardship will provide us \nwith the requisite confidence in our nuclear deterrent, and that this \nconfidence will therefore be sufficient for our deterrent to continue \nto form the foundation of deterrence. It is my judgement that the \nStockpile Stewardship is a well conceived and an important program, but \nwe don't yet know whether it will become an adequate replacement for \ntesting. And until we know this, it would be dangerous to bind our \nnation to a treaty that prohibits testings.\n  I have pointed out some of the more significant shortcomings in the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty to explain that the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram's uncertainty, while itself sufficient justification to oppose \nthe treaty, is not the only reason for such opposition. In failing to \ndefine the word ``test'' the treaty leaves ambiguous its most \nfundamental terms. There is no factual basis upon which to determine \nthat the CTBT will be an effective nonproliferation tool. The CTBT is \nnot verifiable. And it constrains the United States from maintaining \nhigh safety standards for the nuclear stockpile and from ensuring that \nour stockpile, in its configuration, is credible, a necessary condition \nfor nuclear deterrence.\n  Furthermore, the so-called ``safeguards'' announced by the President \nare nothing but a crutch, demonstrating that the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty cannot stand on its own merits.\n  Finally, I have taken the time to dispel the myth that this treaty \nbefore us is the ``longest sought, hardest fought prize in arms control \nhistory.'' This zero-yield test ban treaty is unlike any treaty \nattempted by any previous administration. While a few sporadic and \nmostly half-hearted attempts have been made to attain some form of a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty in the past none of these efforts was in \npursuit of a zero-yield, indefinite duration treaty. There is not an \nunbroken lineage, extending back some 40 years, for this treaty, and it \nis factually incorrect to suggest otherwise.\n  Mr. President, arms control treaties must be judged by the \nstraightforward standard of whether or not they enhance the national \nsecurity of the United States. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty fails \nto attain this standard.\n  Given the limitations of current technology, it is simply not \npossible to be simultaneously for nuclear deterrence and for this \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The two positions are mutually \nexclusive.\n  In his book The Gathering Storm, Winston Churchill observed, ``Facts \nare better than dreams.'' ``Facts are better than dreams.'' Applying \nthis observation to the Comprehensive Test Ban\n\n[[Page S12293]]\n\nTreaty leaves one no choice but to oppose this treaty.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I find the leader's comment extremely \nfascinating. I want to set the record straight on a couple of minor \ndetails, as they are.\n  No. 1: The letter we sent was on July 20. The opening paragraph said:\n\n       We urge you to hold hearings on the Comprehensive Nuclear \n     Test-Ban Treaty and report it to the full Senate for debate. \n     Most importantly, we ask this be done in sufficient time to \n     allow the United States to actively participate in the \n     treaty's inaugural conference of ratifying states to be held \n     in early September.\n\n  We wrote that in July. The assumption, anyone in good faith would \nassume, was we have hearings now--July, August, and September. We had \nnone. We did not have any. Zip. None.\n  The majority leader said, ``Hearings are underway now.'' That is his \nquote. They are not underway now. The day before the treaty, the \nForeign Relations Committee held its first hearing, on the day after we \nare discharged of responsibility. With all due respect to my friend \nfrom the great State of Virginia, chairman of the powerful Armed \nServices Committee, the only committee of jurisdiction under the rules \nis the Foreign Relations Committee. Their input is important. We love \nto hear their opinion, as we do the Intelligence Committee. They have \nno jurisdiction. It gets sent to our committee, not to theirs. And we \nhave 1 day of hearings after we are discharged? Give me a break.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will not yield now. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \nhad 8 days; SALT I, 8 days of Foreign Relations Committee hearings, 18 \ndays on the floor of the Senate; the INF Treaty in 1988, 23 days of \nForeign Relations Committee hearings, 9 days on the Senate floor; \nConventional Forces in Europe Treaty, 1991, 5 days of Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearings, 2 days on the floor; START I, 19 days of hearings \nin the Foreign Relations Committee, 5 days on the floor; START II, \n1996, 8 days in the committee, 3 days on the floor; chemical weapons, \n14 days in committee, 3 days on the floor; NATO enlargement, 7 days in \ncommittee, 8 days on the floor; Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 1 day of \nhearings after we are discharged. No committee report.\n  Look on your desks, I say to my colleagues. Find the report. Find me \na report that makes any recommendation. Come on. Come on, this is a \nstacked deck. The idea that we are going to vote on a treaty that \neveryone acknowledges, opponents and proponents, is maybe the single \nmost significant treaty we will vote on to determine the direction of \nthis country in terms of strategic rationale, and we do not even have a \ncommittee report?\n  If you want to go down the list, the number of months between the \ntime the treaty was sent to us and the time it got to the floor, we are \ntalking over 2 years. In the case of ABM, 2 months; INF, 4 months; CFE, \n8 months; START I, 13; START II, 32; chemical weapons, 37. We keep \ngoing higher and higher. Look at who is in charge when we have these.\n  But, my Lord, the idea we have had hearings, we have had sufficient \ntime to consider it, don't get me wrong; in each of these other \ntreaties, an incredible, valuable contribution and report was filed by \nthe Armed Services Committee and an incredible, valuable position was \ntaken and a report by the Intelligence Committee. They were absolutely \nnecessary and needed, neither of which are available now. That is why \nSenators are arguing about the determinations.\n\n  For example, I just spoke to General Powell, as my friend from \nVirginia spoke to General Powell. I wrote down exactly what he said. I \njust got off the phone with him.\n  He said the most important reason why he wants this delay is so it \ndoes not get defeated. That is an important little point.\n  The second point he said was: I still support this treaty.\n  The third point was: But in light of the way this is being taken up \nand the confusion raised, it is better for the country and everybody to \nhave all this sorted out in an orderly fashion so we all know what we \nare talking about.\n  He knows what he is talking about. He still supports the treaty, but \nhe made a central point, the point Senator Hagel made, and that was: We \nhave not had sufficient debate. Therefore, we can have the kinds of \ncomments made, honest disagreements, my friends from Virginia can say: \nThis is not verifiable. And the Senator from Delaware says: It is \nverifiable.\n  For example, my friend from the Intelligence Committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, quoted in his opening statement the \nWashington Times with regard to verifiability. I will discuss this in \ndetail later. He is on the Intelligence Committee. He knows nobody in \nthe intelligence community came in and said they have evidence that \nRussia has, in fact, detonated a nuclear weapon. He knows that.\n  Mr. KYL. Since the Senator says I know certain things, may I simply \ninterject to make this point: As Senator Biden is well aware, it is \nimportant for Senators to quote only open-source material, such as \nnewspapers, and never to refer to matters in the Intelligence Committee \nwhich are classified. So this Senator will refrain from quoting \nclassified material and will be bound by our rules only to refer to \narticles and newspapers, such as the Washington Times.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I respectfully suggest if you quote newspaper articles and \nyou have some reason to believe a newspaper article is not consistent \nwith what you know, then maybe we should not quote the newspaper \narticles.\n  The point I am making is a very simple one: Nobody in here has enough \nevidence, based upon a record, other than the probably 10 or 12 of us \nto whom responsibility is assigned to know this material; I doubt \nwhether if you poll this Senate, intelligent women and men, that their \ndegree of confidence--and I will be devil's advocate--for or against \nthe treaty is as high as it has been in the past with other treaties \nbecause we have had extensive debate before.\n  When we talk about this notion that we are, in fact, in a position \nwhere what we asked for--and I wish the majority leader was still here. \nIt was the Biden resolution that was going to be attached to an \neducation bill that called for a sense of the Senate that we, in fact, \nhold hearings. Standing in this well, the leader--and he has \nacknowledged this and he made a point of this--walked up to me and \nsaid: If you will withhold that resolution, we can work out giving you \na vote on this. He did say that, and I said fine.\n  The point is, we were not asking for a vote without hearings, ever. \nThe point is also, accurately stated by many, in retrospect, in \nhindsight, should some of us have objected to the unanimous consent \nagreement? The answer is yes. Yes.\n\n  Here is where we are, and it is true, it is totally within the power \nof any single Senator to insist we vote. If that is the case, so be it. \nI am ready to debate the last few hours we have, and we vote. But I \ndefy anyone to suggest this is the way in which they want the Senate in \nthe future on other treaties of any nature, arms control or not, to \nproceed, which is to wait 2 years, do nothing, have no hearings in the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, wait until the committee of jurisdiction is \ndischarged, hold 1 day of hearings, leave 14 hours of debate with one \namendment available to each leader. I do not ever remember any treaty \non which we restricted amendments or covenants. I do not remember that.\n  On the chemical weapons treaty, we had a whole range of amendments, \nall developed in the Foreign Relations Committee after extensive \nhearings.\n  So, folks, this is not the way to do business. But if we are going to \ndo business this way, so be it. I cannot do anything about it except \nagree with the Senator from Virginia that we should not go forward. I \nagree with former General Powell. I agree; we should not go forward. If \nwe do, we do. But it is going to be upon those who conclude that this \nis the way we should conduct business.\n  I think we are setting bad precedent after bad precedent after bad \nprecedent by the way in which we are proceeding. Again, it is true, \ntactically those who oppose the treaty are in a very strong position \nnow. I give them credit for their tactic. But I hope they will put \ntactical advantage beneath substantive responsibility.\n  If their case is as strong as they say, I would assume they would \nfeel even\n\n[[Page S12294]]\n\nbetter to have it debated at length, have the committees thoroughly \nexplore it, and have it made clear to the American people so that when \nthey vote it down, the American people--on average, 80 percent of whom \nsupport the treaty, based on all the polling data anybody has read--\nwill not have to wonder why they went against the public will. They \nwill be able to make their case, even if it is for no other reason than \nthat.\n  So, Mr. President----\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. On his time, I am happy to yield. Again, I apologize to my \nfriend from Georgia. I told him he could come and speak. I will yield \nto him. I did not anticipate the majority leader coming to characterize \nthe circumstances different than--he is entitled to do that; I am not \ncriticizing him--the views of the Senator from Delaware of the \ncharacterization.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. On our time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is the time for cool heads, sound \nminds, to make most difficult decisions. I listened very carefully to \nour distinguished majority leader. And I have listened to my colleague \nand friend from Delaware.\n  My colleague from Delaware dwells on the process. This situation \ntoday is solely the result of the unanimous consent agreement, proposed \nat first by the majority leader of the Senate, and studied for a period \nof 3 days. Our majority leader has a right to believe that 3-day period \nof study enabled my good friend from Delaware and all others to examine \nthis situation and determine, on the fairness, the propriety and, \nindeed, the national interest of bringing this treaty up today and \nTuesday for floor debate.\n  And for having hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee--I am \nsorry that my friend somewhat disparages the jurisdiction of this \ncommittee. But we have the jurisdiction. And I can point to the rules \nover the critical part of this debate, and that is the stockpile of \nnuclear weapons; that is the exclusive province of our committee. It is \nan integral part.\n  In that vein, we held 3 days of hearings. One was behind closed \ndoors, when the intelligence community, to the extent I can reveal it, \non their own initiative brought up the need to start a total new survey \nabout the ability of this country, and indeed others, to monitor the \nterms of this treaty. We did not ask for it. They did it on their own \ninitiative. They brought it up. That survey and study will take a \nperiod of some months and go into next year.\n  But the point is, I say to my distinguished friend from Delaware, \nthis institution operates on the basis of rules. It was total comity \nbetween the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished \nminority leader for a period of 3 days; and finally the Senate--all 100 \nSenators--participated either by being on the floor or consultation \nwith their respective leaders in the unanimous consent agreement. So \nprocess is behind us.\n  To me, to constantly bring up, as the Senator from Delaware did, the \nissue of the process, it has been covered by our distinguished leader \ntoday. It has been covered by the Senator from Delaware. We should move \nforward at this moment with this serious debate on the fundamental \nissue; and that is whether or not this treaty is in America's national \nsecurity interest.\n  I think the press is accurately reporting the facts of the hearing \nheld yesterday, again in the Armed Services Committee, when the \nDirectors of the laboratories--these are not politicians, these \nindividuals who have served in their capacity as top scientists for our \ncountry for 10, 12, 15 years--came before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and told us, with the Secretary of Energy, their boss, \nsitting right there, their own opinions.\n  Any reasonable individual, in examining their statements in their \ntotality, must come to the conclusions which are accurately reported in \nthe very article that appeared today in the New York Times: They cannot \ngive that degree of opinion that is needed to move forward on this \ntreaty. They simply cannot do that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I want to make two points.\n  What I said about the lack of an intelligence community, CIA \nconclusion that Russia has exploded a nuclear device was cleared by the \nCIA to be able to be said. The operative word is ``conclusion.'' They \nreached no such conclusion, and that was cleared. I did not speak out \nof turn.\n  No. 2, with regard to yesterday's--and through the kindness of my \nfriend from Virginia, he has allowed a lowly member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee to sit in on his hearings. Yesterday, in front of \nthe Armed Services Committee, all three lab Directors testified that \nour stockpile today is safe and reliable.\n  Let me read what Dr. Browne said. Dr. Browne said:\n\n       I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program \n     will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear \n     deterrent without nuclear testing.\n\n  Let me further lay out for you that each Director--all three--\nanswered this when Senator Levin asked the following question. Senator \nLevin asked the following question to all three Directors:\n\n       Are you on board with this treaty?\n\n  Every single one of the lab Directors said, ``Yes.''\n  People will say: How can the honorable Senator from Virginia--and he \nis--say what he said and the Senator from Delaware say what he said? \nHow can they be in disagreement? I will answer the question for you.\n  Remember, I said at the beginning ``keep your eye on the ball here.'' \nIt is true, if we do not fully fund the stockpile at $4.5 billion per \nyear for 10 years, that all three of them lose confidence in the \nability to do that.\n  It is kind of ironic. The main reason why we fear that we will fund \nthis--and I challenge anyone to show me this is wrong--is because a \nRepublican-controlled House of Representatives is balking at funding \nit, not because we have not; we have funded it. The distinguished \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee is sitting behind me. We \ndid our part.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Virginia has \nthe floor for the purposes of a question. But the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia--it had been indicated he could speak.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If we will all yield, I will yield. I just wanted to set \nthe record straight.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will resume our colloquy thereafter. I think it is \nimportant that we have our colleague's remarks.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do, too. I think it is very important we have the \nbenefit of precision--precision--precision.\n  Mr. WARNER. Following that, we could resume our colloquy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Following that, I will yield to my friend from New Mexico.\n  Mr. WARNER. Having had the floor, I have to reply to the assertions \nyou made about yesterday's hearings over which I presided and sat there \nfor 5 hours and 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I challenge my friend between now and the \ntime----\n  Mr. WARNER. I will reply to that challenge, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me say it another way. I respectfully request my \nfriend answer two questions while he is getting ready to respond: Did \nor did not Dr. Browne say: ``I am confident that a fully supported and \nsustained program will enable us to continue to maintain America's \nnuclear deterrent without nuclear testing''? I will give him that. \nSecondly, would he be able to respond and tell me how I am wrong, that \nwhen all three Directors were asked, ``Are you on board with this \ntreaty?'' and every single one answered: ``Yes.''\n  Mr. WARNER. I will provide that. We have to extend Senatorial \ncourtesy to our colleague.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be here throughout the entire day, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator. The debate is \nnow beginning to occur on this very important subject. I associate \nmyself with the remarks of the Senator from Virginia, as he explained \nto the Senate and to the public the nature of the procedure by which we \nhave arrived at\n\n[[Page S12295]]\n\nthis event and this process that the leadership of both sides of the \naisle, over a 3-day period, concluded, which was agreed to by unanimous \nconsent, would be the process for discussing the treaty. It is very \nimportant, in light of certain debates that had more to do with the \nprocess than the treaty. That was decided by the leadership. We are now \ndebating the treaty, not the number of hearings, et cetera.\n  In the modern Senate, in my judgment, individual Senators come to \ndecisions on monumental issues, such as this treaty, far more from \ntheir personal and internal counsel than they do whether or not there \nhave been a series of hearings. Not very many Senators are able to \nattend those hearings, but they are gathering the information unto \nthemselves, and they have been weighing the facts about this treaty for \na long, long time. That is where the personal decision is likely to be \nmade. I know that is the case in my case.\n  Therefore, I rise in strong opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. Despite what we are hearing from the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue and the other side of the aisle, ratification of this treaty is \ndangerous and would jeopardize the national security of the United \nStates. President Clinton, the strongest proponent of this treaty, \nclaims it would ``constrain the development of nuclear weapons, \ncontribute to preventing nuclear proliferation, and enhance the ability \nof the United States to monitor suspicious nuclear activities in other \ncountries.''\n  I believe the President and those advocates of that point of view are \nwrong on every count. The treaty will not prevent countries from \nobtaining or developing nuclear weapons. Take the 1970 Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, a treaty designed to stop the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons. Despite its good intentions, which, of course, this \ntreaty also embraces, nuclear proliferation continues today for one \nsimple reason--nations act in accordance with their own national \nsecurity interests.\n  The 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty did not prevent countries \nsuch as China, Iran, and Pakistan from acquiring or transferring \nnuclear technology. We cannot be so naive as to believe that such \ncountries will behave differently if we pass this treaty. We must also \ntake into account that our own conventional arms superiority will \nencourage other nations to cheat on the treaty.\n  My point is this: As the world understands that the United States \ncannot be challenged in conventional warfare--we are clearly the most \npowerful Nation in the world on any conventional act of warfare--that \nmeans other nations which may be adversaries will be pushed toward the \nneed to have nuclear capacity as a quid pro quo to the United States. \nStrangely enough, even the administration admits that the treaty does \nnot represent an effective deterrent for nuclear proliferation or \nmodernization. In testimony before the Senate in 1998, the Acting Under \nSecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs \nsaid he could not identify a single nation that wouldn't seek nuclear \nweapons, if the treaty were to enter into force.\n  Second, the treaty is not verifiable. Former Director of Central \nIntelligence, James Woolsey, testified before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee last year that ``a zero yield Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty is extraordinarily difficult to the point of impossibility \nto verify from afar.''\n  The distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nrecently brought to this body's attention a Washington Post article \nwhich reported that the CIA cannot monitor low-level nuclear tests by \nRussia. So while our Central Intelligence Agency is telling us it can't \nverify compliance with the treaty, our administration persists in its \nmisguided efforts to ratify the treaty. In effect, this administration \nis proposing that the United States adhere scrupulously to such a \ntreaty while other nations will not be verifiably doing so by \ncontinuing to develop and acquire nuclear weapons. Ratification, then, \nmeans that the rogue and other nations would be gaining militarily over \nthe United States.\n  Third, despite what the administration would have us believe, nuclear \ntesting is essential to maintaining a strong and credible U.S. nuclear \narsenal and deterrent. Most experts agree that nuclear tests are \nnecessary to maintain the proper functioning of nuclear weapons and \nwarheads and to modernize the existing stockpile for enhanced safety \nand effectiveness.\n  I want to digress a moment. If the world ever begins to believe that \nour arsenal is less than effective, it encourages bad behavior. If we \never come to believe we are not certain about our nuclear arsenal and \nits capacity, we become destabilized as a nation.\n  Many weapons believed to be reliable and thoroughly tested \nnevertheless developed problems which were only discovered and could \nonly be fixed through nuclear testing. One-third of all the weapon \ndesigns placed in the stockpile since 1958 have required and received \npostdeployment nuclear tests to resolve problems. In three-quarters of \nthese cases, the problems were only identified and assessed as a result \nof nuclear testing and could only be fixed by nuclear testing.\n  The proponents of the treaty think we can do this through computer \nmodeling, but most experts will quickly tell us that we don't know \nwhether the computer modeling will work and probably won't know for \nanother 10 years.\n  In short, only by testing will the United States be able to maintain \na nuclear stockpile that is able to defend against threats from abroad, \nrogue nations, to provide a credible deterrent to hostile nations and \nmaintain confidence in the safety and reliability of our nuclear \nweapons, and to make sure those other nations understand we have a \nreliable, effective nuclear deterrent.\n  It is important to note that the value of America's nuclear arsenal \ndiminishes dramatically if nations, rogue or otherwise, come to believe \nour deterrent is not safe and not reliable. The nuclear umbrella \nextended for decades to cover allies such as Germany and Japan has been \nan important factor in convincing these technologically proficient \nnations not to acquire their own weapons, precisely because of the \nsafety and reliability of our weapons. So what kind of decisions do \nthey begin to make if they ever believe they cannot count on the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent?\n  Mr. President, I want to make a couple of closing comments.\n  The other day, Senator Biden of Delaware, in his earlier remarks \nabout the treaty, said something to the effect that this decision would \n``hang over the heads'' of each of us who will be called upon to vote. \nThe inference was, well, if those of us who oppose the treaty make an \nerror, that will hang over all of our heads. I point out to the Senator \nfrom Delaware that this decision will live with each of us, no matter \nwhat decision we make.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The inference was not that those who voted no were the \nonly ones who would be taking a chance; the inference was that whomever \namong us turned out to be wrong is going to, in fact, have a long time \nto pay.\n  These are big stakes. If, in fact, you vote no, and if proliferation \naccelerates, whether or not because of this, mark my words, those who \nvoted no will pay. Conversely, if you vote yes and we find out a year \nor 2 or 3 from now that all those horrible concerns about the treaty \nturned out to be true and the Soviets have a superiority and the \nChinese are doing this, then those of us who voted for the treaty will \nbe held accountable, as we should. I wasn't applying it to one side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. He has clarified and made the very point I was going \nto make--that, clearly, if somehow proliferation accelerated, those who \nhave voted no would have to feel they made an error in judgment. On the \nother hand, if those who voted for it found themselves in a situation \nwhere the U.S. deterrent had diminished, that the new testing \nprocedures were not as effective, and that world rogues had suddenly \nbecome very weighty in the world, much would hang over their heads.\n  My closing point is this: Which mistake is worse? In other words, if \nthe mistake is another nation has a weapon that it didn't today, that \nwould not be good. I personally don't think this treaty is going to \nstop those nations. But, on the other hand, if the conclusion of the \nerror is that we are unable to defend ourselves, first--or secondarily, \nwe have somehow destabilized\n\n[[Page S12296]]\n\nour allies and have made the world less safe, which is a worse error? I \nthink of a poster I have seen in the office of Senator Gramm of Texas. \nIt says: When the day comes, if the lion lies down with the lamb, we \nbetter be darn sure we are the lion.\n  The emotion the Senator has expressed today is laudable. It is a \nweighty decision. I think the Senator gives more to the reports and the \nprocess than I would, from my limited experience. He has been here a \nlot longer. As I said, while he was off the floor, I think personal \ncounsel has a weightier importance on these kinds of issues. In the \nlimited time I have been here, we have been through three of them now \nin the process. But if I were to have to pick between where we would be \non the balance of mistakes, I would pick the safer one, where we have \nthe capacity to defend ourselves.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on my time, in response, I think the \nSenator from Georgia has narrowed it precisely. Let me tell you why I \nthink the side on which he errs is the biggest chance. There is a \nsafeguard F in this treaty which says that if at any time those \nlaboratory Directors certify that they cannot certify the reliability \nof our stockpile--and they must do it once a year--and communicate that \nto the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy, and they \nconcur with that judgment, which most assuredly they would, barring \ntheir place in history being besmirched in a significant way, then we \nhave in this treaty the absolute authority, under safeguard F, to \nwithdraw.\n\n  So the reason I believe we should err on the side of not testing \nnuclearly--knowing that if, in fact, it becomes necessary to safeguard \nus, we can get out legally in a moment's notice--is that failing to \ntake that very small chance, we open up a door that cannot be closed, \nor is difficult to close. If, as a consequence of no treaty, China \nbegins significant testing and MIRVs ICBMs and moves them from 18 to \n800, or 8,000, or 5,000, if in fact Pakistan and India test further so \nthey can deploy their weapons on the nose cones of missiles that can be \nfired, it is incredibly more difficult to turn that clock back, to put \nthat genie back in the bottle, than it is for a President of the United \nStates, upon the recommendation of the Secretaries of Defense and \nEnergy, saying, Mr. President, get out, get out.\n  The last point I will make is this: I know of no program--and I stand \nto be corrected--where there has been a quantum leap in the capacity of \na country that has taken us by total surprise, where we have had less \nthan a year's notice. The likelihood of any fundamental change in the \nstrategic balance during the year period, during the last certification \nand the next certification, is not reasonable. We are the only Nation \nin the world with the sophisticated capability to even approach that \npossibility. So that is why I respect my friend from Georgia, and he \nknows I do. That is why I decided we are taking very little chance \nrelative to a gigantic chance if we turn the treaty down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware knows the \nrespect is mutual. I just point out that people of honor and good faith \ncan come down on very different sides of these questions, as we have \nseen among experts.\n  Ultimately, each of us will have to personally balance this equation. \nThe political process that has already developed this treaty is the \nvery thing that worries me about the escape clause you talk about. I \ndon't have any confidence in it. I just don't believe, as you do, that \nthis treaty will put any genie in the bottle. I will close with that. I \nadmire the Senator from Delaware for his work. We simply have come to \ntwo different conclusions in this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Again, as usual, my friend from Georgia goes to the heart \nof the issue. If you put everything else aside, you take all the detail \naway, you will find at its root--I am not suggesting that everybody who \nopposes this treaty doesn't believe everything they are saying; they \ndo. But at its root, it comes down to a belief that has been the case \nin almost all the debates on treaties--and I am not suggesting that \neverybody has opposed every treaty. But they have argued one final \npiece, and that is simply that they lack faith in the political will of \nthis country to do whatever is required. That has been the closing and \nlegitimate argument raised. It was raised in START I, START II, SALT I, \nand SALT II.\n  The issue was whether or not we would so change the political climate \nthat we lull ourselves to sleep. My friend from New Mexico remembers \nthe argument that we would not have the political will to reengage. It \nis a legitimate argument. I do not give it short shrift. I think it is \nthe single most serious argument against this treaty.\n  I will close by saying, as the kids say, I will put my experts up \nagainst your experts. I have more of them, numerically.\n  Mr. President, I think it is our turn. I yield 10 minutes to Senator \nBingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nBiden, for yielding time and also for his eloquent statements in \nopposition to going to a vote on this treaty.\n  First, I know everyone says we shouldn't talk about the process, that \nthe process is history. But I think we should talk about the process \nand talk about the fact that next Tuesday is not the time this Senate \nshould dispose of this issue. The reality is that there is a lot of \nuncertainty and a lot of confusion.\n  I learned early in my career that when you are uncertain, the best \nthing to do is sleep on it, take a little time, and let the issue \nresolve itself in your mind before you move ahead. And clearly there \nare a lot of unknowns out there that we need to know before we finally \nvote on this issue.\n  I hope that leadership--particularly the majority leader--will find a \nway to step back from this vote and give the Senate time to get the \nnewest estimate from the intelligence community about what the \ncapabilities of Russia are with regard to low-yield weapons development \nand also to get other expert advice.\n  Clearly, this is an issue of monumental importance. As we start a new \ncentury, we should not rush to judgment before we have given every \nSenator an opportunity to learn the issue and to understand the \nimplications of it.\n  Our nuclear arsenal was developed, and has been maintained, because \nwe believe having a safe and credible and reliable nuclear arsenal has \nimproved and continues to improve U.S. security. I believe that. I am \nsure we will continue to maintain that nuclear arsenal as long as we \nstill have that judgment.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is the issue now before us, \nraises the question of whether we can continue to maintain our nuclear \ndeterrent and maintain our national security through having that \nnuclear deterrent under a regime of no additional nuclear testing. I \nbelieve we can.\n  I believe the benefits we derive from going ahead with this treaty \nand in slowing the spread, and the improvement, of nuclear weapons \naround the world by others make this treaty very much in our national \ninterest.\n  Some have argued that without the ability to test nuclear weapons, we \ncannot have 100-percent confidence that those weapons will work as \nintended. I agree with that. I think it is undoubtedly true that an \nunlimited testing regime will give us a higher degree of confidence in \nour own nuclear weapons than no testing at all. Clearly, that is true \nfor all of our potential adversaries as well. They will do better at \ndeveloping weapons, and they will have a more capable, reliable nuclear \narsenal to point at us--potential adversaries will--if we go ahead and \nhave them pursue unconstrained testing.\n  But we can, in my view, have sufficient confidence in the reliability \nof our weapons through the work we have labeled the Stockpile \nStewardship Program. This is a program that has been discussed \nfrequently on the Senate floor. It is one I have spent many hours \nstudying and trying to understand in the nuclear weapons laboratories \nin my State--Los Alamos and Sandia.\n  I think we need to balance against this concern about lack of 100-\npercent confidence. We need to balance against that the consequences \nthat would result from a rejection of this treaty by the Senate.\n  Senator Moynihan spoke about the likely reaction of a rejection of \nthis\n\n[[Page S12297]]\n\ntreaty in India and Pakistan, both countries which have demonstrated \ntheir nuclear capability already and are on the way toward developing a \nreal nuclear arsenal that can be used against each other or other \ncountries.\n\n  Other Senators have talked on the floor about the likely effect of a \nrejection of this treaty on China or on Russia. The simple fact is that \nthe United States is far ahead of any other country in the world in our \nability to maintain our nuclear deterrent under a no-testing regime.\n  Our allies--and that includes our allies who have nuclear weapons--\nbelieve it is in their interest and in the interest of the world for us \nto go forward with this treaty and believe that, on balance, their \nsecurity will be enhanced if we go forward with this treaty. If that is \ntheir judgment--those nuclear-capable countries depend much more on \ntesting than we do--that a no-testing regime will, on balance, improve \ntheir national security, then I have trouble seeing how entry into a \ntest ban treaty can put us at a comparative disadvantage when we have \ntremendous capability to determine the reliability and safety of our \nweapons without testing--not 100-percent capability, but we have great \ncapability and capability that far exceeds that of any other potential \nadversary.\n  Let me say, in closing, I would like to go back to this issue of \nprocedure and where we go. Since it is clear to me, and I think to all \nSenators and all observers of the Senate, that the two-thirds votes \nnecessary under our Constitution to ratify this treaty are not present \ntoday in the Senate and are not likely to be on Tuesday, I think it \nwould be a tragic mistake for us to go ahead with that vote next week. \nI hope very much that cooler heads prevail, as the Senator from \nVirginia said earlier in the discussion. I hope cooler heads prevail \nand we find a way to put this off to a time when we can approach it \nwith more knowledge and better judgment.\n  In the final analysis, the question we must decide is whether this \ntreaty will reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons, reduce the \nnumber of states with nuclear arsenals, and lessen the likelihood of \nnuclear weapons being used in the next century. That is the issue \nbefore us. I believe it will accomplish each of those end results. I \nbelieve the treaty will have that effect. When it does come to a vote, \nI hope very much that two-thirds of the Members of this Senate have the \ngood judgment to support the treaty.\n  Mr. President, I see there is another Senator wishing to speak. I \nyield the floor, and I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am excited and optimistic about our \nnext century and about the next millennium. We made great human \ntechnical progress in the 19th century. A lot of things happened in \nthat century that were good. We continued that technological progress \nin the 20th century. Unfortunately, the forces of totalitarianism, war, \nfascism, and communism have run loose in the 20th century to an \nunprecedented degree. Millions died as a result. I do believe, though, \nthe next century, the 21st century, can be the greatest in the history \nof mankind.\n  Hitler and his forces of national socialism were crushed in this \ncentury. Communism and the ``Evil Soviet Empire'' collapsed. The world \nis a better place with even greater possibilities. We can work together \nand promote peace, order, stability, and ensure economic, \ntechnological, and medical progress to an unprecedented degree. This, I \nbelieve, can and will happen.\n  Yes, there will be problems. Ambition, ignorance, greed, and hatred \nwill not be eliminated from the face of this Earth. These will abide. \nBut from a global perspective, they can be contained, and peace and \nprogress can be expanded in the next century to an unprecedented \ndegree. For this to happen, however, the United States must lead. It \ncannot be Russia. They have deep economic and political problems. It \ncan't be China. They are driven by the Communist chimeras and old \nambitions. It can't be Europe, for they have not achieved the political \nunity or the military strength to act quickly and decisively. The \nUnited States has the burden to lead for peace. And not just peace--we \nneed peace with justice, a much harder goal.\n  We are a nation composed of immigrants from all the nations of the \nEarth. People from all over the world came here to live in freedom. We \nhave also been blessed with the economic, technological, and military \nstrength in addition to the cultural diversity that enables America to \nbe a unique world leader.\n  Yes, many criticize the United States, but they all fundamentally \nrecognize our critical role in a stable and healthy world order. This \ndoesn't mean we are to be the world's policeman for every little \nmatter, but we must lead with confidence and strength. It is necessary, \ntherefore, for our country to have credibility when we speak, to be \nrespected by all, to be feared by expansionist and dangerous forces, \nand to continue, with even more skill, our self-confident world \nleadership that we have shown in recent years.\n  That is why I have decided it is necessary for me to oppose the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I am of the firm opinion this treaty \nwill do at least two things. It will certainly cause our current \nnuclear stockpiles to be degraded. Simulated tests, all agree, can \nnever be as good as actual tests. Secondly, it will reduce our capacity \nand, more importantly, perhaps, our will to improve our weapons \nsystems--to keep up with scientific advancements. The result, \ntherefore, will be that the United States will see its nuclear power \ndegraded and its capacity for world leadership eroded. This means less \nstability in the world. Our allies will have less confidence in our \nnuclear umbrella. Our adversaries will be more confident, more active, \nmore willing to be aggressive and to push the limits. In addition, our \nconfidence in our own ability to act and lead will be diminished. Our \nPresident and Congress must be certain of our ability to act.\n  Senator Warner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, a \ntremendous patriot with extraordinary experience in matters military, a \nman who loves his country, who supports our President when he can and \nbelieves he should, who opposes this treaty steadfastly, recently said \nthere can be no doubt in the credibility of that stockpile. That is it, \nfundamentally. We can't have doubts, our adversaries can't have doubts, \nand our allies can't have doubts.\n  There have been a lot of discussions about verification. This treaty \ncannot be adequately verified. We have talked about a lot of other \nissues today. Safety--how can we be sure of safety if we are not \ntesting our weapons?\n  I will discuss for a few minutes specifically what I believe is a \nfundamental danger or effect of a complete ban of all testing forever, \nwhich this treaty does. In effect, the goal of this treaty will be and \nis to cap, to freeze, to stop improvements in weapons systems. It will \ninclude our weapons systems.\n  Some say: Jeff, we can still do research and they don't have to do \nall this testing.\n  That is not entirely accurate. Yesterday, as the Director of the \nSandia Laboratory testified, they have design data at this time that \ncould be used to produce a new weapon, but they cannot test it to bring \nit online. That is a significant statement, I believe. We have that \ncapability now, and we are not going to use it.\n  Of course, basic weapons, the Hiroshima-type bomb, do not need to be \ntested. Everybody who is of scientific sophistication in the world--and \nthere are 44 countries today that are either estimated to be or are \nactually nuclear-capable--all over the world people have the capability \nof building a basic nuclear bomb. We ought to know this ban would have \nno impact on that. This treaty would have no impact on buying and \nselling of nuclear weapons from a country that has already produced.\n  What this treaty is doing--and I want Members to think about this--is \nattempting an act that is extraordinary. We will attempt to stop \nresearch and testing on new materials and new weapons. If the United \nStates signs such a treaty, we know we will comply with it; we will \ncomply with the spirit and we will not continue to research and develop \nthrough testing. Such a decision, I believe, would be unwise and would \nbe contrary to human nature and our tendency to progress, improve,\n\n[[Page S12298]]\n\nand advance --characteristics of humanity.\n\n  To pass a treaty such as this will certainly slow our interest in \nmodernization, but it is not likely to slow the research of other \ncapable nuclear nations. They are behind. They--many, at least--will be \ndetermined to catch up. They will use this treaty to catch up, similar \nto the yellow caution flag when there is an accident on a race course--\nallowing those off the lead lap to catch up to the leaders. CTBT will \nallow other states that opportunity.\n  Secondly, in their efforts to catch up, our adversaries may well even \nachieve a breakthrough, a technological advancement that could leapfrog \nthem even beyond the United States into nuclear leadership in this \nworld. That will not only be bad for America, it will be a setback for \nstability and peace and justice for the whole world. We have an \nobligation to work to promote peace and stability.\n  The goal of this Nation, I so strongly believe, is to be a preeminent \nworld power. We have to understand what comes with that: The \nresponsibility to be strong.\n  President Reagan said a number of years ago:\n\n       Our policy is simple: We are not going to betray our \n     friends, reward the enemies of freedom, or permit fear and \n     retreat to become American policies, especially in this \n     hemisphere. None of the four wars in my lifetime came about \n     because we were too strong. It is weakness--weakness that \n     invites adventurous adversaries to make mistaken judgments.\n\n  I think that is the history of mankind. Winston Churchill warned \nEngland about that when Nazi Germany was on the early march and they \ncould have been stopped earlier at much less cost.\n  I have seen it argued by some that the passage of this treaty will \nfreeze our nuclear leadership in place. I believe that is not sound \nreasoning. That is a foolhardy concept. It will stop America from \nimproving our arsenal. It will stop America from improving our \ntechnology. It will allow, I submit, our adversaries to catch up and, \nGod forbid, pass us.\n  Some may believe all the world powers are the same. They used to say \nwe are just a bunch of scorpions in a bottle. I disagree. The United \nStates has a unique role in the world, a unique ability to lead for \ngood. Our leadership has been good for the world. I defy anyone to \ndispute it. When historians write of our role in the next century, I \nwant them to write that we used our power to lead the world in great \nprogress toward peace, with justice and economic and technological and \nmedical prosperity.\n  This goal is not going to be furthered by fuzzy thinking. It will not \nbe achieved if we just sign away, by this treaty, capabilities we have \nthat enable America to lead. That is why we are able to lead--because \nwe have superiority. If there are two football teams--and in Alabama we \nhave a lot of them--some of them like to throw a pass and some maybe \ncannot throw a pass so well. It would be nice to have a treaty \nbeforehand that the one with the ability to pass would sign away that \nability. That doesn't happen on a football field, and it won't happen \nin the world.\n  Our leadership is important, and our military power is crucial to it. \nThat is the solid foundation on which we have to build. We benefited \nfrom a certain number of treaties with the Soviet Union that dealt with \nnuclear weapons in the past. I believe we can continue our efforts to \nreduce the number of weapons in our arsenal. I believe we can perhaps \nreduce by 50 percent the nuclear stockpile we have. Yes, we can do \nthat. There are a lot of things we can do that promote peace. But to \nban all testing of all nuclear weapons? That is a mistake. I do not \nbelieve that will promote peace.\n  I do not believe so. I favor our doing all we can do to stop \nproliferation, the spread of nuclear weapons around the world. The \ntruth is, this will probably be done best on a nation-by-nation basis. \nWhen Pakistan and India had their fuss earlier last year and one \ntested, then the other one tested. Why? Because they felt their \nexistence at stake, and no piece of paper is going to stop any nation \nfrom developing what it believes it has to develop to maintain its \nfreedom, to maintain its autonomy, its independence as a nation. That \nwill not happen.\n  What we have done, as the United States, is provide a nuclear \numbrella. We have been able to say to nations: We are not going to let \nother nuclear powers do you in. Don't develop weapons, we will be \nthere, we will stand firm. We have the capability to destroy anyone who \nattempts to destroy you.\n  People have relied on that. Many nations have. Germany and Japan \ncould easily develop nuclear weapons. They have declined to do so based \non our assurances.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Why did they ratify the treaty, then, and why did they \ndirectly contact us in an extraordinary way through their leadership \nand say: Please, U.S. Senate, ratify it?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate that question. It is my view--sometimes it \nis internal politics. Sometimes, though, it is a lack of being able to \nwalk in our shoes.\n  This is a very significant time for us. We need to ask ourselves who \nwe are as a nation. We are in a class of one. A treaty such as this \nwould be good for Japan. It would be good for Germany, perhaps. But it \nwould constrain us and, in the long run--they may not realize it--it \ncould jeopardize our ability to guarantee their freedom.\n  So on the proliferation question, 44 nations have this ability to \ndevelop nuclear weapons and have them. It is already out there. Others \nare going to continue to get it. It will not stop.\n  I say to America: Please listen. We are a unique world power. We must \nuse that power for good. We must maintain nuclear leadership in the \nworld, and we cannot forfeit our power by signing it away for a treaty \nat the urging of politically correct and fuzzy thinkers.\n  I have a vision in my mind about treaties. We have to watch them, I \nthink. It is Gulliver in the land of Lilliputians, stretched out, \nunable to move because he has been tied down by a whole host of \nthreads. Powerful Gulliver, unable to move, tied down by strings and \nthreads of multiple numbers.\n  We are not one of equals. The United States is in a category of its \nown at this point in history. This treaty might be good for Japan, \nEngland, France. It will not be good for us, and in the long term, the \nlong run, I am convinced for world peace.\n  I remember--I wasn't in this body--a number of years ago in Europe \nthere was a fuss--Senator Warner remembers it, and Senator Biden--about \nwhether or not to put Pershing nuclear missiles and intermediate-range \nmissiles into Germany. The Germans, despite the most intense anti-nuke \nGreens and so forth who were there, agreed with President Reagan to do \nso. Critics said it would cause war and could lead to nuclear war. But \nthe truth is, it led to peace. That strength, that commitment \nunequivocally made, saying we will not allow Germany, we will not allow \nEurope--we are willing to put our necks on the line, our nuclear power \non the line, to guarantee the independence and freedom of Western \nEurope. It was a blow for peace. It helped lead to the collapse of the \nSoviet Union.\n  I recall a few years ago a discussion on Firing Line between William \nBuckley, Jr. and a liberal editor. At the end of the wonderful \ndiscussion, the editor poured forth his hopes and dreams for a more \npeaceful world.\n  Mr. Buckley paused respectfully for a while and then he said:\n       Well, friend, I hope you won't mind if I work to defend the \n     Republic while you are working on these grand plans.\n\n  That is where we are today. I believe we have a burden. I believe we \nought not to sign away the unique capacity that we have as a nation to \nimprove our nuclear arsenal. One of the things we do so well, and most \npeople may not know, is that we have produced sophisticated, highly \ntargetable weapons--weapons capable of being very accurately targeted \nto attack military targets, hardened defensive targets, not just aiming \nthem at population centers. So the extent to which we can improve our \narsenal may give us the ability to be stronger militarily and actually \navoid any more loss of life than would be necessary in such a conflict.\n  I think we are at an important time. The President asked for and \nwanted this debate. It is not as if anybody did not know it was out \nthere. It had been discussed for quite a number of years.\n\n[[Page S12299]]\n\nThe truth is, there are not votes to pass this treaty. Some say maybe \nwe ought to pass on it and not vote on it this time and keep it alive. \nI thought about that. Some good people think that may be the right \nidea. But I have my doubts.\n  I think it might be a good thing for the world to see the Senate vote \nthis treaty down. It is not a good treaty. I think it would send the \nworld the word, and I think around the capitals of the globe we would \nhave some hard-headed world leaders saying: Wow, we thought the United \nStates could be moved by all this anguish and talk and pleas and \npolitical correctness. This is odd. They are able to act in their own \nself-interest and show leadership. I am impressed.\n  I think that might be the long-term result of this, instead of some \nof the calamities our friends would say will happen. I just do not \nthink the world is so fragile that the United States, acting in its own \nrational self-interest that this treaty is not good, turns it down, \nthat we are going to head for a nuclear holocaust. I think, indeed, it \ncould cause us to go back once again to perhaps craft a treaty that is \njustifiable, that will work, that will allow us to modernize and \ninnovate and at the same time promote security and peace in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think I have recognition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator withhold for a moment? We were going back \nand forth. I assured the Senator from New Jersey that he would be able \nto go next. He is not going to take all that long. Since you and I are \ngoing to be here, is it appropriate?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are going to be here. But as a matter \nof courtesy, I just wanted to thank my colleague for his very valuable \ncontribution.\n  He is a member of our committee. He attended the hearings that we \nhave had in the course of this week, and he referred, with great \naccuracy, to the testimony that was given to our committee.\n  But clearly, good, sound, public servants, nonpoliticians, having \nspent anywhere from a decade to three decades of their lives working in \ntheir respective fields--whether it was the technical field, with the \nlaboratory directors, or the military field, they had honest \ndifferences of opinion. There was no consensus, no strong consensus \nexcept the case, the weight of the case against the treaty grew day, by \nday, by day from that testimony, culminating, as you know, in this \narticle in the New York Times this morning, which addresses the very \nheart of this treaty in which these lab directors--I don't know whether \nthey are Republicans or Democrats or what they are; they are not \nwrapped up in this process of the Senate; they are not arguing a \nunanimous consent--are simply telling their fellow scientists the world \nover, the citizens of this country, the scientists in charge of \nmaintaining the safety and reliability of the Nation's nuclear \narsenals, they might not be able to do their job without nuclear tests. \nThat is actual firing of weapons that would be outlawed--outlawed, they \nused the word--under this treaty.\n  I thank the Senator. I want to come back to the laboratory, the \ntestimony my colleague from Delaware and I were in colloquy about. We \nintermittently yield to other Senators. I yield at this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the chairman yield? I would like to say how much I \nenjoyed serving with Senator Warner, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He has had full hearings on this matter. I have seen his \nconviction grow as day, after day, testimony in hearings has indicated \nthis is not a good treaty.\n  I know the Senator from Virginia would support it if he believed it \nwas the right thing. I know he has developed a firm view that it is not \nthe right thing. I certainly respect that. It certainly has impacted my \nview of it, and I agree with him.\n  My instincts are that this is not good for America, and when we say \nno, it is not going to hurt us in the world. People are going to \nrespect us because we are acting in our legitimate, just interests. We \nare acting for peace and stability, as a great leader of the world \nought to act, and we ought not to be pushed around by some polling data \nto pass some treaty that is going to undermine our strength as a \nnation. I thank the chairman for his leadership.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to my friend from New Jersey--how much time would \nhe like?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 10 minutes to my friend from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I first note my appreciation, and I \nsuspect all Senators, for the manner in which Senator Warner and \nSenator Biden have conducted a debate of profound national importance. \nIt speaks well of the quality and tone of debate in the Senate.\n  There are always moments in our lives we suspect we will always \nremember, those times that punctuate our activities and our \nexperiences. Several nights ago, on the eve of the Senate's \nconsideration of this treaty, President Clinton, sitting in the \nresidence, reminded some of us that the last time the Senate rejected a \ntreaty was in 1920, the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty called for the \nestablishment of a League of Nations. The United States, as reflected \nby the Senate, was so traumatized by the First World War, so anxious \nfor the creation of a time that it would never visit again, that it \ndrew all the wrong lessons from the First World War. As a consequence, \nit defeated the Treaty. A Treaty that was, in Woodrow Wilson's words, \n``the last hope of mankind.''\n  We now find ourselves in this debate 80 years later. Yet having \nemerged from the cold war, the trauma and sacrifices of generations in \ndealing with that enormous national struggle, I fear that, once again, \nwe are drawing all the wrong lessons. Essentially, it is the belief of \nmany of my colleagues that the arms control regimes of the last 40 \nyears were successful; that the bipartisan foreign policy from \nEisenhower to Clinton, based on a concept of nonproliferation and arms \ncontrol regimes, could provide real security for the United States; \nand, that seeking security in arms races and technological military \ndominance was illusory.\n  It is extraordinary that, during this debate, we demonstrate a lack \nof confidence in arms control regimes or believe the United States is \nbetter defended outside of these treaties because that is such a \ncontradiction with national experience.\n  In the last 40 years, the United States, from Eisenhower to Nixon, \nKennedy, Johnson, Carter, Bush, and Reagan have ratified START I and \nII, SALT I and II, the ABM Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nBiological Weapons Convention, the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Limited \nTest Ban Treaty, the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, Partial Test \nBan Treaty, the Open Skies Agreement, the Outer Space Agreement, and \nsigned the Missile Technology Control Regime. The nation is profoundly \nmore secure because of each and every one of those treaties and \nregimes.\n  Every Senate and each President at a moment in history faced the same \njudgment we face today. Are we better off by allowing other nations and \nourselves to develop weapons outside of these regimes or should we have \nconfidence in our ability to verify and be more secure within their \nlimits?\n  It appears the Senate may, for the first time in a generation and for \nthe second time in this century, believe that it is better to reject a \ntreaty negotiated by an American President and operate outside of its \nregime. It is a profound decision with enormous consequences. The \nsimple truth is, arms control regimes have enhanced the security of the \nUnited States; indeed, they have enhanced the security of all nations.\n\n  Since 1945, despite their development, possession, and deployment by \na variety of nations, nuclear weapons have never been used in a hostile \nenvironment. It may be the first or certainly the longest period in \nhuman history that weapons were developed and not used. Indeed, nations \nhave even gone to war with each other or been in severe conflict and \nnot used these weapons. It is the ultimate testament that arms\n\n[[Page S12300]]\n\ncontrol works to protect national security.\n  I would understand if the leader of the Iranian Parliament or the \nNorth Korean Supreme People's Assembly were to rise in their respective \nchambers and argue passionately against this treaty. They would have \ntheir reasons. The treaty will allow the United States to maintain the \npreeminent nuclear stockpile in the world, having the only effective \nmeans of continuing to test its weapons by simulation, while the treaty \nwould make it difficult for those nations to continue to develop and \nmodernize their nuclear arsenal. Their opposition would be rational. \nOur opposition is irrational.\n  It would be understandable if members of the National People's \nCongress in Beijing would rise in indignation against China becoming a \nsignatory to the treaty. The thought that China, a great power, \npossessing 18 missiles capable of delivering a weapon, now on the verge \nof developing important new and dangerous technology both to deliver \nthese weapons and to miniaturize them to threaten a potential adversary \nin the United States or Russia or Europe, would join this treaty would \nbe troubling to them.\n  The Chinese, by entering into this treaty, would be unable to test \nthose weapons, making it difficult to know their effectiveness or their \nreliability. Their opposition would be understandable; it would be \nrational. Ours is not.\n  This treaty is an endorsement of the international military status \nquo, and at this snapshot in time in the life of this planet, the \nmilitary status quo is that the United States is the preeminent \nmilitary power with an abundance of weapons, sophistication of weapons, \ndelivery of weapons. If this current arrangement and distribution of \npower is to be preserved for a generation, it means that every nation \nis accepting American preeminence. By their endorsement of this treaty \nand their signature of this treaty, extraordinarily, every other nation \nseems to be willing to accept that preeminence, ironically except us. \nWe would reject the treaty and allow other nations at a relative \ndisadvantage to test, develop, or deploy effective weapons.\n  There are several important consequences in the defeat of this treaty \nthe Senate needs to consider: first, the damage, not necessarily \nmilitarily, but diplomatically to the leadership of the United States. \nThis country has recognized for more than 50 years the only real \nsecurity of this country is an alliance based principally on the \nfoundation of NATO rested on the credibility of American political \nleadership.\n  The defeat of this treaty will put us at variance with the leaders of \nGermany, France, and Britain, who even on this day have appealed to the \nSenate to endorse this treaty. France and Britain have communicated \ntheir strong desire. They have reminded us that they have made changes \nin their own doctrine, and their own weapons choices, based on this \ntreaty. They have also reminded us that if we defeat this treaty, we \nare in some measure separating not simply our judgments but our future \nplanning and security from our traditional allies--the foundation of \nour international alliance system of our security. It will cause damage \nto our credibility and our leadership that will not be easily repaired.\n  Second, defeat of this treaty, for all practical purposes, is an end \nto our efforts, undertaken on a bipartisan basis for a generation, on \nnonproliferation. It is a practical end to our nonproliferation efforts \nbecause it sends a message to each rogue regime, every nation that \npossesses the capability to develop nuclear weapons, that there is this \nnew sense of legitimacy in them doing so, because the United States has \nrejected a treaty that would have contained this threat. The United \nStates will lose credibility with nations, like India and Pakistan, \nwhen we argue that they should not test again or deploy weapons.\n  Third--perhaps most profoundly and immediately--it will lead to the \npossibility of the testing and the development of the technologies that \nChina has obtained from the United States, through espionage or other \nmeans, and allow them to develop a full capability.\n  There is a final factor. The Senate has convened to debate the \nquestion of a treaty on a comprehensive test ban. But it is not the \nonly treaty that is at issue. The defeat of this Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty will certainly mean that the START agreement pending before the \nRussian Duma will never be adopted.\n  Our chance, with a stroke of a pen, to destroy thousands of Russian \nnuclear warheads, potentially aimed at the United States--the greatest \nsingle threat to the security of this Nation under changed political \ncircumstances--will never be destroyed. We debate one treaty, but we \nare deciding the future of two.\n  Earlier in this day debates centered on procedures and hearings, \nwhether or not the treaty was fully considered. I serve as a member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. I, too, must express my profound \ndisappointment, as a representative of the State of New Jersey, and as \na member of that committee, of not being given the opportunity to fully \ndebate, to consider, to hear witnesses on what potentially could be the \nmost important vote I will ever cast as a Senator.\n  People of good judgment might be able to differ on the merits of this \ntreaty, but no one can defend that an issue of this profound importance \nto the life of this country did not receive the consideration it \ndeserved or Senators within the comity of this institution were not \ngiven the due consideration to learn, debate, and be heard.\n  Because I believe, however, this issue is so important--while I am \nconvinced of its merits and the need for immediate ratification--I end \nmuch as I began with that memory of 1920.\n  Most of us are probably convinced the Senate made the wrong judgment \non the League of Nations, setting the world on a dangerous downward \nspiral of confrontation, having come to the false conclusion that \nAmerica would be secure alone behind her oceans, that in isolation \nsomehow we would find peace. It was wrong.\n  But in truth, if the moment could be revisited, President Wilson, \nwhile right on the issue, should have been less proud, more willing to \nmeet his adversaries, and given them extra consideration on the treaty. \nWhile I profoundly believe President Clinton was right to endorse this \ntreaty and to urge its adoption, I urge him to do the same today.\n  Let us make it unequivocally clear that the President of the United \nStates, upon being told by the Director of the CIA that he cannot \nprovide complete assurances that any unexplainable explosions of any \nsource within Russia or China--by our national technical means--that it \ncannot be identified, it will cause the United States, unless \nexplanations and inspections are made immediately available, to \nabrogate the treaty.\n\n  Second, the President make abundantly clear that any refusal to allow \ninspections, even if not absolutely required by the treaty, because it \nis in the national interest, would cause us to abrogate the treaty.\n  Third, the President commit the United States immediately to develop \na national technical means to distinguish between different forms of \nexplosions and small-level nuclear testing, and a program begin \nimmediately.\n  And fourth, that if, indeed, as I believe is provided in the treaty, \nthis President is informed by lab Directors that they can no longer \nassure the safety or the operational capability of our weapons, we will \nabrogate the treaty.\n  Let that be clear to the Senate and to the American people, let there \nbe no question. And if there is no question on those issues, then there \nis no argument against this treaty.\n  I can remember as a boy asking a history teacher why it was, if \nhistory occurred as a continuum, from generation to generation through \nthe centuries, history was written in chapters and in volumes, which \nboth began and ended? And I remember she told me: Because that is how \nit occurs.\n  We are between the volumes of history. If this Senate is to decide \nthat the bipartisan commitment to arms control as an element of \nnational security for the last 40 years has been an error, we are \nending not only a chapter but a volume of the military and diplomatic \nhistory of this country, we are entering into a very uncertain future, \nfor our security is dictated only by what weapons are designed, \ndeployed, and used--a lawless time that is not safer than the 20th \ncentury, but where the 21st century will be profoundly less safe.\n\n[[Page S12301]]\n\n  It will be a time in which, I believe, Members of this Senate will \nhave difficulty looking in the eyes of their children and their \nchildren's children explaining how there was a brief moment when we \ncould commit all the nations of the world not to test these nuclear \nweapons and therefore as a practical matter to be unable, by many \nnations, to deploy them or ever to use them--and we lost the moment.\n  You may feel confident in your vote today; it may make political \nsense. You may be convinced of your own rhetoric, but you will never \never--if one of these weapons is ever used in a hostile environment; if \none of these rogue regimes, from North Korea to Iran, ever tests one of \nthese weapons--you will never look your own children in the eye with \nconfidence in your judgment or feeling that you served them or your \ncountry. I have not been in this institution long, but long enough to \nknow this treaty does not have enough votes to be ratified.\n\n  The President of the United States, recognizing the enormous \npotential diplomatic damage of its defeat and the consequences \nmilitarily of sending a message to other nations that there will be no \nfurther proliferation efforts or control on testing, has asked, as the \nCommander in Chief, the elected representative of the American people, \nthat this vote not occur. What have we come to as a Senate, if the \nPresident of the United States makes such a request in the interest of \nour national security and our diplomatic position in the world and we \nturn a deaf ear? If you cannot do good by voting for this treaty, do \nnot do harm by defeating it. Allow the moment to pass. At least allow \nthe world to live with an ambiguous result rather than a definitive \nconclusion to our national commitment to arms control.\n  We vote on this treaty, but, indeed, we vote on whether to ratify or \nreject a national strategy of a generation and whether arms control \nwill continue to be part of the security of the United States and our \nstrategy of dealing with potentially hostile nations. It is not a \njudgment I would have had to mark the beginning of the 21st century. It \nshows a profound failure to learn the lessons of the 20th century, but \nit is what it is. At least we should be able to lose this moment and go \non to debate and make judgments another day. I beseech of other Members \nof the Senate, do not hold this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I don't see my Republican colleague on the \nfloor. If there is no Republican wishing to speak, with the permission \nof my friend from Arizona, I yield to Senator Byrd.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, may I inquire about the time remaining on \nboth sides. I think we are roughly equal at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 4 hours 11 minutes; the \nminority, 4 hours 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia. If \nhe needs more, I am happy to yield as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank Senator Biden. He is certainly one of the most \nknowledgeable of all Senators on this particular subject. I appreciate \nthe fact that he has sat in on the hearings that the Armed Services \nCommittee has held in the past 2 to 3 days.\n  Mr. President, the debate on which we embark today is of far-reaching \nconsequence. We are deliberating a major treaty, the Comprehensive \nNuclear Test Ban Treaty. Unfortunately, we embark on this debate \neffectively shackled, gagged, and, to a considerable extent, \nblindfolded.\n  I have had the privilege of hearing three days of extremely detailed \nand complex testimony on this Treaty--three days! And I am one of a \nselect few Senators, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \ntogether with Senator Biden, ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, who were exposed to that information. In a similar vein, the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee conducted one full scale hearing on \nthe Treaty this week. But the fact remains that many, if not most, of \nmy colleagues have had little opportunity to hear from the experts \ntestimony on the pros and cons of this Treaty.\n  To be sure, there are a number of Senators who are well versed in the \ndetails of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but they are few in \nnumber. Senator Levin is one of those. Senator Warner is one of those \nSenators. The rest of us are flying virtually blind. I wonder how many \nSenators have taken the time to read the Treaty? I wonder how many \nSenators have consulted with foreign leaders, those who will have to \njoin the United States in ratifying this Treaty if it is to go into \nforce, to get their opinions of the Treaty?\n  Mr. President, when I was majority leader, I visited other capitals \nand took Senators with me to talk with the leaders in foreign capitals \nabout a treaty.\n  The Washington Post reported this morning that envoys from nearly 100 \nnations have implored the United States not to reject the CTBT. I \nwonder how many Senators fully understand the concerns of those \nnations? I wonder how many Senators fully understand our concerns?\n  Those who have read the text of the Treaty may be familiar with the \nbroad brush strokes of the Treaty. But for even those Senators, the \ndetails--the implications of the Articles, the Annexes, and the \nProtocols to the Treaty--may be murky at best.\n  Mr. President, the hearings that the Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner and Senator Levin, \norganized this week were extremely informative. So informative that I \nam overwhelmed by the amount of detail that I have heard.\n  I have often said that the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, is a \nSenator who is exact. He scrupulously and agonizingly, it seems, peers \nthrough a microscope at every bit of minutia when it comes to details. \nThat is the kind of study we need to give a treaty of this nature.\n  The President may sign a bill into law today. If, per chance, both \nHouses suddenly realized that that bill had to be repealed, we can do \nit. We could pass a repealer in one day in both Houses. We could do it, \nif the emergency existed. But not a treaty; it isn't that way with a \ntreaty. We cannot approve the resolution of ratification today, send it \nto the President, the President cannot enter into the treaty formally \ntomorrow, and then on the second day or third day of next week, we \nadopt a new treaty or we take action to negate the treaty we have \nentered into. So a treaty is much different from a bill.\n  From Secretary William Cohen and General Shelton, Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, I heard that this treaty is in the national security \ninterests of the United States. I respect their judgments. But from \nformer Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, whom I also respect, and \nwhose judgment I also respect, I heard that the treaty is flawed in \nterms of its duration--a permanent ban on nuclear weapons testing--and \nin its premise that only testing that can meet a so-called zero yield \nthreshold is acceptable. I do respect Dr. Schlesinger's judgment. I \nheard confidence in the Stockpile Security Program expressed by Energy \nSecretary Bill Richardson, and I heard some caution expressed by the \ndirectors of the Energy Department's nuclear laboratories. Some caution \nthere. Some caution. In short, I have heard some complex and \nconflicting testimony in a short period of time.\n  I must ask, why on earth is the United States Senate allowing a \ntreaty of this magnitude and complexity to be rammed through the body \nwith a maximum of 14 hours of debate, and with a limit of two \nleadership amendments? Have we totally lost all sense of \nresponsibility? What would be wrong with having the vote next year \nafter we have seen the new assessment, which we were told is on its way \nand will be completed somewhere around the first of the year, as I \nremember. What would be wrong? Or even, as some would prefer, what \nwould be wrong with putting it off until the following year? Why do we \nhave to do it now? Why do we have to do it next week? I am not one of \nthose who have been saying we have to have a vote on the treaty. I \ndon't cast any aspersions on anybody by that statement. But lest there \nbe some here who think I am one of those who have been clamoring for a \nvote, I am not; and lest there be some who think that I have been \nprevailed upon by the administration to express opposition to our \nvoting next week. I have not been contacted by the administration.\n  I am concerned about my country. I have heard various Senators say, \nwell,\n\n[[Page S12302]]\n\nif I am wrong, this will happen, or if he is wrong, that will happen; \nor which would you want to bet on, or some such. I am not interested in \nwho is right or who is wrong, for the sake of this Senator or that \nSenator. I am interested from the standpoint of my country if we make \nthe wrong decision. It is my country. And then, being one who is \ndedicated to this institution, having served in it for 41 years, I am \nalso concerned that this institution is not doing its duty in \nconnection with the approval of the ratification of a treaty. I said \nsomething to the effect that we are talking about the separation of \npowers here. And we are, because the constitutional framers did not \nfeel it wise to leave in the hands of a chief executive alone the \nmaking and the carrying into effect of a treaty. And so the framers \nformulated this great system that we have of the separation of powers.\n\n  Hence, the approval of the ratification of treaties by the U.S. \nSenate is a facet of the separation of powers, in the great scheme of \nthings. Now, are we, as Members of the Senate--we who have taken an \noath to support and defend that Constitution of the United States--are \nwe, who are the trusted legatees of those framers who met in \nPhiladelphia in 1787, to put aside our portion, our responsibility in \nthat system of separation of powers and say, oh, well, the President is \nright, the administration is right, give it to them, and wash our hands \nof it, let's not spend anymore time on it? I don't think it is my \nproper responsibility to say I am ready to vote on it just because an \nadministration--whether it be my party or somebody else's party--says I \nshould vote on it.\n  We Senators have a responsibility under our separation of powers to \ndo our share of the work. The Senate is supposed to have that \nresponsibility by virtue of the Constitution. I say that we are \nshirking our duty if we fail to uphold our end of the separation of \npowers doctrine, if we don't take the time to know what we are doing \nhere. There have been questions raised.\n  Are we seriously going to cede, without a murmur, our duty to advise \nand consent to the ratification of treaties? Are we seriously going to \nallow this travesty of the separation of powers to occur? It would be \nnobody's fault but ours if we do. I am not saying reject the treaty nor \nam I saying we should approve it. I have to hold my hand up before my \nCreator and say I don't honestly know how I shall vote on this treaty. \nI will not be pressured by anybody. And politics has nothing to do with \nit, in my view; in this instance, certainly.\n  Mr. President, I bring before the Senate two issues that were raised \nby Dr. Schlesinger that I believe merit consideration. The first is the \nduration of the treaty. It imposes a permanent ban on the testing of \nnuclear weapons. Now, we are all for nonproliferation. That is not the \nargument here. We are all for nonproliferation, but there are other \nthings involved here.\n  First is the duration of the treaty. It imposes a permanent ban on \nthe testing of nuclear weapons. Frankly, I would be delighted to see a \npermanent ban on the testing of nuclear weapons--if we could be sure \nthat the United States could maintain the reliability of its nuclear \nweapons stockpile without testing. But what I have heard this week from \nsome people is that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is not far enough \nalong in development to be absolutely certain, or even almost certain, \nthat it will be an effective substitute for testing.\n  Our weapons are aging, and the nuclear scientists who developed and \ntested those weapons are aging also. For every year that the weapon \nages, the scientist who tested that weapon ages a year. We can replace \ncomponents of the weapons, but as Dr. Schlesinger and Dr. Paul \nRobinson, Director of Sandia National Laboratories, pointed out in \ntheir testimony, it is not so easy to replace the knowledge, the skill, \nand the judgment of the scientists who built those weapons. Can we \nreally replace seasoned physicists with computer scientists? That is a \nquestion that I have, and an answer that I do not yet have.\n  Dr. Schlesinger also questions the advisability of the zero-yield \nthreshold for nuclear weapons testing. Now, I am fairly certain that \nmost American families will not be discussing over the dinner table \nthis evening the relative merits of zero-yield versus low-yield \ntesting. I doubt that many of my colleagues in the Senate will be \ndiscussing such matters over this Columbus Day holiday. But it is a \nvital issue in the deliberation of this treaty. I don't know enough \nabout it, and I have read, I have listened, and I have researched, to a \nlimited degree, the issue. I still have questions. I have doubts. It \nmay be that my doubts are unfounded. It may be that my questions can be \nsatisfactorily answered. But not in the time constraints and under the \nprocedural constraints with which we are faced.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate has a solemn duty to offer its advice and \nconsent in the matter of treaties.\n  We are not only not offering our advice, but we may be offering the \nwrong consent if we vote next week. We may be going the wrong way. We \nmay be ill advised in the consent that we give.\n  Not just consent, as I say, but advice as well. Advice comes in the \nform of understandings, reservations, amendments, conditions, and the \nlike. But not on this treaty under these circumstances. On this treaty \nunder these circumstances, amendments, understandings, reservations, \nmotions, or any other binding expression of opinion are out of bounds. \nThey are off limits, save for one amendment each to be offered by the \ntwo leaders of the Senate. On a treaty binding the United States of \nAmerica to a permanent ban on the testing of the very weapons that form \nthe core of our national security; on a treaty of such incredible \nimportance, the Senate is proceeding to a vote under a self-imposed--a \nself-imposed--gag order.\n  Has this body lost all sense of proportion? Has the Senate become so \nabsolutely blind to its constitutional duties and so dedicated to its \npartisan political objectives that it is willing to abdicate to the \nexecutive branch the Senate's responsibility to give both its advice \nand consent on the ratification of treaties? Is the Senate truly \nwilling to limit its role in the consideration of treaties to that of \neither rubber-stamping whatever the executive branch chooses to send \nus, or, alternatively, jettisoning it out of hand? That is no way to \ndeliberate on a treaty, particularly one such as the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty, which holds such promise, and likewise, perhaps, such peril \nfor the future of America's national security.\n  I respect the passion with which many of my colleagues view this \ntreaty. They can state with absolute certitude that it is in the best \ninterests of this country to approve the ratification of this treaty. \nAnd I respect that view. If I thought like they do, I would also \nexpress with absolute certitude that I was confident in the treaty. But \nthey have spent more time--far more time--than I have spent on it. And \nI admire them for that and compliment them for it. Conversely, others \nwith equal certitude say that the treaty should be rejected.\n  I compliment Senator Levin, I compliment Senator Warner, and others \non the leadership they have demonstrated. I compliment my great friend \nfrom New York, the Senior Senator from New York, before whom I bow with \ngreat reverence. But think of the experience the Senator from New York \nhas had in the field of foreign affairs. I don't know what his position \non the treaty is. But I daresay that he, too, would say we need more \ntime.\n  What is the driving force that says we absolutely cannot wait for a \nfew more months, or even another year? I am not bound on having a vote \nnext year. But this treaty is permanent. This is for keeps.\n  I respect the strongly held views of others. I wish I could share \ntheir certainty either in the merits or dangers of this treaty. If we \nwait 6 months, I might still be uncertain. But I would have had my \nchance. I would have had my day in court. The Senate would have \nfulfilled its duty under the Constitution. To me that is important.\n  I have spent 41 years of my 82 years right here in this Senate, and I \nhave respected its rulings, its precedents, its rules, its history, and \nits customs. And I have to say to Senators that I often bow my head in \nsorrow at the way this Senate has changed since I came here.\n  I cannot imagine that Senator Russell, Senator Dirksen, Senator \nFulbright, Senator McClellan--I cannot imagine that those Senators \nwould\n\n[[Page S12303]]\n\nhave been happy, would have been satisfied. They would have been \nrestless. They would have been very uncomfortable with saying that we \nhave to go through with this unanimous consent request which was sent \naround on the telephone to all Senators' offices--on a Friday--I \nbelieve it was Friday. All Senators are busy. It is all right with an \nordinary bill, an ordinary matter, that comes before the Senate. But \nwhen it comes to a major treaty, everybody recognizes a major treaty.\n  That is not a simple treaty with one or two other nations--which can \nbe very important, however. But this is a major treaty, a far-reaching \ntreaty. It involves the security interests of our country. It involves \nour children, and our grandchildren.\n  Why shouldn't we take a little more time to be sure that Senators \nknow that this is what we are about to do? We are about to take from \nevery Senator his normal right to offer a reservation or an \nunderstanding or an amendment on a major treaty. But, as Shakespeare \nsays, ``What's done 'tis done.'' Yet can we not rectify this horrible \nmistake and give this Senate a few more months so that we can have some \nhearings, so that we can have more experts, so that we can take time to \nread the treaty and to understand it and to talk with foreign leaders? \nI cannot understand why we have thrown away our rights so cavalierly.\n\n  Mr. President, I come not to bury Caesar nor do I come here to call \nLazarus from the tomb. I do not come here today to make a case for or \nagainst this treaty. I am here only to plead that we have more time so \nwe can study it and be better prepared to render a proper and right \njudgment. That is why I am here on this floor today.\n  I joined with other Senators in a letter some time ago urging the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to hold hearings. That is \nthe extent of the efforts that I have put forth in either direction.\n  I want to state for the Record, I am only here to urge that this \nConstitution requires this Senate to advise and consent to treaties \nthat have been made by the President of the United States. That is all \nI am urging--and that we be given sufficient additional the time. We \nare moving toward what appears to be a sure rejection of the treaty \nnext week for all the wrong reasons.\n  It may be that this treaty is not in the best interests of the United \nStates. It may be that it is in the best interests of the United \nStates. Only one thing is sure: It is not in the best interests of the \nUnited States or the Senate to be driven by little more than political \ngamesmanship--and all sides, I suppose, to some extent, have been \ntarnished by that.\n  This is not necessarily leveling an arrow from my bow toward any \nparticular side--political gamesmanship, I say, to an all-or-nothing \nvote on the treaty next week with 3 days' worth of hearings, less than \n2 full days' worth of debate, and virtually no opportunity to improve \nor to modify the Resolution of Ratification.\n  I close by urging the Senate to put off what promises to be a fatal \nvote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and proceed, instead, with \neducating the Senate and the American people, so we can deliberate and \ndecide the fate of this treaty and, who knows, this country and perhaps \nthe world, with a better understanding of the consequences of our \naction.\n  I thank all Senators for their indulgence.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I ask my dear colleague and friend a \nquestion in the friendliest of veins?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. We serve together on the Armed Services Committee. The \nSenator from West Virginia came to every hearing and listened. And he \nasked the question that elicited a critical answer which indicated that \nthe intelligence community needed time within which to complete this \nanalysis regarding the ability of our country tomorrow or in the future \nto monitor another nation's testing if that testing constituted \ncheating under the treaty. The Senator was there yesterday throughout \nthe laboratory hearing, and he had the courage to stand on this floor \nand say that he listened to those Directors, and, indeed, those raised \nthe legitimate concerns.\n  Mr. BYRD. They did in my mind.\n  Mr. WARNER. They did in my mind also. The Senator from West Virginia \nknows in private conversations I have had with him and other colleagues \nthat this Senator on this side of the aisle is doing what I can, \nalthough I will vote against that treaty today, and tomorrow, and the \nnext day, as it is currently written. I recognize its importance.\n  I stayed here until 9:30 last night working with others to see what \nwe can do to adopt a framework. I just left the Press Gallery. They \nasked me, Senator, what are the components? I said the essential \ncomponent is for the President to share equally the responsibility of \nthe very serious decision that our two leaders, Democrat and \nRepublican, are faced with about vitiating this time agreement. The \nSenator from West Virginia recognizes that as a former majority leader \nhimself.\n  I have just been handed this document.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield? Is he speaking on his own time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely. Do not worry about small matters. Worry about \nwhat I am about to tell my dear friend.\n  We are all making the best of efforts. I am listening to Senator \nByrd, in a very clear and precise way, an evenhanded way, state his \ncase. Then I am handed the President's speech in Ottawa.\n  A Reuters report states:\n\n       It is clear now that the level of opposition to the treaty \n     and the time it would take to craft the necessary safeguard \n     to get the necessary votes are simply not there. So I hope \n     the Senate will reach an agreement to delay that vote.\n\n  That expresses our common purpose.\n  All I have called upon the President to do is to share the burden the \nleaders would bear should this decision go forward.\n  I turn the page. Again, quoting:\n\n       Establish an orderly process, a nonpolitical orderly \n     process to systematically deal with all the issues that are \n     out there and take whatever time is necessary to do it.\n\n  As I told the press a few minutes ago, the President, each day, is \ntaking a step in realization of what has to be done. His National \nSecurity Adviser is quoted this morning saying the President asked the \nvote be delayed. The day before, the Secretary of State said for \nanother day this treaty should be decided by the Senate.\n  I say to my good friend, Senator Byrd, the last quote of the \nPresident: ``The whole thing is about politics.''\n  Is everything you are saying today about politics?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator read the whole letter?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am reading a press report.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, the remainder of that comment \nwas:\n\n       . . . and to systematically deal with all the issues that \n     are out there and to take whatever time is necessary to do \n     it. With this treaty other nations will find it hard to \n     acquire and to modernize nuclear weapons and we will gain the \n     means to detect and deter. If we don't have the treaty for \n     the United States, we will continue to refrain from testing \n     and giving a green light to every other country in the world \n     to develop and modernize nuclear weapons. I think it is clear \n     what we ought to do but it is also clear we ought not rush to \n     this vote until there has been an appropriate process in the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Put it in context; is the Senator reading from the Ottawa \nspeech?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am reading from the President's statement on CTBT, \nOctober 8, 1999, in Ottawa as reported, a copy of which was made and \ngiven to me.\n  Mr. WARNER. I add to it this phrase in which he concluded: ``The \nwhole thing is about politics.''\n  I have been here since 9 o'clock this morning, and the Senator has \nbeen here the same period; we are working throughout the day. We will \nbe the last Senators to leave this floor tonight and return on Tuesday.\n  This is not about politics. This is about trying to help our \ncolleagues reach a correct decision on the security interests of this \ncountry, I say to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. He was at the same dinner as I was with the President of \nthe United States when two present colleagues said: ``Mr. President, \nI'm sad to say the political process has taken this over. This is about \npolitics.''\n\n[[Page S12304]]\n\n  The truth of the matter is, politics is implicated in this. No one is \nsuggesting the politics is good or bad on either side, that one side is \nbetter than the other. But two of our Republican colleagues at that \ndinner--the Senator heard them--said the same thing the President said.\n  We are acknowledging reality. We can all pretend here, with all the \nniceties, that politics has no part in this. Let's be real simple: The \nhonest-to-God truth is, this is similar to the guy who says the emperor \nhas no clothes on who usually gets shot after he acknowledges that.\n  Mr. BYRD. That was a child.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am no child, but I may get shot politically for saying \nthis.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague from Delaware, I will not comment \non the comments made at the dinner. I was there, but I think what was \nsaid there was confidential. I have always, as a policy when dealing \nwith Presidents, not commented.\n  I am not criticizing the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed remarks by President Clinton \nfrom October 8, 1999.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       So they want me to give them a letter to cover the \n     political decision they have made that does severe damage to \n     the interest of the United States and the interest of \n     nonproliferation in the world? I don't think so. That's not \n     what this is about. They have to take responsibility for \n     whether they want to reverse 50 years of American leadership \n     in nonproliferation that the Republicans have been just as \n     involved in as the Democrats, to their everlasting credit.\n       Now, they have to make that decision. I cannot bring this \n     treaty up again unless they want to. I have asked them to put \n     it off because we don't have the votes. I have talked to \n     enough Republicans to know that some of them have honest, \n     genuine reservations about this treaty, and they ought to \n     have the opportunity to have them resolved, instead of being \n     told that they owe it to their party to vote against the \n     treaty and that the leadership of their party will do \n     everything they can to keep us from writing safeguards into \n     the treaty which answer their reservations, which is what we \n     do on every other thing.\n       So I don't want to get into making this political. But they \n     shouldn't tie the Senate up or themselves up in knots \n     thinking that some letter from me will somehow obscure from \n     the American people next year the reality that they have run \n     the risk of putting America on the wrong side of the \n     proliferation issue for the first time in 50 years. And they \n     want to do it and then they don't want to get up and defend \n     it before the American people in an election year. That's \n     what this whole thing is about. That is the wrong thing to \n     do.\n       We don't have the votes. I'm not going to try to bring it \n     up without the votes. Let them take it down, but also agree \n     on a legitimate process to take this out of politics. I will \n     not criticize them as long as they are genuinely working \n     through the issues, the way we did in the Chemical Weapons \n     Treaty.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter dated \nOctober 6 to the majority and minority leaders signed by two former \nSecretaries of Energy, John Herrington and James Watkins, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 6, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: We are writing to urge the \n     Senate to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). We \n     were each formerly responsible for managing the United \n     States' nuclear weapons programs in our role as Secretary of \n     Energy. We believe that unless and until the United States \n     can ensure and prove the safety and reliability of its \n     nuclear stockpile without testing, it should refrain from \n     ratifying the current ``zero-yield'' CTBT, which is intended \n     to be of unlimited duration.\n       Over the course of our history with nuclear weapons, \n     testing has been essential for maintaining the performance of \n     the stockpile, as well as the key to designing and certifying \n     new weapons. As President Bush noted in a report to Congress \n     in January 1993, ``Of all U.S. nuclear weapons designs \n     fielded since 1958, approximately one-third have required \n     nuclear testing to resolve problems arising after \n     deployment.''\n       A modern nuclear weapon has about the same number of parts \n     as an automobile, but it is much more complex. Some materials \n     in our weapons, such as plutonium, are radioactive. Over \n     time, these materials radioactively decay, altering both \n     their own properties and contributing to changes age makes in \n     the properties of other materials in the weapon. Even today, \n     major gaps exist in our scientific understanding of nuclear \n     explosives and how these weapons change as they age. These \n     gaps in our knowledge increase the risk of undetected \n     problems that could make our weapons unsafe or unreliable.\n       In 1992, the United States adopted a self-imposed \n     moratorium on nuclear testing. The following year, the \n     Administration and Congress initiated the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program. According to the FY 2000 Stockpile \n     Stewardship Plan Executive Overview released by the \n     Department of Energy (DOE) in March 1999, ``The overall goal \n     of the Stockpile Stewardship program is to have in place by \n     2010 . . . the capabilities that are necessary to provide \n     continuing high confidence in the annual certification of the \n     stockpile without the necessity for nuclear testing.'' This \n     report also states that the success of the program is \n     ``dependent on a highly integrated and interdependent program \n     of experimentation, simulation, and modeling.''\n       We support the Stockpile Stewardship Program and the \n     important research and development work that is being \n     conducted at American weapons laboratories. But no one can \n     state with a high degree of certainty that this program of \n     experiments and computer simulations will be able to \n     provide the same level of confidence in the safety and \n     reliability of our nuclear weapons as we have historically \n     achieved through testing. Therefore, the United States \n     must retain the option of testing; not only to be able to \n     verify the safety and reliability of our nuclear \n     deterrent, but also to validate the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program itself. In 1987, the Congress required the Energy \n     Department to craft a program that would ``. . . prepare \n     the stockpile to be less susceptible to unreliability \n     during long periods of substantially limited testing.'' \n     DOE was also required to ``. . . describe ways in which \n     existing and/or new types of calculations, non-nuclear \n     testing, and permissible but infrequent low yield nuclear \n     testing might be used to move toward these objectives.'' \n     DOE responded to this requirement by designing a test-ban \n     readiness program which anticipated a 10 year, 10 nuclear \n     test per year program, which included comparing the \n     results from new calculational tools and non-nuclear \n     testing facilities to the results of nuclear tests. This \n     program was never pursued because, throughout the Reagan \n     and Bush Administrations, further limitations on nuclear \n     testing were not viewed as necessary or desirable.\n       The Stockpile Stewardship Program is already falling short \n     of its goal. For example, the National Ignition Facility, the \n     flagship of the stewardship program, faces a key technical \n     uncertainty: will it be able to reach thermonuclear ignition, \n     a major goal for which it was designed? Furthermore, this \n     important facility has recently fallen behind schedule and \n     over budget. And, there may be new security risks because \n     classified information under the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program will be concentrated in consumer systems, and much of \n     the new computer code required for the program will be \n     written by hundreds of people at participating colleges and \n     universities.\n       Besides replacing testing, the Stockpile Stewardship \n     Program is aimed at ensuring effective production capability. \n     Even with the end of the Cold War, many production tasks \n     remain essential for weapons maintenance. These include \n     disassembly for inspection or repair, and the fabrication of \n     components to replace those that have decayed or corroded. \n     Some remanufactured components may be significantly different \n     from the original parts due to the use of new manufacturing \n     processes and materials. We risk introducing new defects into \n     the stockpile if we are not permitted to conduct nuclear \n     tests, when analysis clearly so demands, in order to verify \n     that these remanufactured components do not affect the safety \n     or reliability of the original design.\n       Responsible stewardship of the nuclear weapons stockpile \n     has provided the foundation for U.S. deterrent strategy for \n     the past half-century and, despite dramatic transformations \n     in the geopolitical and international security environment, \n     the stockpile will continue to make a critical contribution \n     to U.S. security for the foreseeable future. Although we \n     ascribe to the existing moratorium, the jury is still out as \n     to whether nuclear testing should be eliminated by treaty. We \n     consider it premature to make such a move at this time.\n       As a result, we are of the unqualified opinion that the \n     United States should not ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty.\n           Sincerely,\n     John S. Herrington.\n     James D. Watkins.\n\n  Mr. KYL. In this letter, the two former Secretaries of Energy urge \nthe Senate to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  I also note, part of my submission for the Record earlier was letters \nfrom various former public officials who urged rejection of the treaty. \nBehind me is a chart detailing who some of these people are. I thought \nit important, since I didn't read the entire list to Senator Biden \nearlier, to acknowledge who some of these people are.\n  These are people who believe it would be a bad idea for this treaty \nto be ratified and who speak from experience based upon their positions \nin the U.S. Government. I mentioned earlier the\n\n[[Page S12305]]\n\nsix former Secretaries of Defense. Secretary Schlesinger testified, and \nhis testimony was just cited by Senator Byrd as important testimony in \nopposition to the treaty. People such as Dick Cheney and others are in \nthat list of six. Secretary Weinberger testified, as well.\n  In addition to that, four former National Security Advisers; in \naddition to that, four former Directors of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. In addition to that, four former Directors of the National \nLaboratories--this is important because once an individual is no longer \nin the position of the lab Director, accountable to the Congress, to \nthe Secretary of Energy, and to the President, that person is free to \nspeak his mind--have been very clear about the reasons the National \nLaboratory Stockpile Stewardship Program cannot be an adequate \nsubstitute for testing, in addition to the former Secretaries of Energy \nI mentioned, former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the \nformer Commanders of the U.S. Strategic Command.\n  Let me also make a point I think the majority leader tried to make a \nfew minutes ago but several people have reiterated a contrary view; \nthat is, we have not had enough time to learn about this treaty. The \nmessage from the President of the United States transmitting this \ntreaty was dated September 23, 1997, but the treaty was open for \nsignature and signed by the United States a year before that, September \n24, 1996. So the President waited over a year to send this treaty to \nthe Senate for its action. Not long after that, however, the President \nbegan urging us to take it up, in two State of the Union Messages and \nin a variety of comments thereafter.\n  I took the President at his word, and I began studying the treaty, \nand I began talking to experts. I daresay there are not very many \npeople in this body who know more about the treaty, as Senators, than I \ndo. I know people such as Senator Biden and Senator Levin have done the \nsame thing. They went to school and they became experts on this treaty. \nI recognize them as having an enormous quantity of information about \nit. I did, too, for a couple of years. All Senators had that \nopportunity. If they listened to the President, he was asking them to \nunderstand it and to bring it up.\n  There have been a variety of hearings, not just in the Foreign \nRelations Committee but in other committees as well. I have committee \nreports here. Let's see; this is from the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs. I have three different reports here, I believe: March 18, \n1998; October 27, 1997; February 12, 1997; the Armed Services Committee \nhearings that have been specifically held, and so on. Of course, our \nknowledge does not need to exclusively come from hearings; we do have \nthe ability to read and to talk to experts.\n  The point is, we have had ample opportunity to learn about this \ntreaty. The problem is, there are many in this body who for months \ndemanded a vote, but what they really want is to only have a vote when \nthey think they can win. They do not want a vote when they are going to \nlose. That is why you had this cacophony of voices calling for a vote \nand all of a sudden, when the majority leader accommodated them and \nthey realized they did not have the votes to win, they began saying: \nOh, we need more time. We need to put this off. We need to study it \nmore.\n  There was ample opportunity to study it. I spent a lot of time \nstudying this treaty. I suppose I could have been doing something else, \nbut I spent the time studying it. And every one of my colleagues could \nhave done the same.\n  Finally, there is this notion, the President says: This is the \nlongest-sought, hardest-fought prize in arms control history. Every \nPresident has sought this. That is simply not true. Let's go through \nthe record.\n  President Eisenhower, who imposed a testing moratorium for 3 years, \nsupported the idea of a test ban treaty. But his test ban treaty would \nhave been of limited duration, 4 to 5 years, and would have allowed for \nlow-yield testing. As Senator Byrd noted a moment ago, two of the most \nsalient points of former Secretary Schlesinger's testimony were to \nimpress upon us the fact that this is a treaty in perpetuity that the \nPresident is asking us to sign. President Clinton's test ban treaty is \nfor a zero yield, and everyone acknowledges you cannot verify a zero-\nyield treaty. That was not the treaty President Eisenhower wanted, so \nlet's not say this all started with President Eisenhower and this is a \ntreaty he wanted.\n\n  During the Kennedy administration, the Limited Test Ban Treaty which \nbanned nuclear testing in the atmosphere, space, or underwater, was \nnegotiated. But there was no serious effort to negotiate a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty as of the kind President Clinton \nsubmitted. Incidentally, the Johnson administration took the same \nposition as the Kennedy administration.\n  President Nixon's administration negotiated the Threshold Test Ban \nTreaty but also did not make any attempt to negotiate a Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty of the kind President Clinton has submitted.\n  There was no activity on the subject during the Ford administration.\n  During the Carter administration--and Secretary Schlesinger has \npresented some very interesting comments on this--the Peaceful Nuclear \nExplosion Treaty was signed and consideration was given to a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, though the United States at that time \nwas seeking a 10-year treaty where yields of up to 2 kilotons would \nhave been permissible.\n  Neither President Reagan nor President Bush pursued a Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. In fact, responding to the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell \nprohibition on testing in the 1993 Energy and Water Appropriations Act, \nhere is what President Bush said to the Congress:\n\n       The administration has concluded that it is not possible to \n     develop a test program within the constraints of Public Law \n     102-377 that would be fiscally, militarily and technically \n     responsible. The requirement to maintain and improve the \n     safety of our nuclear stockpile, and to evaluate and maintain \n     the reliability of U.S. forces, necessitates continued \n     nuclear testing for those purposes, albeit at a modest level, \n     for the foreseeable future. The administration strongly urges \n     the Congress to modify this legislation urgently in order to \n     permit the minimum number and kind of underground nuclear \n     tests that the United States requires, regardless of the \n     action of other states, to retain safe, reliable, although \n     dramatically reduced deterrent forces.\n\n  So much for the proposition that all of the Presidents from \nEisenhower through Bush support the notion of the Clinton forever zero \nyield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It is simply not true.\n  There is another important point that President Kennedy made. \nPresident Kennedy was asked to comment on his experience with the 1958-\n1961 test moratorium. The reason this is important is, of course, we \nare looking at an 8-year moratorium on testing already here in the \nUnited States. This treaty would impose upon us a moratorium in \nperpetuity, with only one possible way out, and that is, it would be at \nleast theoretically possible for the United States, if it believed, in \nits supreme national interest, it was required to do so--for the \nPresident to, in effect, step out of the treaty for the purpose of \nconducting one or more tests.\n\n  Here is what President Kennedy had to say about the difficulty of \ndoing that. He said:\n\n       Some may urge us to try a moratorium again, keeping our \n     preparations to test in a constant state of readiness. But in \n     actual practice, particularly in a society of free choice, we \n     cannot keep top-flight scientists concentrating on the \n     preparation of an experiment which may or may not take place \n     or on an uncertain date in the future, nor can large \n     technical laboratories be kept fully alert on a standby \n     basis, waiting for some other nation to break an agreement. \n     This is not merely difficult or inconvenient; we have \n     explored this alternative thoroughly and found it impossible \n     of execution.\n\n  That is what scientists tell me would be the result of a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We already know it would take at least 2 \nyears to regenerate the support for a nuclear test at the Nevada Test \nSite. There is already significant testimony on the record that it \nwould be exceedingly difficult to get the scientific expertise \nconcentrated for the development of such a test. There is also \nsignificant comment on the fact that, obviously, this would send a very \ndangerous signal to our potential adversaries because there is only one \nreason to conduct such a test. Under the terms of the safeguard \nPresident Clinton has offered up here, it would be in the event of \nconcern about the safety or reliability of our stockpile. So the whole \nworld would know, if\n\n[[Page S12306]]\n\nthe United States began preparations to conduct a test, we had a \nproblem. That would be a problem.\n  One of my friends at one of the National Laboratories has in fact \nsaid, regardless of our need to do so--although we can always gain \nsignificant scientific knowledge from a test--we ought to remain \ncapable of conducting a test and have at least one a year, just so we \navoid the problem of nations believing we have problems with our \nstockpile. That way, we would not only have the benefit of a test but \nwe would never signal to anyone in the outside world we were testing \nbecause we had a problem.\n  There is another reason to have a test. When the United States began \nthinking about this moratorium, there was a request of the laboratories \nto design a way to substitute for testing, and the Stockpile \nStewardship Program came from that request. But as part of that, the \nDirectors of the laboratories recommended that a series of 10 tests a \nyear for 10 years be conducted to validate the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram. Those tests have never been held.\n  One of the reasons there is great discomfort with the notion that the \nStockpile Stewardship Program could actually be a substitute for \ntesting is that it has never been validated. I note that some of our \nallies, countries Senator Biden referred to earlier such as France, \nthat conducted tests within the last 3 years, as well as some that \nperhaps would not be categorized as allies, such as China, that also \nconducted tests within the last 3 years, as well as other countries, \ncould well have concluded--and part of this would have to get into \nclassified information--could well have concluded that it was in their \nnational interests to conduct tests in order to validate scientific \nexperiments, in order to prepare for a long period of time in which \nthey could not test, in order to develop warheads of the kind the \nRussians have developed, which are very robust and which can be \nreproduced every several years without the necessity of testing, \nsomething which the United States never did.\n  Our moratorium was imposed, in effect, in the middle of our nuclear \ndevelopment program. Our weapons have all been designed to be replaced \nwith new designs on the assumption that there would always be testing.\n  We never did this testing to get us to the point where we could \nprepare for a moratorium, let alone an absolute ban on any testing in \nperpetuity. That is why the argument is absolutely false some make that \nwe need to freeze in our advantage before others acquire the weapon; \nexactly the opposite is the case.\n\n  Some countries have developed what they believe will hold them for a \nlong period of time in the future based on testing, while the United \nStates rather abruptly stopped its program with President Bush and \nothers suggesting we should go forward with testing for a variety of \nreasons, but we did not do so.\n  We are now caught in the position where we have aging stockpiles with \nseveral of our warheads exceeding their shelf life, with all the \nproblems attendant with that, and a moratorium in which we have not \ntested for 8 years and a prospect we would have a treaty to bind us, \nnever to test again, never having validated the substitute program.\n  This is a reason why I think those who heard testimony from lab \nDirectors, from people such as Johnny Foster and Robert Barker and \nother experts who have been involved in this area for years, have been \nrather shocked at what they have heard and why many of them have \nsuggested they think they need to hear more about this.\n  There is, indeed, a great body of scientific evidence that suggests \nit could be a very bad thing for the United States to adopt this zero-\nyield test in perpetuity, and no amount of more time is going to change \nthat result. That is why, again, there is no reason to extend the time \nof this treaty in order to refute these scientific facts. These \nscientists are not going to change their views. The science does not \nchange. Plutonium and uranium radioactively decay. That is a scientific \nprinciple, so there is some constant here and nothing, including the \npassage of time, is going to change that.\n  Mr. President, I ask Senator Warner if he wants to make a comment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator can go right ahead and take \nall the time he wants.\n  Mr. KYL. I certainly do not want to do that.\n  There is one thing Senator Biden said with which I must take a little \nbit of issue. He noted we have some 6,000 warheads in our inventory, \nthat this was a lot of warheads and certainly they would not all \natrophy; in any event, we would always have enough, even if they were \nnot all good.\n  I think it important to understand what our stockpile consists of \nright now, again, without getting into classified material. There are \nnine types of nuclear weapons in our arsenal. We used to have many more \nthan that. We used to have redundant systems. Now, however, we have \nnine types, each of which are different. They have a different mission, \nand they are delivered on different delivery vehicles or by means of \ndifferent platforms.\n  The total number of warheads can be divided, in effect, by nine. If \nany one or two or three of those classes of warheads have defects in \nthem, it is a matter that affects all of the warheads of that category. \nIt is not as if you have one car that is a lemon. Instead, it is as if \nyou have a car that has to be recalled because every one of that make \nand model has the same problem. That is the way we have found our \nweapon defects to have existed in the past.\n  Let's say one-third of the weapon types have some defect. Roughly, \nthat means about one-third of the weapons. What that means is that \nabout one-third of the ability of the United States to respond with \nrespect to certain targets would be inhibited, but more than that, \nthere may be many targets that are unique to that particular kind of \nwarhead against which we have no capability. It is not as if these \nwarheads are fungible and we can throw any of them at any target with \nany delivery system. Each one has a specific purpose, and it is \ndelivered on a specific platform. That is why we should not be so \ncavalier about concluding that since we have a lot of warheads we, in \neffect, can roll the dice.\n\n  I have a final point, since Senator Warner is about ready, on a \ncomment made by my friend, Senator Specter, who talked about the chain \nreaction if India and Pakistan should begin to detonate these devices \nand how can we ask them to sign on to this treaty if we are not willing \nto set the norm, set the standard of signing.\n  I remind my colleagues, for 8 years we have been setting the norm. We \nhave had a moratorium; we are not testing. Did that stop India? Did it \nstop Pakistan? Has it stopped any other number of countries that \nbelieve in their national interest they want to acquire these weapons? \nNo. Are many of these countries signatories to the NPT? Yes. They have \nalready forsworn these weapons. We would be asking them to also \nforswear the testing of weapons that we now know they already have.\n  I believe we ought to do what is in the best interest of the United \nStates for our own security and not get into this business of \nquestioning what other people in the world will think of us if we do \nnot go along with what they think is a great idea. Internationally, \nthere are a lot of great ideas in the United Nations among countries, \nsome of whom are not friendly and some are, but the United States has \ntried to be a leader in the world. I suggest we lead best if we go back \nto the drawing board and try to do this right, perhaps along the lines \nof some previous Presidents, rather than the unique way President \nClinton proposes to do it with the zero-yield testing in perpetuity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague. He has been \nsteadfast throughout this period of the week when we had hearings and \nattended some of the hearings himself. Throughout the day, he has been \nvery skillful and evenhanded in the way he has helped me and others, \nthe leadership, Senator Helms, who is going to join us momentarily in \nhandling this floor situation. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. Our distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has joined us. He has been in contact with me frequently \nthrough this day.\n\n[[Page S12307]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. While the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is \nassuming his seat, I wish to say to my colleagues, I know of no one \nelse on this side who wishes to speak today. I am anxious to hear what \nmy friend from North Carolina has to say. I will sit here and listen to \nall of it. And I sincerely am anxious to hear it. But I want my \ncolleagues to know for scheduling purposes, I indicated to Senator Kyl \nI am going to respond specifically to some of the points he raised \nbecause--again, I am not being solicitous--I think he is one of the \nbest lawyers in this place. He knows this area very well. I think each \nof his points warrants a very specific response. But I will attempt to \ndo that on Tuesday when we are back in. So I want to put people on \nnotice, I am prepared to debate the issue if people wish to, but as far \nas I am concerned, we do not intend on using any more time today, \nunless for some reason my colleagues conclude I should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Steve Shope \nbe granted floor privileges in the proceedings today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I want to share a few additional thoughts.\n  Earlier today I discussed my belief that if the United States is \ngoing to be a leader for peace, it needs to be a leader militarily in \nthe world. It has fallen uniquely to be our responsibility, our burden, \nour role to do that. I think if we fail to do that, history will record \nthat we abdicated a responsibility. That is critically important.\n  Presiding in the chair is the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have had a number of days of hearings--some top-secret, \ncode-word briefings and hearings. Some have been public.\n  I want to share a few things, as I interpret what occurred in those \nhearings. It is consistent with the headline as has been cited earlier \nin the New York Times: ``Experts Say Test Ban Could Impair Nuclear Arms \nSafety.'' That is the way it was interpreted by a New York Times \nreporter. That is the way I believe it is fair to be concluded.\n  The lab Directors were pressed aggressively by Senator Levin, one of \nthe finer questioners that I have ever observed in this body. He asked \nthem firmly and consistently: Were they on board? They maneuvered \naround a bit, but they eventually did say they were on board. But \nSenator Robert Byrd astutely noted they were ``uneasy'' with those \nanswers. In fact, they indicated they were on board only after a good \ndeal of insistence and debate about signing on to the CTBT \nconcept. They indicated that they would sign on and be on board, if the \nsix safeguards could be included. These are employees of the executive \nbranch of the United States Government. They work for the President. \nThey know the Secretary of Energy was testifying there at the same \ntime.\n\n  The chairman of the committee noted that their testimony was \ninconsistent with the testimony of the Secretary of Energy at the same \nhearing on the same day. The Secretary of Energy is a fine person, but \nhe is not a nuclear engineer. He has not been given the responsibility \nto monitor the safety and security of our weapons. He says they are OK. \nThe President says they are OK. But the experts didn't quite say that. \nIn fact, they said it could impair nuclear arms safety. I think that is \nimportant. We do not have one voice about this matter.\n  They talked about the Stockpile Stewardship Program, and they were \nnot nearly so confident in that program as some would suggest. In fact, \nit almost seemed, I suggest, that they were saying that the President, \nin 1993, just unilaterally said: We are not going to test, so they are \nnot doing that. This apparently gave them some belief that they could \nhave some other kind of testing, so that is better than nothing. I may \nbe misinterpreting those comments, but I don't think so. I think they \nbasically said stockpile stewardship was not a guaranteed thing, but \nthat they would do their best with it, as patriotic Americans. They \nsaid they could not be sure the Stockpile Stewardship Program would \nwork, and they admitted there would be no way to validate the Stockpile \nStewardship Program other than through live-fire tests--tests of \nexplosions, nuclear explosions.\n  I ask, is this, indeed, in the best interest of the United States to \ntie our invaluable deterrent responsibility to an undeveloped, \nuntested, and unvalidated simulation regime?\n  The preamble to the treaty states that cessation of testing is an \neffective measure of nuclear disarmament. Dr. Robinson, Director of the \nSandia Lab, testified that nonnuclear components in today's weapons \nwill ultimately become obsolete and irreproducible--they cannot be \nreproduced. That is, without testing, our nuclear capability will \nvanish. If it does, it is a distinct possibility that other states will \nfind the world's situation having changed significantly, and they may \ndecide to determine to expand their own capability. It will, in fact, \nbe, and these words irritate a number of people, but it has a ring of \ntruth to it. It will be a form of unilateral disarmament, we, being the \nworld leader, signing a piece of paper that ultimately leads us to a \npoint where we cannot continue to be the world leader.\n  We know a test ban can't prevent nations from acquiring nuclear \nweapons. Tests by India and Pakistan showed that. The Sandia Lab \nDirector further testified that, ``[t]hose who claim that by ending \nnuclear testing, we will close off the threat of terrorist development \nand use of nuclear explosives mislead themselves.'' And Congress should \nnot accept such arguments as a basis for endorsing a test ban treaty.\n  I hope, Mr. President, we can develop a way to continue to reduce the \npresence of nuclear weapons. This Congress, this Senate has supported \nmassive reductions in the number of weapons we possess. We have \ncontinued to explore other treaties and agreements.\n  I like limited, bilateral agreements with nations such as Russia or \nChina or England or France, where we know what we are doing and it has \nan end time. We have an agreement. We have a precise understanding of \nthe benefits and risks involved. These broad treaties, to which we are \ncommitting with the whole world of nations, many of whom are not going \nto comply with them, make me nervous. It is not necessarily good for a \ngreat nation to do that. A great nation has to be cautious. A great \nnation can't blithely go out and start signing up to a bunch of \ntreaties and thinking that it will all work out sometime in the future. \nIt is a serious matter.\n\n  I am glad the chairman and others, Senator Kyl, Senator Helms, have \ntaken such a lead in this. I am glad to see Chairman Helms here. \nChairman Helms has said consistently, this treaty is not good for \nAmerica. He has refused to endorse it. He opposes it. Now we have had \nhearings and debate, and a growing number in this Senate are agreeing \nwith him. I don't believe there are votes sufficient to pass it, \nbecause I do not believe that it is good for the country. I think the \nopinion of Senator Helms on that is being validated daily by the \nexperts, as well as Members of this body.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his leadership. I appreciate \nSenator Biden's ability to articulate and to advocate. It makes us all \nthink carefully about what we are doing. I think it has been a good \ndebate. I think we have learned a lot. In the end, I think this Senate \nwill conclude this is not the time to ratify this treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am going to take about 5 minutes to \nrespond to my friend from Alabama. He may have to catch a plane or \nsomething. I hope he will understand that, if he is not on the floor.\n  First of all, I find it fascinating. I think he may want to amend the \nrecord--I am being a bit facetious, a little tongue in cheek--amend the \nrecord by suggesting that he has greater faith in headline writers and \nreporters than he does in the transcript I am about to read.\n  I don't know whether he has ever been bitten by a headline. We all \nknow headline writers read--and no one\n\n[[Page S12308]]\n\nknows this better than my friend from North Carolina--the part of the \ncopy that is given to them, and they get to write the headline they \nwant. Sometimes it bears little resemblance to what happened. I hope we \ndon't put any faith in a headline. I am not suggesting we shouldn't put \nfaith in what is written by reporters sometimes. What was said in this \narticle is accurate, but it is not complete. As my friend from Alabama \nsaid, we do not have one voice speaking on this, but we do have one \nrecord, one record from the hearing. I have a copy of the record from \nthe hearing conducted in the Armed Services Committee yesterday, page \n59. I will read the whole thing. It will take a minute.\n\n       Senator Levin. Therefore, what you are telling us is that \n     if this safeguard [the Strategic Stockpile Program] and other \n     safeguards are part of this process that you can rely upon, \n     that in your words, Dr. Robinson, you are on board in terms \n     of this treaty; is that correct?\n       Dr. Robinson. I am on board that science-based stockpile \n     stewardship has a much higher chance of success and I will \n     accept it as a substitute.\n\n  Going on to page 60.\n\n       Dr. Robinson. As a substitute for requiring yield tests for \n     certification.\n\n  The tests he is referring to are nuclear tests. Then further on down, \nDr. Tarter says:\n\n       I can only testify to the ability of stockpile stewardship \n     to do the job. It is your job, about the treaty.\n       Senator Levin. Are you able to say that, providing you can \n     rely on safeguard F--\n\n  My description: Safeguard F is the safeguard that allows the \nPresident to get out of the treaty if the lab Director certifies that \nhe is not able to certify the safety and reliability.\n\n       Senator Levin. Are you able to say that, providing you can \n     rely on safeguard F and at some point decide that you cannot \n     certify it, that you are willing under that condition to rely \n     on this stewardship program as a substitute for actual \n     testing?\n       Dr. Tarter. Yes.\n\n  Further down, same page:\n\n       Dr. Brown. Senator Levin, if the government [the \n     laboratories] provides us with the sustained resources, the \n     answer is yes, and if safeguard F is there, yes.\n  Now I am not suggesting all else that is quoted is not accurate. But \nit is useful to have a punchline at the end of the quotes. It may be \nviewed as tortuous; it may be viewed in any way you want. I don't think \nmy friend from Alabama means that because these renowned scientists \nhappen to work for the Federal Government--they also, by the way, are \nin the employ, if I am not mistaken, of outside laboratories and \nindustries as well, or at least on loan from them--I hope nobody is \nsuggesting--and I am sure he is not--that they would alter their \ntestimony because the President of the United States or the Secretary \nof Energy takes a position that is consistent with theirs, and that is \nwhy they are taking it.\n  I know my friend from Virginia will want to respond to this today, or \nTuesday, or whenever he wants to do it. We will have plenty of time. I \ndid not want there to be a hiatus between the comments of my friend \nfrom Alabama and my responding. I will conclude, I say to my friend \nfrom North Carolina. I think we should be--and believe me, I need this \nadmonition for myself as well--a little careful about some of the words \nwe use, such as ``unilateral disarmament.'' I don't think anybody is \narguing we are unilaterally disarming.\n  At any rate, I see my friend from Virginia has come down from on high \nand I assume wants to respond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. Inhofe assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am anxious to receive the remarks of our \ndistinguished chairman. But I was right there when Senator Levin asked \nthe questions. I will put in the Record my edification of their \nreplies.\n  We have to understand, this Stockpile Stewardship Program, SSP, is \nbasically a computer and other adjuncts, scientific devices that we are \ngoing to put in place--that is the key, ``put in place''--at the \nminimum, 5 or 6 years from now, but more likely 10 years from now. In \nthe opinion of the Director of Sandia Laboratories, it could be 20 \nyears. That is all in the Record in response to my question.\n  These Directors carefully said: Yes, we are meeting the current \nmilestones in putting together this computer and other high-tech test \nprograms, but we are a long way away. It could be as much as 20 years. \nSo we could go to a period of, at a minimum, 8 to 10 years without any \ntesting of the type that is a substitute for actual testing. Today, the \nstockpile is safe. Tomorrow, it is credible and safe. But as the years \ngo on--and Senator Byrd used the words, as the years go on--the natural \ndegrading under the law of physics of metallic parts, of chemical \nparts, and other parts takes place.\n  Therefore, this hope for SSP, in sum, is almost a dream, but these \nmen conscientiously are working on it day and night. Hopefully, in a \nperiod of anywhere from 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, maybe 20 years, it will be on \nline for that type of database which actual testing will give.\n  In the meantime, we are going through with part of the SSP program, \nbut not all of it--bits and pieces of it--largely relying on the test \ndata of a bank of information we have in this country developed over \nthe period of 50 years in which we did actual tests.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will pursue this more on Tuesday. I \nrespectfully suggest that argument was based on a fallacy, and that is, \nthe Stockpile Stewardship Program will not stay at zero until it is \ncompleted. We began this years ago. It is already working. We already \nuse testing methods that do not require nuclear explosions.\n  The Senator will remember the chart James Schlesinger had with the \narrows going up and down, and I quote from Dr. Sig Hecker, the Director \nof Los Alamos in 1997, whom everybody quotes these days, wrote a letter \nto the Senator from Arizona and said:\n\n       . . . there have been several instances since the cessation \n     of nuclear testing in September 1992, where we have found \n     problems . . . for which in the past we would have turned to \n     a nuclear test in the kiloton range to resolve. In the \n     absence of testing, we have used the methodology of \n     [Stockpile Stewardship] to evaluate the problem and suggest \n     fixes if required.\n       This has included more extensive calculations, non-nuclear \n     laboratory experiments, comparison to previous nuclear test \n     data, and the extensive experience of our designers and \n     engineers. Moreover, our assessment has been checked against \n     the rigors of peer review by the Lawrence Livermore National \n     Laboratory. We have examined several problems of this nature \n     during this year's certification cycle.\n       At this time, we have sufficient confidence in our \n     solutions to certify the stockpile without a resumption of \n     nuclear testing. If our confidence in the fixes were not \n     sufficiently high, we would not certify the stockpile.\n\n  He is no longer the lab Director, but I assume my colleagues all \nbelieve him to be an honorable man. When they say testing is not needed \nat this time--that is, the Directors--I ask my colleagues whether or \nnot they agree with Jim Schlesinger, who said it is not needed at this \ntime and he doubts it will be needed in the future.\n  Let me explain. We are using data from 1,000 past nuclear tests--as \nmy friend says, from nonnuclear subcritical experiments and from high-\ntech simulations to understand what is happening and what may happen in \nthe weapons stockpile.\n  Four facilities that will not be ready until 2005 are--they are \ncalled the National Ignition Facilities--a contained firing facility, \ndual-access radiographic hydrodynamics test facility, and the Atlas \nPlus power facilities. These facilities--and this is important--are all \nlogical successors to older, less capable facilities. Our scientists \nare pushing the envelope but are not engaging in flights of fancy. That \nis why our labs and the Department of Energy are confident the National \nIgnition Facility will work, even though it has cost overruns. These \nfacilities will serve several purposes and increase knowledge of basic \nphysics of nuclear weapons. That new knowledge will lead to more \naccurate and precise computer simulations. The facilities can also be \nused to test the particular weapons problems. That is why I say our \nweapons will still be tested, even without full-scale nuclear weapons \ntesting.\n  Another key tool we are developing is this advanced supercomputing \naccelerated strategic computing initiative, another generation of \nsupercomputers that will be able to synthesize test data from the past, \nand all of the testing done on weapons components, to provide three-\ndimensional simulations of all aspects of nuclear weapons and how they \nreact. Already, our scientists and engineers are working with industry \nand several universities to develop\n\n[[Page S12309]]\n\ncomputers that are capable of running more than 3 trillion operations \nper second. That is a new record level of computing power, and it gives \nus new safety.\n  Our goal, admittedly, over the next 5 years is for those \nsupercomputers to be able to do 100 trillion operations per second. \nThat is not something we need in our stockpile today. In fact, it \nrepresents a 100,000-fold increase in today's computational ability, \nand everybody says today's computational ability is sufficient to \nguarantee the stockpile. But when our weapons reach their so-called \nshelf life, then it is going to be needed, and we anticipate needing \nthat sophisticated modeling. No one thinks that sophisticated modeling \nis needed now.\n  Finally, I have real questions about my colleagues' concern that the \nstockpile stewardship cannot work. Our scientists are the best in the \nworld. They know what they are doing. They define scientific challenges \nthat must meet the military performance and reliability standards. \nAfter defining these challenges, they believe they can meet them. I \nbelieve they know what they are talking about. But I see one problem. \nThe one problem the Stockpile Stewardship Program faces now and in the \nfuture is that some may not fund it. That is what our colleagues at the \nlaboratories are talking about.\n  Let me quote and conclude from a news release released today by the \nDepartment of Energy. I will submit it for the Record. It is ``For \nImmediate Release,'' dated October 8, 1999, and is a joint statement by \nDirectors of three nuclear weapons laboratories--I note parenthetically \nthat my guess is they probably read the New York Times article--C. Paul \nRobinson, Sandia; John C. Browne, Los Alamos; C. Bruce Tarter, Lawrence \nLivermore National Lab.\n  I will read only from the fourth paragraph:\n\n       While there can never be a guarantee that the stockpile \n     will remain safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear \n     testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully \n     supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will \n     enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent \n     without nuclear testing.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the DOE News, October 8, 1999]\n\n     Joint Statement by Three Nuclear Weapons Laboratory Directors\n\n (C. Paul Robinson, Sandia National Laboratories; John C. Browne, Los \n  Alamos National Laboratory; and C. Bruce Tarter, Lawrence Livermore \n                          National Laboratory)\n\n       ``We, the three nuclear weapons laboratory directors, have \n     been consistent in our view that the stockpile remains safe \n     and reliable today.\n       ``For the last three year, we have advised the Secretaries \n     of Energy and Defense through the formal annual certification \n     process that the stockpile remains safe and reliable and that \n     there is no need to return to nuclear testing at this time.\n       ``We have just forwarded our fourth set of certification \n     letters to the Energy and Defense Secretaries confirming our \n     judgment that once again the stockpile is safe and reliable \n     without nuclear testing.\n       ``While there can never be a guarantee that the stockpile \n     will remain safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear \n     testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully \n     supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will \n     enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent \n     without nuclear testing.\n       ``If that turns out not to be the case, Safeguard F--which \n     is a condition for entry into the Test Ban Treaty by the \n     U.S.--provides for the President, in consultation with the \n     Congress, to withdraw from the Treaty under the standard \n     ``supreme national interest'' clause in order to conduct \n     whatever testing might be required.''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me conclude by pointing out that I find \nit kind of interesting. The very people who stand up here and say, as I \nhappen to believe, that they have confidence that our scientists in the \nfuture are going to be able to shoot out of the sky like a bullet \nmeeting a bullet incoming nuclear weapons over the ocean traveling at \nmultithousand miles per hour and do it with certainty and accuracy--\nthey have faith in the ability of that to occur, but they don't have \nfaith in the ability of our scientists at the three laboratories, who \nsay they are well on their way to doing that, to be able to say what \nthey need.\n  I find it kind of interesting. I must admit it is a double-edged \nsword. I find my Democratic colleagues who do not support any national \ndefense initiative--because they say this star wars notion can't work, \nit is too far out--I do not know how they come and rely so easily upon \nthe likelihood that a $45 billion investment is going to guarantee \nthese supercomputers will function to the degree they are needed to \nwhen these weapons reach their shelf life. But let's be fair. You can't \nhave it both ways. I would respectfully submit that the ability to \nguarantee MIRV nuclear warheads fired in the hundreds or the thousands \nat the United States could be blown out of the sky with impunity by a \nmissile defense initiative on our part is a mildly greater scientific \nfeat than what the stockpile requires.\n  As someone said: ``The faith of our father''--``the faith of our \nfather''--has always been that if we put our mind to it, if we invest \nthe money, we have the intelligence, the ingenuity, and the know-how to \nget it done. I would respectfully suggest our three present laboratory \nDirectors and all the doubts they express are primarily related to \nwhether or not safeguard F and funding of $45 billion for the stockpile \nwould be forthcoming.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the best deterrent from keeping those \nthousands of missiles coming in is precisely what we have had these 50-\nplus years--a credible safe deterrent in our stockpile. And the person \nwhose finger is on the button firing those missiles knows that.\n  I am reading from yesterday's proceedings of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on page 50 where the chairman, myself, asked the \nfollowing questions. This is one of the laboratory Directors \ntestifying:\n  ``We moved this year toward the development of the SSP, and last year \ntoward putting in place the supercomputers on a path that we think we \nneed to have. We are on a path that by 2004 we will have a \nsupercomputer in place that begins''--begins--``to get us into the \nrealm of what we need to do this job''--namely certifying the \nstockpiling.\n  ``The issue that I think you are trying to address''--this is the \nhardest point I think as a scientist--``is that we cannot predict that \nby such and such a date we will know everything we need to know.''\n  ``It is an evolving process. Each year we learn something else.''\n  Bit by bit, year by year.\n  I then asked: ``My time is running out.''\n  And it is running out. We want to control time.\n  ``Give us your best estimate, doctor,'' Senator Warner said.\n  ``Dr. Brown: I think we are going to be in the best position sometime \nbetween 2005 and 2010.''\n  ``Chairman Warner: Dr. Tarter.''\n  ``Dr. Tarter: I agree with Dr. Brown.''\n  ``Dr. Robinson: My guess is somewhere in the 10 years hence to 20 \nyears hence period.''\n  There it is, short answers directed to the question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Would my friend yield for a question? From what page of \nthe record was he reading?\n  Mr. WARNER. Page 50 of the official transcript of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I don't doubt it. I read from page 59 to get the \nsignificance?\n  Do you get the significance?\n  That was stated on 50 and 51 and 52. This is 59. After all is said \nand done, the question was asked: Do you believe with the safeguards \nyou can rely upon the stockpile, the strategic stockpile, approach as \nopposed to nuclear testing?\n  They said yes.\n  It follows. Page 59 and 60, I am reading from. Maybe there is \nsomething after page 61 in the testimony that would undermine what I \nhave just said. I respectfully suggest I am unaware of it if it is. I \nstand ready to hear it if it has been.\n  It is one of those deals, folks. You have to go to the end. It \n``ain't over until the fat lady sings.'' It ain't over until you read \nthe whole transcript. The last thing stated was: We have confidence.\n  Then, after the testimony, after the testimony and after the New York\n\n[[Page S12310]]\n\nTimes article, the Department of Energy and in the name of the three \nscientists quoted--and I will read it again.\n  ``While there can be no guarantee''--the point he is making on page \n50--``that the stockpile remains safe and reliable indefinitely without \nnuclear testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully \nsupported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will enable us to \ncontinue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear \ntesting.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is 117 pages. I sat there for 5 hours \n10 minutes. How well I know the various parts of this system. I was \nweary after 3 days of testimony. But it is all here for all Senators to \nread. I invite them to spend as much time as they can on the record.\n  It comes down to honest men, well-intentioned individuals--men and \nwomen on both sides of the issue--cannot agree, and should we move \nforward with a treaty that will vitally affect our security interests, \nunless the preponderance of the evidence is overwhelming, and beyond a \nreasonable doubt? Give us the certainty to make that step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a few brief comments to make in \nresponse to the very eloquent remarks from the Senator from West \nVirginia, in which I thought he covered it quite well. He had a concern \nfor whether the intelligence estimate was going to be forthcoming.\n  I would suggest, and get into the Record at this time, that back in \nDecember of 1995 we were waiting for the NEI report to come out. And it \ncame out.\n  That report said we would not have to defend ourselves in the United \nStates of America for a limited attack in terms of--the discussion, of \ncourse, was the national missile defense--until approximately 15 years, \nnot any less than 15 years.\n  We found out later that was actually imminent at that time.\n  I can recall so well writing the Chairman and Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Shelton, on the 24th of August of this last year--1998--and \nasking him to be specific in terms of taking the national intelligence \nestimate and all the information that he could garner and tell me at \napproximately what date North Korea would be able to fire a missile, a \nmultiple-stage rocket. He came back and said it would be more than 5 \nyears.\n  Seven days later--on the 31st of August, 1998--they fired one.\n  I think we all know right now that they have another type of missile \nthat can reach Washington, DC, from anyplace in the world in about 35 \nminutes, and we don't have any defense against that.\n  I don't think, if we are going to rely on the NEI information, we are \nrelying on something that is going to be in the best interests of \ndefending our country.\n  The Senator from West Virginia also talked about the ratification \nprocess and about needing more time.\n  We hear over and over again from every single person who stood up to \ndefend the CTBT we need more time, we have to have more time. Yet if \none reads what those same individuals are saying, the President of the \nUnited States said on the 16th of May, 1998:\n\n       Now it's all the more important that the Senate act \n     quickly, this year, so we can increase the pressure on, and \n     isolation of, other nations that may be considering their own \n     nuclear test explosions.\n\n  Also the President said:\n\n       . . . I ask the Senate to approve it [CTBT] this year.\n\n  That was 1998--last year; here it is 1999.\n  Vice President Al Gore said the same thing:\n\n       The U.S. Congress should act now to ratify the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n  That is July of 1998.\n  Secretary Albright said:\n\n       We need this Treaty now.\n\n  That was on September 23, a few days ago, this year.\n  She said, further:\n\n       For American leadership, for our future, the time has come \n     to ratify CTBT--this year, this session, now.\n\n  I could go on and on; the leaders have said we have to do it now.\n  As far as taking up this treaty, knowing what is in it, the treaty \nhas been there for 2 years. We have all had an opportunity. Have I read \nthe entire treaty? No, but I read the areas that concern me on \nverification, on zero-yield thresholds, things where I know we cannot \nverify what would be done. Verification is not there.\n  I remind Members, every Senator, including the illustrious Senator \nfrom Delaware, had the opportunity to object to the unanimous consent \nrequest propounded and agreed to a few days ago calling for the vote to \ntake place after the 14 hours of debate which should be some time on \nTuesday or Wednesday.\n  The only Senator from that side who is not openly supporting this yet \nis the Senator from West Virginia who said, by his own mistake, he was \nnot able to get down in time to object to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  We had an opportunity for every Senator to have slowed this train \ndown so they wouldn't have to vote on it and they elected not to do it.\n  I think it is very important we all keep that in mind. This is \nsignificant. It is something we have reviewed over a long period of \ntime. It is something we understand. We have heard the professional \ntestimony. We have attended many meetings. I along with the Presiding \nOfficer, have sat through hours of committee meetings and subcommittee \nmeetings that I have held in my committee on this very subject. I think \nwe understand it and I agree with the statements of all of those, \nincluding the President, Vice President, and the Secretary of State, \nwho I quoted. We need to do it now.\n  I will be here to object to any unanimous consent that would in some \nway vitiate the vote that we believe should be imminent next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President I will take 1 minute.\n  The President doesn't need any more time; he read it and negotiated \nit. I don't need any more time; I spent over 100 hours on that. It is \nmy job on the committee of responsibility. The Senator presiding \ndoesn't need more time; he spent hundreds of hours. The Senator from \nOklahoma doesn't need more time because he spent hundreds of hours on \nit. I defy anyone to find five other Members of the Senate who have \nspent as much time.\n  Usually what happens is we take on the responsibility to inform our \ncolleagues based on our committees because we have more expertise when \nassigned the job. When it is tax policy, I don't know what the Tax Code \nsays on major changes, but I rely upon the committee headed on the \nDemocratic side by my friend from New York to tell me what is in it \nfrom spending hundreds of hours going through the detail.\n  This is a different way to do business. I don't ever remember Members \nhaving voted on a treaty without there being a significant report from \nthe relevant committees on the floor.\n  The President doesn't need any more time. I don't need any more time. \nSenator Byrd says he needs more time, and I don't know anybody more \nconscientious than Senator Byrd. But the reason for more time is there \nhaven't been any hearings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I assure my friend from Delaware, the \nranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I enjoy hearing him \nand hearing him and hearing him.\n  I guess it is sort of similar to what the President said in one of \nhis strong moments not long ago: I guess it depends on what the \ndefinition of ``is'' is.\n  This afternoon in Canada, President Clinton held a press conference \nin which he explicitly rejected the offer I made along with a number of \nother Republican Senators that the Senate would put off a vote on the \nCTBT if the President requested in writing (a) that the treaty be \nwithdrawn and (b) that it not be considered for the duration of his \npresidency.\n  Considering that the President acknowledged he does not have the \nvotes to ratify the treaty, this seemed to many of us a generous offer \nwhich the President rejected with a strange rhetorical outburst.\n  When asked about our offer today, he said:\n\n\n[[Page S12311]]\n\n\n       They want me to give them a letter to cover the political \n     decision they have made that does severe damage to the \n     interest of the United States and the interest of \n     nonproliferation in the world? I don't think so.\n\n  The Mr. President further suggested, strangely and absurdly, that the \nreason we made the offer in the first place was because, as he put it, \nRepublicans are afraid to go though with a vote. He said:\n\n       . . . they want to [kill the treaty] and don't want to get \n     up and defend it before the American people in an election \n     year. . . . [They think] that some letter from me will \n     somehow obscure [that fact] . . . \n\n  Mr. President, among those who are urging that the Senate kill this \ndangerous treaty are: six former Secretaries of Defense, four former \nNational Security Advisors, four former Directors of Central \nIntelligence, and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Yet, Mr. Clinton suggests that Republicans are afraid to vote? The \nfact is, the President and his advisors have done everything possible \nto discourage a solution.\n  Let's make it clear so the President can get his confusing rhetoric \nstraightened out: Since he has rejected our offer, I will object, along \nwith many of my Republican colleagues, to any effort to put off next \nweek's vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  This is a dangerous treaty, contrary to the national security \ninterests of the American people. The Senate should go on record as \nplanned: The Senate should vote this treaty down.\n  Mr. President, may I make an inquiry how much time has expired on \neach side since this morning when the Senate convened?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the distinguished chairman \nof a remarkable coincidence: The opponents have used 204 minutes, the \nproponents, 208 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous-consent agreement \nby the Senate, consideration has begun regarding an arms control treaty \nthat has been the longest-sought, hardest-fought item on the unilateral \nnuclear disarmament agenda. Strangely, the Clinton administration has \nused every fanciful reasoning in its attempt to portray the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as an agreement long pursued by \nevery administration since President Eisenhower, a claim that is \nbewilderingly untrue. Even the administration's own negotiator \nacknowledged that the administration's claims are ``hyperbole.''\n  You see, Mr. President, the truth of the matter is that not one \nadministration (prior to the current one) ever proposed a zero-yield, \nunverifiable, permanent duration test ban. Indeed, as Ambassador \nLedogar admitted, even the Clinton administration itself did not want \nsuch a treaty initially.\n  Someone has commented that the CTBT now before the Senate is the \nclearest case of ``parchment worship'' ever seen. It was neither \ncarefully negotiated nor well-thought through. It does not even define \nexactly what it bans.\n  Instead, the CTBT is the product of a mad scramble to: (1) Create an \narms control ``legacy'' for the Clinton-Gore administration; or (2) \nprovide an excuse for this administration's lack of any \nnonproliferation policy; or (3) obscure the fact that this \nadministration presided over the collapse of the single-most \nsignificant reduction in nuclear weapons with Russia ever negotiated--\nthe START II Treaty--which would have eliminated all MIRVed ICBMs and \nthe SS-18 missile. (The likelihood is that all three played a major \nrole in the administration's decision to try to ram through this Senate \nthis unwise and dangerous treaty.)\n  Unfortunately, in the race to fashion a last-minute rickety \n``legacy'', the Clinton administration abandoned longstanding United \nStates policy on nuclear testing and signed up to a ``zero yield,'' \nunverifiable, permanent duration test ban. As several of us have noted, \nfor a number of reasons relating to verification and U.S. nuclear \nweapons requirements, this is something to which no other \nadministration ever agreed. For instance, President Eisenhower--who has \nbeen repeatedly and mistakenly blamed with authorship of the CTBT--\ninsisted that nuclear tests with a seismic magnitude of less than 4.75 \nbe permitted.\n  The reason that the United States historically has refused to sign on \nto a zero yield test ban is that five problems are created by such a \nprohibition. First, confidence in the safety and the reliability of the \nweapons stockpile will erode. Second, warheads cannot be \n``remanufactured'' to capitalize upon modern technologies. Third, no \nfurther designs or capabilities can be added to the nuclear stockpile. \nFourth, critical infrastructure and hardware cannot be thoroughly \n``hardened'' against nuclear weapons effects. Fifth, the U.S. can have \nno confidence that other countries are abiding by the CTBT because a \nzero yield ban cannot be verified.\n  By preventing the United States from testing, the CTBT will erode our \nability to discover and fix problems with the nuclear stockpile and to \nmake safety improvements. Confidence that the weapons will perform as \nneeded will erode. Already, leaders of our own nuclear weapons design \nlaboratories have stated that problems with the stockpile have arisen \nthat formerly would have prompted nuclear tests.\n  Further, several of the weapons are not as safe as they could be. As \nthis chart demonstrates, only one warhead of the nine in the stockpile \nis equipped with all of the modern surety features available. One \nweapon--the W62--does not have any safety features at all, and three of \nthe weapons--the W76, W78, and W88--are only equipped with ``enhanced \ndetonator safety'' measures.\n  Mr. President, several important safety improvements cannot be made \nto these weapons unless subsequent nuclear testing is allowed to ensure \nthat modified devices will function properly with these changes. I will \nunderscore that for Senators. The CTBT will prevent the United States \nfrom making critical safety improvements to its warheads. I, for one, \nagree with the Governor of North Dakota who wrote to me opposing the \nCTBT stating:\n\n       As a governor of a state that hosts a sizable percentage of \n     our nation's nuclear weapons, I have an obligation to the \n     people of North Dakota to ensure that these warheads are as \n     safe and reliable as they can be made. It troubles me that \n     several U.S. warheads do not contain the most modern safety \n     features available, such as fire-resistant pits and \n     insensitive high explosives. Yet these warheads cannot \n     capitalize upon such improvements without nuclear testing.\n\n  I hope Senators will understand that the CTBT will gradually \nundermine the safety of the U.S. deterrent by precluding the \nincorporation of modern safety features.\n  Moreover, nuclear testing is essential if the United States is to \ndiscover and fix problems with the stockpile. These problems usually \nare associated with aging. The materials and components of weapons can \ndegrade in unpredictable ways and can cause the weapon to fail. Many \nweapons believed to be reliable and thoroughly tested nevertheless \ndeveloped problems which were only discovered, and could only be fixed, \nthrough nuclear testing. In fact, one-third of all the weapon designs \nplaced in the stockpile since 1958 have required and received post-\ndeployment nuclear tests to resolve problems.\n  In three quarters of these cases, the problems were identified and \nassessed only as a result of nuclear testing, and only could be fixed \nthrough testing.\n  The United States has chosen to remanufacture aging weapons in the \nenduring stockpile rather than designing and building new ones. This \npresents problems because many of the materials and processes used in \nproducing the original weapon are no longer available. New materials \nand processes need to be substituted, but they can only be validated to \nassure that the remanufactured weapon works as intended through nuclear \ntesting.\n  Exact replication, especially of older systems, is impossible without \ntesting. In part, this is because documentation has never been \nsufficiently exact to ensure replication. Nuclear testing is the most \nimportant step in product certification; it provides the data for valid \ncertification. As a case in point, the United States attempted to \nremanufacture both the W52 and W68 warheads on the basis of \nsimulations. However, when actually tested, both weapons had a measured \nyield well short of what test-experienced weapons designers predicted. \nThis is a lesson that the administration, in supporting the CTBT, seems \nwilling to forget.\n  The CTBT also will prevent the United States from developing new \nweapons to counter new technological advances by adversaries. Nuclear \ntesting is essential to such modernization.\n\n[[Page S12312]]\n\nWithout it, the nuclear triad will become obsolete.\n  I fail to see the logic behind the argument that the United States \nhas no need to modernize its deterrent if Russia, China, and others are \nsimilarly constrained. Such a claim just won't fly; in fact, given the \ndemonstrable inability to verify a total test ban, I am persuaded that \nsuch assertions are founded upon the mistaken presumption that nuclear \nweapons modernization is driven by the evolution of other nuclear \ndeterrents. Historically, this simply has not been the case.\n  Indeed, nuclear weapons modernization is generally driven either by \nnew mission requirements, or by non-nuclear technological evolution in \ndefensive systems. For instance, during the cold war, advances in air \ndefense and anti-submarine warfare created needs for new weapons. \nNuclear testing was needed to create the B83 bomb, a gravity bomb--a \n``laydown weapon'' because it enabled the B-1B to drop its payload, at \nlow altitude and high speed, and thereby escape the resulting \nexplosion.\n  This weapon was needed in response to advances in air defense \ncapability. For the same reason, the U.S. developed the nuclear air-\nlaunched cruise missile, which allows U.S. bombers to fulfill their \nmission outside of air defense ranges.\n  Nuclear testing was needed for the Trident II missile's warheads, W76 \nand W88. Testing was essential to optimize the system, giving the \nmissile, and thus the submarine as well, increased striking range. This \nwas needed in response to advances in anti-submarine warfare. Without \nthe ability to test and modernize, the airmen and sailors aboard our \nbombers and submarines will be put at increased risk as they try to \nperform their duties with obsolete technology. Senators should think \ncarefully about the implications of the CTBT, and the risk it poses--\nnot just to the nuclear weapons themselves--but to our servicemen.\n  Our clear, future need facing the United States is the requirement to \ndevelop new or modified warheads to respond to developments in missile \ndefense--particularly in the area of directed energy. It would be \nimpossible to adapt to such developments under a complete test ban.\n  Further, without the ability to design new weapons, such as a warhead \noptimized to kill biological plagues or to destroy deeply-buried \ntargets, the U.S. will be unable to respond to serious emerging \nthreats to our security. I could not agree more with one of the former \nDirectors of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Dr. Roger Batzel, \nwho warned that; ``A nuclear arsenal which is unable to keep pace with \na changing security environment is unlikely, in the long run, to prove \nmuch of a deterrent.''\n\n  Fourth, the CTBT would make the United States increasingly vulnerable \nto foreign nuclear programs. Critical systems such as satellites cannot \nbe hardened and thoroughly protected against electro-magnetic pulse \nattack without nuclear testing. Computers cannot simulate a nuclear \nenvironment. Neither can controlled radiation sources. It takes a \nnuclear explosion to create the heat and complex interplay of radiation \nneeded to evaluate the resistance of systems to these nuclear effects.\n  Historically, the United States often has been surprised by how \nsystems which seemingly performed as needed during non-nuclear \nsimulations then failed to function properly in an actual nuclear \nenvironment. Indeed, surprises have been found in the vulnerability to \nnuclear effects of all U.S. strategic nuclear systems except the \nMinuteman II. The CTBT will allow counties to exploit a growing U.S. \nvulnerability brought about by an increasing reliance on high-tech \nweaponry and a decision not to test in order to harden systems.\n  Finally, a ``zero yield'' test ban is not verifiable. While the exact \nthresholds are classified, it is commonly understood that the United \nStates cannot detect nuclear explosions below a few kilotons of yield. \nCountries are able to resort to a number of techniques, ranging from \n``unattended detonations'' to seismic decoupling, that will enable them \nto conduct significant nuclear explosions with little chance of being \ndetected.\n  The proposed verification regime under the CTBT offers scant \nreassurance in this matter. The seismic detection thresholds of the \nInternational Monitoring System are sufficiently high that a large \namount of clandestine testing could occur without fear of seismic \ndetection. Moreover, the on-site inspection regime is riddled with \nloopholes and deficiencies.\n  The bottom line is that if the Senate were to make the mistake of \napproving this treaty, the United States would scrupulously adhere to \nthe CTBT, thereby losing confidence in its nuclear deterrent. Other \nnations, however, most likely would violate the treaty and escape \ndetection, building new weapons to capitalize upon the U.S. \ndeficiencies and vulnerabilities created by the CTBT. For these \nreasons, I oppose the CTBT and I am gratified that more and more \nSenators are making clear their opposition to ratification of an \nunwise, even dangerous, proposal to deprive the American people of the \nprotection they need and deserve.\n  Mr. President, for just a moment I suggest the absence of a quorum \nand then I will resume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and the time be divided equally from \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise simply to express the thanks of \nthis Senator to the eminent chairman of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations for the careful discourse he has presented to us, for the \nfacts, they are complex. No one understands complexity better than he \nor is more willing to live with it. If we do not come to the same \nconclusions, it is not for lack of respect and, indeed, a reverence.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I do thank my friend from New York--our \nfriend from New York--whom we will sorely miss before very long.\n  I thank the Senator and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest from the Senator from North Carolina, without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senate will soon exercise its \nconstitutional duty of ``advice and consent'' for international \ntreaties. This is a solemn task. And the treaty before us, the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty or ``CTBT,'' relates to an issue of \nutmost importance, the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  As I have evaluated this treaty, I have kept one question first and \nforemost in my mind: Will ratification of this treaty by the United \nStates serve to protect the national security of the United States? And \nafter careful consideration, my position is that the CTBT weakens the \nnational security of the United States, and I will therefore oppose \nratification.\n  Although I support the lofty goals of the Test Ban Treaty--preventing \nthe spread of nuclear weapons--I think only the good guys will play by \nthe rules. Test ban advocates argue that setting a good example will \nlead others to play by the rules. The United States has not tested a \nbomb since 1992, but India and Pakistan went ahead with testing bombs, \ndespite U.S. sanctions and condemnation.\n  Test Ban advocates also argue that the threat of sanctions will keep \ncountries in line. As my colleagues will recall, North Korea violated \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--in fact, are still violating the \nNPT--and the Clinton Administration has rewarded the\n\n[[Page S12313]]\n\nDPRK with aid, and more recently, with the removal of sanctions. I \nsuspect the same pattern if rogue nations like North Korea even ratify \nthe CTBT.\n  But even more fundamentally, I believe this zero-yield treaty of \nunlimited duration fundamentally threatens the United States' nuclear \ndeterrent by preventing nuclear testing essential to maintaining the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. Our nuclear weapons \nare the most sophisticated designs in the world, yet over time, the \nnuclear materials and high explosives triggers deteriorate, and we lack \nthe experience in predicting the effects of these changes.\n  According to expert testimony, one-third of all weapons designs \nintroduced into the nuclear weapons stockpile since 1985 have required \nand received post-deployment nuclear tests to resolve problems. In \nthree-fourths of these cases, the problems were discovered only because \nof on-going nuclear tests. In each case, the weapons were thought to be \nreliable and thoroughly tested.\n  How confident can we be in the reliability of our nuclear stockpile \nif we are unable to test these weapons to determine the degradation \neffects of aging? If we cannot be confident in our own weapons' \neffectiveness, what do you suppose other nations will conclude? The use \nof nuclear weapons as a deterrent is only effective when other parties \nbelieve in their capability as well.\n  Although the Stockpile Stewardship Program should be pursued, we must \nremember that the Program is in its infancy. Deciding in 1999 to rely \non an untested program that will be operational in 2010 is reckless. In \nthe future, I hope that nuclear tests can be replaced by computer \nsimulations and laboratory-based experiments. But I am not willing to \nbet my grandchildren's security on it.\n  In light of hearings this past year before the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on Chinese espionage allegations, I also am not \ncomfortable placing the results of our nuclear testing in the memory \nbanks of the National Labs' computers which are vulnerable to espionage \nor sabotage.\n  Finally, I would like to address the problem of verifying other \nnations' compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Recent \nreports from the intelligence community indicate that we are unable to \nmonitor low- level nuclear tests precisely enough to distinguish \nbetween a conventional explosion, a low-level nuclear test, or even \nnatural seismic activity. The United States cannot now, and may not in \nthe foreseeable future, be able to confidently detect and identify \nmilitarily significant nuclear tests of one kiloton or less. That is \nroughly 500 times the size of the blast which destroyed the Murrah \nBuilding in Oklahoma City.\n  Twice last month Russia carried out what might have been nuclear \nexplosions at its Novaya Zemlya testing site in the Arctic. It was \nreported that U.S. surveillance satellites have repeatedly observed the \nkind of activity that usually precedes and follows a low-level nuclear \ntest. Yet, data from the CIA's seismic sensors and other monitoring \nequipment were reportedly insufficient to reach a firm conclusion as to \nthe true nature of the explosions. If it is not possible to confirm \ntests such as these, how are we going to verify that countries such as \nRussia and China are complying with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty?\n  Mr. President, this Treaty is not in the national interest and I urge \nmy colleagues to reject its ratification.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senate has begun consideration of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I regret that the Senate is taking up \nthe treaty in an abrupt and truncated manner that is so highly \npoliticized. Admittedly, the CTBT is not a new subject for the Senate. \nThose of us who over the years have sat on the Foreign Relations, Armed \nServices, or Intelligence Committees are familiar with it. The Senate \nhas held hearings and briefings on the treaty in the past.\n  But for a treaty of this complexity and importance a more sustained \nand focused effort is important. Senators must have a sufficient \nopportunity to examine the treaty in detail, ask questions of our \nmilitary and the administration, consider the possible implications, \nand debate at length in committee and on the floor. Under the current \nagreement, a process that normally would take many months has been \nreduced to a few days. Many Senators know little about this treaty. \nEven for those of us on national security committees, this has been an \nissue floating on the periphery of our concerns.\n  Presidential leadership has been almost entirely absent on the issue. \nDespite having several years to make a case for ratification, the \nadministration has declined to initiate the type of advocacy campaign \nthat should accompany any treaty of this magnitude.\n  Nevertheless, the Senate has adopted an agreement on procedure. So \nlong as that agreement remains in force, Senators must move forward as \nbest they can to express their views and reach informed conclusions \nabout the treaty.\n  In anticipation of the general debate, I will state my reasons for \nopposing ratification of the CTBT.\n  The goal of the CTBT is to ban all nuclear explosions worldwide: I do \nnot believe it can succeed. I have little confidence that the \nverification and enforcement provisions will dissuade other nations \nfrom nuclear testing. Furthermore, I am concerned about our country's \nability to maintain the integrity and safety of our own nuclear arsenal \nunder the conditions of the treaty.\n  I am a strong advocate of effective and verifiable arms control \nagreements. As a former Vice-Chairman of the Senate Arms Control \nObserver Group and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have \nhad the privilege of managing Senate consideration of many arms control \ntreaties and agreements.\n  I fought for Senate consent to ratification of the INF Treaty, which \nbanned intermediate range nuclear weapons in Europe; the Conventional \nForces in Europe Treaty, which created limits on the number of tanks, \nhelicopters, and armored personnel carriers in Europe; the START I \nTreaty, which limited the United States and the Soviet Union to 6,500 \nnuclear weapons; the START II Treaty, which limited the U.S. and the \nformer Soviet Union to 3,500 nuclear weapons; and the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, which outlawed poison gas.\n  These treaties, while not ensuring U.S. security, have made us safer. \nThey have greatly reduced the amount of weaponry threatening the United \nStates, provided extensive verification measures, and served as a \npowerful statement of the intent of the United States to curtail the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction.\n  I understand the impulse of the proponents of the CTBT to express \nU.S. leadership in another area of arms control. Inevitably, arms \ncontrol treaties are accompanied by idealistic principles that envision \na future in which international norms prevail over the threat of \nconflict between nations. However, while affirming our desire for \ninternational peace and stability, the U.S. Senate is charged with the \nconstitutional responsibility of making hard judgments about the likely \noutcomes of treaties. This requires that we examine the treaties in \nclose detail and calculate the consequences of ratification for the \npresent and the future. Viewed in this context, I cannot support the \ntreaty's ratification.\n  I do not believe that the CTBT is of the same caliber as the arms \ncontrol treaties that have come before the Senate in recent decades. \nIts usefulness to the goal of non-proliferation is highly questionable. \nIts likely ineffectuality will risk undermining support and confidence \nin the concept of multi-lateral arms control. Even as a symbolic \nstatement of our desire for a safer world, it is problematic because it \nwould exacerbate risks and uncertainties related to the safety of our \nnuclear stockpile.\n  The United States must maintain a reliable nuclear deterrent for the \nforeseeable future. Although the cold war is over, significant threats \nto our country still exist. At present our nuclear capability provides \na deterrent that is crucial to the safety of the American people and is \nrelied upon as a safety umbrella by most countries around the world. \nOne of the most critical issues under the CTBT would be that of \nensuring the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile \nwithout testing. The safe maintenance and storage of these weapons is a \ncrucial concern. We cannot allow them to fall\n\n[[Page S12314]]\n\ninto disrepair or permit their safety to be called into question.\n  The Administration has proposed an ambitious program that would \nverify the safety and reliability of our weapons through computer \nmodeling and simulations. Unfortunately, the jury is still out on the \nStockpile Stewardship Program. The last nine years have seen \nimprovements, but the bottom line is that the Senate is being asked to \ntrust the security of our country to a program that is unproven and \nunlikely to be fully operational until perhaps 2010. I believe a \nNational Journal article, by James Kitfield, summed it up best by \nquoting a nuclear scientist who likens the challenge of maintaining the \nviability of our stockpile without testing to ``walking an obstacle \ncourse in the dark when your last glimpse of light was a flash of \nlightning back in 1992.''\n  The most likely problems facing our stockpile are a result of aging. \nThis is a threat because nuclear materials and components degrade in \nunpredictable ways, in some cases causing weapons to fail. This is \ncompounded by the fact that the U.S. currently has the oldest inventory \nin the history of our nuclear weapons programs.\n  Over the last forty years, a large percentage of the weapon designs \nin our stockpile have required post-deployment tests to resolve \nproblems. Without these tests, not only would the problems have \nremained undetected, but they also would have gone unrepaired.\n  The Congressional Research Service reported last year that: ``A \nproblem with one warhead type can affect hundreds of thousands of \nindividually deployed warheads; with only 9 types of warheads expected \nto be in the stockpile in 2000, compared to 30 in 1985, a single \nproblem could affect a large fraction of the U.S. nuclear force.'' If \nwe are to put our faith in a program other than testing to ensure the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent and thus our security, \nwe must have complete faith in its efficacy. The Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram falls well short of that standard.\n  The United States has chosen to re-manufacture our aging stockpile \nrather than creating and building new weapon designs. This could be a \npotential problem because many of the components and procedures used in \noriginal weapon designs no longer exist. New production procedures need \nto be developed and substituted for the originals, but we must ensure \nthat the remanufactured weapons will work as designed.\n  I am concerned further by the fact that some of the weapons in our \narsenal are not as safe as we could make them. Of the nine weapon \ndesigns currently in our arsenal, only one employs all of the most \nmodern safety and security measures. Our nuclear weapons laboratories \nare unable to provide the American people with these protections \nbecause of the inability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program to \ncompletely mimic testing.\n  At present, I am not convinced the Stockpile Stewardship Program will \npermit our experts to maintain a credible deterrent in the absence of \ntesting. Without a complete, effective, and proven Stockpile \nStewardship program, the CTBT could erode our ability to discover and \nfix problems with the nuclear stockpile and to make safety \nimprovements.\n  In fact, the most important debate on this issue may be an honest \ndiscussion of whether we should commence limited testing and continue \nsuch a program with consistency and certainty.\n  President Reagan's words ``trust but verify'' remain an important \nmeasuring stick of whether a treaty serves the national security \ninterests of the United States. The U.S. must be confident of its \nability to detect cheating among member states. While the exact \nthresholds are classified, it is commonly understood that the United \nStates cannot detect nuclear explosions below a few kilotons of yield. \nThe Treaty's verification regime, which includes an international \nmonitoring system and on-site inspections, was designed to fill the \ngaps in our national technical means. Unfortunately, the CTBT's \nverification regime will not be up to that task even if it is ever \nfully deployed.\n  Advances in mining technologies have enabled nations to smother \nnuclear tests, allowing them to conduct tests with little chance of \nbeing detected. Similarly, countries can utilize existing geologic \nformations to decouple their nuclear tests, thereby dramatically \nreducing the seismic signal produced and rendering the test \nundetectable. A recent Washington Post article points out that part of \nthe problem of detecting suspected Russian tests at Novaya Zemlya is \nthat the incidents take place in a large granite cave that has proven \neffective in muffling tests.\n  The verification regime is further bedeviled by the lack of a common \ndefinition of a nuclear test. Russia believes hydro-nuclear activities \nand sub-critical experiments are permitted under the treaty. The U.S. \nbelieves sub-critical experiments are permitted but hydro-nuclear tests \nare not. Other states believe both are illegal. A common understanding \nor definition of what is and what is not permitted under the treaty has \nnot been established.\n  Proponents point out that if the U.S. needs additional evidence to \ndetect violations, on-site inspections can be requested. Unfortunately, \nthe CTBT will utilize a red-light inspection process. Requests for on-\nsite inspections must be approved by at least 30 affirmative votes of \nmembers of the Treaty's 51-member Executive Council. In other words, if \nthe United States accused another country of carrying out a nuclear \ntest, we could only get an inspection if 29 other nations concurred \nwith our request. In addition, each country can declare a 50 square \nkilometer area of its territory as off limits to any inspections that \nare approved.\n  The CTBT stands in stark contrast to the Chemical Weapons Convention \nin the area of verifiability. Whereas the CTBT requires an affirmative \nvote of the Executive Council for an inspection to be approved, the CWC \nrequires an affirmative vote to stop an inspection from proceeding. \nFurthermore, the CWC did not exclude large tracts of land from the \ninspection regime, as does the CTBT.\n  The CTBT's verification regime seems to be the embodiment of \neverything the United States has been fighting against in the UNSCOM \ninspection process in Iraq. We have rejected Iraq's position of \nchoosing and approving the national origin of inspectors. In addition, \nthe 50 square kilomater inspection-free zones could become analogous to \nthe controversy over the inspections of Iraqi presidential palaces. The \nUNSCOM experience is one that is best not repeated under a CTBT.\n  Let me turn to some enforcement concerns. Even if the United States \nwere successful in utilizing the laborious verification regime and non-\ncompliance was detected, the Treaty is almost powerless to respond. \nThis treaty simply has no teeth. Arms control advocates need to reflect \non the possible damage to the concept of arms control if we embrace a \ntreaty that comes to be perceived as ineffectual. Arms control based \nonly on a symbolic purpose can breed cynicism in the process and \nundercut for more substantive and proven arms control measures.\n  The CTBT's answer to illegal testing is the possible implementation \nof sanctions. It is clear that this will not prove particularly \ncompelling in the decision-making processes of foreign states intent on \nbuilding nuclear weapons. For those countries seeking nuclear weapons, \nthe perceived benefits in international stature and deterrence \ngenerally far outweigh the concern about sanctions that could be \nbrought to bear by the international community.\n  Further, recent experience has demonstrated that enforcing effective \nmultilateral sanctions against a country is extraordinarily difficult. \nCurrently, the United States is struggling to maintain multilateral \nsanctions on Iraq, a country that openly seeks weapons of mass \ndestruction and blatantly invaded and looted a neighboring nation, \namong other transgressions. If it is difficult to maintain the \ninternational will behind sanctions on an outlaw nation, how would we \nenforce sanctions against more responsible nations of greater \ncommercial importance like India and Pakistan?\n  In particularly grave cases, the CTBT Executive Council can bring the \nissue to the attention of the United Nations. Unfortunately, this too \nwould most likely prove ineffective, given that permanent members of \nthe Security Council could veto any efforts to punish\n\n[[Page S12315]]\n\nCTBT violators. Chances of a better result in the General Assembly are \nremote at best.\n  I believe the enforcement mechanisms of the CTBT provide little \nreason for countries to forego nuclear testing. Some of my friends \nrespond to this charge by pointing out that even if the enforcement \nprovisions of the treaty are ineffective, the treaty will impose new \ninternational norms for behavior. In this case, we have observed that \n``norms'' have not been persuasive for North Korea, Iraq, Iran, India, \nand Pakistan, the very countries whose actions we seek to influence \nthrough a CTBT.\n  If a country breaks the international norm embodied in the CTBT, that \ncountry has already broken the norm associated with the Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT). Countries other than the recognized nuclear \npowers who attempt to test a weapon must first manufacture or obtain a \nweapon, which would constitute a violation of the NPT. I fail to see \nhow an additional norm will deter a motivated nation from developing \nnuclear weapons after violating the longstanding norm of the NPT.\n  On Tuesday the Senate is scheduled to vote on the ratification of the \nCTBT. If this vote takes place, I believe the treaty should be \ndefeated. The Administration has failed to make a case on why this \ntreaty is in our national security interests.\n  The Senate is being asked to rely on an unfinished and unproven \nStockpile Stewardship Program. This program might meet our needs in the \nfuture, but as yet, it is not close to doing so. The treaty is flawed \nwith an ineffective verification regime and a practically nonexistent \nenforcement process.\n  For these reasons, I will vote against ratification of the CTBT.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Senate formally begins \nconsideration of whether to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty, CTBT. Each party to this treaty pledges not to carry out any \nnuclear weapons tests and to refrain from helping others to carry out \nsuch tests. CTBT has been signed by over 150 nations, 51 of which have \nalready ratified the treaty. The question before the Senate now is \nwhether we should join this group in an international effort to limit \nthe spread of nuclear weapons.\n  Although I will have more extensive remarks on the substance of the \ntreaty shortly before the Senate votes, I would like to say a few words \nnow about why I believe the Senate should ratify this important treaty. \nAs in the case of previous arms control agreements, each Senator must \nask himself or herself the following series of questions: Is U.S. \nnational security enhanced by Senate ratification of the CTBT? Is this \nnation better off with the CTBT? Will Senate ratification of CTBT lead \nto a safer world for our children?\n  In my view Mr. President, the answer to each of these questions is an \nunequivocal, unqualified yes for one simple, straightforward reason: a \nworld with fewer countries possessing nuclear weapons is a safer, more \nsecure world for our national security interests, our nation and our \nchildren. Senate ratification of CTBT will help us achieve just such a \nworld.\n  Opponents of the treaty raise two issues: can we verify that other \nnations are complying with the treaty and would U.S. compliance with \nthe treaty permit this nation to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear \ndeterrent? On the first issue, opponents assert that it is impossible \nto verify a prohibition of all nuclear tests. Mr. President, let me \nstate now that they are absolutely correct on that point. The \nintelligence community has confirmed that neither the United States nor \nthe International Monitoring System that would be established under \nCTBT would ensure the detection of every single nuclear explosion, \nregardless of size and location.\n  However, this feature is not unique to CTBT. No arms control treaty \nis 100 percent verifiable. In just the last two decades, the Senate has \nratified numerous treaties knowing full well at the time that it would \nbe possible for a country to successfully skirt one provision or \nanother for some period of time or another. The standard for the Senate \non previous treaties and the standard we should apply to this treaty is \n``effective'' verification. In the case of CTBT, effective verification \nmeans we will be able to detect, with a high degree of confidence, any \ntests that could undermine our nuclear deterrent. After examining the \ninformation and analysis provided by our intelligence community, our \nsenior military leaders have testified that we can effectively verify \nthis treaty.\n  Furthermore, with or without CTBT, we need to monitor the nuclear \ntesting activities of other countries and will face the exact same \nproblems people are assigning exclusively to CTBT --with one major \ndifference. In a world of CTBT, the United States would have additional \ntools at its disposal to determine what has happened. The treaty would \npermit us to have access to data collected at any of the 321 monitoring \nsites established as part of the CTBT's International Monitoring \nSystem. Under the treaty, we will also be able to conduct on-site \ninspections of facilities when we suspect questionable activity has \noccurred. These are resources available to us only if we ratify CTBT.\n  As for the safety and reliability of our existing nuclear weapons, I \nam convinced that the science-based stockpile stewardship program will \npermit us to preserve our nuclear deterrent without testing. I \nacknowledge up front that this program, for which we are spending $4.5 \nbillion annually, is still evolving and it will be a few more years \nbefore we will know for certain its effectiveness. However, critics \nmust also acknowledge three other facts. First, our nuclear weapons are \nsafe and reliable today and are likely to remain so for another \ndecade--with or without a stockpile program. Second, although not fully \nup and running, the stockpile stewardship program has already \ndemonstrated its viability. Although we stopped testing nuclear weapons \nseven years ago, for the past four years the Department of Energy has \nbeen able to certify that our nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. \nIn order to make this certification, the Department has relied in part \non data generated by the early phases of the stockpile stewardship \nprogram. Third, the President submitted, and I strongly support, a \ncondition to the treaty that would permit the United States to withdraw \nfrom the treaty and resume nuclear testing if we have anything other \nthan the highest confidence in the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear weapons.\n  Having said all of this, I would like to raise another important \nissue today. Regardless of where members stand on the merits of the \nCTBT, I think there are two things every member of this body should \nagree upon. The process of treaty ratification is one of the most \nimportant responsibilities our founding fathers vested in the United \nStates Senate. In the course of this nation's history, the Senate has \nnever taken this responsibility lightly. It would be a mistake to do so \nnow. Second, it is hard to imagine a treaty with more significant \nramifications for our national security for decades to come than the \ntreaty before the Senate today. In the few brief days that this issue \nhas been before us, I have heard senior Senators, members who have cast \nthousands of votes, state that their vote on CTBT could well be one of \nthe most consequential of their Senate careers. I agree with that \nassessment.\n  Unfortunately, we are on the verge of ignoring these two truths. For \nsome unknown reason, the CTBT has become a political football in a high \nstakes, highly partisan debate. It appears that some are seeking to \nscore political points instead of carefully weighing this nation's \nnational security interests and our role and responsibilities in the \nworld. If politics should stop at the waters' edge, so too should it \nstop at the door to this chamber when we are deliberating treaties with \nsuch tremendous national and international ramifications.\n  Instead, after over 2 years of inaction, the Senate now finds itself \nlocked in a sprint to a vote that is equally unfair to both the \nopponents and proponents of this treaty. No member of this body can \ntruly believe he or she has all the information needed to render such a \nmomentous decision. No member can truly state that the Senate has lived \nup to the founding fathers' expectations of how this chamber should \nconduct itself when giving its advice and consent on treaties. No \nmember can really assert with a clear conscience that this was a fair \nand thorough process for dealing with any issue, let alone one of this \nmagnitude.\n\n[[Page S12316]]\n\n  Proceeding before we have given full airing to the numerous and \ncomplex issues surrounding the CTBT is unfair to the Senate, unfair to \nour national security and unfair to the American people. Before we \nbegin the calling of the roll asking where we stand on this treaty, we \nshould all take a step back and give ourselves time to study these \nissues. For the good of our nation's security and Americans for \ngenerations to come, I ask members on both sides of the aisle to join \nme in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12316-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, over the years, the culture of college has \ngradually changed from one of academics and concentrated study to one \nconsumed with partying. Gathering at the library with classmates to \nprepare for an exam has taken a back seat to sitting around swilling \nbeers at keg parties or ordering a round of shots at the closest bar.\n  Sadly, the process does not always begin in college. Often times, \nexperimentation with alcohol begins in high school, or even earlier. \nLarge numbers of young people are drinking. According to the 1998 \nMonitoring the Future Study conducted by the University of Michigan, \napproximately thirty-three percent of high school seniors, twenty-one \npercent of tenth graders, and eight percent of eighth graders reported \nbeing drunk at least once in a given month. Yes, Mr. President, drunk.\n  With such startling statistics at the pre-college level, it has \nbecome increasingly important for institutions of higher education to \ntake an even more active role in informing and educating highly \nimpressionable, yet extremely vulnerable, college freshmen about the \nmany dangers of this practice. Last year, I added a provision to the \nHigher Education Act Amendments of 1998 to establish a National \nRecognition Awards program to identify a select number of colleges and \nuniversities with innovative and effective alcohol and drug prevention \nprograms in place on campus. Under the program, each award recipient \nreceives a grant ranging from $40,000 to $75,000 to assist in the \ncontinuation of its important efforts. I am pleased that I was able to \nobtain $850,000 in the Senate's Fiscal Year 2000 Departments of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill to continue funding for this important initiative.\n  The U.S. Department of Education has recently named seven colleges \nand universities as recipients of this first-ever grant award. Mr. \nPresident, it is encouraging to know that institutions of higher \neducation from all corners of the country are taking aim at the problem \nof alcohol abuse among our nation's youth through new and creative \napproaches.\n  The six recipients of this award include Bowling Green State \nUniversity at Bowling Green, Ohio; Hobart and William Smith College at \nGeneva, New York; the University of Arizona at Tucson, Arizona; \nPennsylvania State University at University Park, Pennsylvania; the \nUniversity of Northern Colorado at Greeley, Colorado; the University of \nMissouri at Columbia, Missouri; and Utah State University at Logan, \nUtah. The Bowling Green State University Peer-Based Misperception \nprogram, for example, is designed to change attitudes, behaviors, and \nthe campus social environment with an emphasis on first-year students, \nmembers of Greek fraternal organizations, and athletes. This program \nincorporates small group survey research to uncover and dispel \nmisperceptions among peer groups such as a sorority, fraternity, \nathletic team, or members of a residence hall. Award funds will be used \nto continue the program, to implement it at other institutions, and to \nreduce the overall binge drinking rate.\n  Pennsylvania State University has been recognized for its alcohol-\nfree ``HUB Late Night'' program, a model alternative activity program \noffering students multiple forms of free entertainment as a means of \ncurbing high-risk drinking. The goals of the program involve delivering \nquality entertainment, providing a variety of alcohol-free programs for \na diverse student body, encouraging student involvement in designing \nand implementing programs, and increasing awareness of the program. \nApproximately 71 percent of participants reported that participation in \nthis program resulted in less drinking for themselves and for other \nstudents.\n  I am pleased that a higher education institution in my state, West \nVirginia University (WVU), has adopted an approach similar to that at \nPennsylvania State University in addressing alcohol abuse among \nstudents. West Virginia University recently created the WVUp All Night \nprogram which each Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night offers students \nconcerts, games, movies, free food, and study rooms as attractive \nalternatives to bars and nightclubs. According to WVU President David \nHardesty, the program has been a great success from the start, \nattracting an average of 4,000 students each Thursday, Friday, and \nSaturday night.\n  While this grant program will certainly serve these seven schools \nwell in providing them with the means to administer and expand their \nprevention programs, it is my true hope that this grant program will \nspan far beyond dollars and cents. Soon, the Department of Education \nwill be producing a publication highlighting these model programs, and \nwill make this document available to high school counselors throughout \nthe nation. When thinking about college, it is important for students \nand parents alike to be informed about good alcohol and drug prevention \nprograms. This document will serve as an important tool in helping \nstudents and their parents to make even wiser decisions about where to \npursue their college education.\n  Moreover, the grant recipients of this year's award ought to serve as \nmodels to all higher education institutions throughout the country. \nEach August, many schools face the formidable challenge of determining \nhow best to address the use and abuse of alcohol by underage students. \nWith these model schools, new information will be available to schools \nstill grappling with alcohol abuse problems. I encourage all Senators \nto pass along this information to institutions of higher education in \ntheir respective states.\n\n[[Page S12317]]\n\n  Mr. President, this program will only begin to touch upon some of the \nfundamental areas which must be addressed in halting alcohol from \nrearing its evil head on other vulnerable college campuses. The work \nnow lies ahead for all schools to endorse these noteworthy approaches \nand ideas which are working on select campuses throughout the United \nStates. Let these seven schools be models for all institutions of \nhigher education today and in the future. I congratulate the awardees \nof the program, and look forward to a strong, prosperous future for all \ncollege-going students, a future that is free from alcohol and other \ndrugs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12317-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, right now, my home state of Vermont is \ncelebrating Disability Employment Awareness Month. For that reason, I \nam delighted to speak about the ``Work Incentives Improvement Act of \n1999,'' legislation that I developed with my colleagues, Senators \nKennedy, Roth and Moynihan. This Act, also known as the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act (WIIA), is the most important piece of legislation for \nindividuals with disabilities since the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. This legislation is bipartisan. This legislation was brought to \nthe floor of the United States Senate with 80 cosponsors. And, most \nimportantly, this legislation passed through the Senate on June 15th \nwith a unanimous vote of 99-0.\n  The ``Work Incentives Improvement Act'' addresses a fundamental flaw \nin current law. Today, individuals with disabilities are forced to make \na choice, an absurd choice. They must choose between working and \nreceiving health care. Under current law, if people with disabilities \nwork and earn over $500 per month, they will lose their cash payments \nand health care coverage under Medicaid or Medicare. This is health \ncare coverage that they need. This is health care coverage that they \ncan not get in the private sector. This is not right.\n  Individuals with disabilities want to work. They have told me this. \nIn fact, national surveys over the past 10 years have consistently \nconfirmed that people with disabilities want to be part of the American \nworkforce. But only one-third of them do work. With the enactment of \nWIIA, these individuals would not need to worry about losing their \nhealth care if they choose to work a forty-hour week, to put in \novertime, or to pursue a career advancement. Individuals with \ndisabilities are sitting at home right now, waiting for this \nlegislation to become law. Having a job would provide them with a sense \nof self-worth. Having a job would allow them to contribute to our \neconomy. Having a job would provide them with a living wage, which is \nnot what one has through Social Security.\n  Currently, there are 7.5 million individuals with disabilities across \nthe nation who receive health care coverage and cash payments from the \nfederal government. 24,000 of these people live in Vermont. Only, one-\nhalf of one percent of the 7.5 million work to their full potential, \nbecause, when they earn over $500 per month, they lose their access to \nhealth care coverage. The first part of my legislation tackles this \nproblem. In states that elect to take up this option, WIIA provides \ncontinuing access to health care for Social Security Income and Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance beneficiaries who work and exceed the \nincome threshold.\n  Recognizing that some SSI and SSDI recipients will need job training \nand job placement assistance, the second part of my bill provides these \nincentives. People with disabilities would have more choices in where \nto obtain vocational rehabilitation and employment services. In \naddition, we would increase the incentives to public and participating \nprivate providers serving these individuals.\n  This legislation makes sense. When I came to Congress in 1975, one of \nmy legislative priorities was to provide individuals with disabilities \naccess to the American dream. Through the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, and the Assistive Technology Act, we have consistently improved \nthe lives of people with disabilities. Unfortunately, one major flaw \nremains, providing health care to individuals who want to work. The \nenactment of the Work Incentives Improvement Act would diminish this \nflaw in federal policy.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act reflects what individuals with \ndisabilities say they need. Over 100 national organizations have given \nus their input and endorsed our bill. The President has made it clear \nthat he would like to sign this legislation into law by the end of the \ncurrent year. The Incentives Improvement Act provides the opportunity \nto bring responsible change to federal policy and to eliminate a \nmisguided result of the current system--if you don't work, you get \nhealth care; if you do work, you don't get health care. The Work \nIncentives Improvement Act makes living the American dream a reality \nfor millions of individuals with disabilities, who will no longer be \nforced to choose between the health care coverage they so strongly need \nand the economic independence they so dearly desire.\n  I am looking forward to having my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives finish their work on the Work Incentives Improvement \nAct. Let's send this bill to President Clinton by the end of this \nsession of the 106th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12317-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFIRMATION OF COL. JOHN H. SINCLAIR TO BE UNITED STATES MARSHAL FOR \n                          DISTRICT OF VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate Col. John Sinclair on his \nSenate confirmation as the next United States Marshal for the District \nof Vermont.\n  As a 30-year veteran of the Vermont State Police, Col. Sinclair has \nserved as a uniformed trooper at both the Colchester and Bethel \nBarracks, later joined the Fraud Unit and the Governor's security \ndetail, and then was promoted to the post of Station Commander at the \nBrattleboro Barracks. He has also commanded both the Criminal Division \nand the Field Force. In 1996, he was appointed to his present position \nas director of the Vermont State Police, the department's highest-\nranking uniformed post.\n  I have known Col. Sinclair for nearly 30 years, since the time when \nhe was a new State trooper and I was Chittenden County's new State's \nattorney. We worked closely together on a number of investigations, \ntrials, and law enforcement education programs. I have watched his \ncareer for the past three decades and consider him to be one of the \nfinest police officers with whom I have ever worked. He is a police \nofficer's police officer. He is a strong component of our law \nenforcement team in Vermont.\n  He has gained extensive experience with State, federal, and local law \nenforcement matters. It is fitting that his longstanding service to the \npeople of Vermont culminate in this important law enforcement position. \nHis practical experience, background and training qualify him to be \nVermont's 34th United States Marshal.\n  Again, I congratulate Col. Sinclair and his wife, Barbara, who live \nin Charlotte, and their two sons, on receiving Senate confirmation as \nUnited States Marshal for the District of Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12317-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12317-S12318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SESQUICENTENNIAL OF THE SALT LAKE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this month the Salt Lake County Sheriff's \nOffice is celebrating their sesquicentennial anniversary. The Sheriff's \nOffice is a proud tradition of Utah, and I am grateful to them for \nkeeping Salt Lake County a safe place to live and visit.\n  Pioneers first settled the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. In March 1849, \nthey elected Brigham Young to be their Governor. Then, in October of \nthe same year, John D. Parker was elected to serve as the first sheriff \nof what would become the state of Utah. Later, in 1852, after the \nfederal government ratified the creation of the office of county \nsheriff, James B. Ferguson became John D. Parker's successor. Sheriff \nFerguson was the first officially elected sheriff of Salt Lake County. \nThis makes the Salt Lake County Sheriff's\n\n[[Page S12318]]\n\nOffice one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the west. Today, \nthe 1,254 employees of the Sheriff's Office continue that tradition.\n  Today, there are more than 835,000 citizens of Salt Lake County. \nThese citizens are served by the Sheriff's Office through patrols, \ninvestigations, jails--which have held Ted Bundy, Mark Hoffman, and \nCharles Manson among others--court security, civil service, and \nspecialized services, including K-9, air support, SWAT, and search and \nrescue units. The Sheriff's Office also coordinates local, state, and \nfederal task forces.\n  Some of the more heroic deeds have received national recognition. \nCaptain Lloyd Prescott is just one example of the kind of person we \nhave working for the people of Utah. During a hostage situation at a \nSalt Lake County library, then Lieutenant Lloyd Prescott offered \nhimself as an additional hostage to see if he could defuse the \nsituation. After almost five hours, it was obvious that the suspect was \nbecoming more agitated and that he would likely harm one of the \nhostages. Lieutenant Prescott then announced himself as a police \nofficer and was forced to shoot the suspect. For this act of bravery \nand courage, Lieutenant Prescott was awarded the Presidential \nCommendation from President Clinton, the Governor's Commendation from \nGovernor Leavitt, Officer of the Year from the International \nAssociation of the Chiefs of Police, Officer of the Year from the \nInternational Foot Printers Association, and Deputy Sheriff of the Year \nfrom the National Sheriff's Association. Captain Prescott continues to \nserve the citizens of Salt Lake County and the Sheriff's Office as the \nDivision Commander for the Special Operations Division.\n  This is just one example of the many acts of courage, bravery, and \nsimple acts of service performed daily by employees of the Salt Lake \nCounty Sheriff's Office. I want to extend a public thank you to all the \nemployees and deputies of the Sheriff's Office for their hard work, \nservice, and dedication to upholding justice and the rule of law. I \noffer my hearty congratulations to them on this landmark anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12318-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for S. 1678, the Medicare Beneficiaries Access to Care Act of \n1999, a bill to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries across our nation \ncontinue to have access to the health care services that they need. The \npackage that has been introduced addresses some of the most troubling \nareas in implementation of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and I \ncommend the Senate Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle, for the hard \nwork that he and his staff put into the creation of this bill.\n  I joined my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997, with the expectation that we would save $100 billion that \nwould help preserve the solvency of the Medicare program. Yet the \nmagnitude of cuts in BBA of 1997 have been much deeper than anyone \nintended. Present projections indicate that actual reductions have been \nin the area of $200 billion, twice as much as originally anticipated.\n  The unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have \nbeen severe indeed. And while there is a lot of publicity about the \nimpact of BBA 1997 cuts on entities like hospitals, nursing homes and \nhome health agencies, the real issue here is that the cuts are \nthreatening the ability of our constituents--patients who rely on these \nentities to provide care, rehabilitation, and life-saving services--to \ngain access to the care they need.\n  Take for example the impact of the BBA 1997 Interim Payment System \nfor home health agencies in Medicare. IPS was designed as a way to \ncounteract fraud, waste and abuse within the Medicare program. \nUnfortunately, the way in which IPS was implemented created a \ncounterintuitive and unfair system that penalizes low-cost areas for \ntheir thrift by basing reimbursement on past spending. More than 40 \nhome health agencies in 22 counties have closed in Wisconsin since the \nimplementation of Medicare home health IPS. IPS has ratcheted Medicare \nhome health payments so low that Wisconsin home health agencies are \nlosing hundreds of dollars per patient per day treating Medicare \npatients. Agencies in Wisconsin are not closing just because the \nbusiness isn't profitable, they are closing to reduce the devastating \nrate of loss.\n  BBA 1997 cuts have also been devastating for our nursing homes and \npatients' ability to gain access to outpatient therapy services. \nReimbursements to some nursing homes in Wisconsin has been so low that \none nursing home administrator in La Crosse, Wisconsin, informed me \nthat his agency, one of the few Medicare-certified ventilator-dependent \nprograms in the region, was losing between $150 and $300 per patient \nper day treating patients who depend on ventilators to breathe. That \nagency had no choice but to stop new admissions of ventilator-dependent \npatients. Similarly, residents of nursing homes who require physical \ntherapy, occupational therapy or speech pathology services are faced \nwith an arbitrary $1500 cap on their services, an amount that is \ngrossly inadequate to provide the necessary rehabilitation to patients \nrecovering from a stroke, an amputation or other life-altering event. \nThese arbitrary caps on the provision of rehabilitative therapy, have \nthe effect--though inadvertently--of placing a cap on the extent to \nwhich these patients can regain their independence.\n  One final area that I would like to raise is the expected impact on \nhospitals of BBA 1997 changes such as cuts to Graduate Medical \nEducation payments and the impact of a Prospective Payment System on \nhospital outpatient departments. Preliminary estimates from my \nconstituents at the Wisconsin Health and Hospital Association, WHA, \nindicate that Wisconsin's 28 teaching hospitals will lose almost $25 \nmillion per year from GME cuts. In addition, WHA projects that \nWisconsin hospitals will lose $30 million over the next three years if \nPPS is implemented--a loss of such magnitude that several rural \nhospitals in Wisconsin would likely be forced to close.\n  S. 1678 speaks directly to these concerns by increasing payments to \nMedicare Dependent Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals, of which my \nhome state of Wisconsin has 44. S. 1678 also includes stop-loss \nprotection to ensure that hospitals do not suffer dramatic losses under \nthe Outpatient Prospective Payment System. Lastly, S. 1678 freezes \nIndirect Medical Education cuts at 6.5% over 8 years and increases the \nnumber of residency slots available in rural areas.\n  The provisions of S. 1678 are important to ensuring continued access \nto care, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12318-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTRODUCTION OF S. 1714\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in conjunction with the minting of coins by the Republic of \nIceland in commemoration of the millennium of the discovery of the New \nWorld by Leif Ericson; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n             leif ericson millennium commemorative coin act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Leif Ericson \nMillennium Commemorative Coin Act along with my colleague Senator Rod \nGrams from Minnesota. This bipartisan legislation would authorize the \nU.S. Mint to issue a coin jointly with the Icelandic National Bank in \ncommemoration of Leif Ericson and his voyage and exploration of North \nAmerica. The famous Viking explorer is regarded as the first European \nto set foot on North American soil in the year 1000 AD. Next year marks \nthe 1000th anniversary of Leif Ericson's Voyage of Discovery and this \ncoin will commemorate this landmark event in North American history. \nThis same legislation passed the House on July 19, 1999, and passed \nboth the House and the Senate as amendments during the 105th Congress.\n  The Government of Iceland is an important North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) ally and this action would reiterate our strong \nrelationship with and support for their nation. Iceland votes with the \nUnited States on virtually all United Nations and NATO issues and has \nformulated foreign policies parallel to ours. They also are cutting \ncosts at our military base in Keflavi. Iceland has refrained from \nwhaling, encouraged more U.S. trade and investment and initiated a \npartnership with the State of Alaska. The Government of Iceland has \nalready approved a silver 1000 Kronor Icelandic coin to be produced by \nthe U.S. Mint that will be packaged and issued simultaneously with the \nU.S. Leif Ericson Commemorative Coin. We believe jointly issuing these \ncoins will help further relations between our nations.\n  Mr. President, the United States Congress strengthened United States-\nIcelandic relations by presenting a Leif Ericson statue as a gift to \nIceland in 1930 as a gesture of memorializing Ericson's Voyage of \nDiscovery. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson made October 9 ``Leif \nEricson Day'' in commemoration of this famous Norwegian Viking \nexplorer. The Leif Ericson Commemorative Coin in the year 2000 would \ncommemorate the millennial anniversary of Ericson's voyage and would \ndisplay our commitment to continuing this relationship for the coming \nmillennium.\n  Mr. President, the Leif Ericson Millennium Commemorative Coin Act \nallows a simultaneous issuance of a commemorative U.S. silver dollar \ncoin and a silver 1000 Kroner Icelandic coin. Both coins are to be \nproduced in limited mintages, with U.S. Mint issuing a boxed set. Mint \nand surcharge proceeds from the coins will fund scholarships and \nstudent exchange programs between Iceland and United States. The U.S. \nMint has read and approved the identical House version as meeting all \nthe guidelines contained in the 1995 Congressional House Banking \nCommittee Commemorative Coins Reforms Act, which protects the taxpayer \nfrom any costs. We feel such a coin is an important step in recognizing \nthe important role Iceland has played in North American history. In the \ncoming days, I will be talking to my colleagues in\n\n[[Page S12320]]\n\njoining me in supporting this legislation. Mr. President, I ask for \nunanimous consent for a copy of this bill to be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a deferral of tax on gain from the sale of telecommunications \nbusinesses in specific circumstances or a tax credit and other \nincentives to promote diversity of ownership in telecommunications \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         the telecommunications ownership diversity act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill make sure that new entrants and small businesses will have the \nchance to enter and grow in today's megacorporation-dominated \ntelecommunications marketplace. Together with my good friend and \ncolleague, Communications Subcommittee Chairman Conrad Burns, I am \npleased to bring forward for the Senate's consideration The \nTelecommunications Ownership Diversity Act of 1999.\n  Yesterday's Washington Post had it exactly right in reporting that, \n``the telecommunications world is being remade by technology, \nderegulation, and a relentless momentum toward greater and greater \nsize.'' In the past week alone MCI/WorldComm and Sprint announced what \ncould be the largest merger on record, the FCC approved a merger that \nwill create the country's largest local telephone company, and it has \npending before it many other major mergers, including those that would \nunite CBS with Viacom and Bell Atlantic with GTE.\n  Although this industry restructuring is unprecedented, it is not \nunexpected. Digital technology enables formerly-separate voice, video \nand data services to be offered in combination with each other. This \n``convergence'' makes it possible for many more telecommunications \ncompanies to compete with each other. And so some telecommunications \nbusinesses sell parts of their companies in an effort to focus on \nspecific markets, while others acquire new companies to expand into new \nmarkets.\n  This has opened the door for large companies to improve their \nbusiness prospects. But what about new entrants and small businesses? \nUnfortunately, for them the story has been quite different.\n  Mr. President, no one needs to be told that any small business faces \nsignificant barriers in trying to enter the telecommunications \nindustry. These barriers are even more formidable when the entrepreneur \nhappens to be a woman or a member of a minority group, due to their \nhistorically more difficult job of obtaining needed financing. \nTherefore, in this current telecom industry mixer, small businesses, \nespecially those owned by minorities or women, are often left without \npartners, watching as bigger, more established companies, get to dance.\n  That's not right, but there is an answer. The answer isn't to forbid \nmergers out-of-hand, or to retain hopelessly outdated FCC ownership \nrestrictions, or to pursue constitutionally or economically doomed set-\naside programs. The answer is to give established industry players \neconomic incentives to deal with new entrants and small businesses that \ncounterbalance the incentives they have to deal with larger companies.\n  And that's what our bill does. The Telecommunications Ownership \nDiversity Act will promote entry into the telecommunications industry \nduring this period of unprecedented restructuring by providing \ncarefully-limited changes to the tax law. These changes to the tax law \nare an indispensable component of the solution. Under current law, \nsmaller companies typically must purchase properties for cash, and cash \ntransactions are fully taxable to the seller. So naturally sellers of \ntelecommunications businesses prefer to sell for stock, which is tax-\ndeferred, and which large companies have to offer.\n  The act will level the playing field for new entrants and small \nbusinesses by giving telecommunications business sellers a tax deferral \nwhen the property is bought for cash by a small business telecom \ncompany. The act will also encourage the entry of new players and the \ngrowth of existing small businesses by enabling the seller of a telecom \nbusiness to claim the tax deferral or gain if it invests the proceeds \nof any sale of its business in purchasing an interest in an eligible \nsmall business.\n  In recognition of the convergence of telecommunications services and \nthe growing importance of wireless and Internet-based services as an \nessential component of the telecommunications market, the \ntelecommunications businesses eligible for this capital gains tax \ndeferral are broadly defined to include not only broadcast and cable \nTV-type businesses, but also wireline and wireless telephone service \nproviders and resellers, Internet service providers, information \ntechnology hardware and software companies, and video service \nproviders.\n\n[[Page S12321]]\n\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to establish the \neligibility criteria for small businesses and individuals to qualify, \nbased on the characteristics of the different types of \ntelecommunications businesses and on actual data from recent \nmarketplace transactions. In setting these limits the Secretary is \nempowered to establish different qualifications for different classes \nof eligible purchasers, such as minorities and women, to the extent \nconsistent with law. To eliminate the potential for abuse, the act \nwould require the eligible purchaser to hold any property acquired for \nthree years, during which time it could only be sold to an unrelated \neligible purchaser. The General Accounting Office is required to \nthoroughly audit and report on the administration and effect of the act \nevery two years.\n  Mr. President, I could say that, by utilizing tax deferral options in \nthis way, we are sharing with smaller companies a portion of the \ninvestment benefits our tax laws give to major telecom companies. That \nwould be accurate, but the real need for this act is much more \nfundamental and much simpler than that. Hallmark developments in \nthe telecommunications industry have been made by gifted individuals \nwith small companies and unlimited vision. In this sense the \ntelecommunications industry is a true microcosm of the American free-\nmarket system, in which the benefits produced by its entrepreneurs \ngenerate benefits that extend to all of us. It is therefore critically \nimportant that new entrants and small businesses have a chance to \nparticipate across the broad spectrum of industries that will make up \nthe telecommunications industry in the Information Age. The act will \nhelp them do that, and Senator Burns and I are proud to sponsor it and \nto work for its enactment.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1713. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nextend for an additional 2 years the period for admission of an alien \nas a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(S) of such Act, and to \nauthorize appropriations for the refugee assistance program under \nchapter 2 of title IV of the Immigration and Nationality Act; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            s visa and refugee assistance authorization act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I rise to introduce a bill, the ``S Visa and Refugee \nAssistance Authorization Act,'' to extend the authorization for two \nprovisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The bill is \ncosponsored by Senator Kennedy and is supported by the administration \nand the House immigration subcommittee. The legislation simply would \nextend for an additional two years the authorization of ``S'' temporary \nvisas, which are used to allow individuals to stay in the United States \nto assist in criminal investigations. A sense of the Congress on the \nneed to use these visas in more alien smuggling cases is also included. \nThe bill also would extend for three years the authorization of refugee \nassistance. Such assistance is provided to localities and community-\nbased organizations to help refugees upon their arrival in the United \nStates. My hope is that these noncontroversial provisions can be passed \nexpeditiously. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1713\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``S Visa and Refugee \n     Assistance Authorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       In light of the increasing problem of alien smuggling into \n     the United States, it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     Attorney General should use the provision of nonimmigrant \n     status under section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act in a greater number of alien smuggling \n     investigations per year than has been done in the past.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \npenalty free distribution from qualified retirement plans of \nindividuals residing in presidentially declared disaster areas; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             retirement penalty relief for disaster victims\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to allow penalty-free distributions from qualified \nretirement programs of individuals residing in Presidentially declared \ndisaster areas.\n  I and so many of my colleagues have been visiting our States and \nworking with our Governors and State legislators, city councilpersons \nand mayors particularly with regard to the devastation of floods we \nhave seen as a consequence of the most recent hurricane.\n  I looked into the faces of these suffering people. And one of them--\nthis was not my idea--one of them came to me with the simplest type of \nrequest. I thought it merited the attention of the Senate. I put it \ninto this bill that I now introduce in the Senate.\n  Despite an individual's or family's best efforts to plan for the \nfuture, sometimes the unexpected strikes--hurricanes and natural \ndisasters. When that happens, people need all the tools available to \nrebuild their lives, the lives of their families, and to become an \nintegral part of those communities.\n  One community, Franklin, VA, which is in the central part of the \nState, in the old rural part of the State, dependent largely on \nagriculture, which has flat land--I say to my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Helms, how badly his State was hit by the same storm--had 18 \ninches of rain in less than 2 hours. There is no large riverbed there \nor drainage ditches. And as a result, the water rose in this town up to \nthe second level of the stores and the houses. It went into a railyard \nand toppled enormous freight cars, particularly tank cars with \npetroleum. And suddenly this whole community was awash in foul water of \n8 to 10 to 12 feet some places in height. There was no place for the \nwater to run off, except gradually over this flat territory.\n  These people need to rebuild their lives and their homes. Families \nare faced with repairing and replacing damaged property and lost \nproperty. Many are forced to draw on savings, including their \nretirement accounts, to meet expenses. However, if they choose to tap \nupon their retirement plans or accounts, they are saddled with a 10-\npercent additional Federal tax for early distribution. That was put in \nthe law for good reason--to deter people from going into these plans \nwhere they had some tax benefits. But let's stop to think: That may be \nthe only recourse to financial salvation in the wake of an act of God \nAlmighty.\n\n  They need help. Taxpayers coping with these disasters should not have \nto face the burden of a Federal tax penalty. This bill is very simple. \nIt waives the 10 percent additional tax levied on early distributions \nfrom qualified retirement plans or retirement accounts for residents of \nfederally declared disaster areas--that means the President of the \nUnited States has declared that county a disaster area--designated \nafter July 31, 1999.\n  It is my intention that these distributions will be used for the \nrepair or replacement of property destroyed or damaged by an unforeseen \nnatural disaster or for emergency expenses arising from such a tragic \nevent.\n  The taxpayer must be a resident of an area declared eligible. I point \nthat out: a resident of an area eligible by the President for Federal \ndisaster assistance, and the distribution must be taken within 1 year \nof the disaster declaration.\n  The current Tax Code waives the 10-percent penalty for distribution \nfor certain medical expenses, health insurance premiums for the \nunemployed, higher education expenses, and the purchase of a first \nhome. In my view, eliminating this additional tax for individuals and \nfamilies suffering from the effects of unforeseen natural disasters \nmakes plain common sense.\n  How grateful all of us are for our constituents coming to the great \ncity of Washington, DC, and supplying us with\n\n[[Page S12322]]\n\nideas which probably are before us every day but somehow we overlook \nthem.\n  Tropical Storm Dennis and Hurricane Floyd have had a devastating \neffect on my State. People in Southside and Tidewater, VA, are \nattempting to rebuild their lives and to recover some of what they \nlost. We should remove any disincentive, any roadblock that may hinder \nrebuilding and recovery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1715. A bill to provide for an interim census of Americans \nresiding aboard, and to require that such individuals be included in \nthe 2010 decennial census; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                     census of americans abroad act\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, millions of Americans live and work \nabroad. While living abroad, they continue to pay taxes and vote. They \nare Americans, and they want and deserve to be counted in the decennial \nCensus. In order to achieve this important goal, we must plan and \nprepare.\n  The legislation introduced today directs the Secretary of Commerce to \nuse existing authority to conduct a special census of Americans abroad \nin 2003 to determine how to include this population in the next \ndecennial Census in 2010. While we wish that Americans abroad could be \npart of the 2000 Census, there unfortunately not the time or \nopportunity to do so.

among the several States and, \n     if so, how that should be done; and\n       (4) take appropriate measures--\n       (A) to provide for the inclusion of Americans residing \n     abroad in the 2010 decennial census and decennial censuses \n     thereafter; and\n       (B) to make use of the information obtained from such \n     censuses for such purposes as, and to the maximum extent \n

Res. 200\n\n       Whereas biotechnology is increasingly important to the \n     research and development of medical, agricultural, \n     industrial, and environmental products;\n       Whereas biotechnology has been responsible for \n     breakthroughs and achievements which have benefited people \n     for centuries and, in the 20th century, has contributed to \n     increasing the lifespan of Americans by 25 years through the \n     development of vaccines, antibiotics, and other drugs;\n       Whereas biotechnology is central to research for cures to \n     diseases such as cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, multiple \n     sclerosis, heart and lung disease, Alzheimer's disease, \n     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and innumerable \n     other medical ailments;\n       Whereas biotechnology contributes to crop yields and farm \n     productivity and enhances the quality, value, and suitability \n     of crops for food and other uses which are critical to \n     America's agricultural system;\n       Whereas biotechnology promises environmental benefits \n     including protection of water quality, conservation of \n     topsoil, improvement of waste management techniques, and \n     reduction of chemical pesticide usage;\n       Whereas biotechnology contributes to the success of the \n     United States in international commerce and trade;\n       Whereas biotechnology will be an important catalyst for \n     creating jobs in the 21st century; and\n       Whereas it is important for all Americans to understand the \n     role biotechnology contributes to their quality of life: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of February 14-20 of the year 2000 \n     as ``National Biotechnology Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe this \n     week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nwhich would designate the week of February 14-20 as ``National \nBiotechnology Week.''\n  I'm submitting this resolution because I believe it is important for \nour nation to recognize the role biotechnology has played in enhancing, \nsaving and extending our lives. Indeed, biotechnology has extended the \naverage American's life by nearly 25 years.\n  Mr. President, the 20th century has shown the most significant \nadvancements in all fields of biotechnology and there is reason to \nbelieve it will continue to deliver great hope and promise well into \nthe 21st century. This industry is one of our fastest growing and will \nadd thousands of new job opportunities to our economy. Just as the \nweeks of January and February, 2000 represent the start of a countdown \nto a new millennium beginning in 2001, they also represent the \ncountdown to breakthroughs we all once thought were impossible.\n  Already, advances made in agricultural biotechnology have given us \nincreased crop yields and promises of new uses for our agricultural \ncommodities as well as the higher quality, more nutritious products to \nimprove the competitiveness of our farmers. Great strides have been \nmade through the use of biotechnology and health care and hold the keys \nto successfully treating or curing diseases such as cancer, diabetes \nand countless other conditions. Biotechnology has assisted us in \nimproving water quality, conserving precious topsoil and reducing the \nneed for pesticides which helps us improve our environment for future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few examples of the impact \nbiotechnology has had on our lives. I believe Americans should \nunderstand the importance of biotechnology in our way of life. With the \npassage of the resolution I introduce today, we provide a forum for \nmany events in February to salute and promote this industry of the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing this important \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12323-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT EMPLOYEES WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      THOMPSON AMENDMENT NO. 2290\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for Mr. Thompson) proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. \n858) to amend title 11, District of Columbia Code, to extend coverage \nunder the whistleblower protection provisions of the District of \nColumbia Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978 to personnel of the \ncourts of the District of Columbia; as follows:\n\n       On page 5, strike lines 5 through 12.\n       On page 5, line 13, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(d)''.\n       On page 5, line 18, strike ``(f)`` and insert ``(e)''.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12324-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12324]]\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

John \nFeiler will be recognized here in Washington D.C. as Fort Hood's \nNoncommissioned Officer and Soldier of the third quarter of 1999.\n  Let me to tell you a little about this wonderful Idahoan. John \nFeiler, a native of Burley, Idaho enlisted in the Army shortly after \ngraduating from Burley High School. He began his training as a Combat \nEngineer in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. He was then assigned to the \nEngineer Battalion at Camp Eschborn in Germany. While in Germany he was \nan active participant in Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and \nProvide Comfort in Southwest Asia, for which he earned several awards \nand decorations.\n  After the Persian Gulf War, John was reassigned to Fort Stewart, \nGeorgia. While there, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant, and a \nshort time later he attended the Staff Sergeant Selection Board. During \nhis assignment in Fort Stewart, he was selected as the Commandant's \nInspection Awardee, made the Commandant's list, was nominated as the \n24th ID Engineer Brigade NCO of the Year for two consecutive years (`93 \n& `94), and nominated to represent the 24th ID as their NCO of the Year \nfor the XVIII Airborne Corps NCO of the Year competition.\n  In August of 1994 Sgt. Feiler pursued and completed the Army \nRecruiters Course. He served three years as a recruiter and was awarded \nthe Gold Recruiter Badge as a permanent award.\n  In December of 1997 he arrived in Fort Hood, Texas and was assigned \nto his current unit, A Company 299th Engineer Battalion. During the \neighteen months that he has served in the battalion, he has been \nawarded the Army Commendation Medal, two Army Achievement medals, and \nwas chosen as one of the ``Heroes of Battle'' during the battalion's \n99-05 NTC rotation. He is currently serving as a squad leader there.\n  His awards include the following: the Army Commendation Medal with \nfour oak leaf clusters, the Army Achievement Medal with nine oak leaf \nclusters, the Army Good Conduct Medal (third award), the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal (Saudi Arabia), \nand the Liberation of Kuwait Medal (Kuwait).\n  Idaho and the nation are proud of the way in which Sgt. John Feiler \nhas served our country. I am pleased to draw the Senate's attention to \nthe outstanding contributions he has made and hope all my colleagues \nwill join me in honoring him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/08/senate-section/article/S12324-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   C.B.

Mr. President, many Americans are preparing to enjoy a \nthree-day weekend. Most could tell you that their holiday was to honor \nChristopher Columbus, and a fair number might be able to recite ``in \nfourteen-hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue'' on \nhis way to discovering America. An even smaller number might be able to \nrecount the ongoing controversy over just where along the continent \nColumbus first came to land. But few, I hazard to guess, can truly \nappreciate the magnitude of his great daring, though we all appreciate \nthe bounty of his great mistake. Few may even realize that it is next \nTuesday, October 12, that is the true anniversary of Christopher \nColumbus' discovery of the New World, some 507 years ago.\n  Oh, Columbus, that scion of Eratosthenes, that son of Ptolemy, that \nkin in spirit to Marco Polo, what fascinating history he built upon \nwhen first he set out on his great journey. Although he was surely a \nbrave man, Columbus did not sail blindly off to the west not knowing \nwhether he would drop off the edge, as some children's books might lead \none to believe. No, Columbus had the wisdom of the ancients to guide \nhim and the lure of another adventurer's tales to entice him. He had \nhistory, mathematics, and science as his guides and greed as his goad \nto whip him along his journey.\n  Long before Columbus' day, Eratosthenes, the ancient Greek scholar \ncommonly called the Father of Geography, had determined with amazing \naccuracy the circumference of the earth. Born around 276 B.C. at a \nGreek colony in Cyrene, Libya, Eratosthenes was educated at the \nacademies in Athens and was appointed to run the Great Library at \nAlexandria, in what is now Egypt, in 240 B.C. During his time there, he \nwrote a comprehensive volume about the world, called ``Geography,'' the \nfirst known coining of that word. Eratosthenes used known distances and \ngeometry on a grand scale to calculate the circumference of the earth \nto within 100 miles of its true girth at the equator, 24,901 miles. His \nwork was still available in Columbus' time.\n  A later Greek geographer, Posidonius, felt that Eratosthenes' \ncircumference was too large and recalculated the figure at 18,000 \nmiles, some 7,000 miles too short. What is interesting about this fact \nis that Christopher Columbus deliberately used Posidonius's shorter \nfigure to convince his backers that he could quickly reach Asia by \nsailing west from Europe. It may not have been the first time that \nfinancial backers have been duped using doctored numbers, but I am \nconfident that it has not been the last!\n  So, we know that Columbus knew the earth was round--no fear of \nfalling off the edge--and that it was between 18,000 or 25,000 miles \naround at its midpoint--still a very long journey in either case for \nships the size that Columbus sailed on. But what led him to think \nsailing west from Europe to Asia was feasible? For that, Columbus would \nhave looked to a Roman scholar, Claudius Ptolemaeus, more commonly \nknown as Ptolemy. Like Eratosthenes before him, Ptolemy, who lived from \napproximately 90 to 170 A.D., worked in the Great Library at \nAlexandria, from 127 to 150 A.D. Perhaps inspired by Eratosthenes' \nwork, Ptolemy also published a scholarly work called ``Geography,'' in \naddition to a volume on astronomy and geometry, and a work on \nastrology. Ptolemy's ``Geography'' consisted of eight volumes, and it \nintroduced critical elements of map-making to the world. Ptolemy \nadvanced the efforts of mapmakers in representing the spherical world \non flat paper, in what are known as map projections. He is responsible \nfor the now universal practice of placing north at the top of the map. \nPtolemy also invented latitude and longitude--that is, he created a \ngrid system to lay over the globe in order to chart locations. His \nvolumes charted some eight thousand places around the world he knew, \nrevealing for future generations a geographic knowledge of the Roman \nempire of the second century.\n  Like many ancient works, Ptolemy's ``Geography'' was lost for over a \nthousand years after it was first published. But in the early fifteenth \ncentury, his work was rediscovered, translated into Latin, and \npublished in multiple editions. It would have been readily  available \nto Christopher Columbus, who was influenced both by Ptolemy's erroneous \nshorter circumference of the earth and by his depiction of the Indian \nOcean as a large inland sea, bordered on the south by beguiling Terra \nIncognita, the unknown land. I think there can be few things more \nmysterious, more alluring, than an old map with large blank land masses \nlabeled simply ``terra incognita'' or, on some medieval maps, by the \nphrase ``here be dragons.''\n\n  Marco Polo's fantastic tales of Cathay and the exotic spices and \ngoods that he brought back to Italy sparked a huge appetite for such \nthings, which only increased when the returning Crusaders opened the \noverland trade routes between Europe and the Orient. However, when \nConstantinople fell to the Turks in 1453, two years after Columbus was \nborn, the overland spice routes between Europe and Asia were closed \noff. Every power in Europe was eager--eager--to reopen the very \nprofitable trade, by land or by some unknown sea route. Seeking an \neastern sea route, Bartholomeu Dias reached the Cape of Good Hope in \nAfrica in 1488, and Vasco da Gama reached India in 1498, but the \neastern voyages were long and perilous. Anyone who could find a shorter \nroute would make a fortune for himself and his backers.\n  Columbus himself was born in Genoa in 1451 to Susanna Fontanarossa \nand Domenico Colombo, the eldest of their five children. Growing up in \na major port city, Columbus would have learned a lot about the sea, in \naddition to hearing and reading the tales of riches beyond the horizon.\n  True to his adventurous inclinations, Christopher Columbus took to \nthe sea. After an attack by the French at sea in the Strait of \nGibraltar in 1476, the ship Columbus was sailing on was sunk, forcing \nhim to swim to land. He was able to grab an oar and swim to land in \nPortugal. Three years later, he married into the Portuguese aristocracy \nwhen he wed Felipa Perestrelo. The marriage resulted in one son, Diego, \nand an entre into the financial backing of the Portuguese and Spanish \nnobility. In the simple history of Christopher Columbus that we may \nrecall from elementary school, which was a long time ago for me, it was \nKing Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain who finally provided the \nships, the fabled Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria, in which Columbus set \noff on August 3, 1492, to discover the western shortcut to the fabled \nwealth of the Indies. At roughly 2 a.m. on October 12, 1492, after 71 \ngrueling days at sea trusting in God, Eratosthenes, Ptolemy, and Polo, \nColumbus made landfall in what he believed was the Indies.\n  Columbus found no gold, silks, spices or valuable wood in his \nmisnamed Indies, but he did bring tobacco back to Europe. After \nestablishing a fort called Natividad, built of timbers from the wrecked \nSanta Maria, Columbus returned to Spain.\n  Columbus made three other journeys to his new-found land, which he \nnamed Hispaniola. His second voyage left Spain in September 1493 and \nreturned to Spain in 1496 after establishing a more substantial colony. \nHis third voyage led to his return to Spain in\n\n[[Page S12327]]\n\nchains, prisoner of the colonists who rose up against his bad \nmanagement. Columbus was able to clear his name and made a fourth and \nfinal voyage to the New World before he died in Spain on May 20, 1506. \nThe great irony, however, is that Christopher Columbus believing that \nhe had discovered some untouched part of the Indies, or distant outpost \nof China, not a continent previously unknown to the Europeans. He had \nmade a mistake, but what a glorious mistake it was! For us, it was a \nvery fortunate mistake. Christopher Columbus had discovered what for \nEuropeans was truly Terra Incognita, a new and unknown land, a treasury \nof natural riches that we, as his heirs, enjoy to this day.\n  I am glad that we celebrate this brave man. We celebrate a man who \nmade a great gamble, a man who set off to seek a back door to the Far \nEast by setting his sights west and trusting in ancient scholars. We \ncelebrate a man who appreciated the romance of a traveler's tales and \nwho sensed the riches and wonders that await the bold. We celebrate an \nimperfect man, a man who failed in his goal but who achieved much \nnonetheless. We celebrate a man whose daring, whose courage, who sheer \npersistence, moved history forward.\n  We talk about profiles in courage. These are profiles in political \ncourage. Here was an intrepid man who perhaps could claim the \ngreatest--or one of the greatest--profiles ever written on the record \nof humankind. Imagine him out there on the deep waters. He had no \nwireless telegraph; he had no radio; he had no weather forecasters. All \nhe had was the compass. There were no ships in the area to rescue him \nif his ship sank. There was no way to hear back from home or to speak \nto those back home if he became ill. There was no helicopter to take \nhim to the nearby hospital or to a sister ship. There he was, alone on \nthe great blue waters.\n  Just imagine what courage he must have had, never knowing whether he \nwould be able to return against the winds that were blowing from the \neast, no refrigerator in which to keep the hard tack. His son, \nFerdinand, who accompanied him on his fourth journey, I believe it was, \nwrote that he, Ferdinand, had seen the sailors wait until after dark \nbefore they ate the hard tack so it would not be possible to see the \nmaggots on the hard tack. No sanitation with respect to the water and \nthe food was cooked in an open stove with wood on the decks of the \nsmall ship.\n  What intrepidity. But how fortunate we are today that there was a man \nwho was so intrepid as to face down the mutinous crew and who persisted \nin his faith to say an oath.\n  Today we look forward to that weekend and to next Tuesday, which is \nactually the day, 507 years later, when Columbus made the great \ndiscovery. We will celebrate the life and the accomplishments of \nChristopher Columbus, the first European to see the low green land on \nthe horizon that was North America.\n  I would like to close with the words of Joaquin Miller:\n\n     Behind him lay the gray Azores,\n     Behind the gates of Hercules!\n     Before him not the ghost of shores,\n     Before him only shoreless seas.\n     The good mate said: ``Now must we pray,\n     For lo! The very stars are gone.\n     Brave Adm'rl, speak; what shall I say?''\n     ``Why, say: `Sail on! sail on! and on!' ''\n\n     ``My men grow mutinous day by day;\n     My men grow ghastly wan and weak.''\n     The stout mate thought of home; a spray\n     Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek.\n     ``What shall I say, brave Admiral, say,\n     If we sight naught but seas at dawn?''\n     ``Why you shall say at break of day,\n     Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!' ''\n\n     They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow,\n     Until at last the blanched mate said:\n     ``Why, now not even God would know\n     Should I and all my men fall dead.\n     These very winds forget their way.\n     For God from these dread seas is gone.\n     Now speak, brave Admiral; speak and say.''\n     He said: ``Sail on! sail on! and on!''\n\n     They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate:\n     ``This mad sea shows his teeth tonight.\n     He curls his lip, he lies in wait,\n     With lifted teeth, as if to bite!\n     Brave Adm'rl, say but one good word:\n     What shall we do when hope is gone?''\n     The words leapt like a leaping sword:\n     ``Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!''\n\n     Then pale and worn, he kept his deck,\n     And peered through darkness. Ah, that night\n     Of all dark nights! And then a speck--\n     A light! a light! a light! a light!\n     It grew, a starlet flag unfurled.\n     It grew to be Time's burst of dawn.\n     He gained a world; he gave that world\n     It's grandest lesson: ``On! sail on!''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
