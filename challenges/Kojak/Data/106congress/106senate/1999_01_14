The President has acknowledged conduct \n     with Ms. Lewinsky that was improper. But Article II, Section \n     4 of the Constitution provides that the President shall be \n     removed from office only upon ``Impeachment for, and \n     Conviction of, Treason, Bribery or other high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.'' The charges in the articles do not rise to \n     the level of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as contemplated \n     by the Founding Fathers, and they do not satisfy the rigorous \n     constitutional standard applied throughout our Nation's \n     history. Accordingly, the Articles of Impeachment should be \n     dismissed.\n\n        The President Did Not Commit Perjury or Obstruct Justice\n\n       The President denies each and every material allegation of \n     the two Articles of Impeachment not specifically admitted in \n     this answer.\n\n                               Article I\n\n       President Clinton denies that he made perjurious, false and \n     misleading statements before the federal grand jury on August \n     17, 1998.\n\n                     Factual Responses to Article I\n\n       Without waiving his affirmative defenses, President Clinton \n     offers the following factual responses to the allegations in \n     Article I:\n     (1) The President denies that he made perjurious, false and \n         misleading statements to the grand jury about ``the \n         nature and details of his relationship'' with Monica \n         Lewinsky\n       There is a myth about President Clinton's testimony before \n     the grand jury. The myth is that the President failed to \n     admit his improper intimate relationship with Ms. Monica \n     Lewinsky. The myth is perpetuated by Article I, which accuses \n     the President of lying about ``the nature and details of his \n     relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky.\n       The fact is that the President specifically acknowledged to \n     the grand jury that he had an improper intimate relationship \n     with Ms. Lewinsky. He said so, plainly and clearly: ``When I \n     was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in early \n     1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct that was \n     wrong. These encounters . . . did involve inappropriate \n     intimate contact.'' The President described to the grand jury \n     how the relationship began and how it ended at his insistence \n     early in 1997--long before any public attention or scrutiny. \n     He also described to the grand jury how he had attempted to \n     testify in the deposition in the Jones case months earlier \n     without having to acknowledge to the Jones lawyers what he \n     ultimately admitted to the grand jury--that he had an \n     improper intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n       The President read a prepared statement to the grand jury \n     acknowledging his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The \n     statement was offered at the beginning of his testimony to \n     focus the questioning in a manner that would allow the Office \n     of Independent Counsel to obtain necessary information \n     without unduly dwelling on the salacious details of the \n     relationship. The President's statement was followed by \n     almost four hours of questioning. If it is charged that his \n     statement was in any respect perjurious, false and \n     misleading, the President denies it. The President also \n     denies that the statement was in any way an attempt to thwart \n     the investigation.\n       The President states, as he did during his grand jury \n     testimony, that he engaged in improper physical contact with \n     Ms. Lewinsky. The President was truthful when he testified \n     before the grand jury that he did not engage in sexual \n     relations with Ms. Lewinsky as he understood that term to be \n     defined by the Jones lawyers during their questioning of him \n     in that deposition. The President further denies that his \n     other statements to the grand jury about the nature and \n     details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were \n     perjurious, false, and misleading.\n     (2) The President denies that he made perjurious, false and \n         misleading statements to the grand jury when he testified \n         about statements he had made in the Jones deposition\n       There is a second myth about the President's testimony \n     before the grand jury. The myth is that the President adopted \n     his entire Jones deposition testimony in the grand jury. The \n     President was not asked to and did not broadly restate or \n     reaffirm his Jones deposition testimony. Instead, in the \n     grand jury he discussed the bases for certain answers he \n     gave. The President testified truthfully in the grand jury \n     about statements he made in the Jones deposition. The \n     President stated to the grand jury that he did not attempt to \n     be helpful to or assist the lawyers in the Jones deposition \n     in their quest for information about his relationship with \n     Ms. Lewinsky. He truthfully explained to the grand jury his \n     efforts to answer the questions in the Jones deposition \n     without disclosing his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. \n     Accordingly, the full, underlying Jones deposition is not \n     before the Senate.\n       Indeed, the House specifically considered and rejected an \n     article of impeachment based on the President's deposition in \n     the Jones case. The House managers should not be allowed to \n     prosecute before the Senate an article of impeachment which \n     the full House has rejected.\n     (3) The President denies that he made perjurious, false and \n         misleading statements to the grand jury about \n         ``statements he allowed his attorney to make'' during the \n         Jones deposition\n       The President denies that he made perjurious, false and \n     misleading statements to the grand jury about the statements \n     his attorney made during the Jones deposition. The President \n     was truthful when he explained to the grand jury his \n     understanding of certain statements made by his lawyer, \n     Robert Bennett, during the Jones deposition. The President \n     also was truthful when he testified that he was not focusing \n     on the prolonged and complicated exchange between the \n     attorneys and Judge Wright.\n     (4) The President denies that he made perjurious, false and \n         misleading statements to the grand jury concerning \n         alleged efforts ``to influence the testimony of witnesses \n         and to impede the discovery of evidence'' in the Jones \n         case\n       For the reasons discussed more fully in response to Article \n     II, the President denies that he attempted to influence the \n     testimony of any witness or to impede the discovery \n     of evidence in the Jones case. Thus, the President denies \n     that he made perjurious, false and misleading statements \n     before the grand jury when he testified about these \n     matters.\n\n First Affirmative Defense: Article I Does Not Meet the Constitutional \n                  Standard for Conviction and Removal\n\n       For the same reasons set forth in the preamble of this \n     answer, Article I does not meet the rigorous constitutional \n     standard for conviction and removal from office of a duly \n     elected President and should be dismissed.\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\nSecond Affirmative Defense: Article I Is Too Vague To Permit Conviction \n                              and Removal\n\n       Article I is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable person \n     could know what specific charges are being leveled against \n     the President. It alleges that the President provided the \n     grand jury with ``perjurious, false, and misleading \n     testimony'' concerning ``one or more'' of four subject areas. \n     But it fails to identify any specific statement by the \n     President that is alleged to be perjurious, false and \n     misleading. The House has left the Senate and the President \n     to guess at what it had in mind.\n       One of the fundamental principles of our law and the \n     Constitution is that a person has a right to know what \n     specific charges he or she is facing. Without such fair \n     warning, no one can prepare the defense to which every person \n     is entitled. The law and the Constitution also mandate \n     adequate notice to jurors so they may know the basis for the \n     vote they must make. Without a definite and specific \n     identification of false statements, a trial becomes a moving \n     target for the accused. In addition, the American people \n     deserve to know upon what specific statements the President \n     is being judged, given the gravity and effect of these \n     proceedings, namely nullifying the results of a national \n     election.\n       Article I sweeps broadly and fails to provide the required \n     definite and specific identification. Were it an indictment, \n     it would be dismissed. As an article of impeachment, it is \n     constitutionally defective and should fail.\n\n Third Affirmative Defense: Article I Charges Multiple Offense in One \n                                Article\n\n       Article I is fatally flawed because it charges multiple \n     instances of alleged perjurious, false and misleading \n     statements in one article. The Constitution provides that \n     ``no person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two \n     thirds of the Members present,'' and Senate Rule XXIII \n     provides that ``an article of impeachment shall not be \n     divisible for the purpose of voting thereon at any time \n     during the trial.'' By the express terms of Article I, a \n     Senator may vote for impeachment if he or she finds that \n     there was perjurious, false and misleading testimony in ``one \n     or more'' of four topic areas. This creates the very real \n     possibility that conviction could occur even though Senators \n     were in wide disagreement as to the alleged wrong committed. \n     Put simply, the structure of Article I presents the \n     possibility that the President could be convicted even though \n     he would have been acquitted if separate votes were taken on \n     each allegedly perjurious statement. For example, it would be \n     possible for the President to be convicted and removed from \n     office with as few as 17 Senators agreeing that any single \n     statement was perjurious, because 17 votes for each of the \n     four categories in Article I would yield 68 votes, one more \n     than necessary to convict and remove.\n       By charging multiple wrongs in one article, the House of \n     Representatives has made it impossible for the Senate to \n     comply with the Constitutional mandate that any conviction be \n     by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, \n     Article I should fail.\n\n                    Factual Responses to Article II\n\n       Without waiving his affirmative defenses, President Clinton \n     offers the following factual responses to the allegations in \n     Article II:\n     (1) The President denies that on or about December 17, 1997, \n         he ``corruptly encouraged'' Monica Lewinsky ``to execute \n         a sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be \n         perjurious, false and misleading''\n       The President denies that he encouraged Monica Lewinsky to \n     execute a false affidavit in the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky, \n     the only witness cited in support of this allegation, denies \n     this allegation as well. Her testimony and proffered \n     statements are clear and unmistakable:\n        ``[N]o one even asked me to lie and I was never \n     promised a job for my silence.''\n        ``Neither the President nor anyone ever directed \n     Lewinsky to say anything or to lie . . .''\n        ``Neither the Pres[ident] nor Mr. Jordan (or \n     anyone on their behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. L[ewinsky] to \n     lie.''\n       The President states that, sometime in December 1997, Ms. \n     Lewinsky asked him whether she might be able to avoid \n     testifying the Jones case because she knew nothing about Ms. \n     Jones or the case. The President further states that he told \n     her he believed other witnesses had executed affidavits, and \n     there was a chance they would not have to testify. The \n     President denies that he ever asked, encouraged or suggested \n     that Ms. Lewinsky file a false affidavit or lie. The \n     President states that he believed that Ms. Lewinsky could \n     have filed a limited but truthful affidavit that might have \n     enabled her to avoid having to testify in the Jones case.\n     (2) The President denies that on or about December 17, 1997, \n         he ``corruptly encouraged'' Monica Lewinsky ``to give \n         perjurious, false and misleading testimony of and when \n         called to testify personally'' in the Jones litigation\n       Again, the President denies that he encouraged Ms. Lewinsky \n     to lie if and when called to testify personally in the Jones \n     case. The testimony and proffered statements of Monica \n     Lewinsky, the only witness cited in support of this \n     allegation, are clear and unmistakable:\n        [N]o one ever asked me to lie and I was never \n     promised a job for my silence.''\n        ``Neither the President nor anyone ever directed \n     Lewinsky to say anything or to lie . . .''\n        ``Neither the Pres[ident] nor Mr. Jordan (or \n     anyone on their behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. L[ewinsky] to \n     lie.''\n       The President states that, prior to Ms. Lewinsky's \n     involvement in the Jones case, he and Ms. Lewinsky might have \n     talked about what to do to conceal their relationship from \n     others. Ms. Lewinsky was not a witness in any legal \n     proceeding at that time. Ms. Lewinsky's own testimony and \n     statements support the President's recollection. Ms. Lewinsky \n     testified that she ``pretty much can'' exclude the \n     possibility that she and the President ever had discussions \n     about denying the relationship after she learned she was a \n     witness in the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky also stated that \n     ``they did not discuss the issue [of what to say about their \n     relationship] is specific relation to the Jones matter,'' and \n     that ``she does not believe they discussed the content of any \n     deposition that [she] might be involved in at a later date.''\n     (3) The President denies that on or about December 28, 1997, \n         he ``corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a \n         scheme to conceal evidence'' in the Jones case\n       The President denies that he engaged in, encouraged, or \n     supported any scheme to conceal evidence from discovery in \n     the Jones case, including any gifts he had given to Ms. \n     Lewinsky. The President states that he gave numerous gifts to \n     Ms. Lewinsky prior to December 28, 1997. The President states \n     that, sometime in December, Ms. Lewinsky inquired as to what \n     to do if she were asked in the Jones case about the gifts he \n     had given her, to which the President responded that she \n     would have to turn over whatever she had. The President \n     states that he was unconcerned about having given her gifts \n     and, in fact, that he gave Ms. Lewinsky additional gifts on \n     December 28, 1997. The President denies that he ever asked \n     his secretary, Ms. Betty Currie, to retrieve gifts he had \n     given Ms. Lewinsky, or that he ever asked, encouraged, or \n     suggested that Ms. Lewinsky conceal the gifts. Ms. Currie \n     told prosecutors as early as January 1998 and repeatedly \n     thereafter that it was Ms. Lewinsky who had contacted her \n     about retrieving gifts.\n     (4) The President denies that he obstructed justice in \n         connection with Monica Lewinsky's efforts to obtain a job \n         in New York to ``corruptly prevent'' her ``truthful \n         testimony'' in the Jones case\n       The President denies that he obstructed justice in \n     connection with Ms. Lewinsky's job search in New York or \n     sought to prevent her truthful testimony in the Jones case. \n     The President states that he discussed with Ms. Lewinsky her \n     desire to obtain a job in New York months before she was \n     listed as a potential witness in the Jones case. Indeed, Ms. \n     Lewinsky was offered a job in New York at the United Nations \n     more than a month before she was identified as a possible \n     witness. The President also states that he believes that Ms. \n     Lewinsky raised with him, again before she was ever listed as \n     a possible witness in the Jones case, the prospect of having \n     Mr. Vernon Jordan assist in her job search. Ms. Lewinsky \n     corroborates his recollection that it was her idea to ask for \n     Mr. Jordan's help. The President also states that he was \n     aware that Mr. Jordan was assisting Ms. Lewinsky to obtain \n     employment in New York. The President denies that any of \n     these efforts had any connection whatsoever to Ms. Lewinsky's \n     status as a possible or actual witness in the Jones case. Ms. \n     Lewinsky forcefully confirmed the President's denial when she \n     testified, ``I was never promised a job for my silence.''\n     (5) The President denies that he ``corruptly allowed his \n         attorney to make false and misleading statements to a \n         Federal judge'' concerning Monica Lewinsky's affidavit\n       The President denies that he corruptly allowed his attorney \n     to make false and misleading statements concerning Ms. \n     Lewinsky's affidavit to a Federal judge during the Jones \n     deposition. The President denies that he was focusing his \n     attention on the prolonged and complicated exchange between \n     his attorney and Judge Wright.\n     (6) The President denies that he obstructed justice by \n         relating ``false and misleading statements'' to ``a \n         potential witness,'' Betty Currie, ``in order to \n         corruptly influence [her] testimony''\n       The President denies that he obstructed justice or \n     endeavored in any way to influence any potential testimony of \n     Ms. Betty Currie. The President states that he spoke with Ms. \n     Currie on January 18, 1998. The President testified that, in \n     that conversation, he was trying to find out what the facts \n     were, what Ms. Currie's perception was, and whether his own \n     recollection was correct about certain aspects of his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Currie testified that she \n     felt no pressure ``whatsoever'' from the President's \n     statements and no pressure ``to agree with [her] boss.'' The \n     President denies knowing or believing that Ms. Currie would \n     be a witness in any proceeding at the time of this \n     conversation. Ms. Currie had not been on any of the witness \n     lists proffered by the Jones lawyers. President Clinton \n     states that, after the Independent Counsel investigation \n     became public, when Ms. Currie was scheduled to testify, he \n     told Ms. Currie to ``tell the truth.''\n     (7) The President denies that he obstructed justice when he \n         relayed allegedly ``false and misleading statements'' to \n         his aides\n       The President denies that he obstructed justice when he \n     misled his aides about the\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\n     nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the days \n     immediately following the public revelation of the Lewinsky \n     investigation. The President acknowledges that, in the days \n     following the January 21, 1998, Washington Post article, he \n     misled his family, his friends and staff, and the Nation to \n     conceal the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He \n     sought to avoid disclosing his personal wrongdoing to protect \n     his family and himself from hurt and public embarrassment. \n     The President profoundly regrets his actions, and he has \n     apologized to his family, his friends and staff, and the \n     Nation. The President denies that he had any corrupt purpose \n     or any intent to influence the ongoing grand jury \n     proceedings.\n\nFirst Affirmative Defense: Article II Does Not Meet the Constitutional \n                  Standard for Conviction and Removal\n\n       For the reasons set forth in the preamble of this answer, \n     Article II does not meet the constitutional standard for \n     convicting and removing a duly elected President from office \n     and should be dismissed.\n\n     Second Affirmative Defense: Article II Is Too Vague To Permit \n                         Conviction and Removal\n\n       Article II is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable \n     person could know what specific charges are being leveled \n     against the President. Article II alleges that the President \n     ``obstructed and impeded the administration of justice'' in \n     both the Jones case and the grand jury investigation. But it \n     provides little or no concrete information about the specific \n     acts in which the President is alleged to have engaged, or \n     with whom, or when, that allegedly obstructed or otherwise \n     impeded the administration of justice.\n       As we set forth in the Second Affirmative Defense to \n     Article I, one of the fundamental principles of our law and \n     the Constitution is that a person has the right to know what \n     specific charges he or she is facing. Without such fair \n     warning, no one can mount the defense to which every person \n     is entitled. Fundamental to due process is the right of the \n     President to be adequately informed of the charges so that he \n     is able to confront those charges and defend himself.\n       Article II sweeps too broadly and provides too little \n     definite and specific identification. Were it an indictment, \n     it would be dismissed. As an article of impeachment, it is \n     constitutionally defective and should fail.\n\nThird Affirmative Defense: Article II Charges Multiple Offenses in One \n                                Article\n\n       For the reasons set forth in the Third Affirmative Defense \n     to Article I, Article II is constitutionally defective \n     because it charges multiple instances of alleged acts of \n     obstruction in one article, which makes it impossible for the \n     Senate to comply with the Constitutional mandates that any \n     conviction be by the concurrence of the two-thirds of the \n     members.

Although what follows is not \n     exhaustive, some of the more overt examples will serve to \n     illustrate.\n        At the very outset, the President read a prepared \n     statement, which itself contained totally false assertions \n     and other clearly misleading information.\n        The President relied on his statement nineteen \n     times in his testimony when questioned about his relationship \n     with Ms. Lewinsky.\n        President Clinton falsely testified that he was \n     not paying attention when his lawyer employed Ms. Lewinsky's \n     false affidavit at the Jones deposition.\n        He falsely claimed that his actions with Ms. \n     Lewinsky did not fall within the definition of ``sexual \n     relations'' that was given at his deposition.\n        He falsely testified that he answered questions \n     truthfully at his deposition concerning, among other \n     subjects, whether he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky.\n        He falsely testified that he instructed Ms. \n     Lewinsky to turn over the gifts if she were subpoenaed.\n        He falsely denied trying to influence Ms. Currie \n     after his deposition.\n        He falsely testified that he was truthful to his \n     aides when he gave accounts of his relationship, which \n     accounts were subsequently disseminated to the media and the \n     grand jury.\n\n\n                         Obstruction of Justice\n\n       The President engaged in an ongoing scheme to obstruct both \n     the Jones civil case and the grand jury. Further, he \n     undertook a continuing and concerted plan to tamper with \n     witnesses and prospective witnesses for the purpose of \n     causing those witnesses to provide false and misleading \n     testimony. Examples abound:\n        The President and Ms. Lewinsky concocted a cover \n     story to conceal their relationship, and the President \n     suggested that she employ that story if subpoenaed in the \n     Jones case.\n        The President suggested that Ms. Lewinsky provide \n     an affidavit to avoid testifying in the Jones case, when he \n     knew that the affidavit would need to be false to accomplish \n     its purpose.\n        The President knowingly and willfully allowed his \n     attorney to file Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit and to use it \n     for the purpose of obstructing justice in the Jones case.\n        The President suggested to Ms. Lewinsky that she \n     provide a false account of how she received her job at the \n     Pentagon.\n        The President attempted to influence the expected \n     testimony of his secretary, Ms. Currie, by providing her with \n     a false account of his meetings with Ms. Lewinsky.\n        The President provided several of his top aides \n     with elaborate lies about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, \n     so that those aides would convey the false information to the \n     public and to the grand jury. When he did this, he knew that \n     those aides would likely be called to testify, while he was \n     declining several invitations to testify. By this action, he \n     obstructed and delayed the operation of the grand jury.\n        The President conspired with Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. \n     Currie to conceal evidence that he had been subpoenaed in the \n     Jones case, and thereby delayed and obstructed justice.\n        The President and his representatives orchestrated \n     a campaign to discredit Ms. Lewinsky in order to affect \n     adversely her credibility as a witness, and thereby attempted \n     to obstruct justice both in the Jones case and the grand \n     jury.\n        The President lied repeatedly under oath in his \n     disposition in the Jones case, and thereby obstructed justice \n     in that case.\n        The President's lies and misleading statements \n     under oath at the grand jury were calculated to, and did \n     obstruct, delay and prevent the due administration of justice \n     by that body.\n        The President employed the power of his office to \n     procure a job for Ms. Lewinsky after she signed the false \n     affidavit by causing his friend to exert extraordinary \n     efforts for that purpose.\n       The foregoing are merely accusations of an ongoing pattern \n     of obstruction of justice, and witness tampering extending \n     over a period of several months, and having the effect of \n     seriously compromising the integrity of the entire judicial \n     system.\n       The effect of the President's misconduct has been \n     devastating in several respects.\n       (1) He violated repeatedly his oath to ``preserve, protect \n     and defend the Constitution of the United States.''\n       (2) He ignored his constitutional duty as chief law \n     enforcement officer to ``take care that the laws be \n     faithfully executed.''\n       (3) He deliberately and unlawfully obstructed Paula Jones's \n     rights as a citizen to due process and the equal protection \n     of the laws, though he had sworn to protect those rights.\n       (4) By his pattern of lies under oath, misleading \n     statements and deceit, he has seriously undermined the \n     integrity and credibility of the Office of President and \n     thereby the honor and integrity of the United States.\n       (5) His pattern of perjuries, obstruction of justice, and \n     witness tampering has affected the truth seeking process \n     which is the foundation of our legal system.\n       (6) By mounting an assault in the truth seeking process, he \n     has attacked the entire Judicial Branch of government.\n       The Articles of Impeachment that the House has preferred \n     state offenses that warrant, if proved, the conviction and \n     removal from office of President William Jefferson Clinton. \n     The Articles charge that the President has committed perjury \n     before a federal grand jury and that he obstructed justice in \n     a federal civil rights action. The Senate's own precedents \n     establish beyond doubt that perjury warrants conviction and \n     removal. During the 1980s, the Senate convicted and removed \n     three federal judges for committing perjury. Obstruction of \n     justice under mines the judicial system in the same fashion \n     that\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\n     perjury does, and it also warrants conviction and removal.\n       Under our Constitution, judges are impeached under the same \n     standard as Presidents--treason, bribery, or other high \n     crimes and misdemeanors. Thus, these judicial impeachments \n     for perjury set the standard here. Finally, the Senate's own \n     precedents further establish that the President's crimes need \n     not arise directly out of his official duties. Two of the \n     three judges removed in the 1980s were removed for perjury \n     that had nothing to do with their official duties.\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       This Brief is intended solely to advise the Senate \n     generally of the evidence that the Managers intend to \n     product, if permitted, and of the applicable legal \n     principles. It is not intended to discuss exhaustively all of \n     the evidence, nor does it necessarily include each and every \n     witness and document that the Managers would produce in the \n     course of the trial. This Brief, then, is merely an outline \n     for the use of the Senate in reviewing and assessing the \n     evidence as it is set forth at trial--it is not, and is not \n     intended to be a substitute for a trial at which all of the \n     relevant facts will be developed.\n\n               H. Res. 611, 105th Cong. 2nd Sess. (1998)\n\n       The House Impeachment Resolution charges the President with \n     high crimes and misdemeanors in two Articles. Article One \n     alleges that President Clinton ``willfully corrupted and \n     manipulated the judicial process of the United States for his \n     personal gain and exoneration, impeding the administration of \n     justice'' in that he willfully provided perjurious, false and \n     misleading testimony to a federal grand jury on August 17, \n     1998. Article Two asserts that the President ``has prevented, \n     obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice and \n     engaged in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, \n     impede, cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence and \n     testimony related to a federal civil rights action brought \n     against him.'' Both Articles are now before the Senate of the \n     United States for trial as provided by the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n       The Office of President represents to the American people \n     and to the world, the strength, the philosophy and most of \n     all, the honor and integrity that makes us a great nation and \n     an example for the world. Because all eyes are focused upon \n     that high office, the character and credibility of any \n     temporary occupant of the Oval Office is vital to the \n     domestic and foreign welfare of the citizens. Consequently, \n     serious breaches of integrity and duty of necessity adversely \n     influence the reputation of the United States.\n       This case is not about sex or private conduct. It is about \n     multiple obstructions of justice, perjury, false and \n     misleading statements, and witness tampering--all committed \n     or orchestrated by the President of the United States.\n       Before addressing the President's lies and obstruction, it \n     is important to place the events in the proper context. If \n     this were only about private sex we would not now be before \n     the Senate. But the manner in which the Lewinsky relationship \n     arose and continued is important because it is illustrative \n     of the character of the President and the decisions he made.\n\n                               Background\n\n       Monica Lewinsky, a 22 year old intern, (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 8; \n     H.Doc. 105-311, p. 728) was working at the White House during \n     the government shutdown in 1995. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 10; H.Doc. \n     105-311, p. 730) Prior to their first intimate encounter, she \n     had never even spoken with the President. Sometime on \n     November 15, 1995, Ms. Lewinsky and President Clinton flirted \n     with each other. (Id.) The President of the United States of \n     America then invited this unknown young intern into a private \n     area off the Oval Office where he kissed her. He then invited \n     her back later and when she returned, the two engaged in the \n     first of many acts of inappropriate contact. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, \n     p. 12; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 732)\n       Thereafter, the two concocted a cover story. If Ms. \n     Lewinsky were seen, she was bringing papers to the President. \n     That story was totally false. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 54; H.Doc. \n     105-311, p. 774; 8/26/98 Dep., p. 34; H.Doc. 105-311, p. \n     1314) The only papers she brought were personal messages \n     having nothing to do with her duties or those of the \n     President. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 54-55; H.Doc. 105-311, pp. \n     774-775) After Ms. Lewinsky moved from the White House to the \n     Pentagon, her frequent visits to the President were disguised \n     as visits to Betty Currie. (Id.) Those cover stories are \n     important, because they play a vital role in the later \n     perjuries and obstructions.\n\n                               Encounters\n\n       Over the term of their relationship the following \n     significant matters occurred:\n       1. Monica Lewinsky and the President were alone on at least \n     twenty-one occasions;\n       2. They had at least eleven personal sexual encounters, \n     excluding phone sex: Three in 1995, Five in 1996 and Three in \n     1997;\n       3. They had at least 55 telephone conversations, at least \n     seventeen of which involved phone sex;\n       4. The President gave Ms. Lewinsky twenty presents; and,\n       5. Ms. Lewinsky gave the President forty presents (O.I.C. \n     Referral, App., Tab E; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 104-111)\n       These are the essential facts which form the backdrop for \n     all of the events that followed.\n       The sexual details of the President's encounters with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, though relevant, need not be detailed either in \n     this document or through witness testimony. It is necessary, \n     though, briefly to outline that evidence, because it will \n     demonstrate that the President repeatedly lied about that \n     sexual relationship in his deposition, before the grand jury, \n     and in his responses to the Judiciary Committee's questions. \n     He has consistently maintained that Ms. Lewinsky merely \n     performed acts on him, while he never touched her in a sexual \n     manner. This characterization not only directly contradicts \n     Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, but it also contradicts the sworn \n     grand jury testimony of three of her friends and the \n     statements by two professional counselors with whom she \n     contemporaneously shared the details of her relationship. \n     (O.I.C. Referral, H. Doc. 105-310, pgs. 138-140)\n       While his treatment of Ms. Lewinsky was offensive, it is \n     much more offensive for the President to expect the Senate to \n     believe that in 1995, 1996, and 1997, his intimate contact \n     with Ms. Lewinsky was so limited that it did not fall within \n     his narrow interpretation of a definition of ``sexual \n     relations''. As later demonstrated, he did not even conceive \n     his interpretation until 1998, while preparing for his grand \n     jury appearance.\n\n                        How To View the Evidence\n\n       We respectfully submit that the evidence and testimony must \n     be viewed as a whole; it cannot be compartmentalized. It is \n     essential to avoid considering each event in isolation, and \n     then treating it separately. Events and words that may seem \n     innocent or even exculpatory in a vacuum may well take on a \n     sinister, or even criminal connotation when observed in the \n     context of the whole plot. For example, everyone agrees that \n     Monica Lewinsky testified ``No one ever told me to lie; \n     nobody ever promised me a job.'' (ML 8/20/98 GJ, p. 105; H. \n     Doc. 105-311, p. 1161)\n       When considered alone this would seem exculpatory. However, \n     in the context of the other evidence, another picture \n     emerges. Of course no one said. ``Now, Monica, you go in \n     there and lie.'' They didn't have to. Ms. Lewinsky knew what \n     was expected of her. Similarly, nobody promised her a job, \n     but once she signed the false affidavit, she got one.\n\n                               The Issue\n\n       The ultimate issue is whether the President's course of \n     conduct is such as to affect adversely the Office of the \n     President and also upon the administration of justice, and \n     whether he has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as \n     President and subversive to the Rule of Law and \n     Constitutional government.\n\n                             The Beginning\n\n       The events that form the basis of these charges actually \n     began in late 1995. They reached a critical stage in the \n     winter of 1997 and the first month of 1998. The event \n     culminated when the President of the United States appeared \n     before a federal grand jury, raised his right hand to God and \n     swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the \n     truth.\n\n\n                           december 5-6, 1997\n\n       On Friday, December 5, 1997, Monica Lewinsky asked Betty \n     Currie if the President could see her the next day, Saturday, \n     but Ms. Currie said that the President was scheduled to meet \n     with his lawyers all day. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 107-108; H. \n     Doc. 105-311, pgs. 827-828) Later that Friday, Ms. Lewinsky \n     spoke briefly to the President at a Christmas party. (ML 7/\n     31/98 Int., p. 1; H. Doc. 105-311, p. 1451; ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. \n     108; H. Doc. 105-311, p. 828)\n\n                      The Witness List Is Received\n\n       That evening, Paula Jones's attorneys faxed a list of \n     potential witnesses to the President's attorneys. (849-DC-\n     00000128; 849-DC-00000121-37; Referral, H. Doc. 105-311, p. \n     88) The list included Monica Lewinsky. However, Ms. Lewinsky \n     did not find out that her name was on the list until the \n     President told her ten days later, on December 17. (ML 8/6/98 \n     GJ, pgs. 121-123; H. Doc. 105-311, pgs. 841-843) That delay \n     is significant.\n\n                       Ms. Lewinsky's First Visit\n\n       After her conversation with Ms. Currie and seeing the \n     President at the Christmas party, Ms. Lewinsky drafted a \n     letter to the President terminating their relationship. (ML-\n     55-DC-0177); ML 7/31/98 Int., p. 2; H. Doc. 105-311, p. 1452) \n     The next morning, Saturday, December 6, Ms. Lewinsky went to \n     the White House to deliver the letter and some gifts for the \n     President to Ms. Currie. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 108-109; H. Doc. \n     105-311, pgs. 828-829) When she arrived at the White House, \n     Ms. Lewinsky spoke to several Secret Service officers, and \n     one of them told her that the President was not with his \n     lawyers, as she thought, but rather, he was meeting with \n     Eleanor Mondale. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 111; H. Doc. 105-311, p. \n     831; Mondale 7/16/98 Int., p. 1; H. Doc. 105-316, pgs. 2907-\n     2908; H. Doc. 105-311, p. 2654) Ms. Lewinsky called Ms. \n     Currie from a pay phone, angrily exchanged words with her, \n     and went home. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 112-13; H. Doc. 105-311, \n     pgs. 832-833; Currie 1/27/98 GJ, p. 27; H. Doc. 105-316, p. \n     553) After that phone call, Ms. Currie told the Secret \n     Service watch commander that the President was so upset about \n     the disclosure of his meeting with Ms. Mondale that he wanted \n     somebody fired. (Purdie 7/23/98 GJ, pgs. 13, 18-19; H. Doc. \n     105-316, pgs. 3356-3357).\n\n                      The Telephone Conversations\n\n       At 12:05 p.m., records demonstrate that Ms. Currie paged \n     Bruce Lindsey with the message: ``Call Betty ASAP.'' (964-DC-\n     00000862;\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\n     H. Doc. 105-311, p. 2722) Around that same time, according to \n     Ms. Lewinsky, while she was back at her apartment, Ms. \n     Lewinsky and the President spoke by phone. The President was \n     very angry; he told Ms. Lewinsky that no one had every \n     treated him as poorly as she had. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 113-14; \n     H. Doc. 105-311, pgs. 833-834) The President acknowledged to \n     the grand jury that he was upset about Ms. Lewinsky's \n     behavior and considered it  inappropriate. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, \n     p. 85; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 537). Nevertheless, in a sudden \n     change of mood, he invited her to visit him at the White \n     House that afternoon. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 114; H.Doc. 105-\n     311, p. 834)\n\n                      Ms. Lewinsky's Second Visit\n\n       Monica Lewinsky arrived at the White House for the second \n     time that day and was cleared to enter at 12:52 p.m. (WAVES: \n     827-DC-00000018) Although, in Ms. Lewinsky's words, the \n     President was ``very angry'' with her during their recent \n     telephone conversation, he was ``sweet'' and ``very \n     affectionate'' during this visit. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 113-15; \n     H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 833-835). He also told her that he would \n     talk to Vernon Jordan about her job situation. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, \n     pgs. 115-16; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 835-836)\n\n                The Discussions With the Secret Service\n\n       The President also suddenly changed his attitude toward the \n     Secret Service. Ms. Currie informed some officers that if \n     they kept quiet about the Lewinsky incident, there would be \n     no disciplinary action. (Williams 7/23/98 GJ, pgs. 25, 27-28; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 4539; Chinery 7/23/98 GJ, p. 22-23; H.Doc. \n     105-316, p. 456). According to the Secret Service watch \n     commander, Captain Jeffrey Purdie, the President personally \n     told him, ``I hope you use your discretion'' or ``I hope I \n     can count on your discretion.'' (Purdie 7/23/98 GJ, p. 32; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 3360; Purdie 7/17/98 GJ, p. 3; H.Doc. 105-\n     316, p. 3353) Deputy Chief Charles O'Malley, Captain Purdie's \n     supervisor, testified that he knew of no other time in his \n     fourteen years of service at the White House where the \n     President raised a performance issue with a member of the \n     Secret Service uniformed division. (O'Malley 9/8/98 Dep., \n     pgs. 40-41; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 3168-3171) After his \n     conversation with the President, Captain Purdie told a number \n     of officers that they should not discuss the Lewinsky \n     incident. (Porter 8/13/98 GJ, p. 12; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 3343; \n     Niedzwiecki 7/30/98 GJ, pgs. 30-31, H.Doc. 105-316, p. 3114)\n       When the President was before the grand jury and questioned \n     about his statements to the Secret Service regarding this \n     incident, the President testified, ``I don't remember what I \n     said and I don't remember to whom I said it.'' (WJC 8/17/98 \n     GJ, p. 86; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 534) When confronted with \n     Captain Purdie's testimony, the President testified, ``I \n     don't remember anything I said to him in that regard. I have \n     no recollection of that whatever.'' (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 91; \n     H.Doc. 105-311, p. 543)\n\n             The President's Knowledge of the Witness List\n\n       President Clinton testified before the grand jury that he \n     learned that Ms. Lewinsky was on the Jones witness list that \n     evening, Saturday, December 6, during a meeting with his \n     lawyers. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 83-84; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 535-\n     536) He stood by this answer in response to Request Number 16 \n     submitted by the Judiciary Committee. (Exhibit 18). The \n     meeting occurred around 5 p.m., after Ms. Lewinsky had left \n     the White House. (WAVES: 1407-DC-00000005; Lindsey 3/12/98 \n     GJ, pgs. 64-66; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 2418-19) According to \n     Bruce Lindsey, at the meeting, Bob Bennett had a copy of the \n     Jones witness list faxed to Mr. Bennett the previous night. \n     (Lindsey 3/12/98 GJ, pgs. 65-67; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 2419) \n     (Exhibit 15)\n       However, during his deposition, the President testified \n     that he had heard about the witness list before he saw it. \n     (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., p. 70) In other words, if the President \n     testified truthfully in his deposition, then he knew about \n     the witness list before the 5 p.m. meeting. It is valid to \n     infer that hearing Ms. Lewinsky's name on a witness list \n     prompted the President's sudden and otherwise unexplained \n     change from ``very angry'' to ``very affectionate'' that \n     Saturday afternoon. It is also reasonable to infer that it \n     prompted him to give the unique instruction to a Secret \n     Service watch commander to use ``discretion'' regarding Ms. \n     Lewinsky's visit to the White House, which the watch \n     commander interpreted as an instruction to refrain from \n     discussing the incident. (Purdie 7/17/98 GJ, pgs. 20-21; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 3351-3352; Purdie 7/23/98 GJ, pgs. 32-\n     33; H.Doc. 105-315, pgs. 3360-3361)\n\n                    The Job Search for Ms. Lewinsky\n\n       Monica Lewinsky had been looking for a good paying and high \n     profile job in New York since the previous July. She was not \n     having much success despite the President's promise to help. \n     In early November, Betty Currie arranged a meeting with \n     Vernon Jordan who was supposed to help. (BC 5/6/98 GJ, p. \n     176; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 592)\n       On November 5, Ms. Lewinsky met for twenty minutes with Mr. \n     Jordan (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pg. 104; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 824) No \n     action followed; no job interviews were arranged and there \n     were no further contacts with Mr. Jordan. It was obvious that \n     he made no effort to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky. Indeed, it \n     was so unimportant to him that he ``had no recollection of an \n     early November meeting'' (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, pg. 50; H.Doc. 105-\n     316, p. 1799) and that finding a job for Ms. Lewinsky was not \n     a priority (VJ 5/5/98 GJ, p. 76; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1804) \n     (Chart R) Nothing happened throughout the month of November, \n     because Mr. Jordan was either gone or would not return \n     Monica's calls. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 105-106; H.Doc. 105-311, \n     pgs. 825-826)\n       During the December 6 meeting with the President, she \n     mentioned that she had not been able to get in touch with Mr. \n     Jordan and that it did not seem he had done anything to help \n     her. The President responded by stating, ``Oh, I'll talk to \n     him. I'll get on it,'' or something to that effect. (ML 8/6/\n     98 GJ, pgs. 115-116; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 836) There was \n     obviously still no urgency to help Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Jordan \n     met the President the next day, December 7, but the meeting \n     was unrelated to Ms. Lewinsky. (VJ 5/5/98 GJ. pgs. 83, 116; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 1805, 1810)\n\n                     The December 11, 1997 Activity\n\n       The first activity calculated to help Ms. Lewinsky actually \n     procure employment took place on December 11. Mr. Jordan met \n     with Ms. Lewinsky and gave her a list of contact names. The \n     two also discussed the President. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 119, \n     120; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 839-840) That meeting Mr. Jordan \n     remembered. (VJ 3/5/98 GJ, p. 41; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1798) \n     Vernon Jordan immediately placed calls to two prospective \n     employers. (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, pgs. 54, 62-63; H.Doc. 105-316, \n     pgs. 1800-1802) Later in the afternoon, he even called the \n     President to give him a report on his job search efforts. (VJ \n     3/3/98 GJ, pgs. 64-66; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1802) Clearly, Mr. \n     Jordan and the President were now very interested in helping \n     Monica find a good job in New York. (VJ 5/5/98 GJ, p. 95; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1807)\n\n                   Significance of December 11, 1997\n\n       This sudden interest was inspired by a court order entered \n     on December 11, 1997. On that date, Judge Susan Webber Wright \n     ordered that Paula Jones was entitled to information \n     regarding any state or federal employee with whom the \n     President had sexual relations, proposed sexual relations, or \n     sought to have sexual relations.\n       The President knew that it would be politically and legally \n     expedient to maintain an amicable relationship with Monica \n     Lewinsky. And the President knew that that relationship would \n     be fostered by finding Ms. Lewinsky a job. This was \n     accomplished through enlisting the help of Vernon Jordan.\n\n         December 17, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky Learns of Witness List\n\n       On December 17, 1997, between 2:00 and 2:30 in the morning, \n     Monica Lewinsky's phone rang unexpectedly. It was the \n     President of the United States. The President said that he \n     wanted to tell Ms. Lewinsky two things: one was that Betty \n     Currie's brother had been killed in a car accident; secondly, \n     the President said that he ``had some more bad news,'' that \n     he had seen the witness list for the Paula Jones case and her \n     name was on it. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 123; H.Doc. 105-311, p. \n     843) The President told Ms. Lewinsky that seeing her name on \n     the list ``broke his heart.'' He then told her that ``if \n     [she] were to be subpoenaed, [she] should contact Betty and \n     let Betty know that [she] had received the subpoena.'' (Id.) \n     Ms. Lewinsky asked what she should do if subpoenaed. The \n     President responded: ``Well, maybe you can sign an \n     affidavit.'' (Id.) Both parties knew that the Affidavit would \n     need to be false and misleading to accomplish the desired \n     result.\n\n                     The President's ``Suggestion''\n\n       Then, the President had a very pointed suggestion for \n     Monica Lewinsky, a suggestion that left little room for \n     compromise. He did not specifically tell her to lie. What he \n     did say is ``you know, you can always say you were coming to \n     see Betty or that you were bringing me letters.'' (ML 8/6/98 \n     GJ, p. 123; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 843)\n       In order to understand the significance of this statement, \n     it is necessary to recall the ``cover stories'' that the \n     President and Ms. Lewinsky had previously structured in order \n     to deceive those who protected and worked with the President.\n       Ms. Lewinsky said she would carry papers when she visited \n     the President. When she saw him, she would say: ``Oh, gee, \n     `here are your letters,' wink, wink, wink and he would \n     answer, `Okay that's good.' '' (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 54; H.Doc. \n     105-311, p. 774) After Ms. Lewinsky left White House \n     employment, she would return to the Oval Office under the \n     guise of visiting Betty Currie, not the President. (ML 8/6/98 \n     GJ, p. 55; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 775)\n       Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky promised the President that she \n     would always deny the sexual relationship and always protect \n     him. The President would respond ``that's good'' or similar \n     language of encouragement. (ML 8/20/98 GJ, p. 22; H.Doc. 105-\n     311, p. 1078)\n       So, when the President called Ms. Lewinsky at 2:00 a.m. on \n     December 17 to tell her she was on the witness list, he made \n     sure to remind her of those prior ``cover stories.'' Ms. \n     Lewinsky testified that when the President brought up the \n     misleading stories, she understood that the two would \n     continue their pre-existing pattern of deception.\n\n                       The President's Intention\n\n       It became clear that the President had no intention of \n     making his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky a public \n     affair. And he would use lies, deceit, and deception to \n     ensure that the truth would not be known.\n       It is interesting to note that when the grand jury asked \n     the President whether he remembered calling Monica Lewinsky \n     at 2:00 a.m., he responded: ``No sir, I don't. But it would . \n     . . it is quite possible that that happened. . . .'' (WJC 8/\n     17/98 GJ, p. 115; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 567)\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\n       And when he was asked whether he encouraged Monica Lewinsky \n     to continue the cover stories of ``coming to see Betty'' or \n     ``bringing the letters,'' he answered: ``I don't remember \n     exactly what I told her that night.'' (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. \n     117; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 565)\n       Six days earlier, he had become aware that Paula Jones' \n     lawyers were now able to inquire about other women. Ms. \n     Lewinsky could file a false affidavit, but it might not work. \n     It was absolutely essential that both parties told the same \n     story. He knew that he would lie if asked about Ms. Lewinsky, \n     and he wanted to make certain that she would lie also. That \n     is why the President of the United States called a twenty-\n     four year old woman at 2:00 in the morning.\n\n                          The Evidence Mounts\n\n       But the President had an additional problem. It was not \n     enough that he (and Ms. Lewinsky) simply deny the \n     relationship. The evidence was beginning to accumulate. \n     Because of the emerging evidence, the President found it \n     necessary to reevaluate his defense. By this time, the \n     evidence was establishing, through records and eyewitness \n     accounts, that the President and Monica Lewinsky were \n     spending a significant amount of time together in the Oval \n     Office complex. It was no longer expedient simply to refer to \n     Ms. Lewinsky as a ``groupie'', ``stalker'', ``clutch'', or \n     ``home wrecker'' as the White House first attempted to do. \n     The unassailable facts were forcing the President to \n     acknowledge some type of relationship. But at this point, he \n     still had the opportunity to establish a non-sexual \n     explanation for their meetings, since his DNA had not yet \n     been identified on Monica Lewinsky's blue dress.\n\n                        Need for the Cover Story\n\n       Therefore, the President needed Monica Lewinsky to go along \n     with the cover story in order to provide an innocent, \n     intimate-free explanation for their frequent meetings. And \n     that innocent explanation came in the form of ``document \n     deliveries'' and ``friendly chats with Betty Currie.''\n       Significantly, when the President was deposed on January \n     17, 1998, he used the exact same cover stories that had been \n     utilized by Ms. Lewinsky. In doing so, he stayed consistent \n     with any future Lewinsky testimony while still maintaining \n     his defense in the Jones lawsuit.\n       In the President's deposition, he was asked whether he was \n     ever alone with Monica Lewinsky. He responded: ``I don't \n     recall . . . She--it seems to me she brought things to me \n     once or twice on the weekends. In that case, whatever time \n     she would be in there, drop it off, exchange a few words and \n     go, she was there.'' (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., p. 52-53)\n       Additionally, when questions were posed regarding Ms. \n     Lewinsky's frequent visits to the Oval Office, the President \n     did not hesitate to mention Betty Currie in his answers, for \n     example:\n\n       And my recollection is that on a couple of occasions after \n     [the pizza party meeting], she was there [in the oval office] \n     but my secretary, Betty Currie, was there with her. (WJC 1/\n     17/98 Dep., p. 58)\n       Q. When was the last time you spoke with Monica Lewinsky?\n       A. I'm trying to remember. Probably sometime before \n     Christmas. She came by to see Betty sometime before \n     Christmas. And she was there talking to her, and I stuck my \n     head out, said hello to her. (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., p. 68)\n\n             December 19, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky Is Subpoenaed\n\n       On December 19, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky was subpoenaed to \n     testify in a deposition scheduled for January 23, 1998 in the \n     Jones case. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 128; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 848) \n     (Charts F and G) Extremely distraught, she immediately called \n     the President's closest friend, Vernon Jordan. As noted Ms. \n     Lewinsky testified that the President previously told her to \n     call Betty Currie if she was subpoenaed. She called Mr. \n     Jordan instead because Ms. Currie's brother recently died and \n     she did not want to bother her. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 128-129; \n     H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 848, 849)\n\n                          Vernon Jordan's Role\n\n       Mr. Jordan invited Ms. Lewinsky to his office and she \n     arrived shortly before 5 p.m., still extremely distraught. \n     Around this time, Mr. Jordan called the President and told \n     him Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed. (VJ 5/5/98 GJ, p. 145; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1815) (Exhibit 1) During the meeting with \n     Ms. Lewinsky, which Mr. Jordan characterized as \n     ``disturbing'' (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, p. 100; H.Doc. 105-316, p. \n     1716), she talked about her infatuation with the President. \n     (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, p. 150; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1724) Mr. Jordan \n     decided that he would call a lawyer for her. (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, \n     p. 161; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1726)\n\n                    Mr. Jordan Informs the President\n\n       That evening, Mr. Jordan met with the President and relayed \n     his conversation with Ms. Lewinsky. The details are extremely \n     important because the President, in his deposition, did not \n     recall that meeting. Mr. Jordan told the President again that \n     Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed, that he was concerned about \n     her fascination with the President, and that Ms. Lewinsky had \n     asked Mr. Jordan if he thought the President would leave the \n     First Lady. He also asked the President if he had sexual \n     relations with Ms. Lewinsky. (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, p. 169; H.Doc \n     105-3316, p. 1727) The President was asked at his deposition:\n\n       Q. Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that \n     Monica Lewinsky had been served with a subpoena in this case?\n       A. I don't think so.\n       Q. Did you ever talk with Monica Lewinsky about the \n     possibility that she might be asked to testify in this case?\n       A. Bruce Lindsey, I think Bruce Lindsey told me that she \n     was, I think maybe that's the first person told me she was. I \n     want to be as accurate as I can.\n\n     (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., pgs. 68-69)\n       In the grand jury, the President first repeated his denial \n     that Mr. Jordan told him Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed. \n     (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 39; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 491) Then, when \n     given more specific facts, he admitted that he ``knows now'' \n     that he spoke with Mr. Jordan about the subpoena on the night \n     of December 19, but his ``memory is not clear. . . .'' (WJC \n     8/17/98 GJ, pgs. 41-42; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 493-494) In an \n     attempt to explain away his false deposition testimony, \n     the President testified in the grand jury that he was \n     trying to remember who told him first. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. \n     41; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 492-493) But that was not the \n     question. So his answer was false and misleading. When one \n     considers the nature of the conversation between the \n     President and Mr. Jordan, the suggestion that it would be \n     forgotten defies common sense.\n\n                           December 28, 1997\n\n       December 28, 1997 is a crucial date, because the evidence \n     shows that the President made false and misleading statements \n     to the federal court, the federal grand jury and the Congress \n     of the United States about the events on that date. (Chart J) \n     It is also a date on which he obstructed justice.\n\n                        The President's Account\n\n       The President testified that it was ``possible'' that he \n     invited Ms. Lewinsky to the White House for this visit. (WJC \n     8/17/98 GJ, p. 33; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 485) He admitted that \n     he ``probably'' gave Ms. Lewinsky the most gifts he had ever \n     given her on that date, (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 35; H.Doc. 105-\n     311, p. 487) and that he had given her gifts on other \n     occasions. (WJC 8/6/98 GJ, p. 35) (Chart D) Among the many \n     gifts the President gave Ms. Lewinsky on December 28 was a \n     bear that he said was a symbol of strength. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. \n     176; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 896) Yet only two-and-a-half weeks \n     later, the President forgot that he had given any gifts to \n     Ms. Lewinsky.\n       As an attorney, the President knew that the law will not \n     tolerate someone who says, ``I don't recall'' when that \n     answer is unreasonable under the circumstances. He also knew \n     that, under those circumstances, his answer in the deposition \n     could not be believed. When asked in the grand jury why he \n     was unable to remember, even though he had given Ms. Lewinsky \n     so many gifts only two-and-a-half weeks before the \n     deposition, the President put forth an obviously contrived \n     explanation.\n\n       ``I think what I meant there was I don't recall what they \n     were, not that I don't recall whether I had given them.''\n\n      (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 51; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 503)\n\n                     Response to Committee Requests\n\n       The President adopted that same answer in Response No. 42 \n     to the House Judiciary Committee's Requests For Admission. \n     (Exhibit 18) He was not asked in the deposition to identify \n     the gifts. He was simply asked, ``Have you ever'' given gifts \n     to Ms. Lewinsky. The law does not allow a witness to insert \n     unstated premises or mental reservations into the question to \n     make his answer technically true, if factually false. The \n     essence of lying is in deception, not in words.\n       The President's answer was false. The evidence also proves \n     that his explanation to the grand jury and to the Committee \n     is also false. The President would have us believe that he \n     was able to analyze questions as they were being asked, and \n     pick up such things as verb tense in an attempt to make his \n     statements at least literally true. But when he was asked a \n     simple, straightforward question, he did not understand it. \n     Neither his answer in the deposition nor his attempted \n     explanation is reasonable or true.\n\n                       Testimony Concerning Gifts\n\n       The President was asked in the deposition if Monica \n     Lewinsky ever gave him gifts. He responded, ``once or \n     twice.'' (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., p. 77) This is also false \n     testimony calculated to obstruct justice. He answered this \n     question in his Response to the House Judiciary Committee by \n     saying that he receives numerous gifts, and he did not focus \n     on the precise number. (Exhibit 18) The law again does not \n     support the President's position. An answer that baldly \n     understates a numerical fact in response to a specific \n     quantitative inquiry can be deemed technically true but \n     actually false. For example, a witness is testifying \n     falsely if he says he went to the store five times when in \n     fact he had gone fifty, even though technically he had \n     also gone five times. So too, when the President answered \n     once or twice in the face of evidence that Ms. Lewinsky \n     was frequently bringing gifts, he was lying. (Chart C)\n\n                          Concealment of Gifts\n\n       On December 28, one of the most blatant efforts to obstruct \n     justice and conceal evidence occurred. Ms. Lewinsky testified \n     that she discussed with the President the fact that she had \n     been subpoenaed and that the subpoena called for her to \n     produce gifts. She recalled telling the President that the \n     subpoena requested a hat pin, and that caused her concern. \n     (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 151-152; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 871-872) \n     The President\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\n     told her that it ``bothered'' him, too. (ML 8/20/98 GJ, p. \n     66; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 1122) Ms. Lewinsky then suggested that \n     she take the gifts somewhere, or give them to someone, maybe \n     to Betty. The President answered: ``I don't know'' or ``Let \n     me think about that.'' (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 152-153; H.Doc. \n     105-311, pgs. 872-873) (Chart L) Later that day, Ms. Lewinsky \n     got a call from Ms. Currie, who said: ``I understand you have \n     something to give me'' or ``the President said you have \n     something to give me.'' (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 154-155; H.Doc. \n     105-311, pgs. 874-875) Ms. Currie has a fuzzy memory about \n     this incident, but says that ``the best she can remember,'' \n     Ms. Lewinsky called her. (Currie 5/6/98 GJ, p. 105; H.Doc. \n     105-316, p. 581)\n\n                         The Cell Phone Record\n\n       There is key evidence that Ms. Currie's fuzzy recollection \n     is wrong. Ms. Lewinsky said that she thought Ms. Currie \n     called from her cell phone. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 154-155) \n     (Chart K, Exhibit 2) Ms. Currie's cell phone record \n     corroborates Ms. Lewinsky and proves conclusively that Ms. \n     Currie called Monica from her cell phone several hours after \n     she had left the White House. Moreover, Ms. Currie herself \n     later testified that Ms. Lewinsky's memory may be better than \n     hers on this point. (BC 5/6/98 GJ, p. 126; H.Doc. 105-316, p. \n     584) The facts prove that the President directed Ms. Currie \n     to pick up the gifts.\n\n                       Ms. Currie's Later Actions\n\n       That conclusion is buttressed by Ms. Currie's actions. If \n     Ms. Lewinsky had placed the call requesting a gift exchange, \n     Ms. Currie would logically ask the reason for such a \n     transfer. Ms. Lewinsky was giving her a box of gifts from the \n     President yet she did not tell the President of this strange \n     request. She simply took the gifts and placed them under her \n     bed without asking a single question. (BC 1/27/98 GJ, pgs. \n     57-58; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 557; BC 5/6/98 GJ, pgs. 105-108, \n     114; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 581-582)\n       The President stated in his Response to questions No. 24 \n     and 25 from the House Committee that he was not concerned \n     about the gifts. (Exhibit 18) In fact, he said that he \n     recalled telling Monica that if the Jones lawyers request \n     gifts, she should turn them over. The President testified \n     that he is ``not sure'' if he knew the subpoena asked for \n     gifts. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, pgs. 42-43; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 494-\n     495) Would Monica Lewinsky and the President discuss turning \n     over gifts to the Jones lawyers if Ms. Lewinsky had not told \n     him that the subpoena asked for gifts? On the other hand, if \n     he knew the subpoena requested gifts, why would he give Ms. \n     Lewinsky more gifts on December 28? Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \n     reveals the answer. She said that she never questioned ``that \n     we were ever going to do anything but keep this private'' and \n     that meant to take ``whatever appropriate steps needed to be \n     taken'' to keep it quiet. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 166; H.Doc. \n     105-311, p. 886) The only logical inference is that the \n     gifts--including the bear symbolizing strength--were a tacit \n     reminder to Ms. Lewinsky that they would deny the \n     relationship--even  in the face of a federal subpoena.\n\n                  The President's Deposition Testimony\n\n       Furthermore, the President, at various times in his \n     deposition, seriously misrepresented the nature of his \n     meeting with Ms. Lewinsky on December 28 in order to obstruct \n     the administration of justice. First, he was asked: ``Did she \n     tell you she had been served with a subpoena in this case?'' \n     The President answered flatly: ``No. I don't know if she had \n     been.'' (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., p. 68)\n       He was also asked if he ``ever talked to Monica Lewinsky \n     about the possibility of her testifying.'' ``I'm not sure . . \n     .,'' he said. he then added that he may have joked to her \n     that the Jones lawyers might subpoena every woman he has ever \n     spoken to, and that ``I don't think we ever had more of a \n     conversation than that about it. . . .'' (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., \n     p. 70) Not only does Monica Lewinsky directly contradict this \n     testimony, but the President also directly contradicted \n     himself before the grand jury. Speaking of his December 28, \n     1997 meeting, he said that he ``knew by then, of course, that \n     she had gotten a subpoena'' and that they had a \n     ``conversation about the possibility of her testifying.'' \n     (WJC 8/17/98 Dep., pgs. 35-36) Remember, he had this \n     conversation about her testimony only two-and-a-half weeks \n     before his deposition. Again, his version is not reasonable.\n\n   January 5-9, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky Signs the Affidavit and Gets a Job\n\n       The President knew that Monica Lewinsky was going to \n     execute a false Affidavit. He was so certain of the content \n     that when she asked if he wanted to see it, he told her no, \n     that he had seen fifteen of them. (ML 8/2/98 Int., p. 3; \n     H.Doc. 105-311, p. 1489) He got his information from \n     discussions with Ms. Lewinsky and Vernon Jordan generally \n     about the content of the Affidavit. Moreover, the President \n     had suggested the Affidavit himself and he trusted Mr. Jordan \n     to be certain the mission was accomplished.\n\n                     Additional Presidential Advice\n\n       In the afternoon of January 5, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky met with \n     her lawyer, Mr. Carter, to discuss the Affidavit. (ML 8/6/98 \n     GJ, p. 192; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 912) Her lawyer asked her some \n     hard questions about how she got her job. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. \n     195; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 915) After the meeting, she called \n     Betty Currie and said that she wanted to speak to the \n     President before she signed anything. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 195; \n     H.Doc. 105-311, p. 915) Ms. Lewinsky and the President \n     discussed the issue of how she would answer under oath if \n     asked about how she got her job at the Pentagon. (ML 8/6/98 \n     GJ, p. 197; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 917) The President told her: \n     ``Well, you could always say that the people in Legislative \n     Affairs got it for you or helped you get it.'' (ML 8/6/98 GJ, \n     p. 197; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 917) That, too, is false and \n     misleading.\n\n                        Vernon Jordan's New Role\n\n       The President was also kept advised as to the contents of \n     the Affidavit by Vernon Jordan. (VJ 5/5/98 GJ, p. 224; H.Doc. \n     105-316, p. 1828) On January 6, 1998, Ms. Lewinsky picked up \n     a draft of the Affidavit from Mr. Carter's office. (ML 8/6/98 \n     GJ, p. 199; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 919) She delivered a copy to \n     Mr. Jordan's office. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 200; H.Doc. 105-311, \n     p. 920) because she wanted Mr. Jordan to look at the \n     Affidavit in the belief that if Vernon Jordan gave his \n     imprimatur, the President would also approve. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, \n     pgs. 194-195; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 914, 915) (Chart M) Ms. \n     Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan conferred about the contents and \n     agreed to delete a paragraph inserted by Mr. Carter which \n     might open a line of questions concerning whether she had \n     been alone with the President. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 200; H.Doc. \n     105-311, p. 920) (Exhibit 3) Mr. Jordan maintained that he \n     had nothing to do with the details of the Affidavit. (VJ 3/5/\n     98 GJ, p. 12; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1735) He admits, though, \n     that he spoke with the President after conferring with Ms. \n     Lewinsky about the changes made to her Affidavit. (VJ 5/5/\n     98 GJ, p. 218; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1827)\n\n                 Ms. Lewinsky Signs the False Affidavit\n\n       The next day, January 7, Monica Lewinsky signed the false \n     Affidavit. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 204-205; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. \n     924-925) (Chart N; Exhibit 12) She showed the executed copy \n     to Mr. Jordan that same day. (VJ 5/5/98 GJ, p. 222; H.Doc. \n     105-316, p. 1828) (Exhibit 4) Mr. Jordan, in turn, notified \n     the President that she signed an affidavit denying a sexual \n     relationship. (VJ 3/5/98 GJ, p. 26; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1739)\n\n                       Ms. Lewinsky Gets the Job\n\n       On January 8, 1998, Mr. Jordan arranged an interview for \n     Ms. Lewinsky with MacAndrews and Forbes in New York. (ML 8/6/\n     98 GJ, p. 206; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 926) The interview went \n     poorly, so Ms. Lewinsky called Mr. Jordan and informed him. \n     (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 206; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 926) Mr. Jordan, \n     who had done nothing to assist Ms. Lewinsky's job search from \n     early November to mid December, then called MacAndrews and \n     Forbes CEO, Ron Perelman, to ``make things happen, if they \n     could happen.'' (VJ 5/5/98 GJ, p. 231; H.Doc. 105-316, p. \n     1829) Mr. Jordan called Ms. Lewinsky back and told her not to \n     worry. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 208-209; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 928-\n     929) That evening, Ms. Lewinsky was called by MacAndrews and \n     Forbes and told that she would be given more interviews the \n     next morning. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 209; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 929)\n       After a series of interviews with MacAndrews and Forbes \n     personnel, she was informally offered a job. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, \n     p. 210; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 930) When Ms. Lewinsky called Mr. \n     Jordan to tell him, he passed the good news on to Betty \n     Currie stating, ``Mission Accomplished.'' (VJ 5/28/98 GJ, p. \n     39; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1898). Later, Mr. Jordan called the \n     President and told him personally. (VJ 5/28/98 GJ, p. 41; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1899) (Chart P)\n\n              The Reason for Mr. Jordan's Unique Behavior\n\n       After Ms. Lewinsky had spent months looking for a job--\n     since July according to the President's lawyers--Vernon \n     Jordan made the critical call to a CEO the day after the \n     false Affidavit was signed. Mr. Perelman testified that Mr. \n     Jordan had never called him before about a job \n     recommendation. (Perelman 4/23/98 Dep., p. 11; H.Doc. 105-\n     316, p. 3281) Mr. Jordan, on the other hand, said that he \n     called Mr. Perelman to recommend for hiring: (1) former Mayor \n     Dinkins of New York; (2) a very talented attorney from Akin \n     Gump; (3) a Harvard business school graduate; and (4) Monica \n     Lewinsky. (VJ 3/5/98 GJ, p. 58-59; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1747) \n     Even if Mr. Perelman's testimony is mistaken, Ms. Lewinsky's \n     qualifications do not compare to those of the individuals \n     previously recommended by Mr. Jordan.\n       Vernon Jordan was well aware that people with whom Ms. \n     Lewinsky worked at the White House did not like her (VJ 3/3/\n     98 GJ, pgs. 43, 59) and that she did not like her Pentagon \n     job. (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, pgs. 43-44; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 1706, \n     1707) Mr. Jordan was asked if at ``any point during this \n     process you wondered about her qualifications for \n     employment?'' He answered: ``No, because that was not my \n     judgment to make.'' (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, p. 44; H.Doc. 105-316, p. \n     1707) Yet, when he called Mr. Perelman the day after she \n     signed the Affidavit, he referred to Ms. Lewinsky as a bright \n     young girl who is ``terrific.'' (Perelman 4/23/98 Dep., p. \n     10; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 3281) Mr. Jordan testified that she \n     had been pressing him for a job and voicing unrealistic \n     expectations concerning positions and salary. (VJ 3/5/98 GJ, \n     pgs. 37-38; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1742) Moreover, she narrated a \n     disturbing story about the President leaving the First Lady, \n     and how the President was not spending enough time with her. \n     Yet, none of that gave Mr. Jordan pause in making \n     the recommendation, especially after Monica was \n     subpoenaed. (VJ 3/3/98 GJ, pgs. 156-157; H.Doc. 105-316, \n     p. 1725)\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\n                 The Importance of the False Affidavit\n\n       Monica Lewinsky's false Affidavit enabled the President, \n     through his attorneys, to assert at his January 17, 1998 \n     deposition ``. . . there is absolutely no sex of any kind in \n     any manner, shape of form with President Clinton. . . .'' \n     (WJC, 1/17/98 Dep., p. 54) When questioned by his own \n     attorney in the deposition, the President stated specifically \n     that paragraph 8 of Ms. Lewinsky's Affidavit was ``absolutely \n     true.'' (WJC, 1/17/98 Dep., p. 204) The President later \n     affirmed the truth of that statement when testifying before \n     the grand jury. (WJC, 8/17/98 GJ, p. 20-21; H.Doc. 105-311, \n     pg. 473) Paragraph 8 of Ms. Lewinsky's Affidavit states:\n\n       ``I have never had a sexual relationship with the \n     President, he did not propose that we have a sexual \n     relationship, he did not offer me employment or other \n     benefits in exchange for a sexual relationship, he did not \n     deny me employment or other benefits for rejecting a sexual \n     relationship.''\n\n       Significantly, Ms. Lewinsky reviewed the draft Affidavit on \n     January 6, and signed it on January 7 after deleting a \n     reference to being alone with the President. She showed a \n     copy of the signed Affidavit to Vernon Jordan, who called the \n     President and told him that she had signed it. (VJ, 3/5/98 \n     GJ, pgs. 24-26; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 1728, 1739; VJ, 5/5/98 \n     GJ, p. 222; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1828)\n\n                     The Rush To File the Affidavit\n\n       For the affidavit to work for the President in precluding \n     questions by the Jones attorneys concerning Ms. Lewinsky, it \n     had to be filed with the Court and provided to the \n     President's attorneys in time for his deposition on January \n     17. On January 14, the President's lawyers called Ms. \n     Lewinsky's lawyer and left a message, presumably to find out \n     if he had filed the Affidavit with the Court. (Carrier 6/18/\n     98 GJ, p. 123; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 423) (Chart O) On January \n     15, the President's attorneys called her attorney twice. When \n     they finally reached him, they requested a copy of the \n     Affidavit and asked him, ``Are we still on time?'' (Carter 6/\n     18/98 GJ, p. 123; H.Doc. 105-216, p. 423) Ms. Lewinsky's \n     lawyer faxed a copy on the 15th. (Carter 6/18/98 GJ, p. 123, \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 423) The President's counsel was aware of \n     its contents and used it powerfully in the deposition.\n       Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer called the court in Arkansas twice on \n     January 15 to ensure that the Affidavit could be filed on \n     Saturday, January 17. (Carter 6/18/98 GJ, pgs. 124-125; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 423-424) (Exhibit 5) He finished the \n     Motion to Quash Ms. Lewinsky's deposition in the early \n     morning hours of January 16 and mailed it to the Court \n     with the false Affidavit attached, for Saturday delivery. \n     (Carter 6/18/98 GJ, p. 134; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 426) The \n     President's lawyers left him another message on January \n     16, saying, ``You'll know what it's about.'' (Carter 6/18/\n     98 GJ, p. 135; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 426) Obviously, the \n     President needed that Affidavit to be filed with the Court \n     to support his plans to mislead Ms. Jones' attorneys in \n     the deposition, and thereby obstruct justice.\n\n                          The Newsweek Inquiry\n\n       On January 15, Michael Isikoff of Newsweek called Betty \n     Currie and asked her about Ms. Lewinsky sending gifts to her \n     by courier. (BC 5/6/98 GJ, p. 123; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 584; ML \n     8/6/98 GJ, p. 228; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 948) Ms. Currie than \n     called Ms. Lewinsky and told her about it. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. \n     228-229; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 948-949) The President was out \n     of town, so later, Betty Currie called Ms. Lewinsky back, and \n     asked for a ride to Mr. Jordan's office. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. \n     229; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 949; Currie 5/6/98 GJ, p. 130-131; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 585) Mr. Jordan advised her to speak with \n     Bruce Lindsey and Mike McCurry. (VJ 3/5/98 GJ, p. 71) Ms. \n     Currie testified that she spoke immediately to Mr. Lindsey \n     about Isikoff's call. (BC 5/6/98 GJ, p. 127; H.Doc. 105-316, \n     p. 584)\n\n                 January 17, 1998, Deposition Aftermath\n\n       By the time the President concluded his deposition on \n     January 17, he knew that someone was talking about his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He also knew that the only \n     person who had personal knowledge was Ms. Lewinsky herself. \n     The cover stories that he and Ms. Lewinsky created, and that \n     he used himself during the deposition, were now in jeopardy. \n     It became imperative that he not only contact Ms. Lewinsky, \n     but that he obtain corroboration of his account of the \n     relationship from his trusted secretary, Ms. Currie. At \n     around 7 p.m. on the night of the deposition, the President \n     called Ms. Currie and asked that she come in the following \n     day, Sunday. (BC 7/22/98 GJ, p. 154-155; H.Doc. 105-316, p. \n     701 (Exhibit 6) Ms. Currie could not recall the President \n     ever before calling her that late at home on a Saturday \n     night. (BC 1/27/98 GJ, p. 69; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 559) (Chart \n     S) Sometime in the early morning hours of January 18, 1998, \n     the President learned of a news report concerning Ms. \n     Lewinsky released earlier that day. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 142-\n     143; H.Doc. 105-311, pgs. 594-595) (Exhibit 14)\n\n              The Tampering With the Witness, Betty Currie\n\n       As the charts indicate, between 11:49 a.m. and 2:55 p.m., \n     there were three phone calls between Mr. Jordan and the \n     President. (Exhibit 7) At about 5 p.m., Ms. Currie met with \n     the President. (BC 1/27/98 GJ, p. 67; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 558) \n     He told her that he had just been deposed and that the \n     attorneys asked several questions about Monica Lewinsky. (BC \n     1/27/98 GJ, p. 69-70; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 559) He then made a \n     series of statements to Ms. Currie: (Chart T)\n\n       (1) I was never really alone with Monica, right?\n       (2) You were always there when Monica was there, right?\n       (3) Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?\n       (4) You could see and hear everything, right?\n       (5) She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.\n\n     (BC 1/27/98 GJ, pgs. 70-75; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 559-560; BC \n     7/22/98 GJ, pgs. 6-7; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 664)\n       During Betty Currie's grand jury testimony, she was asked \n     whether she believed that the President wished her to agree \n     with the statements:\n\n       Q. Would it be fair to say, then--based on the way he \n     stated [these five points] and the demeanor that he was using \n     at the time that he stated it to you--that he wished you to \n     agree with that statement?\n       A. I can't speak for him, but----\n       Q. How did you take it? Because you told us at these \n     [previous] meetings in the last several days that that is how \n     you took it.\n       A. [Nodding.]\n       Q. And you're nodding you head, ``yes,'' is that correct?\n       A. That's correct.\n       Q. Okay, with regard to the statement that the President \n     made to you, ``You remember I was never really alone with \n     Monica, right?'' Was that also a statement that, as far as \n     you took, that he wished you to agree with that?\n       A. Correct.\n\n     (BC 1/27/98 GJ, p. 74; H.Doc. 105-316, 559)\n       Though Ms. Currie would later intimate that she did not \n     necessarily feel pressured by the President, she did state \n     that she felt the President was seeking her agreement (or \n     disagreement) with those statements. (BC 7/22/98 GJ, p. 27; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 669)\n\n                    Was This Obstruction of Justice?\n\n       The President essentially admitted to making these \n     statements when he knew they were not true. Consequently, he \n     had painted himself into a legal corner. Understanding the \n     seriousness of the President ``coaching'' Ms. Currie, the \n     argument has been made that those statements to her could not \n     constitute obstruction because she had not been subpoenaed, \n     and the President did not know that she was a potential \n     witness at the time. This argument is refuted by both the law \n     and the facts.\n       The United States Court of Appeals rejected this argument, \n     and stated, ``[A] person may be convicted of obstructing \n     justice if he urges or persuades a prospective witness to \n     give false testimony. Neither must the target be scheduled to \n     testify at the time of the offense, nor must he or she \n     actually give testimony at a later time.'' United States v. \n     Shannon, 836 F.2d 1125, 1128 (8th Cir. 1988) (citing, e.g., \n     United States v. Friedland, 660 F.2d 919, 931 (3rd Cir. \n     1981)).\n       Of course Ms. Currie was a prospective witness, and the \n     President clearly wanted her to be deposed to corroborate \n     him, as his testimony demonstrates. The President claims that \n     he called Ms. Currie into work on a Sunday night only to find \n     out what she knew. But the President knew the truth about his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and if he had told the truth \n     during his deposition the day before, then he would have no \n     reason to worry about what Ms. Currie knew. More importantly, \n     the President's demeanor, Ms. Currie's reaction to his \n     demeanor, and the blatant lies that he suggested clearly \n     prove that the President was not merely interviewing Ms. \n     Currie. Rather, he was looking for corroboration for his \n     false cover-up, and that is why he coached her.\n\n                January 18, the Search for Ms. Lewinsky\n\n       Very soon after his Sunday meeting with Ms. Currie, at 5:12 \n     p.m., the flurry of telephone calls in search of Monica \n     Lewinsky began. (Chart S) between 5:12 p.m. and 8:28 p.m., \n     Ms. Currie paged Ms. Lewinsky four times. ``Kay'' is a \n     reference to a code name Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie agreed \n     to when contacting one another. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 216; H.Doc. \n     105-311, pg. 936) At 11:02 p.m., the President called Ms. \n     Currie at home to ask if she had reached Lewinsky. (BC 7/22/\n     98 GJ, p. 160; H. Doc. 105-316, p. 702)\n\n                    January 19, the Search Continues\n\n       The following morning, January 19, Ms. Currie continued to \n     work diligently on behalf of the President. Between 7:02 a.m. \n     and 8:41 a.m., she paged Ms. Lewinsky another five times. \n     (Chart S) (Exhibit 8) After the 8:41 page, Ms. Currie called \n     the President at 8:43 a.m. and said that she was unable to \n     reach Ms. Lewinsky. (BC 7/22/98 GJ, pgs. 161-162; H.Doc. 105-\n     316, p. 703) One minute later, at 8:44 a.m., she again paged \n     Ms. Lewinsky. This time Ms. Currie's page stated ``Family \n     Emergency,'' apparently in an attempt to alarm Ms. Lewinsky \n     into calling back. That may have been the President's idea, \n     since Ms. Currie had just spoken with him. The President was \n     obviously quite concerned because he called Betty Currie only \n     six minutes later, at 8:50 a.m. Immediately thereafter, at \n     8:51 a.m., Ms. Currie tried a different tact, sending the \n     message: ``Good news.'' Again, perhaps at the President's \n     suggestion. If bad news does not get her to call, try good \n     news. Ms. Currie said that she was trying to encourage Ms. \n     Lewinsky to call, but there was no sense of ``urgency.'' (BC \n     7/22/98 GJ, p. 165; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 704) Ms. Currie's \n     recollection of why she was calling was again fuzzy. She said \n     at one point that\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\n     she believes the President asked her to call Ms. Lewinsky, \n     and she thought she was calling just to tell her that her \n     name came up in the deposition. (BC 7/22/98 GJ, p. 162; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 703) Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed; \n     of course her name came up in the deposition. There was \n     obviously another and more important reason the President \n     needed to get in touch with her.\n\n         Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky's Lawyers Join the Search\n\n       At 8:56 a.m., the President telephoned Vernon Jordan, who \n     then joined in the activity. Over a course of twenty-four \n     minutes, from 10:29 to 10:53 a.m., Mr. Jordan called the \n     White House three times, paged Ms. Lewinsky, and called Ms. \n     Lewinsky's attorney, Frank Carter. Between 10:53 a.m. and \n     4:54 p.m., there are continued calls between Mr. Jordan, Ms. \n     Lewinsky's attorney and individuals at the White House.\n\n                    Ms. Lewinsky Replaces Her Lawyer\n\n       Later that afternoon, at 4:54 p.m., Mr. Jordan called Mr. \n     Carter. Mr. Carter relayed that he had been told he no longer \n     represented Ms. Lewinsky. (VJ 3/5/98 GJ, p. 141; H.Doc. 105-\n     316, p. 1771) Mr. Jordan then made feverish attempts to reach \n     the President or someone at the White House to tell them the \n     bad news, as represented by the six calls between 4:58 p.m. \n     and 5:22 p.m. Vernon Jordan said that he tried to relay this \n     information to the White House because ``[t]he President \n     asked me to get Monica Lewinsky a job,'' and he thought it \n     was ``information that they ought to have.'' (VJ 6/9/98 GJ, \n     pgs. 45-46; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1968) (Chart Q) Mr. Jordan \n     then called Mr. Carter back at 5:14 p.m. to go over what they \n     had already talked about. (VJ 3/5/98 GJ, p. 146; H.Doc. 104-\n     316, p. 1772) Mr. Jordan finally reached the President at \n     5:56 p.m. and told him that Mr. Carter had been fired. (VJ 6/\n     9/98 GJ, p. 54; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 1970)\n\n                    The Reason for the Urgent Search\n\n       This activity shows how important it was for the President \n     of the United States to find Monica Lewinsky to learn to whom \n     she was talking. Betty Currie was in charge of contacting Ms. \n     Lewinsky. The President had just completed a deposition in \n     which he provided false and misleading testimony about his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. She was a co-conspirator in \n     hiding this relationship from the Jones attorneys, and he was \n     losing control over her. The President never got complete \n     control over her again.\n\n     Article I.--False and Misleading Statements to the Grand Jury\n\n       Article I addresses the President's perjurious, false, and \n     misleading testimony to the grand jury. Four categories of \n     false grand jury testimony are listed in the Article. Some \n     salient examples of false statements are described below. \n     When judging the statements made and the answers given, it is \n     vital to recall that the President spent literally days \n     preparing his testimony with his lawyer. He and his attorney \n     were fully aware that the testimony would center around his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his deposition testimony \n     in the Jones case.\n\n                          Grand Jury Testimony\n\n       On August 17, after six invitations, the President of the \n     United States appeared before a grand jury of his fellow \n     citizens and took an oath to tell the complete truth. The \n     President proceeded to equivocate and engage in legalistic \n     fencing; he also lied. The entire testimony was calculated to \n     mislead and deceive the grand jury and to obstruct its \n     process, and eventually to deceive the American people. He \n     set the tone at the very beginning. In the grand jury a \n     witness can tell the truth, lie or assert his privileges \n     against self incrimination. (Chart Y) President Clinton was \n     given a fourth choice. The President was permitted to read a \n     statement. (Chart Z; WJC 8/17/98 GJ, pgs. 8-9)\n\n                   The President's Prepared Statement\n\n       That statement itself is demonstrably false in \n     many particulars. President Clinton claims that he engaged \n     in inappropriate conduct with Ms. Lewinsky ``on certain \n     occasions in early 1996 and once in 1997.'' Notice he did \n     not mention 1995. There was a reason. On three \n     ``occasions'' in 1995, Ms. Lewinsky said she engaged in \n     sexual contact with the President. Ms. Lewinsky was a \n     twenty-one year old intern at the time.\n       The President unlawfully attempted to conceal his three \n     visits alone with Ms. Lewinsky in 1995 during which they \n     engaged in sexual conduct. (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 27-28; H.Doc. \n     105-311, pgs. 747-748; ML 8/6/98 GJ, Ex. 7; H.Doc. 105-311, \n     p. 1251; Chart A) Under Judge Wright's ruling, this evidence \n     was relevant and material to Paula Jones' sexual harassment \n     claims. (Order, Judge Susan Webber Wright, December 11, 1997, \n     p. 3)\n       The President specifically and unequivocally states, ``[The \n     encounters] did not constitute sexual relations as I \n     understood that term to be defined at my January 17, 1998 \n     deposition.'' That assertion is patently false. It is \n     directly contradicted by the corroborated testimony of Monica \n     Lewinsky. (See eg: ML 8/20/98 GJ, pgs. 31-32; H.Doc. 311, p. \n     1174; ML 8/26/98 Dep., p. 25, 30; H.Doc. 311, pgs. 1357, \n     1358)\n       Evidence indicates that the President and Ms. Lewinsky \n     engaged in ``sexual relations'' as the President understood \n     the term to be defined at his deposition and as any \n     reasonable person would have understood the term to have been \n     defined.\n       Contrary to his statement under oath, the President's \n     conduct during the 1995 visits and numerous additional visits \n     did constitute ``sexual relations'' as he understood the term \n     to be defined at his deposition. Before the grand jury, the \n     President admitted that directly touching or kissing another \n     person's breast, or directly touching another person's \n     genitalia with the intent to arouse, would be ``sexual \n     relations'' as the term was defined. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, pgs. \n     94-95; H.Doc 105-311, pgs. 546-547) However, the President \n     maintained that he did not engage in such conduct. (Id.) \n     These statements are contradicted by Ms. Lewinsky's testimony \n     and the testimony of numerous individuals with whom she \n     contemporaneously shared the details of her encounters with \n     the President. Moreover, the theory that Ms. Lewinsky \n     repeated and unilaterally performed acts on the President \n     while he tailored his conduct to fit a contorted definition \n     of ``sexual relations'' which he had not contemplated at the \n     time of the acts, defies common sense.\n       Moreover, the President had not even formed the contorted \n     interpretation of ``sexual relations'' which he asserted in \n     the grand jury until after his deposition had concluded. This \n     is demonstrated by the substantial evidence revealing the \n     President's state of mind during his deposition testimony. \n     First, the President continuously denied at his deposition \n     any fact that would cause the Jones lawyers to believe that \n     he and Ms. Lewinsky had any type of improper relationship, \n     including a denial that they had a sexual affair, (WJC 1/17/\n     98 Dep., p. 78) not recalling if they were ever alone, (WJC \n     1/17/98 Dep., pgs. 52-53, 59) and not recalling whether Ms. \n     Lewinsky had ever given him gifts. (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., pg. 75) \n     Second, the President testified that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit \n     denying a sexual relationship was ``absolutely true'' when, \n     even by his current reading of the definition, it is \n     absolutely false. (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., p. 204) Third, the White \n     House produced a document entitled ``January 24, 1998 Talking \n     Points,'' stating flatly that the President's definition of \n     ``sexual relations'' included oral sex. (Chart W) Fourth, the \n     President made statements to staff members soon after the \n     deposition, saying that he did not have sexual relations, \n     including oral sex, with Ms. Lewinsky, (Podesta 6/16/98 GJ, \n     pg. 92; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 3311) and that she threatened to \n     tell people she and the President had an affair when he \n     rebuffed her sexual advances. (Blumenthal 6/4/98 GJ, p. 59; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 185) Fifth, President Clinton's Answer \n     filed in Federal District Court in response to Paula Jones' \n     First Amended Complaint states unequivocally that ``President \n     Clinton denies that he engaged in any improper conduct with \n     respect to plaintiff or any other woman.'' (Answer of \n     Defendant William Jefferson Clinton, December 17, 1997, p. 8, \n     para. 39) Sixth, in President Clinton's sworn Answers to \n     Interrogatories Numbers 10 and 11, as amended, he flatly \n     denied that he had sexual relations with any federal \n     employee. The President filed this Answer prior to his \n     deposition. Finally, as described below, the President sat \n     silently while his attorney, referring to Ms. Lewinsky's \n     affidavit, represented to the court that there was no sex of \n     any kind or in any manner between the President and Ms. \n     Lewinsky. (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., pg. 54)\n       This circumstantial evidence reveals the President's state \n     of mind at the time of the deposition: his concern was not in \n     technically or legally accurate answers, but in categorically \n     denying anything improper. His grand jury testimony about his \n     state of mind during the deposition is false.\n\n                    Reasons for the False Testimony\n\n       The President did not lie to the grand jury to protect \n     himself from embarrassment, as he could no longer deny the \n     affair. Before his grand jury testimony, the President's \n     semen had been identified by laboratory tests on Ms. \n     Lewinsky's dress, and during his testimony, he admitted an \n     ``inappropriate intimate relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky, \n     In fact, when he testified before the grand jury, he was \n     only hours away from admitting the affair on national \n     television. Embarrassment was inevitable. But, if he \n     truthfully admitted the details of his encounters with Ms. \n     Lewinsky to the grand jury, he would be acknowledging that \n     he lied under oath during his deposition when he claimed \n     that he did not engage in sexual relations with Ms. \n     Lewinsky. (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., pgs. 78, 109, 204) Instead, \n     he chose to lie, not to protect his family or the dignity \n     of his office, but to protect himself from criminal \n     liability for his perjury in the Jones case.\n\n              Additional Falsity in the Prepared Statement\n\n       The President's statement continued, ``I regret that what \n     began as a friendship came to include this conduct [.]'' (WJC \n     8/17/98 GJ, p. 9; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 461) The truth is much \n     more troubling. As Ms. Lewinsky testified, her relationship \n     with the President began with flirting, including Ms. \n     Lewinsky showing the President her underwear. (ML 7/30/98 \n     Int., p. 5; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 1431) As Ms. Lewinsky candidly \n     admitted, she was surprised that the President remembered her \n     name after their first two sexual encounters. (ML 8/26/98 \n     Dep., p. 25; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 1295)\n\n                         Reason for the Falsity\n\n       The President's prepared statement, fraught with untruths, \n     was not an answer the President delivered extemporaneously to \n     a particular question. It was carefully drafted testimony \n     which the President read and relied upon throughout his \n     deposition. The President attempted to use the statement to \n     foreclose questioning on an incriminating topic on nineteen \n     separate occasions. Yet,\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\n     this prepared testimony, which along with other testimony \n     provides the basis for Article I, Item 1, actually \n     contradicts his sworn deposition testimony.\n\n                     Contrary Deposition Testimony\n\n       In this statement, the President admits that he and Ms. \n     Lewinsky were alone on a number of occasions. He refused to \n     make this admission in his deposition in the Jones case. \n     During the deposition, the following exchange occurred:\n\n       Q. Mr. President, before the break, we were talking about \n     Monica Lewinsky. At any time were you and Monica Lewinsky \n     together alone in the Oval Office?\n       A. I don't recall, but as I said, when she worked in the \n     legislative affairs office, they always had somebody there on \n     the weekends. I typically work some on the weekends. \n     Sometimes they'd bring me things on the weekends. She--it \n     seems to me she brought things to me once or twice on the \n     weekends. In that case, whatever time she would be in there, \n     drop if off, exchange a few words and go, she was there. I \n     don't have any specific recollections of what the issues \n     were, what was going on, but when the Congress is there, \n     we're working all the time, and typically I would do some \n     work on One of the days of the weekends in the afternoon.\n       Q. So I understand, your testimony is that it was possible, \n     then, that you were alone with her, but you have no specific \n     recollection of that ever happening?\n       A. Yes, that's correct. It's possible that she, in, while \n     she was working there, brought something to me and that at \n     the time she brought it to me, she was the only person there. \n     That's possible.\n\n     (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., pgs. 52-53)\n       After telling this verbose lie under oath, the President \n     was given an opportunity to correct himself. This exchange \n     followed:\n\n       Q. At any time have you and Monica Lewinsky ever been alone \n     together in any room in the White House?\n       A. I think I testified to that earlier. I think that there \n     is a, it is--I have no specific recollection, but it seems to \n     me that she was on duty on a couple of occasions working for \n     the legislative affairs office and brought me some things to \n     sign, something on the weekend. That's--I have a general \n     memory of that.\n       Q. Do you remember anything that was said in any of those \n     meetings?\n       A. No. You know, we just had conversation, I don't \n     remember.\n\n     (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., pgs. 52-53)\n       Before the grand jury, the President maintained that he \n     testified truthfully at his deposition, a lie which provides, \n     in part, the basis for Article I, Item 2. He stated, ``My \n     goal in this deposition was to be truthful, but not \n     particularly helpful . . . I was determined to walk through \n     the mind field of this deposition without violating the law, \n     and I believe I did.'' (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 80; H.Doc. 105-\n     311, p. 532) But contrary to his deposition testimony, he \n     certainly was along with Ms. Lewinsky when she was not \n     delivering papers, as the President conceded in his prepared \n     grand jury statement.\n       In other words, the President's assertion before the grand \n     jury that he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky, but that he \n     testified truthfully in his deposition, in inconsistent. Yet, \n     to this day, both the President and his attorneys have \n     insisted that he did not lie at his deposition and that he \n     did not lie when he swore under oath that he did not lie at \n     his deposition.\n       In addition to his lie about not recalling being alone with \n     Ms. Lewinsky, the President told numerous other lies at his \n     deposition. All of those lies are incorporated in Article I, \n     Item 2.\n\n                Testimony Concerning the False Affidavit\n\n       Article I, Item 3 charges the President with providing \n     perjurious, false and misleading testimony before a federal \n     grand jury concerning false and misleading statements his \n     attorney Robert Bennett made to Judge Wright at the \n     President's deposition. In one statement, while objecting to \n     questions regarding Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Bennett misled the \n     Court, perhaps knowingly, stating, ``Counsel [for Ms. Jones] \n     is fully aware that Ms. Lewinsky has filed, has an affidavit \n     which they are in possession of saying that there is \n     absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form, \n     with President Clinton[.]'' (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., pgs. 53-54) \n     When Judge Wright interrupted Mr. Bennett and expressed her \n     concern that he might be coaching the President, Mr. Bennett \n     responded, ``In preparation of the witness for this \n     deposition, the witness is fully aware of Ms. Lewinsky's \n     affidavit, so I have not told him a single thing he doesn't \n     know[.]'' (WJC 1/17/98 Dep., p. 54) (Emphasis added)\n       When asked before the grand jury about his statement to \n     Judge Wright, the President testified, ``I'm not even sure I \n     paid attention to what he was saying,'' (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. \n     24; H.Doc. 105-3131, p. 476) He added, ``I didn't pay much \n     attention to this conversation, which is why, when you \n     started asking me about this, I asked to see the \n     deposition.'' (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 24; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 477) \n     Finally, ``I don't believe I ever even focused on what Mr. \n     Bennett said in the exact words he did until I started \n     reading this transcript carefully for this hearing. That \n     moment, the whole argument just passed me by.'' (WJC 8/17/98 \n     GJ, p. 29; H. Doc. 105-311, p. 481)\n       This grand jury testimony defies common sense. During his \n     deposition testimony, the President admittedly misled Ms. \n     Jones' attorneys about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, which \n     continued while Ms. Jones' lawsuit was pending, because he \n     did not want the truth to be known. Of course, when Ms. \n     Lewinsky's name is mentioned during the deposition, \n     particularly in connection with sex, the President is going \n     to listen. Any doubts as to whether he listened to Mr. \n     Bennett's representations are eliminated by watching the \n     videotape of the President's deposition. The videotape shows \n     the President looking directly at Mr. Bennett, paying close \n     attention to his argument to Judge Wright.\n\n           False Testimony Concerning Obstruction of Justice\n\n       Article I, Item 4 concerns the President's grand jury \n     perjury regarding his efforts to influence the testimony of \n     witnesses and his efforts to impede discovery in the Jones  \n     v. Clinton lawsuit. These lies are perhaps the most \n     troubling, as the President used them in an attempt to \n     conceal his criminal actions and the abuse of his office.\n       For example, the President testified before the grand jury \n     that he recalled telling Ms. Lewinsky that if Ms. Jones' \n     lawyers requested the gifts exchanged between Ms. Lewinsky \n     and the President, she should provide them. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, \n     p. 43; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 495) He stated, ``And I told her \n     that if they asked her for gifts, she'd have to give them \n     whatever she had, that that's what the law was.'' (Id.) This \n     testimony is false, as demonstrated by both Ms. Lewinsky's \n     testimony and common sense.\n       Ms. Lewinsky testified that on December 28, 1997, she \n     discussed with the President the subpoena's request for her \n     to produce gifts, including a hat pin. She told the President \n     that it concerned her, (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 151; H.Doc. 105-311, \n     p. 871) and he said that it ``bothered'' him too. (ML 8/20/98 \n     GJ, p. 66; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 1122) Ms. Lewinsky then \n     suggested that she give the gifts to someone, maybe to Betty. \n     But rather than instructing her to turn the gifts over to Ms. \n     Jones' attorneys, the President replied, ``I don't know'' or \n     ``Let me think about that.'' (ML 8/6/98 GJ, p. 152; H.Doc. \n     105-311, p. 872) Several hours later, Ms. Currie called Ms. \n     Lewinsky on her cellular phone and said, ``I understand you \n     have something to give me'' or ``the President said you have \n     something to give me.'' (ML 8/6/98 GJ, pgs. 154-155; H.Doc. \n     105-311, pgs. 874-875)\n       Although Ms. Currie agrees that she picked up the gifts \n     from Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Currie testified that ``the best'' she \n     remembers is that Ms. Lewinsky called her. (BC 5/6/98 GJ, p. \n     105; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 581) She later conceded that Ms. \n     Lewinsky's memory may be better than hers on this point. (BC \n     5/6/98 GJ, p. 126; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 584) A telephone record \n     corroborates Ms. Lewinsky, revealing that Ms. Currie did call \n     her from her cellular phone several hours after Ms. \n     Lewinsky's meeting with the President. The only logical \n     reason Ms. Currie called Ms. Lewinsky to retrieve gifts from \n     the President is that the President told her to do so. He \n     would not have given this instruction if he wished the gifts \n     to be given to Ms. Jones' attorneys.\n\n                    Testimony Concerning Ms. Currie\n\n       The President again testified falsely when he told the \n     grand jury that he was simply trying to ``refresh'' his \n     recollection when he made a series of statements to Ms. \n     Currie the day after his deposition. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 131; \n     H.Doc. 105-311, p. 583) Ms. Currie testified that she met \n     with the President at about 5:00 P.M. on January 18, 1998, \n     and he proceeded to make these statements to her:\n\n       (1) I was never really alone with Monica, right?\n       (2) You were always there when Monica was there, right?\n       (3) Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?\n       (4) You could see and hear everything, right?\n       (5) She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.\n\n     (BC 1/27/98 GJ, pgs. 70-75; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 559-560; BC \n     7/22/98 GJ, pgs. 6-7; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 664)\n       Ms. Currie testified that these were more like statements \n     than questions, and that, as far as she understood, the \n     President wanted her to agree with the statements. (BC 1/27/\n     98 GJ, p. 74; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 559)\n       The President was asked specifically about these statements \n     before the grand jury. He did not deny them, but said that he \n     was ``trying to refresh [his] memory about what the facts \n     were.'' (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 131; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 583) He \n     added that he wanted to ``know what Betty's memory was about \n     what she heard,'' (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 54; H.Doc. 105-316, p. \n     506) and that he was ``trying to get as much information as \n     quickly as [he] could.'' (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 56; H.Doc. 105-\n     311, p. 508) Logic demonstrates that the President's \n     explanation is contrived and false.\n       A person does not refresh his recollection by firing \n     declarative sentences dressed up as leading questions to his \n     secretary. If the President was seeking information, he would \n     have asked Ms. Currie what she recalled. Additionally, a \n     person does not refresh his recollection by asking questions \n     concerning factual scenarios of which the listener was \n     unaware, or worse, of which the declarant and the listener \n     knew were false. How would Ms. Currie know if she was always \n     there when Ms. Lewinsky was there? Ms. Currie, in fact, \n     acknowledged during her grand jury testimony that Ms. \n     Lewinsky could have visited the President at the White House \n     when Ms. Currie was not there. (BC 7/22/98 GJ, pgs.\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\n     65-66; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 679) Ms. Currie also testified that \n     there were several occasions when the President and Ms. \n     Lewinsky were in the Oval Office or study area without anyone \n     else present. (BC 1/27/98 GJ, pgs. 32-33, 36-38; H.Doc. 105-\n     316, pgs. 552-553)\n       More importantly, the President admitted in his statement \n     to the grand jury that he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on \n     several occasions. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, pgs. 9-10; H.Doc. 105-\n     311, pgs. 460-461) Thus, by his own admission, his statement \n     to Ms. Currie about never being alone with Ms. Lewinsky was \n     false. And if they were alone together, Ms. Currie certainly \n     could not say whether the President touched Ms. Lewinsky or \n     not.\n       The statement about whether Ms. Currie could see and hear \n     everything is also refuted by the President's own grand jury \n     testimony. During his ``intimate'' encounters with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, he ensured everyone, including Ms. Currie, was \n     excluded. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 53; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 505) Why \n     would someone refresh his recollection by making a false \n     statement of fact to a subordinate? The answer is obvious--he \n     would not.\n       Lastly, the President stated in the grand jury that he was \n     ``downloading'' information in a ``hurry,'' apparently \n     explaining that he made these statements because he did not \n     have time to listen to answers to open-ended questions. (WJC \n     8/17/98 GJ, p. 56; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 508) But, if he was in \n     such a hurry, why did the President not ask Ms. Currie to \n     refresh his recollection when he spoke with her on the \n     telephone the previous evening? He also has no adequate \n     explanation as to why he could not spend an extra five or 10 \n     minutes with Ms. Currie on January 18 to get her version of \n     the events. In fact, Ms. Currie testified that she first met \n     the President on January 18 while he was on the White House \n     putting green, and he told her to go into the office and he \n     would be in in a few minutes. (BC 1/27/98 GJ, pgs. 67-70; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 558-559) And if he was in such a hurry, \n     why did he repeat these statements to Ms. Currie a few days \n     later? (BC 1/27/98 GJ, pgs. 80-81; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 560-\n     561) The reason for these statements had nothing to do with \n     time constraints or refreshing recollection; he had just \n     finished lying during the Jones deposition about these \n     issues, and he needed corroboration from his secretary.\n\n                   Testimony About Influencing Aides\n\n       Not only did the President lie about his attempts to \n     influence Ms. Currie's testimony, but he lied about his \n     attempts to influence the testimony of some of his top aides. \n     Among the President's lies to his aides, described in detail \n     later in this brief, were that Ms. Lewinsky did not perform \n     oral sex on him, and that Ms. Lewinsky stalked him while he \n     rejected her sexual demands. These lies were then \n     disseminated to the media and attributed to White House \n     sources. They were also disseminated to the grand jury.\n       When the president was asked about these lies before the \n     grand jury, he testified:\n\n       ``And so I said to them things that were true about this \n     relationship. That I used--in the language I used, I said, \n     there's nothing going on between us. That was true. I said, I \n     have not had sex with her as I defined it. That was true. And \n     did I hope that I never would have to be here on this day \n     giving this testimony? Of course.\n       ``But I also didn't want to do anything to complicate this \n     matter further. So I said things that were true. They may \n     have been misleading, and if they were I have to take \n     responsibility for it, and I'm sorry.''\n\n     (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, p. 106; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 558)\n       To accept this grand jury testimony as truth, one must \n     believe that many of the President's top aides engaged in a \n     concerted effort to lie to the grand jury in order to \n     incriminate him at the risk of subjecting themselves to a \n     perjury indictment. We suggest that it is illustrative of the \n     President's character that he never felt any compunction in \n     exposing others to false testimony charges, so long as he \n     could conceal his own perjuries. Simply put, such a \n     conspiracy did not exist.\n       The above are merely highlights of the President's grand \n     jury perjury, and there are numerous additional examples. In \n     order to keep these lies in perspective, three facts must be \n     remembered. First, before the grand jury, the President was \n     not lying to cover up an affair and protect himself from \n     embarrassment, as concealing the affair was now impossible. \n     Second, the President could no longer argue that the facts \n     surrounding his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were somehow \n     irrelevant or immaterial, as the Office of Independent \n     Counsel and the grand jury had mandates to explore them. \n     Third, he cannot claim to have been surprised or unprepared \n     for questions about Ms. Lewinsky before the grand jury, as he \n     spent days with his lawyer, preparing responses to such \n     questions.\n\n                         The President's Method\n\n       Again, the President carefully crafted his statements to \n     give the appearance of being candid, when actually his intent \n     was the opposite. In addition, throughout the testimony, \n     whenever the President was asked a specific question that \n     could not be answered directly without either admitting the \n     truth or giving an easily provable false answer, he said, ``I \n     rely on my statement.'' 19 times he relied on this false and \n     misleading statement; nineteen times, then, he repeated those \n     lies in ``answering'' questions propounded to him. (See eg. \n     WJC 8/17/98 GJ, pg. 139; H.Doc. 105-311, p. 591)\n\n                     The House Committee's Request\n\n       In an effort to avoid unnecessary work and to bring its \n     inquiry to an expeditious end, the Judiciary Committee of the \n     House of Representatives submitted to the President 81 \n     requests to admit or deny specific facts relevant to this \n     investigation. (Exhibit 18) Although, for the most part, the \n     questions could have been answered with a simple ``admit'' or \n     ``deny,'' the President elected to follow the pattern of \n     selective memory, reference to other testimony, blatant \n     untruths, artful distortions, outright lies, and half truths. \n     When he did answer, he engaged in legalistic hair-splitting \n     in an obvious attempt to skirt the whole truth and to deceive \n     and obstruct the due proceedings of the Committee.\n\n                  The President Repeats His Falsities\n\n       Thus, on at least 23 questions, the President professed a \n     lack of memory. This from a man who is renowned for his \n     remarkable memory, for his amazing ability to recall details.\n       In at least 15 answers, the President merely referred to \n     ``White House Records.'' He also referred to his own prior \n     testimony and that of others. He answered several of the \n     requests by merely restating the same deceptive answers that \n     he gave to the grand jury. We will point out several false \n     statements in this Brief.\n       In addition, the half-truths, legalistic parsings, evasive \n     and misleading answers were obviously calculated to obstruct \n     the efforts of the House Committee. They had the effect of \n     seriously hampering its ability to inquire and to ascertain \n     the truth. The President has, therefore, added obstruction of \n     an inquiry and an investigation before the Legislative Branch \n     to his obstructions of justice before the Judicial Branch of \n     our constitutional system of government.\n\n                    The Early Attack on Ms. Lewinsky\n\n       After his deposition, the power and prestige of the Office \n     of President was marshaled to destroy the character and \n     reputation of Monica Lewinsky, a young woman that had been \n     ill-used by the President. As soon as her name surfaced, the \n     campaign began to muzzle any possible testimony, and to \n     attack the credibility of witnesses, in a concerted effort to \n     obstruct the due administration of justice in a lawsuit filed \n     by one female citizen of Arkansas. It almost worked.\n       When the President testified at his deposition that he had \n     no sexual relations, sexual affair or the like with \n     Monica Lewinsky, he felt secure. Monica Lewinksy, the only \n     other witness was on board. She had furnished a false \n     affidavit also denying everything. Later, when he realized \n     from the January 18, 1998, Drudge Report that there were \n     taped conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, \n     he had to develop a new story, and he did. In addition, he \n     recounted that story to White House aides who passed it on \n     to the grand jury in an effort to obstruct that tribunal \n     too.\n       On Wednesday, January 21, 1998, The Washington Post \n     published a story entitled ``Clinton Accused of Urging Aide \n     to Lie; Starr Probes Whether President Told Woman to Deny \n     Alleged Affair to Jones' Lawyers.'' The White House learned \n     the substance of the Post story on the evening of January 20, \n     1998.\n\n                          Mr. Bennett's Remark\n\n       After the President learned of the existence of the story, \n     he made a series of telephone calls.\n       At 12:08 a.m. he called his attorney, Mr. Bennett, and they \n     had a conversation. The next morning, Mr. Bennett was quoted \n     in the Washington Post stating:\n\n       ``The President adamantly denies he ever had a relationship \n     with Ms. Lewinsky and she has confirmed the truth of that.'' \n     He added, ``This story seems ridiculous and I frankly smell a \n     rat.''\n\n                            Additional Calls\n\n       After that conversation, the President had a half hour \n     conversation with White House counsel, Bruce Lindsey.\n       At 1:16 a.m., the President called Betty Currie and spoke \n     to her for 20 minutes.\n       He then called Bruce Lindsey again.\n       At 6:30 a.m. the President called Vernon Jordan.\n       After that, the President again conversed with Bruce \n     Lindsey.\n       This flurry of activity was a prelude to the stories which \n     the President would soon inflict upon top White House aides \n     and advisors.\n\n                  The President's Statements to Staff\n\n\n                             ERSKINE BOWLES\n\n       On the morning of January 21, 1998, the President met with \n     Whie House Chief of Staff, Erskine Bowles, and his two \n     deputies, John Podesta and Sylvia Matthews.\n       Erskine Bowles recalled entering the President's office at \n     9:00 a.m. that morning. He then recounts the President's \n     immediate words as he and two others entered the Oval Office:\n\n       And he looked up at us and he said the same thing he said \n     to the American people.\n       He said, ``I want you to know I did not have sexual \n     relationships with this woman, Monica Lewinsky. I did not ask \n     anybody to lie. And when the facts come out, you'll \n     understand.''\n\n     (Bowles, 4/2/98 GJ, p. 84; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 239) After the \n     President made that blanket denial, Mr. Bowles responded:\n\n       I said, ``Mr. President, I don't know what the facts are. I \n     don't know if they're good, bad, or indifferent. But whatever \n     they are, you ought to get them out. And you ought to get \n     them out rignt now.''\n\n     (Bowles, 4/2/98 GJ, p. 84; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 239)\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\n       When counsel asked whether the President responded to \n     Bowles' suggestion that he tell the truth, Bowles responded:\n\n       I don't think he made any response, but he didn't disagree \n     with me.\n\n     (Bowles, 4/2/98 GJ, p. 84; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 239)\n\n\n                              John Podesta\n\n     January 21, 1998\n       Deputy Chief John Podesta also recalled a meeting with the \n     President on the morning of January 21, 1998.\n       He testified before the grand jury as to what occurred in \n     the Oval Office that morning:\n\n       A. And we started off meeting--we didn't-- I don't think we \n     said anything. And I think the President directed this \n     specifically to Mr. Bowles. He said, ``Erskine, I want you \n     to know that this story is not true.''\n       Q. What else did he say?\n       A. He said that--that he had not had a sexual relationship \n     with her, and that he never asked anybody to lie.\n\n     (Podesta, 6/16/98 GJ, p. 85; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 3310)\n     January 23, 1998\n       Two days later, on January 23, 1998, Mr. Podesta had \n     another discussion with the President:\n\n       ``I asked him how he was doing, and he said he was working \n     on this draft and he said to me that he never had sex with \n     her, and that--and that he never asked--you know, he repeated \n     the denial, but he was extremely explicit in saying he never \n     had sex with her.''\n\n     Then Podesta testified as follows:\n\n       Q. Okay. Not explicit, in the sense that he got more \n     specific than sex, than the word ``sex.''\n       A. Yes, he was more specific than that.\n       Q. Okay, share that with us.\n       A. Well, I think he said--he said that--there was some \n     spate. Of, you know, what sex acts were counted, and he said \n     that he had never had sex with her in any way whatsoever----\n       Q. Okay.\n       A. That they had not had oral sex.\n\n     (Podesta, 6/16/98 GJ, p. 92; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 3311) \n     (Exhibit V)\n\n\n                           sidney blumenthal\n\n       Later in the day on January 21, 1998, the President called \n     Sidney Blumenthal to his office. It is interesting to note \n     how the President's lies become more elaborate and pronounced \n     when he has time to concoct this newest line of defense. When \n     the President spoke to Mr. Bowles and Mr. Podesta, he simply \n     denied the story. But, by the time he spoke to Mr. \n     Blumenthal, the President has added three new angles to his \n     defense strategy: (1) he now portrays Monica Lewinsky as the \n     aggressor; (2) he launches an attack on her reputation by \n     portraying her as a ``stalker''; and (3) he presents himself \n     as the innocent victim being attacked by the forces of evil.\n       Note well this recollection by Mr. Blumenthal in his June \n     4, 1998 testimony: (Chart U)\n\n       And it was at this point that he gave his account of what \n     had happened to me and he said that Monica--and it came very \n     fast. He said, ``Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual \n     demand on me.'' He rebuffed her. He said, ``I've gone down \n     that road before, I've caused pain for a lot of people and \n     I'm not going to do that again.'' She threatened him. She \n     said that she would tell people they'd had an affair, that \n     she was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she \n     hated it and if she had an affair or said she had an affair \n     then she wouldn't be the stalker anymore.\n\n     (Blumenthal, 6/4/98 GJ, p. 49; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 185)\n       And then consider what the President told Mr. Blumenthal \n     moments later:\n\n       And he said, ``I feel like a character in a novel. I feel \n     like somebody who is surrounded by an oppressive force that \n     is creating a lie about me and I can't get the truth out. I \n     feel like the character in the novel Darkness at Noon.\n       And I said to him, ``When this happened with Monica \n     Lewinsky, were you alone?'' He said, ``Well, I was within \n     eyesight or earshot of someone.''\n\n     (Blumenthal, 6/4/98 GJ, p. 50; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 185)\n       At one point, Mr. Blumenthal was asked by the grand jury to \n     describe the President's manner and demeanor during the \n     exchange.\n\n       Q. In response to my question how you responded to the \n     President's story about a threat or discussion about a threat \n     from Ms. Lewinsky, you mentioned you didn't \n     recall specifically. Do you recall generally the nature of \n     your response to the President?\n       A. It was generally sympathetic to the President. And I \n     certainly believed his story. It was a very heartfelt story, \n     he was pouring out his heart, and I believed him.\n\n     (Blumenthal, 6/25/98 GJ, pgs. 16-17; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. \n     192-193)\n\n\n                              BETTY CURRIE\n\n       When Betty Currie testified before the grand jury, she \n     could not recall whether she had another one-on-one \n     discussion with the President on Tuesday, January 20, or \n     Wednesday, January 21. But she did state that on one of those \n     days, the President summoned her back to his office. At that \n     time, the President recapped their now-infamous Sunday \n     afternoon post-deposition discussion in the Oval Office. It \n     was at that meeting that the President made a series of \n     statements to Ms. Currie, to some of which she could not \n     possibly have known the answers. (e.g. ``Monica came on to me \n     and I never touched her, right?'') (BC 1/27/98 GJ, pgs. 70-\n     75; H.Doc. 105-316, pgs. 559-560; BC 7/22/98 GJ, pgs. 6-7; \n     H.Doc. 105-316, p. 664)\n       When he spoke to her on January 20 or 21, he spoke in the \n     same tone and demeanor that he used in his January 18 Sunday \n     session.\n       Ms. Currie stated that the President may have mentioned \n     that she might be asked about Monica Lewinsky. (BC, 1/24/98 \n     Int., p. 8; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 536)\n\n                        Motive for Lies to Staff\n\n       It is abundantly clear that the President's assertions to \n     staff were designed for dissemination to the American people. \n     But it is more important to understand that the President \n     intended his aides to relate that false story to \n     investigators and grand jurors alike. We know that this is \n     true for the following reasons: the Special Division had \n     recently appointed the Office of Independent Counsel to \n     investigate the Monica Lewinsky matter; the President \n     realized that Jones' attorneys and investigators were \n     investigating this matter; the Washington Post journalists \n     and investigators were exposing the details of the Lewinsky \n     affair; and, an investigation relating to perjury charges \n     based on Presidential activities in the Oval Office would \n     certainly lead to interviews with West Wing employees and \n     high level staffers. Because the President would not appear \n     before the grand jury, his version of events would be \n     supplied by those staffers to whom he had lied. The President \n     actually acknowledged that he knew his aides might be called \n     before the grand jury. (WJC 8/17/98 GJ, pgs. 105-109; H.Doc. \n     105-311, pgs. 557-557)\n       In addition, Mr. Podesta testified that he knew that he was \n     likely to be a witness in the ongoing grand jury criminal \n     investigation. He said that he was ``sensitive about not \n     exchanging information because I knew I was a potential \n     witness.'' (Podesta 6/23/98 GJ, p. 79; H.Doc. 105-316, p. \n     3332) He also recalled that the President volunteered to \n     provide information about Ms. Lewinsky to him even though Mr. \n     Podesta had not asked for these details. (Podesta 6/23/98 GJ, \n     p. 79; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 3332)\n       In other words, the President's lies and deceptions to his \n     White House aides, coupled with his steadfast refusal to \n     testify had the effect of presenting a false account of \n     events to investigators and grand jurors. The President's \n     aides believed the President when he told them his contrived \n     account. The aides' eventual testimony provided the \n     President's calculated falsehoods to the grand jury which, in \n     turn, gave the jurors an inaccurate and misleading set of \n     facts upon which to base any decisions.\n\n                             Win, Win, Win\n\n       President Clinton also implemented a win-at-all-\n     costs strategy calculated to obstruct the administration \n     of justice in the Jones case and in the grand jury. This \n     is demonstrated in testimony presented by Richard ``Dick'' \n     Morris to the federal grand jury.\n       Mr. Morris, a former presidential advisor, testified that \n     on January 21, 1998, he met President Clinton and they \n     discussed the turbulent events of the day. The President \n     again denied the accusations against him. After further \n     discussions, they decided to have an overnight poll taken to \n     determine if the American people would forgive the President \n     for adultery, perjury, and obstruction of justice. When Mr. \n     Morris received the results, he called the President:\n\n       ``And I said, `They're just too shocked by this. It's just \n     too new, it's too raw.' And I said, `And the problem is \n     they're willing to forgive you for adultery, but not for \n     perjury or obstruction of justice or the various other \n     things.' ''\n\n     (Morris 8/18/98 GJ. p. 28; H.Doc. 105-316, p. 2929)\n       Morris recalls the following exchange:\n\n       Morris: And I said, ``They're just not ready for it.'' \n     meaning the voters.\n       WJC: Well, we just have to win, then.\n\n     (Morris 8/18/98 GJ, p. 30; H.Doc. 105-216, p. 2930)\n       The President, of course, cannot recall this statement, \n     (Presidential Responses to Questions, Numbers 69, 70, and 71)\n\n                 The Plot to Discredit Monica Lewinsky\n\n       In order to ``win,'' it was necessary to convince the \n     public, and hopefully the grand jurors who read the \n     newspapers, that Monica Lewinsky was unworthy of belief. If \n     the account given by Ms. Lewinsky to Linda Tripp was \n     believed, then there would emerge a tawdry affair in and near \n     the Oval Office. Moreover, the President's own perjury and \n     that of Monica Lewinsky would surface. To do this, the \n     President employed the full power and credibility of the \n     White House and its press corps to destroy the witness. Thus \n     on January 29, 1998:\n\n       Inside the White House, the debate goes on about the best \n     way to destroy That Woman, as President Bill Clinton called \n     Monica Lewinsky. Should they paint her as a friendly \n     fantasist or a malicious stalker? (The Plain Dealer)\n\n     Again:\n\n       ``That poor child has serious emotional problems,'' Rep. \n     Charles Rangel, Democrat of New York, said Tuesday night \n     before the State of the Union. ``She's fantasizing. And I \n     haven't heard that she played with a full deck in her other \n     experiences.'' (The Plain Dealer)\n\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\n\n     From Gene Lyons, an Arkansas columnist on January 30:\n\n       ``But it's also very easy to take a mirror's eye view of \n     this thing, look at this thing from a completely different \n     direction and take the same evidence and posit a totally \n     innocent relationship in which the president was, in a sense, \n     the victim of someone rather like the woman who followed \n     David Letterman around.'' (NBC News)\n\n     From another ``source'' on February 1:\n\n       ``Monica had become known at the White House, says one \n     source, as `the stalker.' ''\n\n     And on February 4:\n\n       ``The media have reported that sources describe Lewinsky as \n     `infatuated' with the president, `star struck' and even `a \n     stalker'.'' (Buffalo News)\n\n     Finally, on January 31:\n\n       ``One White House aide called reporters to offer \n     information about Monica Lewinsky's past, her weight problems \n     and what the aide said was her nickname--`The Stalker.' ''\n       ``Junior staff members, speaking on the condition that they \n     not be identified, said she was known as a flirt, wore her \n     skirts too short, and was `A little bit weird.' ''\n       ``Little by little, ever since allegations of an affair \n     between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Lewinsky surfaced 10 \n     days ago, White House sources have waged a behind-the-scenes \n     campaign to portray her as an untrustworthy climber obsessed \n     with the President.''\n       ``Just hours after the story broke, one White House source \n     made unsolicited calls offering that Lewinsky was the \n     `troubled' product of divorced parents and may have been \n     following the footsteps of her mother, who wrote a tell-all \n     book about the private lives of three famous opera \n     singers.''\n       ``One story had Lewinsky following former Clinton aide \n     George Stephanopoulos to Starbucks. After observing what kind \n     of coffee he ordered, she showed up the next day at his \n     secretary's desk with a cup of the same coffee to `surprise \n     him.' '' (Toronto Sun)\n\n       This sounds familiar because it is the exact tactic used to \n     destroy the reputation and credibility of Paula Jones. The \n     difference is that these false rumors were emanating from the \n     White House, the bastion of the free world, to protect one \n     man from being forced to answer for his deportment in the \n     highest office in the land.\n       On August 17, 1998, the President testified before the \n     grand jury. He then was specifically asked whether he knew \n     that his aides (Blumenthal, Bowles, Podesta and Currie) were \n     likely to be called before the grand jury.\n\n       Q. It may have been misleading, sir, and you knew though, \n     after January 21st when the Post article broke and said that \n     Judge Starr was looking into this, you knew that they might \n     be witnesses. You knew that they might be called into a grand \n     jury, didn't you?\n       WJC. That's right. I think I was quite careful what I said \n     after that. I may have said something to all these people to \n     that effect, but I'll also--whenever anybody asked me any \n     details, I said, look, I don't want you to be a witness or I \n     turn you into a witness or give you information that would \n     get you in trouble. I just wouldn't talk. I, by and large, \n     didn't talk to people about it.\n       Q. If all of these people--let's leave Mrs. Currie for a \n     minute. Vernon Jordan, Sid Blumenthal, John Podesta, Harold \n     Ickes, Erskine Bowles, Harry Thomasson, after the story \n     broke, after Judge Starr's involvement was known on January \n     21st, have said that you denied a sexual relationship with \n     them. Are you denying that?\n       WJC. No.\n       Q. And you've told us that you----\n       WJC. I'm just telling you what I meant by it. I told you \n     what I meant by it when they started this deposition.\n       Q. You've told us now that you were being careful, but that \n     it might have been misleading. Is that correct?\n       WJC. It must have been * * * So, what I was trying to do \n     was to give them something they could--that would be true, \n     even if misleading in the context of this deposition, and \n     keep them out of trouble, and let's deal--and deal with what \n     I thought was the almost ludicrous suggestion that I had \n     urged someone to lie or tried to suborn perjury, in other \n     words.\n\n     (WJC 8/17/97 GJ, pgs. 106-108; H. Doc. 105-311, pgs. 558-560)\n       As the President testified before the grand jury, he \n     maintained that he was being truthful with his aides. \n     (Exhibit 20) He stated that when he spoke to them, he was \n     very careful with his wording. The President stated that he \n     wanted his statement regarding ``sexual relations'' to be \n     literally true because he was only referring to intercourse.\n       However, recall that John Podesta said that the President \n     denied sex ``in any way whatsoever'' ``including oral sex.'' \n     The President told Mr. Podesta, Mr. Bowles, Ms. Williams, and \n     Harold Ickes that he did not have a ``sexual relationship'' \n     with that woman.\n       Importantly, seven days after the President's grand jury \n     appearance, the White House issued a document entitled, \n     ``Talking Points January 24, 1998.'' (Chart W; Exhibit 16) \n     This ``Talking Points'' document outlines proposed questions \n     that the President may be asked. It also outlines suggested \n     answers to those questions. The ``Talking Points'' purport to \n     state the President's view of sexual relations and his view \n     of the relationship with Monica Lewinsky. (Exhibit 17)\n       The ``Talking Points'' state as follows:\n\n       Q. What acts does the President believe constitute a sexual \n     relationship?\n       A. I can't believe we're on national television discussing \n     this. I am not about to engage in an ``act-by-act'' \n     discussion of what constitutes a sexual relationship.\n       Q. Well, for example, Ms. Lewinsky is on tape indicating \n     that the President does not believe oral sex is adultery. \n     Would oral sex, to the President, constitute a sexual \n     relationship?\n       A. Of course it would.\n\n       The President's own talking points refute the President's \n     ``literal truth'' argument.\n\n                   Effect of the President's Conduct\n\n       Some ``experts'' have questioned whether the President's \n     deportment affects his office, the government of the United \n     States or the dignity and honor of the country.\n       Our founders decided in the Constitutional Convention that \n     one of the duties imposed upon the President is to ``take \n     care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' Furthermore, he \n     is required to take an oath to ``Preserve, protect and defend \n     the Constitution of the United States.'' Twice this President \n     stood on the steps of the Capitol, raised his right hand to \n     God and repeated that oath.\n       The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States provides that no person shall ``be deprived of life, \n     liberty or property without due process of law.``\n       The Seventh Amendment insures that in civil suits ``the \n     right of trial by jury shall be preserved.''\n       Finally, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees due process of \n     law and the equal protection of the laws.\n\n                    The Effect on Ms. Jones' Rights\n\n       Paula Jones is an American citizen, just a single citizen \n     who felt that she had suffered a legal wrong. More important, \n     that legal wrong was based upon the Constitution of the \n     United States. She claimed essentially that she was subjected \n     to sexual harassment, which, in turn, constitutes \n     discrimination on the basis of gender. The case was not \n     brought against just any citizen, but against the President \n     of the United States, who was under a legal and moral \n     obligation to preserve and protect Ms. Jones' rights. It is \n     relatively simple to mouth high-minded platitudes and to \n     prosecute vigorously right violations by someone else. It is, \n     however, a test of courage, honor and integrity to enforce \n     those rights against yourself. The President failed that \n     test. As a citizen, Ms. Jones enjoyed an absolute \n     constitutional right to petition the Judicial Branch of \n     government to redress that wrong by filing a lawsuit in the \n     United States District Court, which she did. At this point \n     she became entitled to a trial by jury if she chose, due \n     process of law and the equal protection of the laws no matter \n     who the defendant was in her suit. Due process contemplates \n     that right to a full and fair trial, which, in turn, means \n     the right to call and question witnesses, to cross-examine \n     adverse witnesses and to have her case decided by an unbiased \n     and fully informed jury. What did she actually get? None of \n     the above.\n       On May 27, 1997, the United States Supreme Court ruled in a \n     nine to zero decision that, ``like every other citizen,'' \n     Paula Jones ``has a right to an orderly disposition of her \n     claims.`` In accordance with the Supreme Court's decision, \n     United States District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled on \n     December 11, 1997, that Ms. Jones was entitled to information \n     regarding state or federal employees with whom the President \n     had sexual relations from May, 1986 to the present. Judge \n     Wright had determined that the information was reasonably \n     calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. \n     Six days after this ruling, the President filed an answer to \n     Ms. Jones' Amended Complaint. The President's Answer stated: \n     ``President Clinton denies that he engaged in any improper \n     conduct with respect to plaintiff or any other woman.''\n       Ms. Jones' right to call and depose witnesses was thwarted \n     by perjurious and misleading affidavits and motions; her \n     right to elicit testimony from adverse witnesses was \n     compromised by perjury and false and misleading statements \n     under oath. As a result, had a jury tried the case, it would \n     have been deprived of critical information.\n       That result is bad enough, but it reaches constitutional \n     proportions when denial of the civil rights is directed by \n     the President of the United States who twice took an oath to \n     preserve, protect and defend those rights. But we now know \n     what the ``sanctity of an oath'' means to the President.\n\n                 The Effect on the Office of President\n\n       Moreover, the President is the spokesman for the government \n     and the people of the United States concerning both domestic \n     and foreign matters. His honesty and integrity, therefore, \n     directly influence the credibility of this country. When, as \n     here, that spokesman is guilty of a continuing pattern of \n     lies, misleading statements, and deceits over a long period \n     of time, the believability of any of his pronouncements is \n     seriously called into question. Indeed, how can anyone in or \n     out of our country any longer believe anything he says? And \n     what does that do to confidence in the honor and integrity of \n     the United States?\n       Make no mistake, the conduct of the President is \n     inextricably bound to the welfare of the people of the United \n     States. Not only does it affect economic and national \n     defense, but even more directly, it affects the moral and \n     law-abiding fibre of the commonwealth,\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\n     without which no nation can survive. When, as here, that \n     conduct involves a pattern of abuses of power, of perjury, of \n     deceit, of obstruction of justice and of the Congress, and of \n     other illegal activities, the resulting damage to the honor \n     and respect due to the United States is, of necessity, \n     devastating.\n\n                        The Effect on the System\n\n       Again: there is no such thing as non-serious lying under \n     oath. Every time a witness lies, that witness chips a stone \n     from the foundation of our entire legal system. Likewise, \n     every act of obstruction of justice, of witness tampering or \n     of perjury adversely affects the judicial branch of \n     government like a pebble tossed into a lake. You may not \n     notice the effect at once, but you can be certain that the \n     tranquility of that lake has been disturbed. And if enough \n     pebbles are thrown into the water, the lake itself may \n     disappear. So too with the truth-seeking process of the \n     courts. Every unanswered and unpunished assault upon it has \n     its lasting effect and given enough of them, the system \n     itself will implode.\n       That is why two women who testified before the Committee \n     had been indicted, convicted and punished severely for false \n     statements under oath in civil cases. And that is why only \n     recently a federal grand jury in Chicago indicted four former \n     college football players because they gave false testimony \n     under oath to a grand jury. Nobody suggested that they should \n     not be charged because their motives may have been to protect \n     their careers and family. And nobody has suggested that the \n     perjury was non-serious because it involved only lies about \n     sports; i.e., betting on college football games.\n\n                      Disregard of the Rule of Law\n\n       Apart from all else, the President's illegal actions \n     constitute an attack upon and utter disregard for the truth, \n     and for the rule of law. Much worse, they manifest an \n     arrogant disdain not only for the rights of his fellow \n     citizens, but also for the functions and the integrity of the \n     other two co-equal branches of our constitutional system. One \n     of the witnesses that appeared earlier likened the government \n     of the United States to a three-legged stool. The analysis is \n     apt, because the entire structure of our country rests upon \n     three equal supports: the Legislative, the Judicial, and the \n     Executive. Remove one of those supports, and the State will \n     totter. Remove two and the structure will collapse \n     altogether.\n\n                     Effect on the Judicial Branch\n\n       The President mounted a direct assault upon the truth-\n     seeking process which is the very essence and foundation of \n     the Judicial Branch. Not content with that, though, Mr. \n     Clinton renewed his lies, half-truths and obstruction to this \n     Congress when he filed his answers to simple requests to \n     admit or deny. In so doing, he also demonstrated his lack of \n     respect for the constitutional functions of the Legislative \n     Branch.\n       Actions do not lose their public character merely because \n     they may not directly affect the domestic and foreign \n     functioning of the Executive Branch. Their significance must \n     be examined for their effect on the functioning of the entire \n     system of government. Viewed in that manner, the President's \n     actions were both public and extremely destructive.\n\n          The Conduct Charged Warrants Conviction and Removal\n\n       The Articles state offenses that warrant the President's \n     conviction and removal from office. The Senate's own \n     precedents establish that perjury and obstruction warrant \n     conviction and removal from office. Those same precedents \n     establish that the perjury and obstruction need not have any \n     direct connection to the officer's official duties.\n\n                               Precedents\n\n       In the 1980s, the Senate convicted and removed from office \n     three federal judges for making perjurious statements. \n     Background and History of Impeachment Hearings before the \n     Subcomm. On the Constitution of the House Comm. on the \n     Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2nd Sess. at 190-193 (Comm. Print \n     1998), (Testimony of Charles Cooper) (``Cooper Testimony'') \n     Although able counsel represented each judge, none of them \n     argued that perjury or making false statements are not \n     impeachable offenses. Nor did a single Congressman or \n     Senator, in any of the three impeachment proceedings, suggest \n     that perjury does not constitute a high crime and \n     misdemeanor. Finally, in the cases of Judge Claiborne and \n     Judge Nixon, it was undisputed that the perjury was not \n     committed in connection with the exercise of the judges' \n     judicial powers.\n\n                              Judge Nixon\n\n       In 1989, Judge Walter L. Nixon, Jr., was impeached, \n     convicted, and removed from office for committing perjury. \n     Judge Nixon's offense stemmed from his grand jury testimony \n     and statements to federal officers concerning his \n     intervention in the state drug prosecution of Drew Fairchild, \n     the son of Wiley Fairchild, a business partner of Judge \n     Nixon's.\n       Although Judge Nixon had no official role or function in \n     Drew Fairchild's case (which was assigned to a state court \n     judge), Wiley Fairchild had asked Judge Nixon to help out by \n     speaking to the prosecutor. Judge Nixon did so, and the \n     prosecutor, a long-time friend of Judge Nixon's, dropped the \n     case. When the FBI and the Department of Justice interviewed \n     Judge Nixon, he denied any involvement whatsoever. \n     Subsequently, a federal grand jury was empaneled and Judge \n     Nixon again denied his involvement before that grand jury.\n       After a lengthy criminal prosecution, Judge Nixon was \n     convicted on two counts of perjury before the grand jury and \n     sentenced to five years in prison on each count. Not long \n     thereafter, the House impeached Judge Nixon by a vote of 417 \n     to 0. The first article of impeachment charged him with \n     making the false or misleading statement to the grand jury \n     that he could not ``recall'' discussing the Fairchild case \n     with the prosecutor. The second article charged Nixon with \n     making affirmative false or misleading statements to the \n     grand jury that he had ``nothing whatsoever officially or \n     unofficially to do with the Drew Fairchild case.'' The third \n     article alleged that Judge Nixon made  numerous false \n     statements (not under oath) to federal investigators prior \n     to his grand jury testimony. See 135 Cong. Rec. H1802-03.\n       The House unanimously impeached Judge Nixon, and the House \n     Managers' Report expressed no doubt that perjury is an \n     impeachable offense:\n\n       ``It is difficult to imagine an act more subversive to the \n     legal process than lying from the witness stand. A judge who \n     violates his testimonial oath and misleads a grand jury is \n     clearly unfit to remain on the bench. If a judge's \n     truthfulness cannot be guaranteed, if he sets less than the \n     highest standard for candor, how can ordinary citizens who \n     appear in court be expected to abide by their testimonial \n     oath?''\n\n     House of Representatives' Brief in Support of the Articles of \n     Impeachment at 59 (1989). House Manager Sensenbrenner \n     addressed the question even more directly:\n\n       ``There are basically two questions before you in \n     connection with this impeachment. First, does the conduct \n     alleged in the three articles of impeachment state an \n     impeachable offense? There is really no debate on this point. \n     The articles allege misconduct that is criminal and wholly \n     inconsistent with judicial integrity and the judicial oath. \n     Everyone agrees that a judge who lies under oath, or who \n     deceives Federal investigators by lying in an interview, is \n     not fit to remain on the bench.''\n\n     135 Cong. Rec. S14,497 (Statement of Rep. Sensenbrenner)\n       The Senate agreed, overwhelmingly voting to convict Judge \n     Nixon of perjury on the first two articles (89-8 and 78-19, \n     respectively). As Senator Carl Levin explained:\n\n       ``The record amply supports the finding in the criminal \n     trial that Judge Nixon's statements to the grand jury were \n     false and misleading and constituted perjury. Those are the \n     statements cited in articles I and II and it is on those \n     articles that I vote to convict Judge Nixon and remove him \n     from office.''\n\n     135 Cong. Rec. S14,637 (Statement of Sen. Levin).\n\n                             Judge Hastings\n\n       Also in 1989, the House impeached Judge Alcee L. Hastings \n     for, among other things, committing numerous acts of perjury. \n     The Senate convicted him, and he was removed from office. \n     Initially, Judge Hastings had been indicted by a federal \n     grand jury for conspiracy stemming from his alleged bribery \n     conspiracy with his friend Mr. William Borders to ``fix'' \n     cases before Judge Hastings in exchange for cash payments \n     from defendants. Mr. Borders was convicted, but, at his own \n     trial, Judge Hastings took the stand and unequivocally denied \n     any participation in a conspiracy with Mr. Borders. The jury \n     acquitted Judge Hastings on all counts. Nevertheless, the \n     House impeached Judge Hastings, approving seventeen articles \n     of impeachment, fourteen of which were for lying under oath \n     at his trial.\n       The House voted 413 to 3 to impeach. The House Managers' \n     Report left no doubt that perjury alone is impeachable:\n\n       ``It is important to realize that each instance of false \n     testimony charged in the false statement articles is more \n     than enough reason to convict Judge Hastings and remove him \n     from office. Even if the evidence were insufficient to prove \n     that Judge Hastings was part of the conspiracy with William \n     Borders, which the House in no way concedes, the fact that he \n     lied under oath to assure his acquittal is conduct that \n     cannot be tolerated of a United States District Judge. To \n     bolster one's defense by lying to a jury is separate, \n     independent corrupt conduct. For this reason alone, Judge \n     Hastings should be removed from public office.''\n\n     The House of Representatives' Brief in Support of the \n     Articles of Impeachment at 127-28 (1989). Representative John \n     Conyers (D-Mich.) also argued for the impeachment of Judge \n     Hastings:\n\n       ``[W]e can no more close our eyes to acts that constitute \n     high crimes and misdemeanors when practiced by judges whose \n     views we approve than we could against judges whose views we \n     detested. It would be disloyal . . . to my oath of office at \n     this late state of my career to attempt to set up a double \n     standard for those who share my philosophy and for those who \n     may oppose it. In order to be true to our principles, we must \n     demand that all persons live up to the same high standards \n     that we demand of everyone else.''\n\n     134 Cong. Rec. H6184 (1988) (Statement of Rep. Conyers).\n\n                            Judge Claiborne\n\n       In 1986, Judge Harry E. Claiborne was impeached, convicted, \n     and removed from office for making false statements under \n     penalties\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n     of perjury. In particular, Judge Claiborne had filed false \n     income tax returns in 1979 and 1980, grossly understating his \n     income. As a result, he was convicted by a jury of two \n     counts of willfully making a false statement on a federal \n     tax return in violation of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7206 (a). \n     Subsequently, the House unanimously (406-0) approved four \n     articles of impeachment. The proposition that Claiborne's \n     perjurious personal income tax filings were not \n     impeachable was never even seriously considered. As the \n     House Managers explained:\n\n       ``[T]he constitutional issues raised by the first two \n     Articles of Impeachment [concerning the filing of false tax \n     returns] are readily resolved. The Constitution provides that \n     Judge Claiborne may be impeached and convicted for ``High \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Article II, Section 4. The willful \n     making or subscribing of a false statement on a tax return is \n     a felony offense under the laws of the United States. The \n     commission of such a felony is a proper basis for Judge \n     Clairborne's impeachment and conviction in the Senate.''\n\n     Proceedngs of the United States Senate Impeachment Trial of \n     Judge Harry E. Clairborne, S. Doc. No. 99-48, at 40 (1986) \n     (Claiborne Proceedings'') (emphases added).\n       House Manager Rodino, in his oral argument to the Senate, \n     emphatically made the same point:\n\n       ``Honor in the eyes of the American people lies in public \n     officials who respect the law, not in those who violate the \n     trust that has been given to them when they are trusted with \n     public office. Judge Harry E. Claiborne has, sad to say, \n     undermined the integrity of the judicial branch of \n     Government. To restore that integrity and to maintain public \n     confidence in the administration of justice, Judge Claiborne \n     must be convicted on the fourth Article of Impeachment [that \n     of reducing confidence in the integrity of the judiciary].''\n\n     132 Cong. Rec. S15,481 (1986) (Statement of Rep. Rodino).\n       The Senate agreed. Telling are the words of then-Senator \n     Albert Gore, Jr. In voting to convict Judge Claiborne and \n     remove him from office:\n\n       ``The conclusion is inescapable that Clairborne filed false \n     income tax returns and that he did so willfully rather than \n     negligently. . . . Given the circumstances, it is incumbent \n     upon the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility \n     and strip this man of his title. An individual who has \n     knowingly falsified tax returns has no business receiving a \n     salary derived from the tax dollars of honest citizens. More \n     importantly, an individual quality of such reprehensible \n     conduct ought not be permitted to exercise the awesome powers \n     which the Constitution entrusts to the Federal Judiciary.''\n\n     Claiborne Proceedings, S. Doc. No. 99-48, at 372 (1986).\n\n                      Application to the President\n\n       To avoid the conclusive force of these recent precedents--\n     and in particular the exact precedent supporting impeachment \n     for, conviction, and removal for perjury--the only recourse \n     for the President's defenders is to argue that a high crime \n     or misdemeanor for a judge is not necessarily a high crime or \n     misdemeanor for the President. The arguments advanced in \n     support of this dubious proposition do not withstand serious \n     scrutiny. See generally Cooper Testimony, at 193.\n       The Constitution provides that Article III judges ``shall \n     hold their Offices during good Behavior, U.S. Const. Art. \n     III, 1. Thus, these arguments suggest that judges are \n     impeachable for ``misbehavior'' while other federal officials \n     are only impeachable for treason, bribery, and other high \n     crimes and misdemeanors.\n       The staff of the House Judiciary Committee in the 1970s and \n     the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal in \n     the 1990s both issued reports rejecting these arguments. In \n     1974, the staff of the Judiciary Committee's Impeachment \n     Inquiry issued a report which included the following \n     conclusion:\n\n       ``Does Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, which \n     states that judges `shall hold their Offices during good \n     Behaviour,' limit the relevance of the ten impeachments of \n     judges with respect to presidential impeachment standards as \n     has been argued by some? It does not. The argument is that \n     `good behavior' implies an additional ground for impeachment \n     of judges not applicable to other civil officers. However, \n     the only impeachment provision discussed in the Convention \n     and included in the Constitution is Article II, Section 4, \n     which by its expressed terms, applies to all civil officers, \n     including judges, and defines impeachment offenses as \n     `Treason, Bribery, and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' \n     ''\n\n     Staff of House Comm. on the Judiciary, 93rd Cong. 2d Sess., \n     Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment (Comm. \n     Print 1974) (``1974 Staff Report'') at 17.\n       The National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal \n     came to the same conclusion. The Commission concluded that \n     ``the most plausible reading of the phrase `during good \n     Behavior' is that it means tenure for life, subject to the \n     impeachment power. . . . The ratification debates about the \n     federal judiciary seem to have proceeded on the assumption \n     that good-behavior tenure meant removal only through \n     impeachment and conviction.'' National Commission on Judicial \n     Discipline and Removal, Report of the National Commission on \n     Judicial Discipline and Removal 17-18 (1993) (footnote \n     omitted).\n       The record of the 1986 impeachment of Judge Claiborne also \n     argues against different impeachment standards for federal \n     judges and presidents. Judge Claiborne filed a motion asking \n     the Senate to dismiss the articles of impeachment against him \n     for failure to state impeachable offenses. One of the \n     motion's arguments was that ``[t]he standard for impeachment \n     of a judge is different than that for other officers'' and \n     that the Constitution limited ``removal of the judiciary to \n     acts involving misconduct related to discharge of office.'' \n     Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Articles of \n     Impeachment on the Grounds They Do Not State Impeachable \n     Offenses 4 (hereinafter cited as ``Claiborne Motion''), \n     reprinted in Hearings Before the Senate Impeachment Trial \n     Committee, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 245 (1986) (hereinafter cited \n     as ``Senate Claiborne Hearings'').\n       Representative Kastenmeier responded that ``reliance on the \n     term `good behavior' as stating a sanction for judges is \n     totally misplaced and virtually all commentators agree that \n     that is directed to affirming the life tenure of judges \n     during good behavior. It is not to set them down, \n     differently, as judicial officers from civil officers.'' Id. \n     at 81-82. He further stated that ``[n]or . . . is there any \n     support for the notion that . . . Federal judges are not \n     civil officers of the United States, subject to the \n     impeachment clause of article II of the Constitution.'' Id. \n     at 81.\n       The Senate never voted on Claiborne's motion. However, the \n     Senate was clearly not swayed by the arguments contained \n     therein because it later voted to convict Judge Claiborne. \n     132 Cong. Rec. S15,760-62 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 1986). The \n     Senate thus rejected the claim that the standard of \n     impeachable offenses was different for judges than for \n     presidents.\n       Moreover, even assuming that presidential high crimes and \n     misdemeanors could be different from judicial ones, surely \n     the President ought not be held to a lower standard of \n     impeachability than judges. In the course of the 1980s \n     judicial impeachments, Congress emphasized unequivocally that \n     the removal from office of federal judges guilty of crimes \n     indistinguishable from those currently charged against the \n     President was essential to the preservation of the rule of \n     law. If the perjury of just one judge so undermines the rule \n     of law as to make it intolerable that he remain in office, \n     then how much more so does perjury committed by the President \n     of the United States, who alone is charged with the duty ``to \n     take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' See \n     generally, Cooper Testimony at 194)\n       It is just as devastating to our system of government when \n     a President commits perjury. As the House Judiciary Committee \n     stated in justifying an article of impeachment against \n     President Nixon, the President not only has ``the obligation \n     that every citizen has to live under the law,'' but in \n     addition has the duty ``not merely to live by the law but to \n     see that law faithfully applied.'' Impeachment of Richard M. \n     Nixon, President of the United States, H. Rept. No. 93-1305, \n     93rd Cong., 2d Sess. at 180 (1974). The Constitution provides \n     that he ``shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully \n     executed.'' U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec. 3. When a President, as \n     chief law enforcement officer of the United States, commits \n     perjury, he violates this constitutional oath unique to his \n     office and casts doubt on the notion that we are a nation \n     ruled by laws and not men.\n\n           Perjury and Obstruction Are as Serious as Bribery\n\n       Further evidence that perjury and obstruction warrant \n     conviction and removal comes directly from the text of the \n     Constitution. Because the Constitution specifically mentions \n     bribery, no one can dispute that it is an impeachable \n     offense. U.S. Const., art. II, Sec. 4. Because the \n     constitutional language does not limit the term, we must take \n     it to mean all forms of bribery. Our statutes specifically \n     criminalize bribery of witnesses with the intent to influence \n     their testimony in judicial proceedings. 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 201(b)(3) & (4), (c)(2) & (3). See also 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1503 (general obstruction of justice statute), 1512 \n     (witness tampering statute). Indeed, in a criminal case, the \n     efforts to provide Ms. Lewinsky with job assistance in return \n     for submitting a false affidavit charged in the Articles \n     might easily have been charged under these statutes. No one \n     could reasonably argue that the President's bribing a witness \n     to provide false testimony--even in a private lawsuit--does \n     not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. The plain \n     language of the Constitution indicates that it is.\n       Having established that point, the rest is easy. Bribing a \n     witness is illegal because it leads to false testimony that \n     in turn undermines the ability of the judicial system to \n     reach just results. Thus, among other things, the Framers \n     clearly intended impeachment to protect the judicial \n     system from these kinds of attacks. Perjury and \n     obstruction of justice are illegal for exactly the same \n     reason, and they accomplish exactly the same ends through \n     slightly different means. Simple logic establishes that \n     perjury and obstruction of justice--even in a private \n     lawsuit--are exactly the types of other high crimes and \n     misdemeanors that are of the same magnitude as bribery.\n\n                      High Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\n       Although Congress has never adopted a fixed definition of \n     ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' much of the background and \n     history of the impeachment process contradicts the \n     President's claim that these offenses are private and \n     therefore do not warrant conviction and removal. Two reports\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\n     prepared in 1974 on the background and history of impeachment \n     are particularly helpful in evaluating the President's \n     defense. Both reports support the conclusion that the facts \n     in this case compel the conviction and removal of President \n     Clinton.\n       Many have commented on the report on ``Constitutional \n     Grounds for Presidential Impeachment'' prepared in February \n     1974 by the staff of the Nixon impeachment inquiry. The \n     general principles concerning grounds for impeachment set \n     forth in that report indicate that perjury and obstruction of \n     justice are impeachable offenses. Consider this key language \n     from the staff report describing the type of conduct which \n     gives rise to impeachment:\n       ``The emphasis has been on the significant effects of the \n     conduct--undermining the integrity of office, disregard of \n     constitutional duties and oath of office, arrogation of \n     power, abuse of the governmental process, adverse impact on \n     the system of government.''\n\n     1974 Staff Report at 26 (emphasis added).\n       Perjury and obstruction of justice clearly ``undermine the \n     integrity of office.'' They unavoidably erode respect for the \n     office of the President. Such offenses obviously involve \n     ``disregard of [the President's] constitutional duties and \n     oath of office.'' Moreover, these offenses have a direct and \n     serious ``adverse impact on the system of government.'' \n     Obstruction of justice is by definition an assault on the due \n     administration of justice--a core function of our system of \n     government.\n       The thoughtful report on ``The Law of Presidential \n     Impeachment'' prepared by the Association of the Bar of the \n     City of New York in January of 1974 also places a great deal \n     of emphasis on the corrosive impact of presidential \n     misconduct on the integrity of office:\n       It is our conclusion, in summary, that the grounds for\n\n     ``impeachment are not limited to or synonymous with crimes . \n     . . Rather, we believe that acts which undermine the \n     integrity of government are appropriate grounds whether or \n     not they happen to constitute offenses under the general \n     criminal law. In our view, the essential nexus to damaging \n     the integrity of government may be found in acts which \n     constitute corruption in, or flagrant abuse of the powers of, \n     official position. It may also be found in acts which, \n     without directly affecting governmental processes, undermine \n     that degree of public confidence in the probity of executive \n     and judicial officers that is essential to the effectiveness \n     of government in a free society.''\n\n     Association of the Bar of the City of New York, The Law of \n     Presidential Impeachment, (1974) at 161 (emphasis added). The \n     commission of perjury and obstruction of justice by a \n     President are acts that without doubt ``undermine that degree \n     of public confidence in the probity of the [the President] \n     that is essential to the effectiveness of government in a \n     free society.'' Such acts inevitably subvert the respect for \n     law which is essential to the well-being of our \n     constitutional system.\n       That the President's perjury and obstruction do not \n     directly involve his official conduct does not diminish their \n     significance. The record is clear that federal officials have \n     been impeached for reasons other than official misconduct. As \n     set forth above, two recent impeachments of federal judges \n     are compelling examples. In 1989, Judge Walter Nixon was \n     impeached, convicted, and removed from office for committing \n     perjury before a federal grand jury. Judge Nixon's perjury \n     involved his efforts to fix a state case for the son of a \n     business partner--a matter in which he had no official \n     role. In 1986, Judge Harry E. Claiborne was impeached, \n     convicted, and removed from office for making false \n     statements under penalty of perjury on his income tax \n     returns. That misconduct had nothing to do with his \n     official responsibilities.\n       Nothing in the text, structure, or history of the \n     Constitution suggests that officials are subject to \n     impeachment only for official misconduct. Perjury and \n     obstruction of justice--even regarding a private matter--are \n     offenses that substantially affect the President's official \n     duties because they are grossly incompatible with his \n     preeminent duty to ``take care that the laws be faithfully \n     executed.'' Regardless of their genesis, perjury and \n     obstruction of justice are acts of public misconduct--they \n     cannot be dismissed as understandable or trivial. Perjury and \n     obstruction of justice are not private matters; they are \n     crimes against the system of justice, for which impeachment, \n     conviction, and removal are appropriate.\n       The record of Judge Claiborne's impeachment proceedings \n     affirms that conclusion. Representative Hamilton Fish, the \n     ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and one of the \n     House managers in the Senate trial, stated that \n     ``[i]mpeachable conduct does not have to occur in the course \n     of the performance of an officer's official duties. Evidence \n     of misconduct, misbehavior, high crimes, and misdemeanors can \n     be justified upon one's private dealings as well as one's \n     exercise of public office. That, of course, is the situation \n     in this case.'' 132 Cong. Rec. H4713 (daily ed. July 22, \n     1986).\n       Judge Claiborne's unsuccessful motion that the Senate \n     dismiss the articles of impeachment for failure to state \n     impeachable offenses provides additional evidence that \n     personal misconduct can justify impeachment. One of the \n     arguments his attorney made for the motion was that ``there \n     is no allegation . . . that the behavior of Judge Claiborne \n     in any way was related to misbehavior in his official \n     function as a judge; it was private misbehavior.'' (Senate \n     Claiborne Hearings, at 77, Statement of Judge Claiborne's \n     counsel, Oscar Goodman). (See also Claiborne Motion, at 3)\n       Representative Kastenmeier responded by stating that ``it \n     would be absurd to conclude that a judge who had committed \n     murder, mayhem, rape, or perhaps espionage in his private \n     life, could not be removed from office by the U.S. Senate.'' \n     (Senate Claiborne Hearings, at 81) Kastenmeier's response was \n     repeated by the House of Representatives in its pleading \n     opposing Claiborne's motion to dismiss. (Opposition to \n     Claiborne Motion at 2)\n       The Senate did not vote on Judge Claiborne's motion, but it \n     later voted to convict him. 132 Cong. Rec. S15,760-62 (daily \n     ed. Oct. 9, 1986). The Senate thus agreed with the House that \n     private improprieties could be, and were in this instance, \n     impeachable offenses.\n       The Claiborne case makes clear that perjury, even if it \n     relates to a matter wholly separated from a federal officer's \n     official duties--a judge's personal tax returns--is an \n     impeachable offense. Judge Nixon's false statements were also \n     in regard to a matter distinct from his official duties. In \n     short, the Senate's own precedents establish that misconduct \n     need not be in one's official capacity to warrant removal.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       This is a defining moment for the Presidency as an \n     institution, because if the President is not convicted as a \n     consequence of the conduct that has been portrayed, then no \n     House of Representatives will ever be able to impeach again \n     and no Senate will ever convict. The bar will be so high that \n     only a convicted felon or a traitor will need to be \n     concerned.\n       Experts pointed to the fact that the House refused to \n     impeach President Nixon for lying on an income tax return. \n     Can you imagine a future President, faced with possible \n     impeachment, pointing to the perjuries, lies, obstructions, \n     and tampering with witnesses by the current occupant of the \n     office as not rising to the level of high crimes and \n     misdemeanors? If this is not enough, what is? How far can the \n     standard be lowered without completely compromising the \n     credibility of the office for all time?\n       Dated: January 11, 1999.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                APPENDIX\n\n [In the Senate of the United States Sitting as a Court of Impeachment]\n\n     In re Impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton\n\n  Appendix to Trial Memorandum of the Managers Appointed by the U.S. \n                        House of Representatives\n\n     The United States\n     House of Representatives\n\n     Henry J.

My name is Jane Doe # . I am 24 years old and I \n     currently reside at 700 New Hampshire Avenue, NW., \n     Washington, DC 20037.\n       2. On December 19, 1997, I was served with a subpoena from \n     the plaintiff to give a deposition and to produce documents \n     in the lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin Jones against President \n     William Jefferson Clinton and Danny Ferguson.\n       3. I can not fathom any reason that the plaintiff would \n     seek information from me for her case.\n       4. I have never met Ms. Jones, nor do I have any \n     information regarding the events she alleges occurred at the \n     Excelsior Hotel on May 8, 1991 or any other information \n     concerning any of the allegations in her case.\n       5. I worked at the White House in the summer of 1995 as a \n     White House intern. Beginning in December, 1995, I worked in \n     the Office of Legislative Affairs as a staff assistant for \n     correspondence. In April, 1996, I accepted a job as assistant \n     to the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the U.S. \n     Department of Defense. I maintained that job until December \n     26, 1997. I am currently unemployed but seeking a new job.\n       6. In the course of my employment at the White House, I met \n     President Clinton on several occasions. I do not recall ever \n     being alone with the President, although it is possible that \n     while working in the White House Office of Legislative \n     Affairs I may have presented him with a letter for his \n     signature while no one else was present. This would have \n     lasted only a matter of minutes.\n       7. I have the utmost respect for the President who has \n     always behaved appropriately in my presence.\n       8. I have never had a sexual relationship with the \n     President, he did not propose that we have a sexual \n     relationship, he did not offer me employment or other \n     benefits in exchange for a sexual relationship, he did not \n     deny me employment or other benefits for rejecting a sexual \n     relationship. I do not know of any other person who had a \n     sexual relationship with the President, was offered \n     employment or other benefits in exchange for a sexual \n     relationship, or was denied employment or other benefits for \n     rejecting a sexual relationship. The occasions that I saw the \n     President, with crowds of other people, after I left my \n     employment at the White House in April, 1996 related to \n     official receptions, formal functions or events related to \n     the U.S. Department of Defense, where I was working at the \n     time. There were other people present on all of these \n     occasions.\n       9. Since I do not possess any information that could \n     possibly be relevant to the allegations made by Paula Jones \n     or lead to admissible evidence in this case, I asked my \n     attorney to provide this affidavit to plaintiff's counsel. \n     Requiring my deposition in this matter would cause \n     unwarranted attorney's fees and costs, disruption of my life, \n     especially since I am looking for employment, and constitute \n     an invasion of my right to privacy.\n       I declare under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing \n     is true and correct.\n                                               Monica S.

CONCLUSION\n\n        TRIAL MEMORANDUM OF PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       Twenty-six months ago, more than 90 million Americans left \n     their homes and work places to travel to schools, church \n     halls and other civic centers to elect a President of the \n     United States. And on January 20, 1997, William Jefferson \n     Clinton was sworn in to serve a second term of office for \n     four years.\n       The Senate, in receipt of Articles of Impeachment from the \n     House of Representatives, is now gathered in trial to \n     consider whether that decision should be set aside for the \n     remaining two years of the President's term. It is a power \n     contemplated and authorized by the Framers of the \n     Constitution, but never before employed in our nation's \n     history. The gravity of what is at stake--the democratic \n     choice of the American people--and the solemnity of the \n     proceedings dictate that a decision to remove the President \n     from office should follow only from the most serious of \n     circumstances and should be done in conformity with \n     Constitutional standards and in the interest of the Nation \n     and its people.\n       The Articles of Impeachment that have been exhibited to the \n     Senate fall far short of what the Founding Fathers had in \n     mind when they placed in the hands of the Congress the power \n     to impeach and remove a President from office. They fall far \n     short of what the American people demand be shown and proven \n     before their democratic choice is reversed. And they even \n     fall far short of what a prudent prosecutor would require \n     before presenting a case to a judge or jury.\n       Take away the elaborate trappings of the Articles and the \n     high-flying rhetoric that has accompanied them, and we see \n     clearly that the House of Representatives asks the Senate to \n     remove the President from office because he:\n        used the phrase ``certain occasions'' to describe \n     the frequency of his improper intimate contacts with Ms. \n     Monica Lewinsky. There were, according to the House Managers, \n     eleven such contacts over the course of approximately 500 \n     days.\n       Should the will of the people be overruled and the \n     President of the United States be removed from office because \n     he used the phrase ``certain occasions'' to describe eleven \n     events over some 500 days? That is what the House of \n     Representatives asks the Senate to do.\n        used the word ``occasional'' to describe the \n     frequency of inappropriate telephone conversations between he \n     and Monica Lewinsky. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President \n     and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in between ten and fifteen such \n     conversations spanning a 23-month period.\n       Should the will of the people be overruled and the \n     President of the United States be removed from office because \n     he used the word ``occasional'' to describe up to 15 \n     telephone calls over a 23-month period? That is what the \n     House of Representatives asks the Senate to do.\n        said the improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky \n     began in early 1996, while she recalls that it began in \n     November 1995. And he said the contact did not include \n     touching certain parts of her body, while she said it did.\n       Should the will of the people be overruled and the \n     President of the United States be removed from office because \n     two people have a\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\n     different recollection of the details of a wrongful \n     relationship--which the President has admitted? That is what \n     the House of Representatives asks the Senate to do.\n       The Articles of Impeachment are not limited to the examples \n     cited above, but the other allegations of wrongdoing are \n     similarly unconvincing. There is the charge that the \n     President unlawfully obstructed justice by allegedly trying \n     to find a job for Monica Lewinsky in exchange for her silence \n     about their relationship. This charge is made despite the \n     fact that no one involved in the effort to find work for Ms. \n     Lewinsky--including Ms. Lewinsky herself--testifies that \n     there was any connection between the job search and the \n     affidavit. Indeed, the basis for that allegation, Ms. \n     Lewinsky's statements to Ms. Tripp, was expressly repudiated \n     by Ms. Lewinsky under oath.\n       There is also the charge that the President conspired to \n     obstruct justice by arranging for Ms. Lewinsky to hide gifts \n     that he had given her, even though the facts and the \n     testimony contain no evidence that he did so. In fact, the \n     evidence shows that the President gave her new gifts on the \n     very day that the articles allege he conspired to conceal his \n     gifts to her.\n       In the final analysis, the House is asking the Senate to \n     remove the President because he had a wrongful relationship \n     and sought to keep the existence of that relationship \n     private.\n       Nothing said in this Trial Memorandum is intended to excuse \n     the President's actions. By his own admission, he is guilty \n     of personal failings. As he has publicly stated, ``I don't \n     think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned.'' He \n     has misled his family, his friends, his staff, and the Nation \n     about the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He \n     hoped to avoid exposure of personal wrongdoing so as to \n     protect his family and himself and to avoid public \n     embarrassment. He has acknowledged that his actions were \n     wrong.\n       By the same token, these actions must not be \n     mischaracterized into a wholly groundless excuse for removing \n     the President from the office to which he was twice elected \n     by the American people. The allegations in the articles and \n     the argument in the House Managers' Trial Memorandum do not \n     begin to satisfy the stringent showing required by our \n     Founding Fathers to remove a duly elected President from \n     office, either as a matter of fact or law.\n\n\n a. the constitutional standard for impeachment has not been satisfied\n\n       There is strong agreement among constitutional and legal \n     scholars and historians that the substance of the articles \n     does not amount to impeachable offenses. On November 6, 1998, \n     430 Constitutional law professors wrote:\n\n       ``Did President Clinton commit `high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors' warranting impeachment under the Constitution? \n     We . . . believe that the misconduct alleged in the report of \n     the Independent Counsel . . . does not cross the threshold. . \n     . . [I]t is clear that Members of Congress could violate \n     their constitutional responsibilities if they sought to \n     impeach and remove the President for misconduct, even \n     criminal misconduct, that fell short of the high \n     constitutional standard required for impeachment.''\n\n       On October 28, 1998, more than 400 historians issued a \n     joint statement warning that because impeachment had \n     traditionally been reserved for high crimes and misdemeanors \n     in the exercise of executive power, impeachment of the \n     President based on the facts alleged in the OIC Referral \n     would set a dangerous precedent. ``If carried forward, they \n     will leave the Presidency permanently disfigured and \n     diminished, at the mercy as never before of caprices of any \n     Congress. The Presidency, historically the center of \n     leadership during our great national ordeals, will be \n     crippled in meeting the inevitable challenges of the \n     future.''\n       We address why the charges in the two articles do not rise \n     to the level of `high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' in Section \n     III, Constitutional Standard and Burden of Proof.\n\n\n      B. The President Did Not Commit Perjury or Obstruct Justice\n\n       Article I alleges perjury before a federal grand jury. \n     Article II alleges obstruction of justice. Both perjury and \n     obstruction of justice are statutory crimes. In rebutting the \n     allegations contained in the articles of impeachment, this \n     brief refers to the facts as well as to laws, legal \n     principles, court decisions, procedural safeguards, and the \n     Constitution itself. Those who seek to remove the President \n     speak of the ``rule of law.'' Among the most fundamental \n     rules of law are the principles that those who accuse have \n     the burden of proof, and those who are accused have the right \n     to defend themselves by relying on the law, established \n     procedures, and the Constitution. These principles are not \n     ``legalisms'' but rather the very essence of the ``rule of \n     law'' that distinguishes our Nation from others.\n       We respond, in detail, to those allegations whose substance \n     we can decipher in Section IV, The President Should Be \n     Acquitted on Article I, and in Section V, The President \n     Should Be Acquitted on Article II.\n\n\n                   C. Compound Charges and Vagueness\n\n       If there were any doubt that the House of Representatives \n     has utterly failed in its constitutional responsibility to \n     the Senate and to the President, that doubt vanishes upon \n     reading the Trial Memorandum submitted by the House Managers. \n     Having proferred two articles of impeachment, each of which \n     unconstitutionally combines multiple offenses and fails to \n     give even minimally adequate notice of the charges it \n     encompasses, the House--three days before the Managers are to \n     open their case--is still expanding, not refining, the scope \n     of those articles. In further violation of the most basic \n     constitutional principles, their brief advances, merely as \n     ``examples,'' nineteen conclusory allegations--eight of \n     perjury under Article I and eleven of obstruction of justice \n     under Article II, some of which have never appeared before, \n     even in the Report submitted by the Judiciary Committee \n     (``Committee Report''), much less in the Office of \n     Independent Counsel (``OIC'') Referral or in the articles \n     themselves.\\1\\ If the target the Managers present to the \n     Senate and to the President is still moving now, what can the \n     President expect in the coming days? Is there any point at \n     which the President will be given the right accorded a \n     defendant in the most minor criminal case--to know with \n     certainty the charges against which he must defend?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ For example, the House managers add a charge that the \n     President engaged in ``legalistic hair splitting [in his \n     response to the 81 questions] in an obvious attempt to skirt \n     the whole truth and to deceive and obstruct'' the Committee. \n     This charge was specifically rejected by the full House of \n     Representatives when it rejected Article IV.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Senate, we know, fully appreciates these concerns and \n     has, in past proceedings, dealt appropriately with articles \n     far less flawed than these. The constitutional concerns \n     raised by the House's action are addressed in Section VI, The \n     Structural Deficiencies of the Articles Preclude a \n     Constitutionally Sound Vote.\n\n                             II. Background\n\n\n                A. The Whitewater Investigative Dead-End\n\n       The Lewinsky investigation emerged in January 1998 from the \n     long-running Whitewater investigation. On August 5, 1994, the \n     Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Court Circuit appointed Kenneth W. \n     Starr as Independent Counsel to conduct an investigation \n     centering on two Arkansas entities, Whitewater Development \n     Company, Inc., and Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan \n     Association.\n       In the spring of 1997, OIC investigators, without any \n     expansion of jurisdiction, interviewed Arkansas state \n     troopers who had once been assigned to the Governor's \n     security detail, and ``[t]he troopers said Starr's \n     investigators asked about 12 to 15 women by name, including \n     Paula Corbin Jones. . . .'' Woodward & Schmidt, ``Starr \n     Probes Clinton Personal Life,'' The Washington Post (June 25, \n     1997) at A1 (emphasis added). ``The nature of the questioning \n     marks a sharp departure from previous avenues of inquiry in \n     the three-year old investigation. . . . Until now, . . . what \n     has become a wide-ranging investigation of many aspects of \n     Clinton's governorship has largely steered clear of questions \n     about Clinton's relationships with women. . . .'' \\2\\ One of \n     the most striking aspects of this new phase of the Whitewater \n     investigation was the extent to which it focused on the Jones \n     case. One of the troopers interviewed declared, ``[t]hey \n     asked me about Paula Jones, all kinds of questions about \n     Paula Jones, whether I saw Clinton and Paula together and how \n     many times.'' \\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Ibid. Trooper Roger Perry, a 21-year veteran of the \n     Arkansas state police, stated that he ``was asked about the \n     most intimate details of Clinton's life: `I was left with the \n     impression that they wanted me to show he was a womanizer. . \n     . . All they wanted to talk about was women.' '' Ibid. \n     (Ellipsis in original).\n     \\3\\ Ibid. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In his November 19, 1998, testimony before the House \n     Judiciary Committee, Mr. Starr conceded that his agents had \n     conducted these interrogations and acknowledged that at that \n     time, he had not sought expansion of his jurisdiction from \n     either the Special Division or the Attorney General.\\4\\ Mr. \n     Starr contended that these inquiries were somehow relevant to \n     his Whitewater investigation: ``we were, in fact \n     interviewing, as good prosecutors, good investigators do, \n     individuals who would have information that may be relevant \n     to our inquiry about the President's involvement in \n     Whitewater, in Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and the \n     like.''\\5\\ It seems irrefutable, however, that the OIC was in \n     fact engaged in an unauthorized attempt to gather \n     embarrassing information about the President--information \n     wholly unrelated to Whitewater or Madison Guaranty Savings \n     and Loan, but potentially relevant to the lawsuit filed by \n     Paula Jones.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\4\\ Transcript of November 19, 1998 House Judiciary Committee \n     Hearing at 377-378.\n     \\5\\ Ibid. at 378.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                     B. The Paula Jones Litigation\n\n       The Paula Jones lawsuit made certain allegations about \n     events she said had occurred three years earlier, in 1991, \n     when the President was Governor of Arkansas. Discovery in the \n     case had been stayed until the Supreme Court's decision on \n     May 27, 1997, denying the President temporary immunity from \n     suit.\\6\\ Shortly thereafter, Ms. Jones' legal team began a \n     public relations offensive against the President, headed by \n     Ms. Jones' new spokesperson, Mr. Susan Carpenter-McMillan, \n     and her new counsel affiliated with the conservation \n     Rutherford Institute.\\7\\ ``I will\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\n     never deny that when I first heard about this case I said, \n     ``Okay, good. We're gonna get that little slimeball,' said \n     Ms. Carpenter-McMillan.''\\8\\ While Ms. Jones' previous \n     attorneys, Messrs. Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata, had \n     largely avoided the media, as the Jones civil suit \n     increasingly became a partisan vehicle to try to damage the \n     President, public personal attacks became the order of the \n     day.\\9\\ As is now well known, this effort led ultimately to \n     the Jones lawyers being permitted to subpoena various women, \n     to discover the nature of their relationship, if any, with \n     the President, allegedly for the purpose of determining \n     whether they had information relevant to the sexual \n     harassment charge. Among these women was Ms. Lewinsky.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681 (1997).\n     \\7\\ Ms. Jones was described as having ``accepted financial \n     support of a Virginia conservative group,'' which intended to \n     ``raise $100,000 or more on Jones's behalf, although the \n     money will go for expenses and not legal fees.'' ``Jones \n     Acquires New Lawyers and Backing,'' The Washington Post \n     (October 2, 1998) at A1. Jones' new law firm, the Dallas-\n     based Radar, Campbell, Fisher and Pyke, had ``represented \n     conservatives in antiabortion cases and other causes.'' Ibid. \n     See also Dallas Lawyers Agree to Take on Paula Jones' Case--\n     Their Small Firm Has Ties to Conservative Advocacy Group,'' \n     The Los Angeles Times (Oct. 2, 1997) (Rutherford Institute a \n     ``conservative advocacy group.'').\n     \\8\\ ``Cause Celebre: An Antiabortion Activist Makes Herself \n     the Unofficial Mouthpiece for Paula Jones.''

At that time, the OIC \n     investigation began to intrude formally into the Jones case: \n     the OIC met with Ms. Tripp through the week of January 12, \n     and with her cooperation taped Ms. Lewinsky discussing the \n     Jones case and the President. Ms. Tripp also informed the OIC \n     that she had been surreptitiously taping conversations with \n     Ms. Lewinsky in violation of Maryland law, and in exchange \n     for her cooperation, the OIC promised Ms. Tripp immunity from \n     federal prosecution, and assistance in protecting her from \n     state prosecution.\\10\\ On Friday, January 16, after Ms. Tripp \n     wore a body wire and had taped conversations with Ms. \n     Lewinsky for the OIC, the OIC received jurisdiction from the \n     Attorney General and formalized an immunity agreement with \n     Ms. Tripp in writing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\10\\ Supplemental Materials to the Referral to the United \n     States House of Representatives Pursuant to Title 28, United \n     States Code Section 595(C), H.

Starr in \n     Conformity with the Requirements of Title 28, United States \n     Code, Section 595(c), at 1 (House Judiciary Committee) \n     (printed September 11, 1998).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The House Judiciary held a total of four hearings and \n     called but one witness: Kenneth W. Starr. The Committee \n     allowed the President's lawyers two days in which to present \n     a defense. The White House presented four panels of \n     distinguished expert witnesses who testified that the facts, \n     as alleged, did not constitute an impeachable offense, did \n     not reveal an abuse of power, and would not support a case \n     for perjury or obstruction of justice that any reasonable \n     prosecutor would bring. White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff \n     presented argument to the Committee on behalf of the \n     President, which is incorporated into this Trial Memorandum \n     by reference.\\19\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\19\\ Also incorporated by reference into this Trial \n     Memorandum are the four prior submissions of the President to \n     the House of Representatives: Preliminary Memorandum \n     Concerning Referral of Office of Independent Counsel \n     (September 11, 1998) (73 pages); Initial Response to Referral \n     of Office of Independent Counsel (September 12, 1998) (42 \n     pages); Memorandum Regarding Standards of Impeachment \n     (October 2, 1998) (30 pages); Submission by Counsel for \n     President Clinton to the Committee on the House Judiciary of \n     the United States House of Representatives (December 8, 1998) \n     (184 pages).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On December 11 and 12, the Judiciary Committee voted \n     essentially along party lines to approve four articles of \n     impeachment. Republicans defeated the alternative resolution \n     of censure offered by certain Committee Democrats. Almost \n     immediately after censure failed in the Committee, the House \n     Republican leadership declared publicly that no censure \n     proposal would be considered by the full House when it \n     considered the articles of impeachment.\\20\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\20\\ See Baker & Eilperin, ``GOP Blocks Democrats' Bid to \n     Debate Censure in House: Panel Votes Final, Trimmed Article \n     of Impeachment,'' The Washington Post (Dec. 13, 1998) at A1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On December 19, 1998, voting essentially on party lines, \n     the House of Representatives approved two articles of \n     impeachment: Article I, which alleged perjury before the \n     grand jury, passed by a vote of 228 to 206 and Article III, \n     which alleged obstruction of justice, passed by a vote of 221 \n     to 212. The full House defeated two other Articles: Article \n     II, which alleged that the President committed perjury in his \n     civil deposition, and Article IV, which alleged abuse of \n     power. Consideration of a censure resolution was blocked, \n     even though members of both parties had expressed a desire to \n     vote on such an option.\n       From beginning to end the House process was both partisan \n     and unfair.

The Senate Has a Constitutional Duty to Confront the \n         Question Whether Impeachable Offenses Have Been Alleged\n       It is the solemn duty of the Senate to consider the \n     question whether the articles state an impeachable \n     offense.\\24\\ That Constitutional question has not, in the \n     words of one House Manager, ``already been resolved by the \n     House.'' \\25\\ To the contrary, that question now awaits the \n     Senate's measured consideration and independent judgment. \n     Indeed, throughout our history, resolving this question has \n     been an essential part of the Senate's constitutional \n     obligation to ``try all Impeachments.''

The Constitution Requires a High Standard of Proof of \n         ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' for Removal\n       a. The Constitutional Text and Structure Set an \n           Intentionally High Standard for Removal\n       The Constitution provides that the President shall be \n     removed from office only upon ``Impeachment for, and \n     Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.'' U.S. Constitution, Art. II, section 4. The \n     charges fail to meet the high standard that the Framers \n     established.\\27\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\27\\ For a more complete discussion of the Standards for \n     Impeachment, please see Submission by Counsel for President \n     Clinton to the House Judiciary of the United States House of \n     Representatives at 24-43 (December 8, 1998); Memorandum \n     Regarding Standards of Impeachment (October 2, 1998); and \n     Impeachment of William Jefferson, President of the United \n     States, Report of the Committee on the Judiciary to Accompany \n     H.

References to pages 329-406 of the Committee Report \n     will be cited hereinafter as ``Minority Report.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The syntax of the Constitutional standard ``Treason, \n     Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (emphasis \n     added) strongly suggests, by the interpretive principle \n     noscitur a sociis,28 that, to be impeachable \n     offenses, high crimes and misdemeanors must be of the \n     seriousness of ``Treason'' and ``Bribery.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\28\\ `` `It is known from its associates' . . . the meaning \n     of a word is or may be known from the accompanying words.'' \n     Black's Law Dictionary 1209 (4th ed. 1968).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Our Constitutional structure reaffirms that the standard \n     must be a very high one. Ours is a Constitution of separated \n     powers. In that Constitution, the President does not serve at \n     the will of Congress, but as the directly elected,\\29\\ \n     solitary head of the Executive Branch. The Constitution \n     reflects a judgment that a strong Executive, executing the \n     law independently of legislative will, is a necessary \n     protection for a free people.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\29\\ Of course, that election takes place through the \n     mediating activity of the Electoral College. See U.S. Const. \n     Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 2-3 and Amend. XII.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       These elementary facts of constitutional structure \n     underscore the need for a very high standard for impeachment. \n     The House Managers, in their Brief, suggest that the failure \n     to remove the President would raise the standard for \n     impeachment higher than the Framers intended. They say that \n     if the Senate does not remove the President, ``The bar will \n     be so high that only a convicted felon or a traitor will need \n     to be concerned.'' But that standard is just a modified \n     version of the plain language of Article II, Section 4 of the \n     Constitution, which says a President can only be impeached \n     and removed for ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.'' The Framers wanted a high bar. It was not the \n     intention of the Framers that the President should be subject \n     to the will of the dominant legislative party. As Alexander \n     Hamilton said in a warning against the politicization of \n     impeachment: ``There will always be the greater danger that \n     the decision will be regulated more by comparative strength \n     of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or \n     guilt.'' Federalist 65. Our system of government does not \n     permit Congress to unseat the President merely because it \n     disagrees with his behavior or his policies. The Framers' \n     decisive rejection of parliamentary government is one reason \n     they caused the phrase ``Treason, Bribery or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors'' to appear in the Constitution \n     itself. They chose to specify those categories of offenses \n     subject to the impeachment power, rather than leave that \n     judgment to the unfettered whim of the legislature.\n       Any just and proper impeachment process must be reasonably \n     viewed by the public as arising from one of those rare cases \n     when the Legislature is compelled to stand in for all the \n     people and remove a President whose continuation in office \n     threatens grave harm to the Republic. Indeed, it is not \n     exaggeration to say--as a group of more than 400 leading \n     historians and constitutional scholars publicly stated--that \n     removal on these articles would ``mangle the system of checks \n     and balances that is our chief safeguard against abuses of \n     public power.'' \\30\\ Removal of the President on these \n     grounds would defy the constitutional presumption that the \n     removal power rests with the people in elections, and it \n     would do incalculable damage to the institution of the \n     Presidency. If ``successful,'' removal here ``will leave the \n     Presidency permanently disfigured and diminished, at the \n     mercy as never before of the caprices of any Congress.'' \\31\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\30\\ Statement of Historians in Defense of the Constitution \n     (Oct. 28, 1998) (``Statement of Historians''); see also \n     Schmitt, ``Scholars and Historians Assail Clinton Impeachment \n     Inquiry,'' The New York Times (Oct. 19, 1998) at A18.\n     \\31\\ Statement of Historians.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Framers made the President the sole nationally elected \n     public official (together with the Vice-President), \n     responsible to all the people. Therefore, when articles of \n     impeachment have been exhibited, the Senate confronts this \n     inescapable question: is the alleged misconduct so profoundly \n     serious, so malevolent to our Constitutional system, that it \n     justifies undoing the people's decision? Is the wrong alleged \n     of a sort that not only demands removal of the President \n     before the ordinary electoral cycle can do its work, but also \n     justifies the national trauma that accompanies the \n     impeachment trial process itself? The wrongdoing alleged here \n     does not remotely meet that standard.\n       b. The Framers Believed that Impeachment and Removal Were \n           Appropriate Only for Offenses Against the System of \n           Government\n       ``[H]igh Crimes and Misdemeanors'' refers to nothing short \n     of Presidential actions that are ``great and dangerous \n     offenses'' or ``attempts to subvert the Constitution.'' \\32\\ \n     Impeachment was never intended to be a remedy for private \n     wrongs. It was intended to be a method of removing a \n     President whose continued presence in the Office would cause \n     grave danger to the Nation and our Constitutional system of \n     government.\\33\\ Thus, ``in all but the most extreme \n     instances, impeachment should be limited to abuse of public \n     office, not private misconduct unrelated to public office.'' \n     \\34\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\32\\ George Mason, 2 Farrand, The Records of the Federal \n     Convention of 1787 550 (Rev. ed. 1966).\n     \\33\\ As the 1975 Watergate staff report concluded \n     ``Impeachment is the first step in remedial process--removal \n     from office and possible disqualification from holding future \n     office. The purpose of impeachment is not personal \n     punishment; its function is primarily to maintain \n     constitutional government. . . .

As scholar and Justice James Wilson \n     wrote, ``our President . . . is amendable to [the laws] in \n     his private character as a citizen, and in his public \n     character by impeachment.'' \\35\\ As such, impeachment is \n     limited to certain forms of wrongdoing. Alexander\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\n     Hamilton described the subject of the Senate's impeachment \n     jurisdiction as ``those offenses which proceed from the \n     misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or \n     violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which \n     may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they \n     relate chiefly to injuries done to the society itself.'' \n     36\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\35\\ 2 Elliot, The Debate in the Several State Conventions on \n     the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 480 (reprint of 2d \n     ed.)\n     \\36\\ The Federalist No. 65 at 331 (Gary Wills ed. 1982).

(reprint of 1st ed. 1833).\n\n       The Framers ``intended that a president be removable from \n     office for the commission of great offenses against the \n     Constitution.'' \\37\\ Impeachment therefore addresses public \n     wrongdoing, whether denominated a ``political crime [  ] \n     against the state,'' \\38\\ or ``an act of malfeasance or abuse \n     of office,'' \\39\\ or a ``great offense [  ] against the \n     federal government.'' \\40\\ Ordinary civil and criminal wrongs \n     can be addressed through ordinary judicial processes. And \n     ordinary political wrongs can be addressed at the ballot box \n     and by public opinion. Impeachment is reserved for the most \n     serious public misconduct, those aggravated abuses of \n     executive power that, given the President's four-year term, \n     might otherwise go unchecked.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\37\\ John Labovitz, Presidential Impeachment 94 (1978).\n     \\38\\ Raoul Berger, Impeachment 61 (1973).\n     \\39\\ Rotunda, An Essay on the Constitutional Parameters of \n     Federal Impeachment, 76 Ky.

Past Precedents Confirm that Allegations of Dishonesty Do \n         Not Alone State Impeachable Offenses\n       Because impeachment of a President nullifies the popular \n     will of the people, as evidence by an election, it must be \n     used with great circumspection. As applicable precedents \n     establish, it should not be used to punish private \n     misconduct.\n       a. The Fraudulent Tax Return Allegation Against President \n           Nixon\n       Five articles of impeachment were proposed against then-\n     President Nixon by the Judiciary Committee of the House of \n     Representatives in 1974. Three were approved and two were \n     not. The approved articles alleged official wrongdoing. \n     Article I charged President Nixon with ``using the powers of \n     his high office [to] engage [  ] . . . in a course of conduct \n     or plan designed to delay, impede and obstruct'' the \n     Watergate investigation.\\41\\ Article II described the \n     President as engaging in ``repeated and continuing abuse of \n     the powers of the Presidency in disregard of the fundamental \n     principle of the rule of law in our system of government'' \n     thereby ``us[ing] his power as President to violate the \n     Constitution and the law of the land.'' \\42\\ Article III \n     charged the President with refusing to comply with Judiciary \n     Committee subpoenas in frustration of a power necessary to \n     ``preserve the integrity of the impeachment process itself \n     and the ability of Congress to act as the ultimate safeguard \n     against improper Presidential conduct.'' \\43\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\41\\ Impeachment of Richard M.

The President was alleged to have failed to \n     report certain income, to have taken improper tax deductions, \n     and to have manufactured (either personally or through his \n     agents) false documents to support the deductions taken.\n     \\45\\ Given the underlying facts, that act might have provided \n     the basis for multiple criminal charges; conviction on, for \n     example, the tax evasion charge, could have subjected \n     President Nixon to a 5-year prison term.\n     \\46\\ See Nixon Report at 344 (``the Committee was told by a \n     criminal fraud tax expert that on the evidence presented to \n     the Committee, if the President were an ordinary taxpayer, \n     the government would seek to send him to jail'') (Statement \n     of Additional Views of Mr. Mezvinsky, et al.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Specifying the applicable standard for impeachment, the \n     majority staff concluded that ``[b]ecause impeachment of a \n     President is a grave step for the nation, it is to be \n     predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with \n     either the constitutional form and principles of our \n     government or the proper performance of constitutional duties \n     of the president office.'' \\47\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\47\\ Nixon Impeachment Inquiry at 26 (emphasis added).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       And the minority views of many Republican members were in \n     substantial agreement: ``the framers . . . were concerned \n     with preserving the government from being overthrown by the \n     treachery or corruption of one man. . . . [I]t is our \n     judgment, based upon this constitutional history, that the \n     Framers of the United States Constitution intended that the \n     President should be removable by the legislative branch only \n     for serious misconduct dangerous to the system of government \n     established by the Constitution.'' \\48\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\48\\ Nixon Report at 364-365 (Minority Views of Messrs. \n     Hutchinson, Smith, Sandman, Wiggins, Dennis, Mayne, Lott, \n     Moorhead, Maraziti and Latta).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The legal principle that impeachable offenses required \n     misconduct dangerous to our system of government provided one \n     basis for the Committee's rejection of the fraudulent-tax-\n     return charge. As Congressman Hogan (R-Md.) put the matter, \n     the Constitution's phrase ``high crime signified a crime \n     against the system of government, not merely a serious \n     crime,''\\49\\ As noted, the tax-fraud charge, involving an act \n     which did not demonstrate public misconduct, was rejected by \n     an overwhelming (and bipartisan) 26-12 margin.\\50\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\49\\ Id.

The Financial Misdealing Allegation Against Alexander \n           Hamilton\n       In 1792, Congress investigated Secretary of Treasury \n     Alexander Hamilton for alleged financial misdealings with a \n     convicted swindler. Hamilton had made payments to the \n     swindler and had urged his wife (Hamilton's paramour) to burn \n     incriminating correspondence. Members of Congress \n     investigated the matter and it came to the attention of \n     President Washington and future Presidents Adams, Jefferson, \n     Madison and Monroe.\n       This private matter was not deemed worthy of removing Mr. \n     Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury.\\51\\ Even when it \n     eventually became public, it was no barrier to Hamilton's \n     appointment to high position in the United States Army. \n     Although not insignificant, Hamilton's behavior was \n     essentially private. It was certain not regarded as \n     impeachable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\51\\ See generally Rosenfeld, ``Founding Fathers Didn't \n     Flinch,'' The Los Angeles Times (September 18, 1980).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     4. The Views of Prominent Historians and Legal Scholars \n         Confirm that Impeachable Offenses Are not Present\n       a. No Impeachable Offense Has Been Stated Here\n       There is strong agreement among consititutional scholars \n     and historians that the articles do not charge impeachable \n     offenses. As Professor Michael Gerhardt summarized in his \n     recent testimony before a subcommitte of the House of \n     Representatives, there is ``widespread recognition [of] a \n     paradigmatic case for impeachment.''\\52\\ In such a case, \n     ``there must be a nexus between the misconduct of an \n     impeachable official and the latter's official duties.''\\53\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\52\\ Statement of Professor Michael J. Gerhardt Before the \n     House Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Judiciary \n     Committee Regarding the Background and History of Impeachment \n     (November 9, 1998) at 13 (``Subcommittee Hearings'').\n     \\53\\Ibid. (emphasis added).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       There is no such nexus here. Indeed the allegations are so \n     far removed from official wrongdoing that their assertion \n     here threatens to weaken significantly the Presidency itself. \n     As the more than 400 prominent historians and constitutional \n     scholars warned in their public statement: ``[t]he theory of \n     impeachment underlying these efforts is unprecedented in our \n     history . . . [and is] are extremely ominous for the future \n     of our political insitutions. If carried forward, [the \n     current processes] will leave the Presidency permanently \n     disfigured and diminished, at the mercy as never before of \n     the caprices of any Congress.\\54\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\54\\ Statement of Historians.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Similarly, in a letter to the House of Representatives, an \n     extraordinary group of 430 legal scholars argued together \n     that these offenses, even if proven true, did not rise to the \n     level of an impeachable offense.\\55\\ The gist of these \n     scholarly objections is that the alleged wrongdoing is \n     insufficiently connected to the exercise of public office. \n     Because the articles charge wrongdoing of an essentially \n     private nature, any harm such behavior poses is too removed \n     from our system of government to justify unseating the \n     President. Numerous scholars, opining long before the current \n     controversy, have emphasized the necessary connection of \n     impeachable wrongs to threats against the state itself. They \n     have found that impeachment should be reserved for:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\55\\ See Letter of 430 Law Professors to Messrs.

Indeed the House Managers themselves acknowledge \n     that ``the President's [alleged] perjury and obstruction\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\n     do not directly involve his official conduct.'' 64\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\64\\ House Br. at 109.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       b. To Make Impeachable Offenses of These Allegations would \n           Forever Lower the Bar in a Way Inimical to the \n           Presidency and to Our Government of Separated powers\n       These articles allege (1) sexual misbehavior, (2) \n     statements about sexual misbehavior and (3) attempts to \n     conceal the fact of sexual misbehavior. These kinds of wrongs \n     are simply not subjects fit for impeachment. To remove a \n     President on this basis would lower the impeachment bar to an \n     unprecedented level and create a devastating precedent. As \n     Professor Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., addressing this problem, \n     has testified:\n       ``Lowering the bar for impeachment creates a novel . . . \n     revolutionary theory of impeachment, [and] . . . would send \n     us on an adventure with ominous implications for the \n     separation of powers that the Constitution established as the \n     basis of our political order. It would permanently weaken the \n     Presidency.'' 65\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\65\\ Subcommittee Hearings (Written Statement of Arthur \n     Schlesinger, Tr. at 2).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The lowering of the bar that Professor Schlesinger \n     described must stop here. Professor Jack Rakove made a \n     similar point when he stated that ``Impeachment [is] a remedy \n     to be deployed only in . . . unequivocal cases where . . . \n     the insult to the constitutional system is grave.'' \n     66 Indeed, he said, there ``would have to be a \n     high degree of consensus on both sides of the aisle in \n     Congress and in both Houses to proceed.'' 67\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\66\\ Subcommittee Hearings (Written Statement of Professor \n     Jack Rakove at 4).\n     \\67\\ Subcommittee Hearings (Oral Testimony of Professor \n     Rakove).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Bipartisan consensus was, of course, utterly lacking in the \n     House of Representatives. No civil officer--no President, no \n     judge, no cabinet member--has ever been impeached by so \n     narrow a margin as supported the articles exhibited \n     here.68 The closeness and partisan division of the \n     vote reflect the constitutionally dubious nature of the \n     charges.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\68\\ The present articles were approved by margins of 228-206 \n     (Article I) and 221-212 (Article II). All prior resolutions \n     were approved by substantially wider margins in the House of \n     Representatives. See Impeachments of the following civil \n     officers: Judge John Pickering (1803) (45-8; Justice Samuel \n     Chase (1804) (73-32; Judge James Peck (1830) 143-49; Judge \n     West Humphreys (1862) (no vote available, but resolution of \n     impeachment voted ``without division,'' see 3 Hinds \n     Precedents of the House of Representatives Sec. 2386); \n     President Andrew Johnson (1868) (128-47; Judge James Belknap \n     (1876) (unanimous); Judge Charles Swayne (1903) (unanimous); \n     Judge Robert Archbald (1912) (223-1); Judge George English \n     (1925) (306-62); Judge Harold Louderback (1932) (183--143); \n     Judge Halsted Ritter (1933) (181-146); Judge Harry Claiborne \n     (1986) (406-0); Judge Walter L. Nixon, Jr. (1988) (417-0); \n     Judge Alcee L. Hastings (1988) (413-3). The impeachment \n     resolution against Senator William Bount in 1797 was by voice \n     vote and so no specific count was recorded.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       When articles are based on sexual wrongdoing, and when they \n     have passed only by the narrowest, partisan margin, the \n     future of our constitutional politics is in the balance. The \n     very stability of our Constitutional government may depend \n     upon the Senate's response to these articles. Nothing about \n     this case justifies removal of a twice-elected President, \n     because no ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' are alleged.\n     5. Comparisons to Impeachment of Judges Are Wrong\n       The House Managers suggest that perjury per se is an \n     impeachable offense because (1) several federal judges have \n     been impeached and removed for perjury, and (2) those \n     precedents control this case. See House Br. at 95-105. That \n     notion is erroneous. It is blind both to the qualitative \n     differences among different allegations of perjury and the \n     very basic differences between federal judges and the \n     President.\n       First, the impeachment and removal of a Federal judge, \n     while a very solemn task, implicates very different \n     considerations than the impeachment of a president. Federal \n     judges are appointed without public approval and enjoy life \n     tenure without public accountability. Consequently, they hold \n     their offices under our Constitution only ``during good \n     behavior.'' Under our system, impeachment is the only way to \n     remove a Federal judge from office--even a Federal judge \n     sitting in jail.69 By contrast, a president is \n     elected by the Nation to a term, limited to a specified \n     number of years, and he faces accountability in the form of \n     elections.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\69\\ Former House Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino, \n     during a recent judicial impeachment proceeding, cogently \n     explained the unique position that Federal judges hold in our \n     Constitutional system:\n     ``The judges of our Federal courts occupy a unique position \n     of trust and responsibility in our government: They are the \n     only members of any branch that hold their office for life; \n     they are purposely insulated from the immediate pressures and \n     shifting currents of the body politic. But with the special \n     prerogative of judicial independence comes the most exacting \n     standard of public and private conduct . . . The high \n     standard of behavior for judges is inscribed in article III \n     of the Constitution, which provides that judges ``shall hold \n     offices during good behavior. . . .'' (132 Cong. Rec. H4712 \n     (July 22, 1986) (impeachment of Judge Harry E. Claiborne) \n     (emphasis added).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Second, whether an allegedly perjurious statement rises to \n     the level of an impeachable offense depends necessarily on \n     the particulars of that statement, and the relation of those \n     statements to the fulfillment of official responsibilities. \n     In the impeachment of Judge Harry Claiborne, the accused had \n     been convicted of filing false income tax returns.\\70\\ As a \n     judge, Claiborne was charged with the responsibility of \n     hearing tax-evasion cases. Once convicted, he simply could \n     not perform his official functions because his personal \n     probity had been impaired such that he could not longer be an \n     arbiter of others' oaths. His wrongdoing bore a direct \n     connection to the performance of his judicial tasks. The \n     inquiry into President Nixon disclosed similar wrongdoing, \n     but the House Judiciary Committee refused to approve an \n     article of impeachment against the President on that basis. \n     The case of Judge Walter Nixon is similar. He was convicted \n     of making perjurious statements concerning his intervention \n     in a judicial proceeding, which is to say, employing the \n     power and prestige of his office to obtain advantage for a \n     party.\\71\\ Although the proceeding at issue was not in his \n     court, his use of the judicial office for the private gain of \n     a party to a judicial proceeding directly implicated his \n     official functions. Finally, Judge Alcee Hastings was \n     impeached and removed for making perjurious statements at his \n     trial for conspiring to fix cases in his own court.\\72\\ As \n     with Judges Claiborne and Nixon, Judge Hastings' perjurious \n     statements were immediately and incurably detrimental to the \n     performance of his official duties. The allegations against \n     the President, which (as the Managers acknowledge) ``do not \n     directly involve his official conduct,'' House Br. at 109, \n     simply do not involve wrongdoing of gravity sufficient to \n     foreclose effective performance of the Presidential office.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\70\\ Proceedings of the United States Senate in the \n     Impeachment Trial of Harry E.

The practical reason was that it \n     seemed inappropriate to determine the fate of an elected \n     chief executive on the basis of law developed in proceedings \n     directed at petty misconduct by obscure judges. The legal \n     reason was that the Constitution provides that judges serve \n     during good behavior. . . . [T]he [good behavior] clause made \n     a difference in judicial impeachments, confounding the \n     application of these cases to presidential impeachment''.\\73\\\n\n     \\73\\ Labovitz, Presidential Impeachment at 92-93 (emphasis \n     added).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Thus, the judicial precedents relied upon by the House \n     Managers have only ``limited force when applied to the \n     impeachment of a President.''\\74\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\74\\ Office of Senate Legal Counsel, Memorandum on \n     Impeachment Issues at 26 (Oct. 7, 1988) (summarizing view of \n     some commentators).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The most telling rejoinder to the House's argument comes \n     from President Ford. His definition of impeachable offenses, \n     offered as a congressman in 1970 in connection with an effort \n     to impeach Associate Justice William O. Douglas--that it is, \n     in essence, ``whatever the majority of the House of \n     Representatives considers it to be''--has been cited. Almost \n     never noted is the more important aspect of then-Congressman \n     Ford's statement--that, in contrast to the life-tenure of \n     judges, because presidents can be removed by the electorate, \n     ``to remove them in midterm . . . would indeed require crimes \n     of the magnitude of treason and bribery.''\\75\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\75\\ 116 Cong. Rec. 11912, 11913, (1970).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                        b. the standard of proof\n\n       Beyond the question of what constitutes an impeachable \n     offense, each Senator must confront the question of what \n     standard the evidence must meet to justify a vote of \n     ``guilty.'' The Senate has, of course, addressed this issue \n     before--most recently in the trials of Judge Claiborne and \n     Judge Hastings. We recognize that the Senate chose in the \n     Claiborne proceedings, and reaffirmed in the Hastings trial, \n     not to impose itself any single standard of proof but, \n     rather, to leave that judgment to the conscience of each \n     senator. Many Senators here today were present for the debate \n     on this issue and chose a standard by which to test the \n     evidence. For many Senators, however, the issue is a new one. \n     And none previously has had to face the issue in the special \n     context of a Presidential impeachment.\n       We argued before the House Judiciary Committee that it must \n     treat a vote to impeach as, in effect, a vote to remove the \n     President from office and that a decision of such moment \n     ought not to be based on anything less than ``clear and \n     convincing'' evidence. That standard is higher than the \n     ``preponderance of the evidence'' test applicable to the \n     ordinary civil case but lower than the beyond a reasonable \n     doubt test applicable to a criminal case. Nonetheless, we \n     felt that the clear and convincing standard was consistent \n     with the grave responsibility of triggering a process that \n     might result in the removal of a president. In fact, it had \n     been the standard agreed upon by both Watergate Committee \n     majority and minority counsel (as well as counsel for \n     President Nixon) twenty-four years ago.\n       Certainly no lesser standard should be applied in the \n     Senate. Indeed, we submit that the gravity of the decision \n     the Senate must\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\n     reach should lead each Senator to go further and ask whether \n     the House has established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       Both lawyers and laymen too often treat the standard of \n     proof as meaningless legal jargon with no application to the \n     real world of difficult decisions. But it is much more than \n     that. In our system of justice, it is the guidepost that \n     shows the way through the labyrinth of conflicting evidence. \n     It tells the factfinder to look within and ask: ``Would I \n     make the most important decisions of my life based on the \n     degree of certainty I have about these facts?'' In the unique \n     legal-political setting of an impeachment trial, it protects \n     against partisan overreaching, and it assures the public that \n     this grave decision has been made with care. In sum, it is a \n     disciplining force to carry into the deliberations.\n       This point is given added weight by the language of the \n     Constitution. Article I, section 3, clause 6 of the United \n     States Constitution gives to the Senate ``the Power to try \n     all Impeachments. . . . and no Person shall be convicted \n     without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members \n     present.'' (Emphasis added.) Use of the words ``try'' and \n     ``convicted'' strongly suggests that an impeachment trial is \n     akin to a criminal proceeding and that the beyond-a-\n     reasonable-doubt standard of criminal proceedings should be \n     used. This position was enunciated in the Minority Views \n     contained in the Report of the House Judiciary Committee on \n     the impeachment proceedings against President Nixon (H.Rep. \n     93-1305 at 377-381) and has been espoused as the correct \n     standard by such Senators as Robert Taft, Jr., Sam Ervin, \n     Strom Thurmond and John Stennis.\\76\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\76\\ Claiborne Proceedings at 106-107.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Even if the clear and convincing standard nonetheless is \n     appropriate for judicial impeachments, it does not follow \n     that it should be applied where the Presidency itself is at \n     stake. With judges, the Senate must balance its concern for \n     the independence of the judiciary against the recognition \n     that, because judges hold life-time tenure, impeachment is \n     the only available means to protect the public against those \n     who are corrupt. On the other hand, when a President is on \n     trial, the balance to be struck is quite different. Here the \n     Senate is asked, in effect, to overturn the results of an \n     election held two years ago in which the American people \n     selected the head of one of the three coordinate branches of \n     government. It is asked to take this action in circumstances \n     where there is no suggestion of corruption or misuse of \n     office--or any other conduct that places our system of \n     government at risk in the two remaining years of the \n     President's term, when once again the people will judge who \n     they wish to lead them. In this setting, the evidence should \n     be tested by the most stringent standard we know--proof \n     beyond a reasonable doubt. Only then can the American people \n     be confident that this most serious of constitutional \n     decisions has been given the careful consideration it \n     deserves.\n\n           IV. The President Should Be Acquitted on Article I\n\n       The evidence does not support the allegations of Article I.\n\n\n                           a. applicable law\n\n       Article I alleges perjury, along with false and misleading \n     statements, before a federal grand jury. Perjury is a \n     statutory crime that is set forth in the United States Code \n     at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623.\\77\\ Before an accused may be found \n     guilty of perjury before a grand jury, a prosecutor most \n     prove all elements of the offense.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\77\\ Section 1623 provides in relevant part:\n     ``(a) Whoever under oath . . . in any proceeding before or \n     ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States \n     knowingly makes any false material declaration or makes or \n     uses any other information . . . knowing the same to contain \n     any false material declaration, shall be fined under this \n     title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'' (18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1623(a) (1994)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In the criminal law context, Sec. 1623 requires proof \n     beyond a reasonable doubt of the following elements: that an \n     accused (1) while under oath (2) knowingly (3) made a false \n     statement as to (4) material facts. The ``materiality'' \n     element is fundamental: it means that testimony given to a \n     grand jury may be found perjurious only if it had a tendency \n     to influence, impede, or hamper the grand jury's \n     investigation. See, e.g., United States v. Reilly, 33 F.3d \n     1396, 1419 (3d Cir. 1994); United States v. Barrett, 111 F.3d \n     947, 953 (D.C. Cir. 1997). If an answer provided to a grand \n     jury has no impact on the grand jury's investigation, or if \n     it relates to a subject that the grand jury is not \n     considering, it is incapable as a matter of law of being \n     perjurious. Thus, alleged false testimony concerning details \n     that a grand jury is not investigating cannot as a matter of \n     law constitute perjury, since such testimony by definition is \n     immaterial. See, e.g., United States v. Lasater, 535 F.2d \n     1041, 1048 (8th Cir. 1976) (where defendant admitted signing \n     letter and testified to its purpose, his denial of actually \n     writing letter was not material to grand jury investigation \n     and was incapable of supporting perjury charge); United \n     States v. Pyle, 156 F.2d 852, 856 (D.C. Cir. 1946) (details \n     such as whether defendant ``paid the rent on her Washington \n     apartment, as she testified that she did'' were ``not \n     pertinent to the issue being tried;'' therefore, ``the false \n     statement attributed to [defendant] was in no way material in \n     the case in which she made it and did not constitute perjury \n     within the meaning of the statute.'') In other words, mere \n     falsity--even knowing falsity--is not perjury if the \n     statement at issue is not ``material'' to the matter under \n     consideration.\n       An additional ``element'' of perjury prosecutions, at least \n     as a matter of prosecutorial practice, is that a perjury \n     conviction cannot rest solely on the testimony of one \n     witness. In United States v. Weiler, 323 U.S. 606, 608-09 \n     (1945), the Supreme Court observed that the ``special rule \n     which bars conviction for perjury solely upon the evidence of \n     a single witness is deeply rooted in past centuries.'' While \n     Sec. 1623 does not literally incorporate the so-called ``two-\n     witness'' rule, the case law makes clear that perjury \n     prosecutions under this statute require a high degree of \n     proof, and that prosecutors should not, as a matter of reason \n     and practicality, try to bring perjury prosecutions based \n     solely on the testimony of a single witness. As the Supreme \n     Court has cautioned, perjury cases should not rest merely \n     upon ``an oath against an oath.'' Id. at 609.\n       Indeed, that is exactly the point that experienced former \n     federal prosecutors made to the House Judiciary Committee. A \n     panel of former federal prosecutors, some Republican, \n     testified that they would not charge perjury based upon the \n     facts in this case. For example, Mr. Thomas Sullivan, a \n     former United States Attorney for the Northern District of \n     Illinois, told the Committee that ``the evidence set out in \n     the Starr report would not be prosecuted as a criminal case \n     by a responsible federal prosecutor.'' See Transcript of \n     ``Prosecutorial Standards for Obstruction of Justice and \n     Perjury'' Hearing (Dec. 9, 1998); see generally Minority \n     Report at 340-47. As Mr. Sullivan emphasized, ``because \n     perjury and obstruction charges often arise from private \n     dealings with few observers, the courts have required either \n     two witnesses who testified directly to the facts \n     establishing the crime, or, if only one witness testifies to \n     the facts constituting the alleged perjury, that there be \n     substantial corroborating proof to establish guilt.'' See \n     Transcript of ``Prosecutorial Standards for Obstruction of \n     Justice and Perjury'' Hearing (Dec. 9, 1998). The other \n     prosecutors on the panel agreed. Mr. Richard J. Davis, who \n     served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the \n     Southern District of New York and as a Task Force Leader for \n     the Watergate Special Prosecution Force, testified that ``it \n     is virtually unheard of to bring a perjury prosecution based \n     solely on the conflicting testimony of two people.'' Id. A \n     review of the perjury alleged here thus requires both careful \n     scrutiny of the materiality of any alleged falsehood and \n     vigilance against conviction merely on an ``oath against an \n     oath.'' Weiler, 323 U.S. at 609.\n\n\n                    b. structure of the allegations\n\n       Article I charges that the President committed perjury when \n     he testified before the grand jury on August 17, 1998. It \n     alleges he ``willfully provided perjurious, false and \n     misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning ``one or \n     more of the following: (1) the nature and details of his \n     relationship with a subordinate Government employee; (2) \n     prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in a \n     Federal civil rights action brought against him; (3) prior \n     false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney to \n     make to a Federal judge in that civil rights action; and (4) \n     his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses \n     and to impede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights \n     action.'' As noted above, the article does not provide \n     guidance on the particular statements alleged to be \n     perjurious, false and misleading. But by reference to the \n     different views in the House Committee Report, the \n     presentation of House Majority Counsel David Schippers, the \n     OIC Referral, and the Trial Memorandum of the House Managers, \n     we have attempted to identify certain statements from which \n     members of the House might have chosen.\n       Subpart (1) alleges that the President committed perjury \n     before the grand jury about the details of his relationship \n     with Ms. Lewinsky--including apparently such insignificant \n     matters as mis-remembering the precise month on which certain \n     inappropriate physical contact started, understating as \n     ``occasional'' his infrequent inappropriate physical and \n     telephone contacts with Ms. Lewinsky over a period of many \n     months, characterizing their relationship as starting as a \n     friendship, and touching Ms. Lewinsky in certain ways and for \n     certain purposes during their intimate encounters.\n       Subpart (2) of Article I alleges that the President made \n     perjurious, false and misleading statements to the grand jury \n     when he testified about certain responses he had given in the \n     Jones civil deposition. The House Managers erroneously \n     suggest that in the grand jury President Clinton was asked \n     about and reaffirmed his entire deposition testimony, \n     including his deposition testimony about whether he had been \n     alone with Ms. Lewinsky. See House Br. at 2, 60. That is \n     demonstrably false. Those statements that the President did \n     in fact make in the grand jury, by way of explaining his \n     deposition testimony, were truthful. Moreover, to the extent \n     this subpart repeats allegations of Article II of the \n     original proposed articles of impeachment, the full House of \n     Representatives has explicitly considered and specifically \n     rejected those charges, and their consideration would violate \n     the impeachment procedures mandated by the Constitution.\n       Subparts (3) and (4) allege that the President lied in the \n     grand jury when he testified about certain activities in late \n     1997 and early\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\n     1998. They are based on statements about conduct that the \n     House Managers claim constitutes obstruction of justice under \n     Article II and in many respects track Article II. Compare \n     Article I (3) (perjury in the grand jury concerning alleged \n     ``prior false and misleading statements he allowed his \n     attorney to make to a Federal judge'') with Article II (5) \n     (obstructing justice by ``allow[ing] his attorney to make \n     false and misleading statements to a Federal judge) and \n     compare Article I (4) (perjury in the grand jury concerning \n     alleged ``corrupt efforts to influence testimony of witnesses \n     and to impede the discovery of evidence'') with Article II \n     (3), (6), (7) (obstructing justice when he (3) ``engaged in, \n     encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal evidence,'' \n     i.e., gifts; (6) ``corruptly influence[d] the testimony'' of \n     Betty Currie; (7) ``made false and misleading statements to \n     potential witnesses in a Federal grand jury proceeding in \n     order to corruptly influence the testimony of those \n     witnesses''). These perjury allegations are without merit \n     both because the obstruction charges upon which they are \n     based are wrong and because the statements that President \n     Clinton made in the grand jury about these charges are true. \n     Because of the close parallel, and for sake of brevity in \n     this submission, we have dealt comprehensively with these \n     overlapping allegations in the next section addressing \n     Article II (obstruction of justice), and address them only \n     briefly in this section.\n\n\n         c. response to the particular allegations in article i\n\n       The president testified truthfully before the grand jury. \n     There must be no mistake about what the President said. He \n     admitted to the grand jury that he had engaged in an \n     inappropriate intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky over a \n     period of many months. He admitted to the grand jury that he \n     had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky. He admitted to the grand \n     jury that he had mislead his family, his friends and staff, \n     and the entire Nation about the nature of that relationship. \n     No one who heard the President's August 17 speech or watched \n     the President's videotaped grand jury testimony had any doubt \n     that he had admitted to an ongoing physical relationship with \n     Ms. Lewinsky.\n       The article makes general allegations about his testimony \n     but does not specify alleged false statements, so direct \n     rebuttal is impossible. In light of this uncertainty, we set \n     forth below responses to the allegations that have been made \n     by the House Managers, the House Committee, and the OIC, even \n     though they were not adopted in the article, in an effort to \n     try to respond comprehensively to the charges.\n     1. The President denies that he made materially false or \n         misleading statements to the grand jury about ``the \n         nature and details of his relationship'' with Monica \n         Lewinsky\n       (a) Early in his grand jury testimony, the President \n     specifically acknowleded that he had had a relationship with \n     Ms. Lewinsky that involved ``improper intimate contact.'' \n     App. at 461. He described how the relationship began and how \n     it ended early in 1997--long before any public attention or \n     scrutiny.\n       In response to the first question about Ms. Lewinsky, the \n     President read the following statement:\n\n       ``When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions \n     in early 1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct \n     that was wrong. These encounters did not consist of sexual \n     intercourse. They did not constitute sexual relations as I \n     understood that term to be defined at my January 17th, 1998 \n     deposition. But they did involve inappropriate intimate \n     contact.\n       ``These inappropriate encounteres ended, at my insistence, \n     in early 1997. I also had occasional telephone conversations \n     with Ms. Lewinsky that included inappropriate sexual banter.\n       ``I regret that what began as a friendship came to include \n     this conduct, and I take full responsibility for my actions.\n       ``While I will provide the grand jury whatever other \n     information I can, because of privacy considerations \n     affecting my family, myself, and others, and in an effort to \n     preserve the dignity of the office I hold, this is all I will \n     say about the specifics of these particular matters.\n       ``I will try to answer, to the best of my ability, other \n     questions including questions about my relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky; questions about my understanding of the term \n     `sexual relations', as I understood it to be denied at my \n     January 17th, 1998 deposition; and questions concerning \n     alleged subornation of perjury, obstruction of justice, and \n     intimidation of witnesses.''\n\n     App. at 460-62. The President occasionally referred back to \n     this statement--but only when asked very specific questions \n     about his physical relationship with Ms. Lewinsky--and he \n     otherwise responded fully to four hours of interrogation \n     about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, his answers in the \n     civil deposition, and his conduct surrounding the Jones \n     deposition.\n       The articles are silent on precisely what statements the \n     President made about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that \n     were allegedly perjurious. But between the House Brief and \n     the Committee Report, both drafted by the Managers, it \n     appears there are three aspects of this prepared statement \n     that are alleged to be false and misleading because Ms. \n     Lewinsky's recollection differs--albeit with respect to \n     certain very specific, utterly immaterial matters: first, \n     when the President admitted that inappropriate conduct \n     occurred ``on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in \n     1997,'' he allegedly committed perjury because in the \n     Managers' view, the first instance of inappropriate conduct \n     apparently occurred a few months prior to ``early 1996,'' see \n     House Br. at 53; second, when the President admitted to \n     inappropriate conduct ``on certain occasions in early 1996 \n     and once in 1997,'' he allegedly committed perjury because, \n     according to the House Committee, there were eleven total \n     sexual encounters and the term ``on certain occasions'' \n     implied something other than eleven. see Committee Report at \n     34; and third, when the President admitted that he ``had \n     occasional telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky that \n     included sexual banter,'' he allegedly committed perjury \n     because, according to the House Committee (although not Ms. \n     Lewinsky), seventeen conversations may have included sexually \n     explicit conversation, ibid. Apart from the fact that the \n     record itself refutes some of the allegations (for example, \n     seven of the seventeen calls were only ``possible,'' \n     according even to the OIC, App. at 116-26, and Ms. Lewinsky \n     recalled fewer than seventeen, App. at 744), simply to state \n     them is to reveal their utter immateriality. \\78\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\78\\ Even the OIC Referral did not allege perjury based on \n     these latter two theories and mentioned the first only \n     briefly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The President categorically denies that his prepared \n     statement was perjurious, false and misleading in any \n     respect. He offered his written statement to focus the \n     questioning in a manner that would allow the OIC to obtain \n     the information it needed without unduly dwelling on the \n     salacious details of his relationship. It preceded almost \n     four hours of follow-up questions about the relationship. It \n     is utterly remarkable that the Managers now find fault even \n     with the President's very painful public admission of \n     inappropriate conduct.\n       In any event, the charges are totally without merit. The \n     Committee Report takes issue with the terms ``on certain \n     occasions'' and ``occasional,'' but neither phrase implies a \n     definite or maximum number. ``On certain occasions''--the \n     phrase introducing discussion of the physical contacts--has \n     virtually no meaning other than ``it sometimes happened.'' It \n     is unfathomable what objective interpretation the Majority \n     gives to this phrase to suggest that it could be false. An \n     attack on the phrase ``occasional''--the phrase introducing \n     discussion of the inappropriate telephone contacts--is little \n     different. Dictionaries define ``occasional'' to mean \n     ``occurring at irregular or infrequent intervals'' or ``now \n     and then.'' \\79\\ It is a measure of the Committee Report's \n     extraordinary overreaching to suggest that the eleven \n     occasions of intimate contact alleged by the House Majority \n     over well more than a year did not occur, by any objective \n     reading, ``on certain occasions.'' And since even the OIC \n     Referral acknowledges that the inappropriate telephone \n     contact occurred not ``at least 17 times'' (as the Committee \n     Report and the Managers suggest, Committee Report at 8; House \n     Br. at 11) but between 10 and 15 times over a 23-month \n     period,\\80\\ ``occasional'' would surely seem not just a \n     reasonable description but the correct one.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\79\\ Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1997) p. 803; \n     see also Webster's II New Riverside Dictionary (1988) p. 812 \n     (``occurring from time to time; infrequent''); Chambers \n     English Dictionary (1988 ed.) p. 992 (``occurring \n     infrequently, irregularly, now and then''); The American \n     Heritage Dictionary (2d Coll. ed.) (``occurring from time to \n     time''); Webster's New World Dictionary (3d Coll. ed.) p. 937 \n     (``of irregular occurrence; happening now and then; \n     infrequent'').\n     \\80\\ The OIC chart of contacts between Ms. Lewinsky and the \n     President identifies ten phone conversations ``including \n     phone sex'' and seven phone conversations ``possibly'' \n     including phone sex. App. at 116-26.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Finally, these squabbles are utterly immaterial. Even if \n     the President and Ms. Lewinsky disagreed as to the precise \n     number of such encounters, it is of no consequence whatsoever \n     to anything, given his admission of their relationship. This \n     is precisely the kind of disagreement that the law does not \n     intend to capture as perjury.\n       The date of the first intimate encounter is also totally \n     immaterial. Having acknowledged the relationship, the \n     President had no conceivable motive to misstate the date on \n     which it began. The Managers assert that the President \n     committed perjury when he testified about when the \n     relationship began, but they offer no rationale for why he \n     would have done so.\\81\\ The President had already made a \n     painful admission. Any misstatement about when the intimate \n     relationship began (if there was a misstatement) cannot \n     justify a charge of perjury, let alone the removal of the \n     President from office. As Chairman Hyde himself stated in \n     reference to this latter allegation, ``It doesn't strike me \n     as a terribly\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\n     serious count.'' Remarks of Chairman Hyde at Perjury Hearing \n     of December 1, 1998.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\81\\  The Committee Report did not adopt the baseless surmise \n     of the OIC Referral, i.e., that the President lied about the \n     starting date of his relationship because Ms. Lewinsky was \n     still an intern at the time, whereas she later became a paid \n     employee. For good reason. The only support offered by the \n     Referral for this conjecture is a comment Ms. Lewinsky \n     attributes to the President in which he purportedly said that \n     her pink ``intern pass'' ``might be a problem.'' Referral at \n     149-50. But even Ms. Lewinsky indicated that the President \n     was not referring to her intern status, but rather was noting \n     that, as an intern with a pink ``intern pass,'' she had only \n     limited access to the West Wing of the White House. App. at \n     1567 (Lewinsky FBI 302 8/24/98). Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky had \n     in fact become an employee by late 1995, so even under the \n     OIC theory the President could have acknowledged such \n     intimate contact in 1995.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (b) The Managers also assert that the President lied when, \n     after admitting that he had an inappropriate sexual \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, he maintained that he did not \n     touch Ms. Lewinsky in a manner that met the definition used \n     in the Jones deposition. See House Br. at 54. The President \n     admits that he engaged in appropriate physical contact with \n     Ms. Lewinsky, but has testified that he did not engage in \n     activity that met the convoluted and truncated definition he \n     was presented in the Jones deposition.\\82\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\82\\ At the deposition, the Jones attorneys presented a \n     broad, three-part definition of the term ``sexual relations'' \n     to be used by them in the questioning. Judge Wright ruled \n     that two parts of the definition were ``too broad'' and \n     eliminated them. Dep. at 22. The President, therefore, was \n     presented with the following definition (as he understood it \n     to have been amended by the Court):\n     Definition of Sexual Relations--\n     For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in \n     ``sexual relations'' when the person knowingly engages in or \n     causes--\n     (1) contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner \n     thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or \n     gratify the sexual desire of any person;\n     (2) contact between any part of the person's body or an \n     object and the genitals and anus of another person; or\n     (3) contact between the genitals or anus of the person and \n     any part of another person's body.\n     ``Contact'' means intentional touching, either directly or \n     through clothing.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       It is important to note that this Jones definition was not \n     of the President's making. It was one provided to him by the \n     Jones' lawyers for their questioning of him. Under that \n     definition, oral sex performed by Ms. Lewinsky on the \n     President would not constitute sexual relations, while \n     touching certain areas of Ms. Lewinsky's body with the intent \n     to arouse her would meet the definition. The President \n     testified in the grand jury that believed that oral sex \n     performed on him fell outside the Jones definition. App. at \n     544.\\83\\ As strange as this may sound, a totally reasonable \n     reading of the definition supports that conclusion, as many \n     commentators have agreed.\\84\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\83\\ The Managers erroneously suggest that the President's \n     explanation of his understanding of the Jones deposition \n     definition of ``sexual relations'' is a recent fabrication \n     rather than an accurate account of his view at the time of \n     the deposition. House Br. at 54-55. To support this \n     contention, the Managers, among other meritless arguments, \n     point to a document produced by the White House entitled \n     ``January 24, 1998 Talking Points,'' stating that oral sex \n     would constitute a sexual relationship for the President. Id. \n     at 55. This document, however, was not created, reviewed or \n     approved by the President and did not represent his views. It \n     is irrelevant to the issue at hand for the additional reason \n     that it does not speak by its own terms to the meaning of the \n     contorted definition of ``sexual relations'' used in the \n     Jones deposition.\n     \\84\\ See, e.g., Perjury Hearing of December 1, 1998 \n     (Statement of Professor Stephen A. Saltzburg at 2) (``That \n     definition defined certain forms of sexual contact as sexual \n     relations but, for reasons known only to the Jones lawyers, \n     limited the definition to contact with any person for the \n     purpose of gratification.''); MSNBC Internight, August 12, \n     1998 (Cynthia Alksne) (``[W]hen the definition finally was \n     put before the president, it did not include the receipt of \n     oral sex''); ``DeLay Urges a Wait For Starr's Report,'' The \n     Washington Times (August 31, 1998) (``The definition of \n     sexual relations, used by lawyers for Paula Jones when they \n     questioned the president, was loosely worded and may not have \n     included oral sex''); ``Legally Accurate,'' The National Law \n     Journal (August 31, 1998) (``Given the narrowness of the \n     court-approved definition in [the Jones] case, Mr. Clinton \n     indeed may not have perjured himself back then if, say, he \n     received oral sex but did not reciprocate sexually'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       This claim comes down to an oath against an oath about \n     immaterial details concerning an acknowledged wrongful \n     relationship.\n     2. The President denies that he made perjurious, false and \n         misleading statements to the grand jury about testimony \n         he gave in the Jones case\n       First, it is important to understand that the allegation of \n     Article I that the President ``willfully provided false and \n     misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning . . . prior \n     perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in'' the \n     Jones deposition is premised on a misunderstanding of the \n     President's grand jury testimony. The President was not asked \n     to, and he did not, reaffirm his entire Jones deposition \n     testimony during his grand jury appearance. For example, \n     contrary to popular myth and the undocumented assertion of \n     the House Managers, House Br. at 2, the President was never \n     even asked in the grand jury about his answer to the \n     deposition question whether he and Ms. Lewinsky had been \n     ``together alone in the Oval Office.'' Dep. at 52-53,\\85\\ and \n     he therefore neither reaffirmed it nor even addressed it. In \n     fact, in the grand jury he was asked only about a small \n     handful of his answers in the deposition. As is demonstrated \n     below, his explanation of these answers were not \n     reaffirmations or in any respect evasive or misleading--they \n     were completely truthful, and they do not support a perjury \n     allegation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\85\\ The only questions the OIC asked the President about \n     being alone with Ms. Lewinsky did not reference the \n     deposition at all. Instead, the OIC asked the President to \n     elaborate on his acknowledgement in his prepared statement \n     before the grand jury that he had been alone with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, App. at 481, and to explain why he made a \n     statement, ``I was never alone with her'' to Ms. Currie on \n     January 18th. See, e.g., App. at 583.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The extent to which this allegation of the House Majority \n     misses the mark is dramatically apparent when it is compared \n     with the OIC's Referral. The OIC did not charge that the \n     President's statements about his prior deposition testimony \n     were perjurious (apart from the charge discussed above \n     concerning the nature and details of his relationship with \n     Ms. Lewinsky).\\86\\ See OIC Ref. at 145. It would be \n     remarkable to contemplate charges beyond those brought by the \n     OIC, particularly in the context of a perjury claim where the \n     OIC chose what to ask the President and itself conducted the \n     grand jury session.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\86\\ Specifically, the Referral alleges that the President \n     lied when he testified (1) that ``he believed that oral sex \n     was not covered by any of the terms and definitions for \n     sexual activity used at the Jones deposition''; (2) that \n     their physical contact was more limited than Ms. Lewinsky's \n     testimony suggests; and (3) that their intimate relationship \n     began in early 1996 and not late 1995. Id. at 148-49.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The House Managers point to a single statement made by \n     President Clinton in the grand jury to justify their \n     contention that every statement from his civil deposition is \n     now fair game. House Br. at 60. Specifically, the House \n     Managers rely on President Clinton's explanation in the grand \n     jury of his state of mind during the Jones deposition: ``My \n     goal in this deposition was to be truthful, but not \n     particularly helpful . . . I was determined to walk through \n     the mine field of this deposition without violating the law, \n     and I believe I did.'' App. at 532. In addition to being a \n     true statement of his belief as to his legal position, this \n     single remark plainly was not intended as and was not a broad \n     reaffirmation of the accuracy of all the statements the \n     President made during the Jones deposition. Indeed, given \n     that he told the grand jury that he had an intimate \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky during which he was alone with \n     her, no one who heard the grand jury testimony could have \n     understood it to be the unequivocal reaffirmation that is \n     alleged.\n       The Managers charge that the President did not really mean \n     it when he told the grand jury how he was trying to be \n     literally truthful in the Jones deposition without providing \n     information about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The \n     President had endeavored to navigate the deposition without \n     having to make embarrassing admissions about his \n     inappropriate, albeit consensual, relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky. And to do this, the President walked as close to \n     the line between (a) truthful but evasive or non-responsive \n     testimony and (b) false testimony as he could without \n     crossing it. He sought, as he explained to the grand jury, to \n     give answers that were literally accurate, even if, as a \n     result, they were evasive and thus misleading. We repeat: \n     what is at issue here is not the underlying statements made \n     by the President in the deposition, but the President's \n     explanations in the grand jury of his effort to walk a fine \n     line. Anyone who reads or watches that deposition knows the \n     President was in fact trying to do precisely what he has \n     admitted--to give the lawyers grudging, unresponsive or even \n     misleading answers without actually lying. However successful \n     or unsuccessful he might have been, there is no evidence that \n     controverts the fact that this was indeed the President's \n     intention.\n       An examination of the statements that the President \n     actually did make in the grand jury about his deposition \n     testimony further demonstrates the lack of merit in this \n     article. In the grand jury, the President only was asked \n     about three areas of his deposition testimony that were \n     covered in the failed impeachment article alleging perjury in \n     the civil deposition.\\87\\ The first topic was the nature of \n     any intimate contact with Ms. Lewinsky and has already been \n     addressed above.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\87\\ The proposed article of impeachment alleging perjury in \n     the civil deposition, like the two that are before the \n     Senate, did not identity any specific instances of false \n     testimony, but we have made our comparison with the Committee \n     Report's elaboration of the deposition perjury article as it \n     undoubtedly represents the largest universe of alleged \n     perjurious statements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The second topic was the President's testimony about his \n     knowledge of gifts he exchanged with Ms. Lewinsky. In his \n     grand jury testimony, the President had the following \n     exchange with the OIC:\n\n       Q: When you testified in the Paula Jones case, this was \n     only two and a half weeks after you had given her these six \n     gifts, you were asked, at page 75 in your deposition, lines 2 \n     through 5, ``Well, have you ever given any gifts to Monica \n     Lewinsky?'' And you answered, ``I don't recall.''\n       And you were correct. You pointed out that you actually \n     asked them, for prompting, ``Do you know what they were?''\n       A: I think what I meant there was I don't recall what they \n     were, not that I don't recall whether I had given them. And \n     then if you see, they did give me these specifics, and I gave \n     them quite a good explanation here. I remembered very clearly \n     what the facts were about The Black Dog. . . .\n\n     App. at 502-03. The President's explanation that he could not \n     recall the exact gifts that he had given Ms. Lewinsky and \n     that he affirmatively sought prompting from the Jones lawyers \n     is entirely consistent with his deposition testimony. This \n     record plainly does not support a charge of perjury.\n       The third and last topic was the President's deposition \n     testimony that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit statement denying \n     having a sexual relationship with the President was correct:\n\n       Q: And you indicated that it [Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit \n     statement that she had no sexual relationship with him] was \n     absolutely correct.\n       A: I did. . . . I believe at the time that she filled out \n     this affidavit, if she believed that\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\n     the definition of sexual relationship was two people having \n     intercourse, then this is accurate. And I believe that this \n     is the definition that most ordinary Americans would give it. \n     . . .\n\n     App. at 473. The President's grand jury testimony was \n     truthful. As Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp discussed long before \n     any of this matter was public, this was in fact Ms. \n     Lewinsky's definition of ``sex'' and apparently the \n     President's as well. See Supp. at 2664 (10/3/97 Tape); see \n     also App. at 1558 (Lewinsky FBI 302 8/19/98). There is no \n     evidence whatever that the President did not believe this \n     definition of sexual relations, and his belief finds support \n     in dictionary definitions, the courts and commentators.\\88\\ \n     Moreover, the record establishes that Ms. Lewinsky shared \n     this view.\\89\\ Since the President's grand jury testimony \n     about his understanding is corroborated both by dictionaries \n     and by his prior statements to Ms. Lewinsky, it simply cannot \n     be labeled ``wrong'' or, more seriously, ``perjurious.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\88\\ As one court has stated, ``[i]n common parlance the \n     terms `sexual intercourse' and `sexual relations' are often \n     used interchangeably.'' J.Y. v. D.A, 381 N.E.2d 1270, 1273 \n     (Ind. App. 1978). Dictionary definitions make the same point:\n      Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1st \n     ed. 1981) at 2082, defines ``sexual relations'' as \n     ``coitus;''\n      Random House Webster's College Dictionary (1st ed. \n     1996) at 1229, defines ``sexual relations'' as ``sexual \n     intercourse; coitus;''\n      Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. \n     1997) at 1074, defines ``sexual relations'' as ``coitus;''\n      Black's Law Dictionary (Abridged 6th ed. 1991) at \n     560, defines ``intercourse'' as ``sexual relations;'' and\n      Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary (2d ed. \n     1996) at 1775, defines ``sexual relations'' as ``sexual \n     intercourse; coitus.''\n     \\89\\ Ms. Lewinsky took the position early on that her contact \n     with the President did not constitute ``sex'' and reaffirmed \n     that position even after she had received immunity and began \n     cooperating with the OIC. For example, in one of the \n     conversations surreptitiously taped by Ms. Tripp, Ms. \n     Lewinsky explained to Ms. Tripp that she ``didn't have sex'' \n     with the President because ``[h]aving sex is having \n     intercourse.'' Supp. at 2664; see also Supp. at 1066 (grand \n     jury testimony of Ms. Neysa Erbland stated that Ms. Lewinsky \n     had said that the President and she ``didn't have sex''). Ms. \n     Lewinsky reaffirmed this position even after receiving \n     immunity, stating in an FBI interview that ``her use of the \n     term `having sex' means having intercourse. . . .'' App. at \n     1558 (Lewinsky FBI 302 8/19/98). Likewise, in her original \n     proffer to the OIC, she wrote, ``Ms. L[ewinsky] was \n     comfortable signing the affidavit with regard to the `sexual \n     relationship' because she could justify to herself that she \n     and the Pres[ident] did not have sexual intercourse.'' App. \n     at 718 (2/1/98 Proffer).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The President did not testify falsely and perjuriously in \n     the grand jury about his civil deposition testimony.\n     3. The President denies that he made perjurious, false and \n         misleading statements to the grand jury about the \n         statements of his attorney to Judge Wright during the \n         Jones deposition\n       It is remarkable that Article I contains allegations such \n     as this one that even the OIC, which conducted the \n     President's grand jury appearance, chose not to include in \n     the Referral (presumably because there was no ``substantial \n     and credible information'' to support the claim). Subpart (3) \n     appears to allege that the President lied in his grand jury \n     testimony when he characterized his state of mind in his \n     civil deposition as his lawyer described the Lewinsky \n     affidavit as meaning ``there is no sex of any kind in any \n     manner, shape or form.'' Dep. at 53-54. Specifically, the \n     House Managers appear to base their perjury claim on \n     President Clinton's grand jury statement that ``I'm not even \n     sure I paid attention to what he [Mr. Bennett] was saying.'' \n     House Br. at 62.\n       The House Brief takes issue with President Clinton's \n     statement that he was ``not paying a great deal of attention \n     to this exchange'' because, it alleges, the ``videotape [of \n     the deposition] shows the President looking directly at Mr. \n     Bennett, paying close attention to his argument to Judge \n     Wright.'' Ibid. While it is true that the videotape shows the \n     President staring in what is presumably Mr. Bennett's \n     direction, there is no evidence whatsoever that he was indeed \n     ``paying close attention'' to the lengthy exchange. Notably \n     absent from the videotape is any action on the part of the \n     President that could be read as affirming Mr. Bennett's \n     statement, such as a nod of the head, or any other activity \n     that could be used to distinguish between a fixed stare and \n     true attention to the complicated sparring of counsel. The \n     President was a witness in a difficult and complex deposition \n     and, as he testified, he was ``focussing on [his] answers to \n     the questions.'' App. at 477. It is a safe bet that the \n     common law has never seen a perjury charge based on so \n     little.\\90\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\90\\ This allegation is nearly identical to the allegation of \n     Article II(5), and, for the sake of brevity, it is addressed \n     at greater length in the response to Article II, below.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     4. The President denies that he made perjurious, false and \n         misleading statements to the grand jury when he denied \n         attempting ``to influence the testimony of witnesses and \n         to impede the discovery of evidence'' in the Jones case\n       The general language of the final proviso of Article I, \n     according to the House Managers, is meant to signify a wide \n     range of allegations, see House Br. at 60-69, although none \n     were thought sufficiently credible to be included in the OIC \n     Referral. These allegations were not even included in the \n     summary of the Starr evidence presented to the Committee on \n     October 5, 1998, by House Majority Counsel Schippers. They \n     are nothing more than an effort to inflate the perjury \n     allegations by converting every statement that the President \n     made about the subject matter of Article II into a new count \n     for perjury. As the discussion of Article II establishes, the \n     President did not attempt to obstruct justice. Thus, his \n     explanations of his statements in the grand jury were \n     truthful.\n       The House Brief asserts that the President committed \n     perjury with respect to three areas of his grand jury \n     testimony about the obstruction allegations. These claims are \n     addressed thoroughly in the next section along with the \n     corresponding Article II obstruction claims, and they are \n     addressed in a short form here. The first claim is that the \n     President committed perjury ``when he testified before the \n     grand jury that he recalled telling Ms. Lewinsky that if Ms. \n     Jones' lawyers requested the gifts exchanged between Ms. \n     Lewinsky and the President, she should provide them.'' House \n     Br. at 63. The House Managers contest the truthfulness of \n     this statement by asserting that the President was \n     responsible for Ms. Lewinsky's transfer of gifts to Ms. \n     Currie in late December. In other words, if the obstruction \n     claim is true, they allege, this statement is not true. As is \n     laid out in greater detail in the next section, the House \n     Manager's view of this matter ignores a wealth of evidence \n     establishing that the idea to conceal some of the gifts she \n     had received originated with, and was executed by, Ms. \n     Lewinsky. See e.g., Supp. at 557 (Currie GJ 1/27/98); Supp. \n     at 531 (Currie FBI 302 1/24/98); Supp. at 582 (Currie GJ 5/6/\n     98); App. at 1122 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98); see also App. at \n     1481 (``LEWINSKY . . . suggested to the President that Betty \n     Currie hold the gifts'') (Lewinsky FBI 302 8/1/98).\n       Second, the House Managers contend that the President \n     provided perjurious testimony when he explained to the grand \n     jury that he was trying to ``refresh'' his recollection when \n     he spoke with Betty Currie on January 18, 1998 about his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. House Br. at 65. The House \n     Managers completely ignore the numerous statements that Ms. \n     Currie makes in her testimony that support the President's \n     assertion that he was merely trying to gather information. \n     for example, Ms. Currie stated in her first interview with \n     the OIC that ``Clinton then mentioned some of the questions \n     he was asked at his deposition. Currie advised the way \n     Clinton phrased the queries, they were both statements and \n     questions at the same time.'' Supp. at 534 (Currie FBI 302 1/\n     24/98). Ms. Currie's final grand jury testimony on this issue \n     also supports the President' explanation of his questioning:\n\n       Q: Now, back again to the four statements that you \n     testified the President made to you that were presented as \n     statements, did you feel pressured when he told you those \n     statements?\n       A: None whatsoever.\n       Q: What did you think, or what was going through your mind \n     about what he was doing?\n       A: At that time I felt that he was--I want to use the word \n     shocked or surprised that this was an issue, and he was just \n     talking.\n       Q: That was your impression that he wanted you to say--\n     because he would end each of the statements with ``Right?,'' \n     with a question.\n       A:  I do not remember that he wanted me to say ``Right.'' \n     He would say ``Right'' and I could have said, ``Wrong.''\n       Q: But he would end each of those questions with a \n     ``Right?'' and you could either say whether it was true or \n     not true?\n       A: Correct.\n       Q: Did you feel any pressure to agree with your boss?\n       A: None.\n\n     Supp. at 668 (Currie GJ 7/22/98) (emphasis added).\n       Ms. Currie's testimony supports the President's assertion \n     that he was looking for information as a result of his \n     deposition. There is no basis to doubt the President's \n     explanation that his expectation of a media onslaught \n     prompted the conversation. See App. at 583. Indeed, neither \n     the testimony of Ms. Currie nor that of the President--the \n     only two participants in this conversation--conceivably \n     supports the inference that he had any other intent. The \n     House Managers' contention that the President's explanation \n     to the grand jury was perjurious totally disregards the \n     testimony of the only two witnesses with first-hand knowledge \n     and has no basis in fact or in the evidence.\n       Finally, the House Managers contend that President Clinton \n     ``lied about his attempts to influence the testimony of some \n     of his top aides.'' House Br. at 68. The basis for this \n     charge appears to be the President's testimony that, although \n     he said misleading things to his aides about his relationship \n     with Ms. Lewinsky, he tried to say things that were true. Id. \n     at 69. Once again, the record does not even approach a case \n     for perjury. The President acknowledged that he misled; he \n     tried, however, not to lie. It is a mystery how the Managers \n     could try to disprove this simple statement of intent.\n\n           V. The President Should be Acquitted on Article II\n\n       The evidence does not support the allegations of Article \n     II.\n\n\n                           a. applicable law\n\n       Article II alleges obstruction of justice, a statutory \n     crime that is set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503, the ``Omnibus \n     Obstruction Provision.'' In the criminal law context, \n     Sec. 1503 requires proof of the following elements: (1) that\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\n     there existed a pending judicial proceeding; (2) that the \n     accused knew of the proceeding; and (3) that the defendant \n     acted ``corruptly'' with the specific intent to obstruct or \n     interfere with the proceeding or due administration of \n     justice. See, e.g., United States  v. Bucey, 876 F.2d 1297, \n     1314 (7th Cir. 1989). False statements alone cannot sustain a \n     conviction under Sec. 1503. See United States v. Thomas, 916 \n     F.2d 647, 652 (11th Cir. 1990).\\91\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\91\\ 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1512 covers witness tampering. It is \n     clear that the allegations in Article II could not satisfy \n     the elements of Sec. 1512. That provision requires proof that \n     a defendant knowingly engaged in intimidation, physical \n     force, threats, misleading conduct, or corrupt persuasion \n     with intent to influence, delay, or prevent testimony or \n     cause any person to withhold objects or documents from an \n     official proceeding. It is clear from the case law that \n     ``misleading conduct'' as contemplated by Sec. 1512 does not \n     cover scenarios where an accused urged a witness to give \n     false testimony without resorting to coercive or deceptive \n     conduct. See, e.g., United States  v. Kulczyk, 931 F.2d 542, \n     547 (9th Cir. 1991) (reversing conviction under Sec. 1512 \n     because ``there is simply no support for the argument that \n     [defendant] did anything other than ask the witnesses to \n     lie''); United States v. King, 762 F.2d 232, 237 (2d Cir. \n     1985) (``Since the only allegation in the indictment as to \n     the means by which [defendant] induced [a witness] to \n     withhold testimony was that [the defendant] misled [the \n     witness], and since the evidence failed totally to support \n     any inference that [the witness] was, or even could have \n     been, misled, the conduct proven by the government was not \n     within the terms of Sec. 1512.''). Deceit is thus the \n     gravamen of an obstruction of justice charge that is \n     predicated on witness tampering.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                    B. Structure of the Allegations\n\n       Article II exhibited by the House of Representatives \n     alleges that the President ``has prevented, obstructed, and \n     impeded the administration of justice, and has to that end \n     engaged personally, and through his subordinates and agents, \n     in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, \n     cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence and \n     testimony'' in the Jones case. The Article alleges that the \n     President did so by engaging in ``one or more of the \n     following acts'': the President (1) corruptly encouraged Ms. \n     Lewinsky ``to execute a sworn affidavit . . . that he knew to \n     be perjurious, false and misleading''; (2) ``corruptly \n     encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to give perjurious, false, and \n     misleading testimony if and when called to testify \n     personally'' in the Jones case; (3) ``corruptly engaged in, \n     encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal evidence that \n     had been subpoenaed'' in the Jones case, namely gifts given \n     by him to Ms. Lewinsky; (4) ``intensified and succeeded in an \n     effort to secure job assistance'' for Ms. Lewinsky between \n     December 7, 1997 and January 14, 1998, ``in order to \n     corruptly prevent [her] truthful testimony'' in the Jones \n     case; (5) ``corruptly allowed his attorney to make false and \n     misleading statements'' to Judge Susan Webber Wright at the \n     Jones deposition; (6) ``related a false and misleading \n     account of events'' involving Ms. Lewinsky to Betty Currie, a \n     ``potential witness'' in the Jones case, ``in order to \n     corruptly influence'' her testimony; and (7) made false and \n     misleading statements to certain members of his staff who \n     were ``potential'' grand jury witnesses, in order to \n     corruptly influence their testimony.\n       As noted above, this article essentially duplicates some of \n     the perjury allegations of Article I (4): Article II alleges \n     particular acts of obstruction while Article I (4) alleges \n     that the President lied in the grand jury when he discussed \n     those allegations.\\92\\ Both sets of allegations are \n     unsupported. Our discussion here of the details of these \n     charges will, as well, serve in part as our response to the \n     allegations in Article I (4).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\92\\ Compare Article I (4) (perjury in the grand jury \n     concerning alleged ``corrupt efforts to influence testimony \n     of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence'') with \n     Article II (1)-(3), (6) (obstructing justice when he (1) \n     ``encouraged witness . . . to execute a [false] sworn \n     affidavit''; (2) ``encouraged a witness . . . to give \n     perjurious, false and misleading testimony''; (3) ``engaged \n     in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal evidence''; \n     (6) ``corruptly influence[d] the testimony'' of Betty \n     Currie). Compare also Article I (3) (perjury in the grand \n     jury concerning alleged ``prior false and misleading \n     statements he allowed his attorney to make to a Federal \n     judge'') with Article II (5) (obstructing justice by \n     ``allow[ing] his attorney to make false and misleading \n     statements to a Federal judge).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n        C. Response to the Particular Allegations in Article II\n\n     1. The President denies that on or about December 17, 1997, \n         he ``corruptly encouraged'' Monica Lewinsky ``to execute \n         a sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be \n         perjurious, false and misleading''\n       Article II (1) alleges that the President ``corruptly \n     encouraged'' Monica Lewinsky ``to execute a sworn affidavit \n     in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false and \n     misleading.'' The House Managers allege that during a \n     December 17 phone conversation, Ms. Lewinsky asked the \n     President what she could do if she were subpoenaed in the \n     Jones case and that the President responded, ``Well, maybe \n     you can sign an affidavit.'' House Br. at 22. This admitted \n     statement by the President of totally lawful conduct is the \n     Managers' entire factual basis for the allegation in Article \n     II (1).\n       The Managers do not allege that the President ever \n     suggested to Ms. Lewinsky she should file a false affidavit \n     or otherwise told her what to say in the affidavit. Indeed \n     they could not, because Ms. Lewinsky has repeatedly and \n     forcefully denied any such suggestions:\n        ``Neither the Pres[ident] nor Mr. Jordan (or \n     anyone on their behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. L[ewinsky] to \n     lie.'' App. at 718 (2/1/98 Proffer).\n        ``[N]o one ever asked me to lie and I was never \n     promised a job for my silence.'' App. at 1161 (Lewinsky GJ 8/\n     20/98).\n        ``Neither the President nor Jordan ever told \n     Lewinsky that she had to lie.'' App. at 1398 (Lewinsky FBI \n     302 7/27/98).\n        ``Neither the President nor anyone ever directed \n     Lewinsky to say anything or to lie. . . .'' App. at 1400 \n     (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/27/98).\n        ``I think I told [Linda Tripp] that--you know at \n     various times the President and Mr. Jordan had told me I have \n     to lie. That wasn't true.'' App. at 942 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98).\n       In an attempt to compensate for the total lack of evidence \n     supporting their theory,\\93\\ the Managers offer their view \n     that ``both parties knew the affidavit would have to be false \n     and misleading in order to accomplish the desired result.'' \n     House Br. at 22; see also Committee Report at 65 (the \n     President ``knew [the affidavit] would have to be false for \n     Ms. Lewinsky to avoid testifying''). But there is no evidence \n     to support such bald conjecture, and in fact the opposite is \n     true. Both Ms. Lewinsky and the President testified that, \n     given the particular claims in the Jones  case, they thought \n     a truthful, limited affidavit might establish that Ms. \n     Lewinsky had nothing relevant to offer. The President \n     explained to the grand jury why he believed that Ms. Lewinsky \n     would execute a truthful but limited affidavit that would \n     have established that she was not relevant to the Jones \n     case:\\94\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\93\\ The myth that the President told Ms. Lewinsky to lie in \n     her affidavit springs not from the evidence but from the \n     surreptitiously recorded Tripp tapes. But as Ms. Lewinsky \n     explained to the grand jury, many of the statements she made \n     to Ms. Tripp--including on this subject--were not true: ``I \n     think I told [Linda Tripp] that--you know at various times \n     the President and Mr. Jordan had told me I have to lie. That \n     wasn't true.'' App. at 942 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98).\n     \\94\\ Indeed, the Committee Report alleges without support \n     that the President lied to the grand jury when he indicated \n     his belief that Ms. Lewinsky could indeed have filed a \n     truthful but limited affidavit that might have gotten her out \n     of testifying in the Jones case. Article I (4). This claim \n     fails for the reasons discussed in the text.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        ``But I'm just telling you that it's certainly \n     true what she says here, that we didn't have--there was no \n     employment, no benefit in exchange, there was nothing having \n     to do with sexual harassment. And if she defined sexual \n     relationship in the way I think most Americans do, meaning \n     intercourse, then she told the truth.'' App. at 474.\n        ``You know, I believed then, I believe now, that \n     Monica Lewinsky could have sworn out an honest affidavit, \n     that under reasonable circumstances, and without the benefit \n     of what Linda Tripp did to her, would have given her a chance \n     not to be a witness in this case.'' App. at 521.\n        ``I believed then, I believe today, that she could \n     execute an affidavit which, under reasonable circumstances \n     with fair-minded, nonpolitically-oriented people, would \n     result in her being relieved of the burden to be put through \n     the kind of testimony that, thanks to Linda Tripp's work with \n     you and with the Jones lawyers, she would have been put \n     through. I don't think that's dishonest. I don't think that's \n     illegal.'' App. at 529.\n        ``But I also will tell you that I felt quite \n     comfortable that she could have executed a truthful \n     affidavit, which would not have disclosed the embarrassing \n     details of the relationship that we had had, which had been \n     over for many, many months by the time this incident \n     occurred.'' App. at 568-69.\n        ``I've already told you that I felt strongly that \n     she could issue, that she could execute an affidavit that \n     would be factually truthful, that might get her out of having \n     to testify. . . . And did I hope she'd be able to get out of \n     testifying on an affidavit? Absolutely. Did I want her to \n     execute a false affidavit? No, I did not.'' App. at 571.\n\n     The Jones case involved allegations of a nonconsensual sexual \n     solicitation. Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the President \n     was consensual, and she knew nothing about the factual \n     allegations of the Jones case.\n       Ms. Lewinsky similarly recognized that an affidavit need \n     not be false in order to accomplish the purpose of avoiding a \n     deposition:\n        LEWINSKY told TRIPP that the purpose of the \n     affidavit was to avoid being deposed. LEWINSKY advised that \n     one does this by giving a portion of the whole story, so the \n     attorneys do not think you have anything of relevance to \n     their case. App. at 1420 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/29/98) (emphasis \n     added).\n        LEWINSKY advised the goal of an affidavit is to be \n     as benign as possible, so as to avoid being deposed. App. at \n     1421 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/29/98) (emphasis added).\n        I thought that signing an affidavit could range \n     from anywhere--the point of it would be to deter or to \n     prevent me from being deposed and so that that could range \n     from anywhere between maybe just somehow mentioning, you \n     know, innocuous things or going as far as maybe having to \n     deny any kind of a relationship. App. at 842 (Lewinsky GJ 8/\n     6/98) (emphasis added).\n       The Committee Report argued that Ms. Lewinsky must have \n     known that the President wanted her to lie because he never \n     told her to fully detail their relationship in her affidavit \n     and because an affidavit fully detailing the ``true nature'' \n     of their relationship would have been damaging to him in the \n     Jones case. Committee Report at 65. The Managers wisely \n     appear to have abandoned\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\n     this argument.\\95\\ Ms. Lewinsky plainly was under no \n     obligation to volunteer to the Jones lawyers every last \n     detail about her relationship with the President--and the \n     failure of the President to instruct her to do so is neither \n     wrong nor an obstruction of justice. A limited, truthful \n     affidavit might have established that Ms. Lewinsky was not \n     relevant to the Jones case. The suggestion that perhaps Ms. \n     Lewinsky could submit an affidavit in lieu of a deposition, \n     as the President knew other potential deponents in the Jones \n     case had attempted to do, in order to avoid the expense, \n     burden, and humiliation of testifying in the Jones case was \n     entirely proper. The notion that the President of the United \n     States could face removal from office not because he told \n     Monica Lewinsky to lie, or encouraged her to do so, but \n     because he did not affirmatively instruct her to disclose \n     every detail of their relationship to the Jones lawyers is \n     simply not supportable.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\95\\ The Committee Report argued that Ms. Lewinsky \n     ``contextually understood that the President wanted her to \n     lie'' because he never told her to file an affidavit fully \n     detailing the ``true nature'' of their relationship. \n     Committee Report at 65. The only support cited for this \n     ``contextual understanding'' obstruction theory advanced by \n     the Committee Report was a reference back to the OIC \n     Referral. The OIC Referral, in turn, advanced the same \n     theory, citing only the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky that, while \n     the President never encouraged her to lie, he remained silent \n     about what she should do or say, and by such silence, ``I \n     knew what that meant.'' App. at 954 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98) \n     (cited in Referral at 174). It is extraordinary that the \n     President of the United States could face removal from office \n     not because he told Ms. Lewinsky to lie, or said anything of \n     the sort, but instead because he stayed silent--and Ms. \n     Lewinsky thought she ``knew what that meant.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Moreover, there is significant evidence in the record that, \n     at the time she executed the affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky honestly \n     believed that her denial of a sexual relationship was \n     accurate given what she believed to be the definition of a \n     ``sexual relationship'':\n        ``I never even came close to sleeping with [the \n     President] . . . We didn't have sex . . . Having sex is \n     having intercourse. That's how most people would--'' Supp. at \n     2664 (Lewinsky-Tripp tape 10/3/97).\\96\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\96\\ A friend of Ms. Lewinsky's also testified that, based on \n     her close relationship with her, she believed that Ms. \n     Lewinsky did not lie in her affidavit based on her \n     understanding that when Ms. Lewinsky referred to ``sex'' she \n     meant intercourse. Supp. at 4597 (6/23/98 grand jury \n     testimony of Ms. Dale Young). See also Supp. at 1066 (grand \n     jury testimony of Ms. Neysa Erbland stating that Ms. Lewinsky \n     had said that the President and she ``didn't have sex'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        ``Ms. L[ewinsky] was comfortable signing the \n     affidavit with regard to the sexual relationship because she \n     could justify to herself that she and the Pres[ident] did not \n     have sexual intercourse.'' App. at 718 (2/1/98 Proffer).\n        ``Lewinsky said that her use of the term `having \n     sex' means having intercourse. . . .'' App. at 1558 (Lewinsky \n     FBI 302 8/19/98).\n       The allegation contained in Article II(1) is totally \n     unsupported by evidence. It is the product of a baseless \n     hypothesis, and it should be rejected.\n     2. The President denies that on or about December 17, 1997, \n         he ``corruptly encouraged'' Monica Lewinsky ``to give \n         perjurious, false and misleading testimony if and when \n         called to testify personally'' in the Jones litigation\n       Article II (2) alleges that the President encouraged Ms. \n     Lewinsky to give false testimony if and when she was called \n     to testify personally in the Jones litigation. Again, Ms. \n     Lewinsky repeatedly denied that anyone told her or encouraged \n     her to lie:\n        ``Neither the Pres[ident] nor Mr. Jordan (or \n     anyone on their behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. L[ewinsky] to \n     lie.'' App. at 718 (2/1/98 Proffer).\n        ``[N]o one ever asked me to lie and I was never \n     promised a job for my silence.'' App. at 1161 (Lewinsky GJ 8/\n     20/98).\n        ``Neither the President nor Jordan ever told \n     Lewinsky that she had to lie.'' App. at 1398 (Lewinsky FBI \n     302 7/27/98).\n        ``Neither the President nor anyone ever directed \n     Lewinsky to say anything or to lie. . . . App. at 1400 \n     (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/27/98).\n        ``I think I told [Linda Tripp] that--you know at \n     various times the President and Mr. Jordan had told me I have \n     to lie. That wasn't true.'' App. at 942 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98) \n     (emphasis added).\n       The Managers allege that the President called Ms. Lewinsky \n     on December 17 to inform her that she had been listed as a \n     potential witness in the Jones case, and that during this \n     conversation, he ``sort of said, `You know, you can always \n     say you were coming to see Betty or that you were bringing me \n     letters.' '' House Br. at 22; App. at 843 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/\n     98). Other than the fact that Ms. Lewinsky recalls this \n     statement being made in the same conversation in which she \n     learned that her name was on the Jones witness list, the \n     Managers cite no evidence whatsoever that supports their \n     claim that the President encouraged her to make such \n     statements ``if and when called to testify personally in the \n     Jones case.'' They claim simply that Ms. Lewinsky had \n     discussed such explanations for her visits with the President \n     in the past. Unremarkably, the President and Ms. Lewinsky had \n     been concerned about concealing their improper relationship \n     from others while it was ongoing.\n       Ms. Lewinsky's own testimony and proffered statements \n     undercut their case:\n        When asked what should be said if anyone \n     questioned Ms. Lewinsky about her being with the President, \n     he said she should say she was bringing him letters (when she \n     worked in Legislative Affairs) or visiting Betty Currie \n     (after she left the WH). There is truth to both of these \n     statements. . . . [This] occurred prior to the subpoena in \n     the Paula Jones case. App. at 709 and 718 (2/1/98 Proffer) \n     (emphasis added).\n        After Ms. Lewinsky was informed, by the \n     Pres[ident], that she was identified as a possible witness in \n     the Jones case, the Pres[ident] and Ms. L[ewinsky] discussed \n     what she should do. The President told her he was not sure \n     she would be subpoenaed, but in the event that she was, she \n     should contact Ms. Currie. When asked what to do if she was \n     subpoenaed, the Pres[ident] suggested she could sign an \n     affidavit to try to satisfy their inquiry and not be deposed. \n     In general, Ms. L[ewinsky] should say she visited the WH to \n     see Ms. Currie and, on occasion when working at the WH, she \n     brought him letters when no one else was around. Neither of \n     those statements untrue. App. at 712 (2/1/98 Proffer) \n     (emphasis added).\n        To the best of Ms. L[ewinsky]'s memory, she does \n     not believe they discussed the content of any deposition that \n     Ms. L[ewinsky] might be involved in at a later date. App. at \n     712 (2/1/98 Proffer) (emphasis added).\n        LEWINSKY advised, though they did not discuss the \n     issue in specific relation to the JONES matter, she and \n     CLINTON had discussed what to say when asked about LEWINSKY's \n     visits to the White House. App. at 1466 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/\n     31/98) (emphasis added).\n       Ms. Lewinsky's statements indicate that she asked the \n     President what to say if ``anyone'' asked about her visits, \n     that the President said ``in general'' she could give such an \n     explanation, and that they ``did not discuss the issue in \n     specific relation to the Jones matter.''\n       This is consistent with the President's testimony that he \n     and Ms. Lewinsky ``might have talked about what to do in a \n     non-legal context at some point in the past,'' although he \n     had no specific memory of that conversation. App. at 569. The \n     President also stated in his grand jury testimony that he did \n     not recall saying anything like that in connection with Ms. \n     Lewinsky's testimony in the Jones case:\n\n       Q. And in that conversation, or in any conversation in \n     which you informed her she was on the witness list, did you \n     tell her, you know, you can always say that you were coming \n     to see Betty or bringing me letters? Did you tell her \n     anything like that?\n       A. I don't remember. She was coming to see Betty. I can \n     tell you this. I absolutely never asked her to lie.\n\n     App. at 568. Ms. Lewinsky does not testify that this \n     discussion was had in reference to testimony she may or may \n     not have been called to give personally, and the Managers' \n     implication is directly contradicted by Ms. Lewinsky's \n     statement that she and the President did not discuss her \n     deposition testimony in that conversation. See App. at 712 \n     (2/1/98 Proffer) (``To the best of Ms. L[ewinsky's] memory, \n     she does not believe they discussed [in the December 17 \n     conversation] the content of any deposition that Ms. \n     L[ewinsky] might be involved in at a later date.'').\n       In support of this allegation, the Managers also cite Ms. \n     Lewinsky's testimony that she told the President she would \n     deny the relationship and that the President made some \n     encouraging comment. House Br. at 23. Ms. Lewinsky never \n     stated that she told the President any such thing on December \n     17, or at any other time after she had been identified as a \n     witness. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky testified that that discussion \n     did not take place after she learned she was a witness in the \n     Jones case:\n\n       Q: It is possible that you also had these discussions \n     [about denying the relationship] after you learned that you \n     were a witness in the Paula Jones case?\n       A: I don't believe so. No.\n       Q: Can you exclude that possibility?\n       A: I pretty much can. I really don't remember it. I mean, \n     it would be very surprising for me to be confronted with \n     something that would show me different, but I--it was 2:30 in \n     the--I mean, the conversation I'm thinking of mainly would \n     have been December 17th, which was----\n       Q: The telephone call.\n       A: Right. And it was--you know, 2:00, 2:30 in the morning. \n     I remember the gist of it and I--I really don't think so.\n\n     App. at 1119-20 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98) (emphasis added).\n       Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky has stated several times that \n     neither of these so-called ``cover stories'' was untrue. In \n     her handwritten proffer, Ms. Lewinsky stated that she asked \n     the President what to say if anyone asked her about her \n     visits to the Oval Office and he said that she could say \n     ``she was bringing him letters (when she worked in \n     Legislative Affairs) or visiting Betty Currie (after she left \n     the White House).'' App. at 709 (Lewinsky 2/1/98 Proffer). \n     Ms. Lewinsky expressly stated: ``There is truth to both of \n     these statements.'' Id.  (emphasis added); see also App. at \n     712 (2/1/98 Proffer) (``[n]either of those statements [was] \n     untrue.'') (emphasis added). Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky testified \n     to the grand jury that she did in fact bring papers to the \n     President and that on some occasions, she visited the Oval \n     Office only to see Ms. Currie:\n\n       Q: Did you actually bring [the President] papers at all?\n       A: Yes.\n       Q: All right. Tell us a little about that.\n       A: It varied. Sometimes it was just actual copies of \n     letters. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\n\n     App. at 774-75 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98).\n\n     ``I saw Betty on every time that I was there . . . most of \n     the time my purpose was to see the President, but there were \n     some times when I did just go see Betty but the President \n     wasn't in the office.''\n\n     App. at 775 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98). The Managers assert that \n     those stories were misleading. House Br. at 23; see also \n     Committee Report at 66 (delivering documents to the President \n     was a ``ruse that had no legitimate business purpose.''). In \n     other words, while the so-called ``cover stories'' were \n     literally true, such explanations might have been misleading. \n     But literal truth is a critical issue in perjury and \n     obstruction cases, as is Ms. Lewinsky's belief that the \n     statements were, in fact, literally true.\n       The allegation contained in Article II (2) is unsupported \n     by the evidence and should be rejected.\n     3. The President denies that he ``corruptly engaged in, \n         encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal evidence''--\n         gifts he had given to Monica Lewinsky--in the Jones case\n       This allegation charges that the President participated in \n     a scheme to conceal certain gifts he had given to Monica \n     Lewinsky. It apparently centers on two events allegedly \n     occurring in December 1997: (a) a conversation between the \n     President and Ms. Lewinsky in which the two allegedly \n     discussed the gifts the President had given Ms. Lewinsky, and \n     (b) Ms. Currie's receipt of a box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky \n     and storage of them under her bed. The evidence does not \n     support the charge.\n       a. Ms. Lewinsky's December 28 Meeting with the President\n       Monica Lewinsky met with the President on December 28, \n     1997, sometime shortly after 8:00 a.m. to pick up Christmas \n     presents. App. at 868 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98). According to Ms. \n     Lewinsky, she raised the subject of gifts she had received \n     from the President in relation to the Jones subpoena, and \n     this was the first and only time that this subject arose. \n     App. at 1130 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98); App. at 1338 (Lewinsky \n     Depo. 8/26/98).\n       The House Trial Brief and the Committee Report quote one \n     version of Ms. Lewinsky's description of that December 28 \n     conversation:\n\n     ``[A]t some point I said to him, `Well, you know, should I--\n     maybe I should put the gifts away outside my house somewhere \n     or give them to someone, maybe Betty.' And he sort of said--I \n     think he responded, `I don't know' or `Let me think about \n     that.' And left that topic.'' App. at 872 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/\n     98).\n\n       In fairness, the Senate should be aware that Ms. Lewinsky \n     has addressed this crucial exchange with prosecutors on at \n     least ten different occasions, which we lay out in the margin \n     for review.\\97\\ The accounts varied--in some Ms. Lewinsky \n     essentially recalled that the President gave no response, but \n     the House Managers, like the Committee Report and the OIC \n     Referral, cite only the account most favorable to their case, \n     failing even to take note of the other inconsistent \n     recollections. But the important fact about Ms. Lewinsky's \n     various descriptions of this conversation is that, at the \n     very most, the President stated ``I don't know'' or ``Let me \n     think about it'' when Ms. Lewinsky raised the issue of the \n     gifts. Even by the account most unfavorable to the President, \n     the record is clear and unambiguous that the President never \n     initiated any discussion about the gifts nor did he tell or \n     even suggest to Ms. Lewinsky that she should conceal the \n     gifts.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\97\\ Those statements, from earliest to latest in time:\n     1. Proffer (2/1/98): ``Ms. L then asked if she should put \n     away (outside her home) the gifts he had given her or, maybe, \n     give them so someone else.'' App. at 715.\n     2. FBI 302 (7/27/98): ``LEWINSKY expressed her concern about \n     the gifts that the President had given LEWINSKY and \n     specifically the hat pin that had been subpoenaed by PAULA \n     JONES. The President seemed to know what the JONES subpoena \n     called for in advance and did not seem surprised about the \n     hat pin. The President asked LEWINSKY is she had told anyone \n     about the hat pin and LEWINSKY denied that she had, but may \n     have said that she gave some of the gifts to FRANK CARTER. . \n     . . LEWINSKY asked the President if she should give the gifts \n     to someone and the President replied `I don't know.' '' App. \n     at 1395.\n     3. FBI 302 (8/1/98): ``LEWINSKY said that she was concerned \n     about the gifts that the President had given her and \n     suggested to the President that BETTY CURRIE hold the gifts. \n     The President said something like, `I don't know,' or `I'll \n     think about it.' The President did not tell LEWINSKY what to \n     do with the gifts at that time.'' App. at 1481.\n     4. Grand Jury (8/6/98): ``[A]t some point I said to him, \n     `Well, you know, should I--maybe I should put the gifts away \n     outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, maybe \n     Betty.' And he sort of said--I think he responded, `I don't \n     know' or `Let me think about that.' And left that topic.'' \n     App. at 872.\n     5. FBI 302 (8/13/97): ``During their December 28, 1997 \n     meeting, CLINTON did not specifically mention which gifts to \n     get rid of.'' App. at 1549.\n     6. Grand Jury (8/20/98): ``It was December 28th and I was \n     there to get my Christmas gifts from him. . . And we spent \n     maybe about five minutes or so, not very long, talking about \n     the case. And I said to him, `Well, do you think' . . . And \n     at one point, I said, `Well do you think I should--' I don't \n     think I said `get rid of,' I said, `But do you think I should \n     put away or maybe give to Betty or give someone the gifts?' \n     And he--I don't remember his response. I think it was \n     something like, `I don't know,' or `Hmm,' or--there really \n     was no response.'' App. at 1121-22.\n     7. Grand Jury (8/20/98): ``A JUROR: Now, did you bring up \n     Betty's name [at the December 28 meeting during which gifts \n     were supposedly discussed] or did the President bring up \n     Betty's name? THE WITNESS: I think I brought it up. The \n     President wouldn't have brought up Betty's name because he \n     really didn't--he really didn't discuss it. . .'' App. at \n     1122.\n     8. Grand Jury (8/20/98): ``A JUROR: You had said that the \n     President had called you initially to come get your Christmas \n     gift, you had gone there, you had a talk, et cetera, and \n     there was no--you expressed concern, the President really \n     didn't say anything.'' App. at 1126.\n     9. FBI 302 (8/24/98): ``LEWINSKY advised that CLINTON was \n     sitting in the rocking chair in the Study. LEWINSKY asked \n     CLINTON what she should do with the gifts CLINTON had given \n     her and he either did not respond or responded `I don't \n     know.' LEWINSKY is not sure exactly what was said, but she is \n     certain that whatever CLINTON said, she did not have a clear \n     image in her mind of what to do next.'' App. at 1566.\n     10. FBI 302 (9/3/98): ``On December 28, 1997, in a \n     conversation between LEWINSKY and the President, the hat pin \n     given to Lewinsky by the President was specifically \n     discussed. They also discussed the general subject of the \n     gifts the President had given Lewinsky. However, they did not \n     discuss other specific gifts called for by the PAULA JONES \n     subpoena. LEWINSKY got the impression that the President knew \n     what was on the subpoena.'' App. at 1590.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Indeed, on several occasions, Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of \n     the President's reaction depict the President as not even \n     acknowledging her suggestion. Among those versions, ignored \n     by the Committee Report and the Managers, are the following:\n        ``And he--I don't remember his response. I think \n     it was something like, `I don't know,''' or `Hmm,' or--there \n     really was no response.'' App. at 1122 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98) \n     (emphasis added).\n        ``[The President] either did not respond or \n     responded `I don't know.' LEWINSKY is not sure exactly what \n     was said, but she is certain that whatever CLINTON said, she \n     did not have a clear image in her mind of what to do next.'' \n     App. at 1566 (Lewinsky FBI 302 8/24/98) (emphasis added).\n        ``The President wouldn't have brought up Betty's \n     name, because he really didn't--he really didn't discuss it . \n     . .'' App. at 1122 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98) (emphasis added).\n        ``A JUROR: You had said that the President had \n     called you initially to come get your Christmas gift, you had \n     gone there, you had a talk, et cetera, and there was no--you \n     expressed concern, the President didn't really say \n     anything.'' App. at 1126 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98) (emphasis \n     added).\\98\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\98\\ Here a grand juror is restating Ms. Lewinsky's earlier \n     testimony, with which Ms. Lewinsky appeared to agree (she did \n     not dispute the accuracy of the grand juror's \n     recapitulation).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Thus, the evidence establishes that there was essentially \n     no discussion of gifts. That December 28 meeting provides no \n     evidence of any ``scheme . . . designed to . . . conceal the \n     existence'' of any gifts.\n       b. Ms. Currie's Supposed Involvement in Concealing Gifts\n       Because the record is devoid of any evidence of obstruction \n     by the President at his December 28 meeting with Monica \n     Lewinsky, Article II (3) necessarily depends on the added \n     assumption that, after the December 28 meeting, the President \n     must have instructed his secretary, Ms. Betty Currie, to \n     retrieve the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky, thereby consummating \n     the obstruction of justice. As the following discussion will \n     demonstrate, the record is devoid of any direct evidence that \n     the President discussed this subject with Ms. Currie. At \n     most, it conflicted on the question of whether Ms. Currie or \n     Ms. Lewinsky initiated the gift retrieval.\n       We begin with what is certain. The record is undisputed \n     that Ms. Currie picked up a box containing gifts from Ms. \n     Lewinsky and placed them under her bed at home. The primary \n     factual dispute, therefore, is which of the two initiated the \n     pick-up. According to the logic of the Committee Report, if \n     Ms. Currie initiated the retrieval, she must have been so \n     instructed by the President. Committee Report at 69 (``there \n     is no reason for her to do so unless instructed by the \n     President'').\n       But the facts are otherwise. Both Ms. Currie and the \n     President have denied ever having any such conversation \n     wherein the President instructed Ms. Currie to retrieve the \n     gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. App. at 502 (President Clinton GJ 8/\n     17/98); Supp. at 581 (Currie GJ 5/6/98). In other words, the \n     only two parties who could have direct knowledge of such an \n     instruction by the President have denied it took place.\n       In the face of this direct evidence that the President did \n     not ask Ms. Currie to pick up these gifts, the Committee \n     Report's obstruction theory hinges on the inference that Ms. \n     Currie called Ms. Lewinsky and must have done so at the \n     direction of the President. To be sure, Ms. Lewinsky has \n     stated on several occasions that Ms. Currie initiated a call \n     to her to inquire about retrieving something. The Managers \n     and the Committee Report cited the following passage from Ms. \n     Lewinsky's grand jury testimony:\n\n       Q: What did [Betty Currie] say?\n       A: She said, ``I understand you have something to give \n     me.'' Or, ``The President said you have something to give \n     me.'' Along those lines. . . .\n       Q: When she said something along the lines of ``I \n     understand you have something to give me,'' or ``The \n     President says you have something for me,'' what did you \n     understand her to mean?\n       A: The gifts.\n     App. at 874 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98). See also App. at 715 (2/1/\n     98 Proffer) (``Ms. Currie called Ms. L later that afternoon \n     and said that the Pres. had told her Ms. L wanted her to hold \n     onto something for her.'').\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\n       However, Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged that it was she who \n     first raised the prospect of Ms. Currie's involvement in \n     holding the gifts:\n\n       A JUROR: Now, did you bring up Betty's name or did the \n     President bring up Betty's name?\n       [MS. LEWINSKY]: I think I brought it up. The President \n     wouldn't have brought up Betty's name because he really \n     didn't--he really didn't discuss it.\n\n     App. at 1122 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98). And contrary to the \n     Committee Report's suggestion that Lewinsky's memory of these \n     events has been ``consistent and unequivocal'' and she has \n     ``recited the same facts in February, July, and August,'' \n     Committee Report at 69, Ms. Lewinsky herself acknowledged at \n     her last grand jury appearance that her memory of the crucial \n     conversation is less than crystal clear:\n\n       A JUROR: . . . Do you remember Betty Currie saying that the \n     President had told her to call?\n       [MS. LEWINSKY]: Right now. I don't. I don't remember. . . .\n\n     App. at 1141 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98).\n       Moreover, Ms. Currie has repeatedly and unvaryingly stated \n     that it was Ms. Lewinsky who contacted Ms. Currie about the \n     gifts, not the other way around. A few examples include:\n        ``LEWINSKY called CURRIE and advised she had to \n     return all gifts CLINTON had given LEWINSKY as there was talk \n     going around about the gifts.'' Supp. at 531 (Currie FBI 302 \n     1/24/98);\n        ``Monica said she was getting concerned, and she \n     wanted to give me the stuff the President had given her--or \n     give me a box of stuff. It was a box of stuff.'' Supp. at 557 \n     (Currie GJ 1/27/98);\n        Q: . . . Just tell us for a moment how this issue \n     first arose and what you did about it and what Ms. Lewinsky \n     told you.\n        A: The best I remember it first arose with a \n     conversation. I don't know if it was over the telephone or in \n     person. I don't know. She asked me if I would pick up a box. \n     She said Isikoff had been inquiring about gifts.'' Supp. at \n     582 (Currie GJ 5/6/98);\n        ``The best I remember she said that she wanted me \n     to hold these gifts--hold this--she may have said gifts, I'm \n     sure she said gifts, box of gifts--I don't remember--because \n     people were asking questions. And I said, `Fine.' '' Supp. at \n     581 (Currie GJ 5/6/98);\n        ``The best I remember is Monica calls me and asks \n     me if she can give me some gifts, if I'd pick up some gifts \n     for her.'' Supp. at 706 (Currie GJ 7/22/98).\n       The Committee Report attempts to portray Ms. Currie's \n     memory as faulty on the key issue of whether Ms. Lewinsky \n     initiated the gift retrieval by unfairly referencing Ms. \n     Currie's answer to a completely different question. Ms. \n     Currie was asked whether she had discussed with the President \n     Ms. Lewinsky's ``turning over to [her]'' the gift he had \n     given her. Ms. Currie indicated that she could remember no \n     such occasion. ``If Monica said [Ms. Currie] talked to the \n     President about it,'' she was then asked, ``would that not be \n     true?'' Then, only on the limited question of whether Ms. \n     Currie ever talked to the President about the gifts--wholly \n     separate from the issue of who made the initial contact--did \n     Ms. Currie courteously defer, ``Then she may remember better \n     than I. I don't remember.'' Supp. at 584 (Currie GJ 5/6/98). \n     Ironically, it is the substance of this very allegation--\n     regarding conversations between Ms. Currie and the \n     President--that Ms. Lewinsky told the grand jury she could \n     not recall. (In later testimony, referring to a conversation \n     she had with the President on January 21, Ms. Currie \n     testified that she was ``sure'' that she did not discuss the \n     fact that she had a box of Ms. Lewinsky's belongings under \n     her bed. Supp. at 705 (Currie GJ 7/22/98).)\n       To support its theory that Ms. Currie initiated a call to \n     Ms. Lewinsky, the House Managers place great reliance on a \n     cell phone record of Ms. Currie, calling it ``key evidence \n     that Ms. Currie's fuzzy recollection is wrong'' and which \n     ``conclusively proves'' that ``the President directed Ms. \n     Currie to pick up the gifts.'' House Br. at 33. There is \n     record of a one-minute call on December 28, 1998 from Ms. \n     Currie's cell phone to Ms. Lewinsky's home at 3:32 p.m. Even \n     assuming Ms. Lewinsky is correct that Ms. Currie picked up \n     the gifts on December 28, her own testimony refutes the \n     possibility that the Managers' mysterious 3:32 p.m. telephone \n     call could have been the initial contact by Ms. Currie to \n     retrieve the gifts. To the contrary, the timing and duration \n     of the call strongly suggest just the opposite. It is \n     undisputed that Ms. Lewinsky entered the White House on the \n     morning of December 28 at 8:16 a.m. App. at 111 (White House \n     entry records). While no exit time for Ms. Lewinsky was \n     recorded because she inadvertently left her visitor badge in \n     the White House, she has testified that the visit lasted \n     around an hour. App. at 870-72 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98). \n     Consistent with this timing, records also indicate that the \n     President left the Oval Office at 9:52 a.m., thus placing Ms. \n     Lewinsky's exit around 9:30 to 9:45 a.m. App. at 111. Ms. \n     Lewinsky has indicated on several occasions that her \n     discussion with Betty Currie occurred just ``several hours'' \n     after she left. App. at 875 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98); App. at \n     1395 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/27/98). Ms. Lewinsky three times \n     placed the timing of the actual gift exchange with Ms. Currie \n     ``at about 2:00 p.m.'' App at 1127 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98); \n     App. at 1396 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/27/98); App. at 1482 \n     (Lewinsky FBI 302 8/1/98). This, in light of undisputed \n     documentary evidence and Ms. Lewinsky's own testimony, it \n     becomes clear that the 3:32 p.m. telephone record relied upon \n     by the Committee Report in fact is unlikely to reflect a call \n     placed to initiate the pick-up.\n       Apart from this conspicuous timing defect, there is \n     another, independent reason to conclude that the 3:32 p.m. \n     telephone call could not have been the conversation Ms. \n     Lewinsky describes. The 3:32 p.m. call is documented to have \n     lasted no longer than one minute, and because such calls are \n     rounded up to the nearest minute, it quite conceivably could \n     have been much shorter in duration. It is difficult to \n     imagine that the conversation reflected in Ms. Lewinsky's \n     statements could have taken place in less than one minute. \n     Both Ms. Currie and Ms. Lewinsky have described the various \n     matters that were discussed in their initial conversation: \n     not only was this the first time the topic of returning gifts \n     was discussed, which quite likely generated some discussion \n     between the two, but they also had to discuss and arrange a \n     convenient plan for Ms. Currie to make the pick-\n     up.99\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\99\\ The OIC Referral, which took great pains to point out \n     every allegedly incriminating piece of evidence, made no \n     reference to this telephone record, perhaps because the OIC \n     knew it tended not to corroborate Ms. Lewinsky's time line. \n     In its place, the Referral rested its corroboration hopes in \n     the following bizarre analysis: ``More generally, the person \n     making the extra effort (in this case, Ms. Currie) is \n     ordinarily the person requesting the favor.'' Referral at \n     170. Wisely, the House Managers chose not to pursue this \n     groundless speculation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       What, then, to make of this call so heavily relied upon by \n     the House Managers? The record is replete with references \n     that Ms. Currie and Ms. Lewinsky communicated very \n     frequently, especially during this December 1997-January 1998 \n     time period. See, e.g., Supp. at 554 (Currie GJ 1/27/98) \n     (many calls around Christmas-time). They often called or \n     paged each other to discuss a host of topics, including Ms. \n     Lewinsky's pending job search, Ms. Currie's mother's illness, \n     and her contacts with Mr. Jordan. There is simply no reason \n     to believe this call was anything other than one of the many \n     calls and exchanges of pages that these two shared during the \n     period.\n       c. The Obstruction-by-Gift-Concealment Charge Is at Odds \n           With the President's Actions\n       Ultimately, and irrespective of the absence of evidence \n     implicating the President in Ms. Lewinsky's gift concealment, \n     the charge fails because it is inconsistent with other events \n     of the very same day. There is absolutely no dispute that the \n     President gave Ms. Lewinsky numerous additional gifts during \n     their December 28 meeting. It must therefore be assumed that \n     on the very day the President and Ms. Lewinsky were \n     conspiring to hide the gifts he had already given to her, the \n     President added to the pile. No stretch of logic will support \n     such an outlandish theory.\n       From the beginning, this inherent contradiction has puzzled \n     investigators. If there were a plot to conceal these gifts, \n     why did the President give Ms. Lewinsky several more gifts at \n     the very moment the concealment plan was allegedly hatched? \n     The House Managers OIC prosecutors, grand jurors, and even \n     Ms. Lewinsky hopelessly searched for an answer to that \n     essential question:\n\n       Q: Although, Ms. Lewinsky, I think what is sort of--it \n     seems a little odd and, I guess really the grand jurors \n     wanted your impression of it, was on the same day that you're \n     discussing basically getting the gifts to Betty to conceal \n     them, he's giving you a new set of gifts.\n       A: You know, I have come recently to look at that as sort \n     of a strange situation, I think, in the course of the past \n     few weeks. . . .\n\n     App. at 887-88 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98) (emphasis added). See \n     House Br. at 34.\n       The Committee Report fails to resolve this significant flaw \n     in its theory.100 The report admits that Ms. \n     Lewinsky ``can't answer'' why the President would in one \n     breath give her gifts and in the next hatch a plan to take \n     them back. But it cites only to Ms. Lewinsky's understanding \n     of the relationship's pattern of concealment and how she \n     contemplated it must apply to the gifts. It creates the \n     erroneous impression that the President gave Ms. Lewinsky \n     instructions to conceal the gifts in the December 28 meeting \n     by quoting her testimony that ``from everything he said to \n     me'' she would conceal the gifts. But we know that Ms. \n     Lewinsky has\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\n     repeatedly testified that no such discussion ever occurred. \n     Her reliance on ``everything he said to me'' must, therefore, \n     reflect her own plan to implement discussions the two had had \n     about concealing the relationship long before her role in the \n     Jones litigation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\100\\ Incredibly, not only does the Committee Report fail to \n     offer a sensible answer to this perplexity, but without any \n     factual or logical support it accuses the President of lying \n     to the grand jury when he testified that he was not \n     particularly concerned about the gifts he had given Ms. \n     Lewinsky and thus had no compunction about giving her \n     additional gifts on December 28. Article I (4). For whatever \n     reason, neither the Committee Report nor the OIC Referral \n     acknowledges the most reasonable explanation for these \n     events: as the President has testified repeatedly, he was not \n     concerned about the gifts he had given Ms. Lewinsky.\n      ``I was never hung up about this gift issue. Maybe \n     it's because I have a different experience. But, you know, \n     the President gets hundreds of gifts a year, maybe more. I \n     have always given a lot of gifts to people, especially if \n     they give me gifts. And this was no big deal to me.'' App. at \n     495.\n      ``this gift business . . . didn't bother me.'' App. \n     at 496.\n      ``I wasn't troubled by this gift issue.'' App. at \n     497.\n      ``I have always given a lot of people gifts. I have \n     always been given gifts. I do not think there is anything \n     improper about a man giving a woman a gift, or a woman giving \n     a man a gift, that necessarily connotes an improper \n     relationship. So, it didn't bother me.'' App. at 498.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       What this passage confirms is that Ms. Lewinsky had very \n     much in her mind that she would do what she could to conceal \n     the relationship--a modus operandi she herself acknowledged \n     well pre-dated the Jones litigation. That she took such steps \n     does not mean that the President knew of or participated in \n     them. Indeed, it appears that the entire gift-concealment \n     plan arose not from any plan suggested by the President--\n     which the Committee Report so desperately struggles to \n     maintain--but rather more innocently from the actions of a \n     young woman taking steps she thought were best.\\101\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\101\\ As the President has stated about this potentiality, \n     ``I didn't then, I don't now see this [the gifts] as a \n     problem. And if she thought it was a problem, I think it--it \n     must have been from a, really a misapprehension of the \n     circumstances. I certainly never encouraged her not to, to \n     comply lawfully with a subpoena.'' App. at 497-98 (emphasis \n     added.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In any event, the record evidence is abundantly clear that \n     the President has not obstructed justice by any plan or \n     scheme to conceal gifts he had given to Ms. Lewinsky, and \n     logic and reason fully undercut any such theory.\n     4. The President denies that he obstructed justice in \n         connection with Monica Lewinsky's efforts to obtain a job \n         in New York in an effort to ``corruptly prevent'' her \n         ``truthful testimony'' in the Jones case\n       Again, in the absence of specifics in Article II itself, we \n     look to the Committee Report for guidance on the actual \n     charges. The Committee Report would like to portray this \n     claim in as sinister a light as possible, and it alleges that \n     the President of the United States employed his close friend \n     Vernon Jordan to get Monica Lewinsky a job in New York to \n     influence her testimony or perhaps get her away from the \n     Jones lawyers. To reach this conclusion, and without the \n     benefit of a single piece of direct evidence to support the \n     charge, it ignores the direct testimony of several witnesses, \n     assigns diabolical purposes to a series of innocuous events, \n     and then claims that ``[i]t is logical to infer from this \n     chain of events'' that the job efforts ``were motivated to \n     influence the testimony of'' Ms. Lewinsky. Committee Report \n     at 71. Again, the evidence contradicts the inferences the \n     Committee Report strives to draw. Ms. Lewinsky's New York job \n     search began on her own initiative long before her \n     involvement in the Jones case. By her own forceful testimony, \n     her job search had no connection to the Jones case.\n       Mr. Jordan agreed to help Ms. Lewinsky not at the direction \n     of the President but upon the request of Betty Currie, Mr. \n     Jordan's long-time friend. And bizarrely, the idea to involve \n     Mr. Jordan (which arose well before Ms. Lewinsky became a \n     possible Jones witness) came not from the President but \n     apparently emanated from Ms. Tripp. In short, the facts \n     directly frustrate the House Majority's theory.\\102\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\102\\ This allegation has gone through several iterations. As \n     initially referred to the House of Representatives, the \n     charge was that the President ``help[ed] Ms. Lewinsky obtain \n     a job in New York at a time when she would have been a \n     witness against him'' in the Jones case. OIC Referral at 181. \n     Faced with the significant evidence that Ms. Lewinsky's job \n     efforts had originated long before she became involved in the \n     Jones case and were in fact entirely unrelated to the Jones \n     case, the Judiciary Committee Majority was forced to recraft \n     this claim. Instead of implying a complete connection between \n     the job search and the Jones ligitation, the article now \n     oddly charges that the President intensified and succeeded in \n     an effort to secure job assistance'' for Ms. Lewinsky ``at a \n     time when the truthful testimony of [Ms. Lewinsky] would have \n     been harmful to him,'' Article II (5) (emphasis added)--\n     thereby admitting that the initial effort was motivated by \n     appropriate concerns.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       a. The Complete Absence of Direct Evidence Supporting This \n           Charge\n       It is hard to overstate the importance of the fact that--by \n     the House Managers', the Committee Report's and the OIC's own \n     admission--there is not one single piece of direct evidence \n     to support this charge. Not one. Indeed, just the contrary is \n     true. Both Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan have repeatedly \n     testified that there was never an explicit or implicit \n     agreement, suggestion, or implication that Ms. Lewinsky would \n     be rewarded with a job for her silence or false testimony. \n     One need look no further than their own testimony:\n\n       Lewsinky: ``[N]o one ever asked me to lie and I was never \n     promised a job for my silence.'' App. at 1161 (Lewinsky GJ 8/\n     20/98);\n       ``There was no agreement with the President, JORDAN, or \n     anyone else that LEWINSKY had to sign the Jones affidavit \n     before getting a job in New York. LEWINSKY never demanded a \n     job from Jordan in exchange for a favorable affidavit. Nether \n     the President nor JORDAN ever told LEWINSKY that she had to \n     lie.'' App. at 1398 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/27/98).\n       Jordan: ``As far as I was concerned, [the job and the \n     affidavit] were two very separate matters.'' Supp. at 1737 \n     (Jordan GJ 3/5/98).\n       ``Unequivocally, indubitably, no''--in response to the \n     question whether the job search and the affidavit were in any \n     way connected. Supp. at 1827 (Jordan GJ 5/5/98).\\103\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\103\\ The only person who suggested any such quid pro quo was \n     Ms. Tripp, who repeatedly urged Ms. Lewinsky to demand such \n     linkage. App. at 1493 (Lewinsky FBI 302 8/2/98 (``TRIPP told \n     LEWINSKY not to sign the affidavit until LEWINSKY had a \n     job.''). To appease Linda Tripp's repeated demands on this \n     point, Ms. Lewinsky ultimately told Ms. Tripp that she had \n     told Mr. Jordan she wouldn't sign the affidavit until she had \n     a job. But as she later emphasized to the grand jury, ``That \n     was definitely a lie, based on something Linda had made me \n     promise her on January 9th.'' App. at 1134 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/\n     98).\n\n       This is the direct evidence. The House Managers' \n     circumstantial ``chain of events'' case, House Br. 39-41, \n     cannot overcome the hurdle the direct evidence presents.\n       b. Background of Ms. Lewinsky's New York Job Search\n       By its terms, Article II(4) would have the Senate evaluate \n     Ms. Lewinsky's job search by considering only the \n     circumstances ``[b]eginning on or about December 7, 1977.'' \n     Article II(4). Although barely mentioned in the Committee \n     Report's ``explanation'' of Article II(4), the significant \n     events occurring before December 7, 1997 cannot simply be \n     ignored because they are inconsistent with the Majority's \n     theory. Without reciting every detail, the undisputed record \n     establishes that the following facts occurred long before Ms. \n     Lewinsky was involved in the Jones case:\n       First, Ms. Lewinsky had contemplated looking for a job in \n     New York as early as July 1997. App. at 1414 (Lewinsky FBI \n     302 7/29/98) (July 3 letter ``first time [Lewinsky] mentioned \n     the possibility of moving to New York''); App. at 787-788 (On \n     July 4, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky wrote the President a letter \n     describing her interest in a job ``in New York at the United \n     Nations''); Committee Report at 10 (``Ms. Lewinsky had been \n     searching for a highly paid job in New York since the \n     previous July.'') She conveyed that prospect to a friend on \n     September 2, 1997. App. at 2811 (Lewinsky e-mail).\n       Second, in early October, at the request of Ms. Currie, \n     then-Deputy Chief of Staff John Podesta asked U.N. Ambassador \n     Bill Richardson to consider Ms. Lewinsky for a position at \n     the U.N. Supp. at 3404 (Richardson GJ 4/3/98). Ms. Currie \n     testified that she was acting on her own in this effort. \n     Supp. at 592 (Currie GJ 5/6/98).\n       Third, around October 6, Ms. Tripp told Ms. Lewinsky that \n     an acquaintance in the White House reported that it was \n     unlikely Ms. Lewinsky would ever be re-employed at the White \n     House. After this disclosure, Ms. Lewinsky ``was mostly \n     resolved to look for a job in the private sector in New \n     York.'' App. at 1543-44 (Lewinsky FBI 302) 8/13/98; see also \n     App. at 1460 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/31/98) (remarks by the Linda \n     Tripp acquaintance were the ``straw that broke the camel's \n     back'').\n       Fourth, sometime prior to October 9, 1997, Ms. Tripp and \n     Ms. Lewinsky discussed the prospect of enlisting Mr. Vernon \n     Jordan to assist Ms. Lewinsky in obtaining a private sector \n     job in New York. App. at 822-24 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98); see \n     also App. at 1079 (Lewinsky GJ 8/20/98) (``I don't remember . \n     . . if [enlisting Jordan] was my idea or Linda's idea. And I \n     know that that came up in discussions with her, I believe, \n     before I discussed it with the President''). On either \n     October 9 or 11, Ms. Lewinsky conveyed to the President this \n     idea of asking Mr. Jordan for assistance. Id.\n       Fifth, in mid-October, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky purchased a book \n     on jobs in New York. App. at 1462 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/31/98). \n     Ms. Lewinsky completed and sent to Betty Currie at the White \n     House a packet of jobs-related materials on October 15 or 16. \n     Supp. at 735 (Lewinsky Tripp tape of 10/15/97 conversation).\n       Sixth, on October 31, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky interviewed for a \n     position with Ambassador Bill Richardson at the United \n     Nations in New York. Ambassador Richardson was ``impressed'' \n     with Ms. Lewinsky and, on November 3, offered her a position, \n     which she ultimately rejected. Supp. at 3411 (Richardson GJ \n     4/30/98); Supp. at 3731 (Sutphen GJ 5/27/98). Ms. Currie \n     informed the President that Ms. Lewinsky had received a job \n     offer at the U.N. Supp. at 592 (Currie GJ 5/6/98). Ambassador \n     Richardson never spoke to the President or Mr. Jordan about \n     Ms. Lewinsky, and he testified emphatically and repeatedly \n     that no one pressured him to hire her. Supp. at 3422-23 \n     (Richardson GJ 4/30/98); Supp. at 3418 (same); Supp. at 3429 \n     (same).\n       Seventh, as of late October or November, Ms. Lewinsky had \n     told Mr. Kenneth Bacon, her boss at the Pentagon, that she \n     wanted to leave the Pentagon and move to New York. In a \n     series of conversations, she enlisted his assistance in \n     obtaining a private sector job in New York. Supp. at 11 \n     (Kenneth Bacon FBI 302 2/26/98). In response, Mr. Bacon \n     contacted Howard Paster, CEO of the public relations firm \n     Hill & Knowlton about Ms. Lewinsky. Id.\n       Eighth, in November, Ms. Lewinsky gave notice to the \n     Pentagon that she would be leaving her Pentagon job at year's \n     end. Supp. at 116 (Clifford Bernath GJ 5/21/98).\n       Ninth, Ms. Lewinsky apparently had a preliminary meeting \n     with Mr. Jordan on November 5, 1997 to discuss her job \n     search. During this twenty-minute meeting, Ms. Lewinsky and \n     Mr. Jordan discussed a list of potential employers she had \n     compiled. App. at 1464-65 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/31/98). In that \n     meeting, Ms. Lewinsky never informed Mr. Jordan of any time \n     constraints on her need for job assistance. Supp. at 2647 \n     (Lewinsky-Tripp Tape of 11/8/97 conversation). Mr. Jordan had \n     to leave town the next day. App. at 1465 (Lewinsky FBI 302 \n     Form 7/31/98). Ms. Lewinsky had a follow-up telephone \n     conversation with Mr. Jordan around Thanksgiving wherein he \n     advised her that he was ``working on her job search'' and \n     instructed\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\n     her to call him again ``around the first week of December.'' \n     App. at 1465 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/31/98); see also App. at 825 \n     (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98) (``And so Betty arranged for me to speak \n     with [Jordan] again and I spoke with him when I was in Los \n     Angeles before--right before Thanksgiving.'') \\104\\ \n     Inexplicably, the Committee Report, the presentation by its \n     chief counsel, and the Starr Referral all choose to ignore \n     this key piece of testimony--that contact resumed in early \n     December because Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan agreed (in \n     November) that it would. See Committee Report at 10 (``Ms. \n     Lewinsky had no further contacts with Mr. Jordan at that time \n     [early November to mid December].''); Schippers Dec. 10, 1998 \n     Presentation at 38 (``Vernon Jordan, who, by the way, had \n     done nothing from early November to mid-December.''); \n     Referral at 182 (``Ms. Lewinsky had no contact with . . . Mr. \n     Jordan for another month [after November 5].'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\104\\ Mr. Jordan was then out of the country from the day \n     after Thanksgiving until December 4. Supp. at 1804 (Jordan GJ \n     5/5/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In sum, the record is clear that Ms. Lewinsky decided on \n     her own to seek a job in New York many months before her \n     involvement in the Jones case. She had asked her Pentagon \n     boss to help, as well as Ms. Currie, who arranged indirectly \n     for Ms. Lewinsky to interview with Ambassador Richardson at \n     the United Nations. Mr. Jordan became involved in the job \n     search at the request of Ms. Currie (apparently at the \n     suggestion of Ms. Tripp) and, notwithstanding his travels in \n     November, Supp. at 1811 (Jordan GJ 5/5/98), kept in contact \n     with Ms. Lewinsky with plans to reconvene early in December.\n       c. The Committee Report's Circumstantial Case\n       Article II ignores this background and merely alleges that \n     efforts to aid Ms. Lewinsky's job search ``intensified and \n     succeeded'' in December 1997. While not adopted in the \n     article, the House Brief, the Committee Report, and the \n     accompanying final presentation by Majority Counsel Schippers \n     offer some guidance as to the meaning of the actual charge. \n     They cite three events--Mr. Jordan's December 11 meeting with \n     Ms. Lewinsky to discuss job prospects in New York, Ms. \n     Lewinsky's execution of her Jones affidavit, and her receipt \n     of a job--in an effort to portray Ms. Lewinsky's job search \n     as sinister. But the full record easily dispels any \n     suggestion that there were any obstructive or improper acts.\n\n      (1) Monica Lewinsky's December 11 meeting with Vernon Jordan\n\n       The House Managers and the Committee Report suggest that \n     Mr. Jordan took action on Ms. Lewinsky's job search request \n     only after, and because, Ms. Lewinsky's name appeared on the \n     witness list on December 5 and only after, and because, Judge \n     Wright ordered the President to answer certain questions \n     about ``other women'' on December 11. See House Br. at 21. \n     Consider the Committee Report portrayal:\n\n       ``[T]he effort to obtain a job for Monica Lewinsky in New \n     York intensified after the President learned, on December 6, \n     1997, that Monica Lewinsky was listed on the witness list for \n     the case Jones v. Clinton.\\105\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\105\\ Committee Report at 70. That portrayal flatly \n     contradicts the Committee Report's earlier statement that on \n     December 6 ``there was still no urgency to help Lewinsky.'' \n     Committee Report at 10-11.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On December 7, 1997, President Clinton met with Vernon \n     Jordan at the White House. Ms. Lewinsky met with Mr. Jordan \n     on December 11 to discuss specific job contacts in New York. \n     Mr. Jordan then made calls to certain New York companies on \n     Ms. Lewinsky's behalf. Jordan telephoned President Clinton to \n     keep him informed of the efforts to get Ms. Lewinsky a job.'' \n     Committee Report at 70.\n       ``Something happened that changed the priority assigned to \n     the job search. On the morning of December 11, 1997, Judge \n     Susan Webber Wright ordered President Clinton to provide \n     information regarding any state or federal employee with whom \n     he had, proposed, or sought sexual relations. To keep Ms. \n     Lewinsky satisfied was now of critical importance.'' \n     Committee Report at 11.\n\n       The unmistakable intention of this narrative is to suggest \n     that, after the President learned Ms. Lewinsky's name was on \n     the witness list on December 6, he (1) contacted Mr. Jordan \n     on December 7 to engage his assistance for Ms. Lewinsky, and \n     only then did Mr. Jordan agree to meet with Ms. Lewinsky, and \n     further, that (2) Mr. Jordan met with Ms. Lewinsky on \n     December 11 and took concrete steps to help Ms. Lewinsky only \n     after and as a result of Judge Wright's December 11 order. \n     Both suggestions are demonstrably false.\n       The President had nothing to do with arranging the December \n     11 meeting between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky. As the record \n     indicates, after receiving a request from Ms. Currie on \n     December 5 that he meet with Ms. Lewinsky, and telling Ms. \n     Currie to have Ms. Lewinsky call him, Ms. Lewinsky called Mr. \n     Jordan on December 8. Supp. at 1705 (Jordan GJ 3/3/98). As \n     noted above, that call had been presaged by a conversation \n     between Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky around Thanksgiving in \n     which Jordan told her ``he was working on her job search'' \n     and asked her to contact him again ``around the first week of \n     December.'' App. at 1465 (Lewinsky FBI 302 7/31/98). In the \n     December 8 call, the two arranged for Ms. Lewinsky to come to \n     Mr. Jordan's office on December 11; on the same day, Ms. \n     Lewinsky sent Mr. Jordan via courier a copy of her resume. \n     Supp. at 1705 (Jordan GJ 3/3/98). At the time of that \n     contact, Mr. Jordan did not even know that Ms. Lewinsky knew \n     President Clinton. Id.\n       In the intervening period before Ms. Lewinsky's December 11 \n     meeting with Mr. Jordan, the President met with Mr. Jordan on \n     December 7. As the Committee Report acknowledges, that \n     meeting had nothing to do with Ms. Lewinsky. Committee Report \n     at 11. Yet the House Managers' Brief, like the Committee \n     Report before it, states that ``the sudden interest [in \n     helping Ms. Lewinsky obtain a job] was inspired by a court \n     order entered on December 11, 1997'' in the Jones case.\\106\\ \n     House Br. at 21. No evidence supports that supposition. The \n     December 11 meeting had been scheduled on December 8. Neither \n     the OIC Referral nor the Committee Report nor the Managers' \n     Brief cites any evidence that the President or Mr. Jordan had \n     any knowledge of the contents of that Order at the time of \n     the December 11 meeting.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\106\\ That Order authorized Paula Jones' attorneys to obtain \n     discovery relating to certain government employees ``with \n     whom the President had sexual relations, proposed sexual \n     relations, or sought to have sexual relations.'' House Br. at \n     21.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Mr. Jordan met with Ms. Lewinsky shortly after 1:00 p.m. on \n     December 11. Supp. at 1863 (Akin Gump visitor log); Supp. at \n     1809 (Jordan GJ 5/5/98). In anticipation of that meeting, Mr. \n     Jordan had made several calls to prospective employers about \n     Ms. Lewinsky. Supp. at 1807-09 (Jordan GJ 5/5/98). Mr. Jordan \n     spoke about Ms. Lewinsky with Mr. Peter Georgescu of Young & \n     Rubicam at 9:45 a.m. that morning, and with Mr. Richard \n     Halperin of Revlon around 1:00 p.m., immediately before \n     meeting with Ms. Lewinsky. Supp. at 1807-09 (Jordan GJ 5/5/\n     98). Again, there is no evidence that any of this occurred \n     after Mr. Jordan learned of Judge Wright's order.\n       Although the Committee Report claims that a heightened \n     sense of urgency attached in December which ``intensified'' \n     the job search efforts, it ignores the sworn testimony of Mr. \n     Jordan denying any such intensification: ``Oh, no. I do not \n     recall any heightened sense of urgency [in December]. What I \n     do recall is that I dealt with it when I had time to do it.'' \n     Supp. at 1811 (Jordan GJ 5/5/98).\\107\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\107\\ Mr. Jordan explained that not much activity occurred in \n     November because ``I was traveling.'' Supp. at 1811 (Jordan \n     GJ 9/5/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The ``heightened urgency'' theory also is undermined by the \n     simple fact that Mr. Jordan indisputably placed no pressure \n     on any company to give Ms. Lewinsky a job and suggested no \n     date by which Ms. Lewinsky had to be hired. The first person \n     Mr. Jordan contacted, Mr. Georgescu of Young & Rubicam/\n     Burson-Marsteller, told investigators that Mr. Jordan did not \n     engage in a ``sales pitch'' for Lewinsky. Supp. at 1222 \n     (Georgescu FBI 302 3/25/98). Mr. Georgescu told Mr. Jordan \n     that the company ``would take a look at [Ms. Lewinsky] in the \n     usual way,'' Supp. at 1219 (Georgescu FBI 302 1/29/98), and \n     that once the initial interview was set up, Ms. Lewinsky \n     would be ``on [her] own from that point.'' Supp. at 1222 \n     (Georgescu FBI 302 3/25/98). The executive who interviewed \n     Ms. Lewinsky at Burson-Marsteller stated that Ms. Lewinsky's \n     recruitment process went ``by the book'' and, ``while \n     somewhat accelerated,'' the process ``went through the normal \n     steps.'' Supp. at 111 (Berk FBI 302 3/31/98).\n       At American Express, Mr. Jordan contacted Ms. Ursula \n     Fairbairn, who stated that Mr. Jordan exerted ``no . . . \n     pressure'' to hire Lewinsky. Supp. at 1087 (Fairbairn FBI 302 \n     2/4/98). Indeed, she considered it ``not unusual for board \n     members'' like Mr. Jordan to recommend talented people for \n     employment and noted that Mr. Jordan had recently recommended \n     another person just a few months earlier. Id. The person who \n     interviewed Ms. Lewinsky stated that he felt ``absolutely no \n     pressure'' to hire her and indeed told her she did not have \n     the qualifications necessary for the position. Supp. at 3521 \n     (Schick FBI 302 1/29/98).\n       Perhaps most telling of the absence of pressure applied by \n     Mr. Jordan is the fact that neither Young & Rubicam/Burson-\n     Marsteller or American Express offered Ms. Lewinsky a job.\n       Similarly, at MacAndrews & Forbes/Revlon, where Ms. \n     Lewinsky ultimately was offered a job (see below), Mr. Jordan \n     initially contacted Mr. Halperin, who has stated that it was \n     not unusual for Mr. Jordan to make an employment \n     recommendation. Supp. at 1281 (Halperin FBI 302 1/26/98). \n     Moreover, he emphasized that Mr. Jordan did not ``ask [him] \n     to work on any particular timetable,'' Supp. at 1294 \n     (Halperin GJ 4/23/98), and that ``there was no implied time \n     constraint or requirement for fast action.'' Supp. at 1286 \n     (Halperin FBI 3/27/98.)\n       (2) The January job interviews and the Revlon employment \n           offer\n       The Committee Report attempts to conflate separate and \n     unrelated acts--the signing of the affidavit and the Revlon \n     job offer--to sustain its otherwise unsustainable obstruction \n     theory. The Committee Report's description of these events is \n     deftly misleading:\n\n       ``The next day, January 7, Monica Lewinsky signed the false \n     affidavit. She showed the executed copy to Mr. Jordan that \n     same day. She did this so that Mr. Jordan could report to \n     President Clinton that it had been signed and another mission \n     had been accomplished.\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\n       On January 8, Ms. Lewinsky had an interview arranged by Mr. \n     Jordan with MacAndrews & Forbes in New York. The interview \n     went poorly. Afterwards, Ms. Lewinsky called Mr. Jordan and \n     informed him. Mr. Jordan, who had done nothing from early \n     November to mid-December, then called the chief executive \n     officer of MacAndrews & Forbes, Ron Perelman, to ``make \n     things happen, if they could happen.'' Mr. Jordan called Ms. \n     Lewinsky back and told her not to worry. That evening, \n     MacAndrews & Forbes called Ms. Lewinsky and told her that she \n     would be given more interviews the next morning.\n       The next morning, Ms. Lewinsky received her reward for \n     signing the false affidavit. After a series of interviews \n     with MacAndrews & Forbes personnel, she was informally \n     offered a job. Committee Report at 18 (citations omitted).\n\n       By this portrayal, the Committee Report suggests two \n     conclusions: first, that Ms. Lewinsky was ``reward[ed]'' with \n     a job for her signing of the affidavit; second, that the only \n     reason Ms. Lewinsky was given a second interview and \n     ultimately hired at Revlon was Mr. Jordan's intervention with \n     Mr. Perelman. Once again, both conclusions are demonstrably \n     false.\n       Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky have testified under oath that \n     there was no causal connection between the job search and the \n     affidavit. The only person to draw (or, actually, recommend) \n     any such linkage was Ms. Tripp. The factual record easily \n     debunks the second insinuation--that Ms. Lewinsky was hired \n     as a direct result of Mr. Jordan's call to Mr. Perelman. One \n     fact is virtually dispositive: the Revlon executive who \n     scheduled Ms. Lewinsky's January 9 interview and decided to \n     hire her that same day never even knew about Mr. Jordan's \n     call to Mr. Perelman, or any interest Mr. Perelman might have \n     in Ms. Lewinsky, and thus could not have been acting in \n     furtherance of such a plan.\n       Ms. Lewinsky initially interviewed with Mr. Halperin of \n     MacAndrews & Forbes (Revlon's parent company) on December 18, \n     1997. (Mr. Jordan had spoken with Mr. Halperin on December \n     11.) Prior to interviewing Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Halperin \n     forwarded a copy of her resume to Mr. Jaymie Durnan, also of \n     MacAndrews & Forbes, for his consideration. Supp. at 1286-87 \n     (Halperin FBI 302 3/27/98). Following his interview of Ms. \n     Lewinsky, Mr. Halperin thought that she would likely be \n     ``shipped to Revlon'' for consideration. Id.\n       Mr. Durnan received Ms. Lewinsky's resume from Mr. Halperin \n     in mid-December and, after reviewing it, decided to interview \n     Ms. Lewinsky after the first of the year. (He was going on \n     vocation the last two weeks of December). Supp. at 1053 \n     (Durnan FBI 302 3/27/98). When he returned from vacation, his \n     assistant scheduled an interview with Ms. Lewinsky for \n     January 7, 1998, but, because of scheduling problems, he \n     rescheduled the interview for the next day, January 8, 1998. \n     Supp. at 1049 (Durnan FBI 302 1/26/98). Mr. Durnan's decision \n     to interview Ms. Lewinsky was made independently of the \n     decision by Mr. Halperin to interview her. Indeed, only when \n     Mr. Durnan interviewed Ms. Lewinsky in January did he \n     discover that she had had a December interview with Mr. \n     Halperin. Id.\n       It was this interview with Mr. Durnan that Ms. Lewinsky \n     later described as having gone poorly in her view. App. at \n     926 (Lewinsky GJ 8/6/98). The House Managers (``[t]he \n     interview went poorly,'' House Br. at 38), the Committee \n     Report (``The interview went poorly'', id. at 21), and the \n     OIC Referral (``The interview went poorly,'' id. at 184) all \n     emphasize only Ms. Lewinsky's impression of the job \n     interview--for obvious reasons: it tends to heighten the \n     supposed relevance of the Jordan call to Mr. Perelman. In \n     other words, under this theory, Ms. Lewinsky had no prospect \n     of a job at MacAndrews & Forbes/Revlon until Mr. Jordan \n     resurrected her chances with Mr. Perelman.\n       Unfortunately, like so much other ``evidence'' in the \n     obstruction case, the facts do not bear out this sinister \n     theory. Mr. Durnan had no similar impression that his \n     interview with Ms. Lewinsky had gone ``poorly.'' In fact, \n     just the opposite was true: he was ``impressed'' with Ms. \n     Lewinsky and thought that she would ``fit in'' with \n     MacAndrews & Forbes but ``there was nothing available at that \n     time which suited her interests.'' Supp. at 1054 (Durnan FBI \n     302 3/27/98). Mr. Durnan therefore decided to forward Ms. \n     Lewinsky's resume to Ms. Allyn Seidman of Revlon. After the \n     interview, he called Ms. Seidman and left her a voicemail \n     message about his interview with Ms. Lewinsky and explained \n     that, while there was no current opening at MacAndrews & \n     Forbes, ``perhaps there was something available at Revlon.'' \n     Id.\n       In the meantime, Mr. Jordan had called Mr. Perelman about \n     Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Perelman described this conversation as \n     ``very low key and casual.'' Supp. at 3273 (Perelman FBI 302 \n     1/26/98). Mr. Jordan ``made no specific requests and did not \n     request'' him ``to intervene''; nonetheless, Mr. Perelman \n     agreed to ``look into it.'' Id. Later that day, Mr. Durnan \n     spoke to Mr. Perelman, who mentioned that he had received a \n     call from Mr. Jordan about a job candidate. Mr. Perelman told \n     Mr. Durnan ``let's see what we can do,'' Supp. at 3276 \n     (Perelman FBI 302 3/27/98), but Mr. Durnan never concluded \n     that hiring Ms. Lewinsky was ``mandatory.'' Supp. at 1055 \n     (Durnan FBI 302 3/27/98). Mr. Perelman later called Mr. \n     Jordan and said they would do what they could; Mr. Jordan \n     expressed no urgency to Mr. Perelman. Supp. at 3276 (Perelman \n     FBI 302 3/27/98).\n       By the time Mr. Durnan had discussed Ms. Lewinsky with Mr. \n     Perelman, he had already forwarded her resume to Ms. Seidman \n     at Revlon. Supp. at 1049-50 (Durnan FBI 302 1/26/98). After \n     speaking with Mr. Perelman, Mr. Durnan spoke with Ms. \n     Seidman, following up on the voicemail message he had left \n     earlier that day. Supp. at 1055 (Durnan FBI 302 3/27/98). \n     Upon speaking to Ms. Seidman about Ms. Lewinsky, however, Mr. \n     Durnan did not tell Ms. Seidman that CEO Perelman has \n     expressed any interest in Ms. Lewinsky. Id. Rather, he simply \n     said that if she liked Ms. Lewinsky, she should hire her. \n     Supp. at 1050 (Durnan FBI 302 1/26/98).\n       For her part, Ms. Seidman has testified that she had no \n     idea that Mr. Perelman had expressed interest in Ms. \n     Lewinsky:\n\n       Q: Did [Mr. Durnan] indicate to you that he had spoken to \n     anyone else within MacAndrews or Revlon about Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       A: Not that I recall, no.\n       Q: Do you have knowledge as to whether or not Mr. Perelman \n     spoke with anyone either on the MacAndrews & Forbes side or \n     the Revlon side about Monica Lewinsky?\n       A: No.\n\n     Supp. at 3642 (Seidman Depo. 4/23/98). Rather, Ms. Seidman's \n     consideration of Ms. Lewinsky proceeded on the merits. \n     Indeed, as a result of the interview, Ms. Seidman concluded \n     that Ms. Lewinsky was ``bright, articulate and polished,'' \n     Supp. at 3635 (Seidman FBI 302 1/26/98), and ``a talented, \n     enthusiastic, bright young woman'' who would be a ``good fit \n     in [her] department.'' Supp. at 3643 (Seidman Depo. 4/23/98). \n     She decided after the interview to hire Ms. Lewinsky, and \n     thereafter called Mr. Durnan ``and told him I thought she was \n     great,'' Id.\n       In sum, Ms. Seidman made the decision to grant an interview \n     and hire Ms. Lewinsky on the merits. She did not even know \n     that Mr. Perelman had expressed any interest in Ms. Lewinsky \n     or that Mr. Jordan had spoken to Mr. Perelman the day before. \n     As amply demonstrated, the House Managers' Jordan-Perelman \n     intervention theory just doesn't hold water.\n       d. Conclusion\n       From the preceding discussion of the factual record, two \n     conclusions are inescapable. First, there is simply no direct \n     evidence to support the job-for-silence obstruction theory. \n     From her initial proffer to the last minutes of her grand \n     jury appearance, the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky has been clear \n     and consistent: she was never asked or encouraged to lie or \n     promised a job for her silence or for a favorable affidavit. \n     Mr. Jordan has been equally unequivocal on this point. \n     Second, the ``chain of events'' circumstantial case upon \n     which this obstruction allegation must rest falls apart after \n     inspection of the full evidentiary record. Ms. Lewinsky's job \n     search began on her own volition and long before she was ever \n     a witness in the Jones case. Mr. Jordan's assistance \n     originated with a request from Ms. Currie, which had no \n     connection to events in the Jones litigation. No pressure was \n     applied to anyone at any time. And Ms. Lewinsky's ultimate \n     hiring had absolutely no connection to her signing of the \n     affidavit in the Jones case. Viewed on this unambiguous \n     record, the job-search allegations are plainly unsupportable.\n     5. The President denies that he ``corruptly allowed his \n         attorney to make false and misleading statements to a \n         Federal judge'' concerning Monica Lewinsky's affidavit\n       Article II (5) charges that the President engaged in an \n     obstruction of justice because he ``did not say anything'' \n     during his Jones deposition when his attorney cited the \n     Lewinsky affidavit to Judge Wright and stated that ``there is \n     no sex of any kind in any manner, shape, or form.'' Committee \n     Report at 72. The rationale underlying this charge of \n     obstruction of justice hinges on an odd combination of a \n     bizarrely heightened legal obligation, a disregard of the \n     actual record testimony, and a good does of amateur \n     psychology. This claim is factually and legally baseless.\n       The law, of course, imposes no obligation on a client to \n     monitor every statement and representation made by his or her \n     lawyer. Particularly in the confines of an ongoing civil \n     deposition, where clients are routinely counseled to focus on \n     the questions posed of them and their responses and ignore \n     all distractions, it is totally inappropriate to try to \n     remove a President from office because of a statement by his \n     attorney. Indeed, the President forcefully explained to the \n     grand jury that he was not focusing on the exchange between \n     lawyers but instead concentrating on his own testimony:\n        ``I'm not even sure I paid much attention to what \n     he was saying. I was thinking, I was ready to get on with my \n     testimony here and they were having these constant \n     discussions all through the deposition.'' App. at 476;\n        ``I was not paying a great deal of attention to \n     this exchange. I was focusing on my own testimony.'' App. at \n     510;\n        ``I'm quite sure that I didn't follow all the \n     interchanges between the lawyers all that carefully.'' App. \n     at 510;\n        ``I am not even sure that when Mr. Bennett made \n     that statement that I was concentrating on the exact words he \n     used.'' App. at 511;\n        ``When I was in there, I didn't think about my \n     lawyers. I was, frankly, thinking about myself and my \n     testimony and trying to answer the questions.'' App. at 512;\n        ``I didn't pay any attention to this colloquy that \n     went on. I was waiting for my instructions as a witness to go \n     forward. I was\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\n     worried about my own testimony.'' App. at 513.\n       The Committee Report ignores the President's repeated and \n     consistent description of his state of mind during the \n     deposition exchange. Instead, the Committee Report and \n     majority counsel's final presentation undertake a novel \n     exercise in video psychology, claiming that by studying the \n     President's facial expressions and by noting that he was \n     ``looking in Mr. Bennett's direction' during the exchange, it \n     necessarily follows that the President was in fact listening \n     to and concentrating on every single word uttered by his \n     attorney \\108\\ and knowingly made a decision not to correct \n     his attorney.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\108\\ It is upon this same fanciful methodology that the \n     Committee Report premises the allegation of Article I (3) \n     that the President lied to the grand jury in providing these \n     responses. Citing the President's oft-criticized response \n     about Mr. Bennett's use of the present tense in his statement \n     ``there is no sex of any'' (``It depends on what the meaning \n     of the word `is' is.'' App. at 510), the Committee Report \n     claims that such parsing contradicts the President's claim \n     that he was not paying close attention to the exchange. But \n     contrary to the Committee Report's suggestion, the \n     President's response to this question did not purport to \n     describe the President's contemporaneous thinking at the \n     deposition, but rather only in retrospect whether he agreed \n     with the questioner that it was ``an utterly false \n     statement.'' Id. The President later emphasized that he \n     ``wasn't trying to give . . . a cute answer'' in his earlier \n     explanation, but rather only that the average person thinking \n     in the present tense would likely consider that Mr. Bennett's \n     statement was accurate since the relationship had ended long \n     ago. App. at 513.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The futility of such an exercise is manifest. It is \n     especially unsettling when set against the President's \n     adamant denials that he harbored any contemporaneous or \n     meaningful realization of his attorney's colloquy with the \n     Judge. The theory is factually flimsy, legally unfounded, and \n     should be rejected.\n     6. The President denies that he obstructed justice by \n         relating ``false and misleading statements'' to ``a \n         potential witness,'' Betty Currie, ``in order to \n         corruptly influence [her] testimony''\n       There is no dispute that the President met with his \n     secretary, Ms. Currie, on the day after his Jones deposition \n     and discussed questions he had been asked about Ms. Lewinsky. \n     The Managers cast this conversation in the most sinister \n     light possible and alleges that the President attempted to \n     influence the testimony of a ``witness'' by pressuring Ms. \n     Currie to agree with an inaccurate version of facts about Ms. \n     Lewinsky. The Managers claim that ``the President essentially \n     admitted to making these statements when he knew they were \n     not true.'' House Br. at 47. That is totally false. The \n     President admitted nothing of the sort and the Managers cite \n     nothing in support. The President has adamantly denied that \n     he had any intention to influence Ms. Currie's recollection \n     of events or her testimony in any manner. The absence of any \n     such intention is further fortified by the undisputed factual \n     record establishing that to the President's knowledge, Ms. \n     Currie was neither an actual nor contemplated witness in the \n     Jones litigation at the time of the conversation. And \n     critically, Ms. Currie testified that, during the \n     conversation, she did not perceive any pressure \n     ``whatsoever'' to agree with any statement made by the \n     President.\n       The President's actions could not as a matter of law \n     support this allegation. To obstruct a proceeding or tamper \n     with a witness, there must be both a known proceeding and a \n     known witness. In the proceeding that the President certainly \n     knew about--the Jones case--Ms. Currie was neither an actual \n     nor prospective witness. As for the only proceeding in which \n     Ms. Currie ultimately became a witness--the OIC \n     investigation--no one asserts the President could have known \n     it existed at that time.\n       At the time of the January 18 conversation.\\109\\ Ms. Currie \n     was not a witness in the Jones case, as even Mr. Starr \n     acknowledged: ``The evidence is not that she was on the \n     witness list, and we have never said that she was.'' \n     Transcript of November 19, 1998 Testimony at 192.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\109\\ Ms. Currie remembers a second conversation similar in \n     substance a few days after the January 18 discussion, but \n     still in advance of the public disclosure of this matter on \n     January 21, 1998. Supp. at 561 (Currie GJ 1/27/98).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Nor was there any reason to suspect Ms. Currie would play \n     any role in the Jones case. The discovery period was, at the \n     time of this conversation, in its final days, and a \n     deposition of Ms. Currie scheduled and completed within that \n     deadline would have been highly unlikely.\n       Just as the President could not have intended to influence \n     the testimony of ``witness'' Betty Currie because she was \n     neither an actual nor a prospective witness, so too is it \n     equally clear that the President never pressured Ms. Currie \n     to alter her recollection. Such lack of real or perceived \n     pressure also fatally undercuts this charge. Despite the \n     prosecutor's best efforts to coax Ms. Currie into saying she \n     was pressured to agree with the President's statements, Ms. \n     Currie adamantly denied any such pressure. As she testified:\n\n       Q: Now, back again to the four statements that you \n     testified the President made to you that were presented as \n     statements, did you feel pressured when he told you those \n     statements?\n       A: None whatsoever.\n       Q: What did you think, or what was going through your mind \n     about what he was doing?\n       A: At the time I felt that he was--I want to use the word \n     shocked or surprised that this was an issue, and he was just \n     talking.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Q: That was your impression, that he wanted you to say--\n     because he would end each of the statements with ``Right?'', \n     with a question.\n       A: I do not remember that he wanted me to say ``Right.'' He \n     would say ``Right'' and I could have said. ``Wrong.''\n       Q: But he would end each of those questions with a \n     ``Right?'' and you could either say whether it was true or \n     not true?\n       A: Correct.\n       Q: Did you feel any pressure to agree with your boss?\n       A: None.\n\n     Supp. at 668 (Currie GJ 7/22/98). Ms. Currie explained that \n     she felt no pressure because she basically agreed with the \n     President's statements:\n\n       Q: You testified with respect to the statements as the \n     President made them, and, in particular, the four statements \n     that we've already discussed. You felt at the time that they \n     were technically accurate? Is that a fair assessment of your \n     testimony?\n       A: That's a fair assessment.\n       Q: But you suggested that at the time. Have you changed \n     your opinion about it in retrospect?\n       A: I have not changed my opinion, no.\n\n     Supp. at 667 (Currie GJ 7/22/98); see also Supp. at 534 \n     (Currie FBI 302 1/24/98) (``Currie advised that she responded \n     ``right'' to each of the statements because as far as she \n     knew, the statements were basically right.''); Supp. at 665 \n     (Currie GJ 7/22/98) (``I said `Right' to him because I \n     thought they were correct, `Right, you were never really \n     alone with Monica, right' '').\n       What, then, to make of this conversation if there was no \n     effort to influence Ms. Currie's testimony? Well, to \n     understand fully the dynamic, one must remove the memory of \n     all that has transpired since January 21 and place oneself in \n     the President's position after the Jones deposition. The \n     President had just faced unexpectedly detailed questions \n     about Ms. Lewinsky. The questions addressed, at times, minute \n     details and at other times contained bizarre inaccuracies \n     about the relationship. As the President candidly admitted in \n     his grand jury testimony, he had long thought the day would \n     come when his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky would become \n     public:\n\n       ``I formed an opinion early in 1996, once I got into this \n     unfortunate and wrong conduct, that when it stopped, which I \n     knew I'd have to do and which I should have done long before \n     I did, that she would talk about it. Not because Monica \n     Lewinsky is a bad person. She's basically a good girl. She's \n     a good young woman with a good heart and a good mind. . . . \n     But I knew that the minute there was no longer any contact, \n     she would talk about this. She would have to. She couldn't \n     help it. It was, it was part of her psyche.''\n\n     App. at 575-76 (emphasis added). Now, with the questioning \n     about Ms. Lewinsky in the Jones case and the publication of \n     the first internet report article about Ms. Lewinsky, the \n     President knew that a media storm was about to erupt. And \n     erupt it did.\n       So it was hardly surprising that the President reached out \n     to Ms. Currie at this time. He was trying to gather all \n     available information and assess the political and personal \n     consequences that this revelation would soon have. Though he \n     did not confide fully in Ms. Currie, he knew Ms. Currie was \n     Ms. Lewinsky's main contact and thus could have additional \n     relevant information to help him assess and respond to the \n     impending media scrutiny. As the President testified:\n\n       ``I do not remember how many times I talked to Betty Currie \n     or when. I don't. I can't possibly remember that. I do \n     remember, when I first heard about this story breaking, \n     trying to ascertain what the facts were, trying to ascertain \n     what Betty's perception was. I remember that I was highly \n     agitated, understandably, I think.''\n\n     App. at 593. And further, ``[W]hat I was trying to determine \n     was whether my recollection was right and that she was always \n     in the office complex when Monica was there. . . . I thought \n     what would happen is that it would break in the press, and I \n     was trying to get the facts down.'' App. at 507-08 (emphasis \n     added). As the President concluded: ``I was not trying to get \n     Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful. I was \n     trying to get as much information as quickly as I could.'' \n     App. at 508.\n       Ms. Currie's grand jury testimony confirms the President's \n     ``agitated'' state of mind and information-gathering purpose \n     for the discussion. She testified that the President \n     appeared, in her words, to be ``shocked or surprised that \n     this was an issue, and he was just talking.'' Supp. at 668 \n     (Currie GJ 7/22/98). She described the President's remarks as \n     ``both statements and questions at the same time.'' Supp. at \n     534 (Currie FBI 302 1/24/98).\n       Finally, the inference that the President intended to \n     influence Ms. Currie's testimony before she ever became a \n     witness is firmly undercut by the advice the President gave \n     to her when she ultimately did become a witness in the OIC \n     investigation:\n\n       ``And then I remember when I knew she was going to have to \n     testify to the grand jury, and I, I felt terrible because she \n     had been through this loss of her sister, this horrible \n     accident Christmas that killed her\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\n     brother, and her mother was in the hospital. I was trying to \n     do--to make her understand that I didn't want her to, to be \n     untruthful to the grand jury. And if her memory was different \n     than mine, it was fine, just go in there and tell them what \n     she thought. So, that's all I remember.''\n\n     App. at 593; see also App. at 508 (``I think Ms. Currie would \n     also testify that I explicitly told her, once I realized you \n     were involved in the Jones case--you, the Office of \n     Independent Counsel--and that she might have to be called as \n     a witness, that she should just go in there and tell the \n     truth, tell what she knew, and be perfectly \n     truthful.'').\\110\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\110\\ Only groundless speculation and unfounded inferences \n     support the Committee Report's mirror allegation of Article I \n     (4) that the President lied to the grand jury when he \n     described his motivation in discussing these matters with Ms. \n     Currie. That allegation should be rejected for the same \n     reasons discussed more fully in the text of this section.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In sum, neither the testimony of Ms. Currie nor that of the \n     President--the only two participants in this conversation--\n     supports the inference that the conversation had an insidious \n     purpose. The undisputed evidence shows that Ms. Currie was \n     neither an actual nor contemplated witness in the Jones case. \n     And when Ms. Currie did ultimately become a witness in the \n     Starr investigation, the President told her to tell the \n     truth, which she did.\n     7. The President denies that he obstructed justice when he \n         relayed allegedly ``false and misleading statements'' to \n         his aides\n       This final allegation of Article II should be rejected out \n     of hand. The President has admitted misleading his family, \n     his staff, and the Nation about his relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, and he has expressed his profound regret for such \n     conduct. But this Article asserts that the President should \n     be impeached and removed from office because he failed to be \n     candid with his friends and aides about the nature of his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. These allegedly impeachable \n     denials took place in the immediate aftermath of the Lewinsky \n     publicity--at the very time the President was denying any \n     improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in nearly identical \n     terms on national television. Having made this announcement \n     to the whole country on television, it is simply absurd to \n     believe that he was somehow attempting corruptly to influence \n     the testimony of aides when he told them virtually the same \n     thing at the same time.\\111\\ Rather, the evidence \n     demonstrates that the President spoke with these individuals \n     regarding the allegations because of the longstanding \n     professional and personal relationships he shared with them \n     and the corresponding responsibility he felt to address their \n     concerns once the allegations were aired. The Managers point \n     to no evidence--for there is none--that the President spoke \n     to these individuals for any other reason, and certainly not \n     that he spoke with them intending to obstruct any \n     proceeding.\\112\\ They simply assert that since he knew there \n     was an investigation, his intent had to be that they relate \n     his remarks to the investigators and grand jurors. House Br. \n     at 80.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\111\\ As the Supreme Court has held, to constitute \n     obstruction of justice such actions must be taken `'with an \n     intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings.'' \n     United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 592, 599 (1995).\n     \\112\\ The Committee Reports's allegation under Article I (4) \n     that the President committed perjury before the grand jury \n     when, in the course of admitting that he misled his close \n     aides, he stated that he endeavored to say to his aides \n     ``things that were true,'' App. at 557-60, without disclosing \n     the full nature of the relationship is simply bizarre.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       However, there is no allegation that the President \n     attempted to influence these aides' testimony about their own \n     personal knowledge or observations. Nor is there any evidence \n     that the President knew any of these aides would ultimately \n     be witnesses in the grand jury when he spoke with them. None \n     was under subpoena at the time the denials took place and \n     none had any independent knowledge of any sexual activity \n     between the President and Ms. Lewinsky. Indeed, the only \n     evidence these witnesses could offer on this score was the \n     hearsay repetition of the same public denials that the \n     members of the grand jury likely heard on their home \n     television sets. Under the strained theory of this article, \n     every person who heard the President's public denial could \n     have been called to the grand jury to create still additional \n     obstructions of justice.\n       To bolster this otherwise unsupportable charge, the \n     Managers point to an excerpt of the President's testimony \n     wherein he acknowledged that, to the extent he shared with \n     anyone any details of the facts of his relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, they could conceivably be called before the grand \n     jury--which for the sake of his friends the President wanted \n     to avoid:\n\n       ``I think I was quite careful what I said after [January \n     21]. I may have said something to all of these people to that \n     effect [denying an improper relationship], but I'll also--\n     whenever anybody asked me any details, I said, look, I don't \n     want you to be a witness or I turn you into a witness or give \n     you information that could get you in trouble. I just \n     wouldn't talk. I, by and large, didn't talk to people about \n     this.''\n\n     App. at 647. The point was not that the President believed \n     these people would be witnesses and so decided to mislead \n     them, but rather that he decided to provide as little \n     information as possible (consistent with his perceived \n     obligation to address their legitimate concerns) in order to \n     keep them from becoming witnesses solely because of what he \n     told them.\n       In conclusion, this Article fails as a matter of law and as \n     a matter of common sense. It should be soundly rejected.\n\n      VI. The Structural Deficiencies of the Articles Preclude a \n                      Constitutionally Sound Vote\n\n       The Constitution prescribes a strict and exacting standard \n     for the removal of a popularly elected President. Because \n     each of the two articles charges multiple unspecified wrongs, \n     each is unconstitutionally flawed in two independent \n     respects.\n       First, by charging multiple wrongs in one article, the \n     House of Representatives has made it impossible for the \n     Senate to comply with the Constitutional mandate that any \n     conviction be by the concurrence of two-thirds of the \n     members. Since Senate Rules require that an entire article be \n     voted as a unit, sixty-seven Senators could conceivably vote \n     to convict while in wide disagreement as to the alleged wrong \n     committed--for example, they could completely disagree on \n     what statement they believe is false--in direct violation of \n     the Constitutional requirements of ``Concurrence'' and due \n     process.\n       Second, by charging perjury without identifying a single \n     allegedly perjurious statement, and charging obstruction of \n     justice without identifying a single allegedly obstructive \n     action by the President, the House of Representatives has \n     failed to inform the Senate either of the statements it \n     agreed were perjurious (if it agreed), or of the actual \n     conduct by the President that it agreed constituted \n     obstruction of justice (again, if it agreed). The result is \n     that the President does not have the most basic notice of the \n     charges against him required by due process and fundamental \n     fairness. He is not in a position to defend against anything \n     other than a moving target. The guesswork involved even in \n     identifying the charges to be addressed in this Trial \n     Memorandum highlights just how flawed the articles are.\\113\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\113\\ The House Managers cannot constitutionally unbundle the \n     charges in the articles or provide the missing specifics. \n     This is because the Constitution provides that only the House \n     of Representatives can amend articles of impeachment, and \n     judicial precedent demonstrates that unduly vague indictments \n     cannot be cured by a prosecutor providing a bill of \n     particulars. Only the charging body--here, the House--can \n     particularize an impermissibly vague charge.\n     Indeed, Senate precedent confirms that the entire House must \n     grant particulars when articles of impeachment are not \n     sufficiently specific for a fair trial. During the 1933 \n     impeachment trial of Judge Harold Louderback, counsel for the \n     Judge filed a motion to make the original Article V, the \n     omnibus or ``catchall'' article, more definite. 77 Cong Rec. \n     1852, 1854 (1933). The House Managers unanimously consented \n     to the motion, which they considered to be akin to a motion \n     for a bill of particulars, and the full House amended Article \n     V to provide the requested specifics. Id. Thereafter, the \n     Clerk of the House informed the Senate that the House had \n     adopted an amendment to Article V. Id. Judge Louderback was \n     then tried on the amended article. Judge Louderback was \n     subsequently acquitted on all five articles. Impeachment of \n     Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States, Report by \n     Staff of the Impeachment Inquiry, House Comm. on the \n     Judiciary, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., Appendix B at 55 (Feb. 1974).\n     The power to define and approve articles of impeachment is \n     vested by the Constitution exclusively in the House of \n     Representatives. U.S. Const. Art I, Sec. 2, cl. 5. It follows \n     that any alteration of an Article of Impeachment can be \n     performed only by the House. The House cannot delegate (and \n     has not delegated) to the Managers the authority to amend or \n     alter the Articles, and Senate precedent demonstrates that \n     only the House (not the Managers unilaterally) can effect an \n     amendment to articles of impeachment.\n     Case law is consistent with this precedent. When indictments \n     are unconstitutionally vague, they cannot be cured by a \n     prosecutor's provision of a bill of particulars, because only \n     the charging body can elaborate upon vague charges. As the \n     Supreme Court noted in Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. \n     749, 771 (1962):\n     ``It is argued that any deficiency in the indictments in \n     these cases could have been cured by bills of particulars. \n     But it is a settled rule that a bill of particular cannot \n     save an invalid indictment . . . To allow the prosecutor, or \n     the court, to make a subsequent guess as to what was in the \n     minds of the grand jury at the time they returned the \n     indictment would deprive the defendant of a basic protection \n     which the guaranty of the intervention of a grand jury was \n     designed to secure. For a defendant could then be convicted \n     on the basis of facts not found by, and perhaps not even \n     presented to, the grand jury which indicted him. This \n     underlying principle is reflected by the settled rule in the \n     federal courts that an indictment may not be amended except \n     by resubmission to the grand jury. . . .''\n     See also Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 214, 216 \n     (1960) quoting Ex Parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1 (1887) (``If it lies \n     within the province of a court to charging part to an \n     indictment to suit its own notions of what it ought to have \n     been or what they grand jury would probably have made it if \n     their attention had been called to suggested changes, the \n     great importance which the common law attaches to an \n     indictment by a grand jury . . . may be frittered away until \n     its value is almost destroyed.'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The result is a pair of articles whose structure does not \n     permit a constitutionally sound vote to convict. If they were \n     counts in an indictment, these articles would not survive a \n     motion to dismiss. Under the unique circumstances of an \n     impeachment trial, they should fail:\n\n\n  A. The Articles Are Both Unfairly Complex and Lacking in Specificity\n\n       A cursory review of the articles demonstrates that they \n     each allege multiple and unspecified acts of wrongdoing.\n     1. The Structure of Article I\n       Article I accuses the President of numerous different \n     wrongful actions. The introductory paragraph charges the \n     President with (i) violating his constitutional oath \n     faithfully to execute his office and defend the\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\n     Constitution; (ii) violating his constitutional duty to take \n     care that the laws be faithfully executed; (iii) willfully \n     corrupting and manipulating the judicial process; and (iv) \n     impeding the administration of justice.\n       The second paragraph charges the President with (a) \n     perjurious, (b) false, and (c) misleading testimony to the \n     grand jury concerning ``one or more'' of four different \n     subject areas:\n       (1) the nature and details of this relationship with a \n     subordinate government employee;\n       (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he \n     gave in a Federal civil rights action brought against him;\n       (3) prior false and misleading statements he allowed his \n     attorney to make to a federal judge in that action;\n       (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of \n     witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in that \n     civil rights action.\n       The third paragraph alleges that, as a consequence of the \n     foregoing, the President has, to the manifest injury of the \n     people of the United States:\n        undermined the integrity of his office;\n        brought disrepute on the Presidency;\n        betrayed his trust as President; and\n        acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law \n     and justice.\n       It is imperative to note that although Article I alleges \n     ``perjurious, false and misleading'' testimony concerning \n     ``one or more'' of four general subject areas, it does not \n     identify the particular sworn statements by the President \n     that were allegedly ``perjurious,'' (and therefore \n     potentially illegal), or ``false'' or ``misleading'' (and \n     therefore not unlawful). In fact, contrary to the most basic \n     rules of fairness and due process, Article I does not \n     identify a single specific statement that is at issue.\n       In sum, Article I appears to charge the President with four \n     general forms of wrongdoing (violations of two oaths, \n     manipulation of legal process, impeding justice), involving \n     three (perjurious, false, misleading) distinct types of \n     statements, concerning different subjects (relationship to \n     Ms. Lewinsky, prior deposition testimony, prior statements of \n     his attorney, obstruction of justice),\\114\\ resulting in four \n     species of harms either to the Presidency (undermining its \n     integrity, bringing it into disrepute) or to the people \n     (acting in a manner subversive of the rule of law and to the \n     manifest injury of the people). And it alleges all of this \n     without identifying a single, specific perjurious, false or \n     misleading statement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\114\\ It appears that each of these topic areas includes \n     various, unspecified allegedly perjurious, false and \n     misleading statements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Absent a clear statement of which statements are alleged to \n     have been perjurious, and which specific acts are alleged to \n     have been undertaken with the purpose of obstructing the \n     administration of justice, it is impossible to prepare a \n     defense. It is a fundamental tenet of our jurisprudence that \n     an accused must be afforded notice of the specific charges \n     against which he must defend. Neither the Referral of the \n     Office of the Independent Counsel, nor the Committee Report \n     of the Judiciary Committee, nor the House Managers' Trial \n     Memorandum was adopted by the House, and none of them can \n     provide the necessary particulars. It is impossible to know \n     whether the different statements and acts charged in the \n     Referral, or the Report, or the Trial Memorandum, or all, or \n     none, are what the House had in mind when it passed the \n     Articles.\n     2. The Structure of Article II\n       Article II accuses the President of a variety of wrongful \n     acts. The introductory paragraph charges the President with \n     (i) violating his constitutional oath faithfully to execute \n     his office and defend the Constitution and (ii) violating his \n     constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully \n     executed by (iii) preventing, obstructing and impeding the \n     administration of justice by engaging (personally and through \n     subordinates and agents) in a scheme designed to delay, \n     impede, cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence and \n     testimony related to a Federal civil rights action.\n       The second paragraph specifies the various ways in which \n     the violations in the first paragraph are said to have \n     occurred. It states that the harm was effectuated by \n     ``means'' that are not expressly defined or delimited, but \n     rather are said to include ``one or more'' of seven ``acts'' \n     attributed to the President:\n       (1) corruptly encouraging a witness to execute a \n     perjurious, false and misleading affidavit;\n       (2) corruptly encouraging a witness to give perjurious, \n     false and misleading testimony if called to testify;\n       (3) corruptly engaging in, encouraging or supporting a \n     scheme to conceal evidence;\n       (4) intensifying and succeeding in an effort to secure job \n     assistance to a witness in order to corruptly prevent the \n     truthful testimony of that witness at a time when that \n     witness's truthful testimony would have been harmful;\n       (5) allowing his attorney to make false and misleading \n     statements to a federal judge in order to prevent relevant \n     questioning;\n       (6) relating a false and misleading account of events to a \n     potential witness in a civil rights action in order to \n     corruptly influence the testimony of that person;\n       (7) making false and misleading statements to potential \n     witnesses in a Federal grand jury proceeding in order to \n     corruptly influence their testimony and causing the grand \n     jury to receive false and misleading information.\n       The third paragraph alleges that, as a result of the \n     foregoing, the President has, to the manifest injury of the \n     people of the United States:\n        undermined the integrity of his office;\n        brought disrepute on the Presidency;\n        betrayed his trust as President; and\n        acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law \n     and justice.\n       As with the first article, Article II does not set forth a \n     single specific act alleged to have been performed by the \n     President. Instead, it alleges general ``encourage[ment]'' to \n     execute a false affidavit, provide misleading testimony, and \n     conceal subpoenaed evidence. This Article also includes \n     general allegations that the President undertook to \n     ``corruptly influence'' and/or ``corruptly prevent'' the \n     testimony of potential witnesses and that he ``engaged in . . \n     . or supported'' a scheme to conceal evidence. Again, the \n     Senate and the President have been left to guess at the \n     charges (if any) actually agreed upon by the House.\n\n\n   b. conviction on these articles would violate the constitutional \nrequirement that two-thirds of the senate reach agreement that specific \n                       wrongdoing has been proven\n\n     1. The Articles Bundle Together Disparate Allegations in \n         Violation of the Constitution's Requirements of \n         Concurrence and Due Process\n       a. The Articles Violate the Constitution's Two-Thirds \n           Concurrence Requirement\n       Article I, section 3 of the Constitution provides that ``no \n     person shall be convicted [on articles of impeachment] \n     without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members \n     present.'' U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 3, cl. 6. The \n     Constitution's requirement is plain. These must be \n     ``Concurrence,'' which is to say genuine, reliably \n     manifested, agreement, among those voting to convict. Both \n     the committing of this task to the Senate and the two-thirds \n     requirement are important constitutional safeguards \n     reflecting the Framers' intent that conviction not come \n     easily. Conviction demands real and objectively verifiable \n     agreement among a substantial supermajority.\n       Indeed, the two-thirds supermajority requirement is a \n     crucial constitutional safeguard. Supermajority provisions \n     are constitutional exceptions \\115\\ to the presumption that \n     decisions by legislative bodies shall be made by majority \n     rule.\\116\\ These exceptions serve exceptional ends. The two-\n     thirds concurrence rule serves the indispensable purpose of \n     protecting the people who chose the President by election. By \n     giving a ``veto'' to a minority of Senators, the Framers \n     sought to ensure the rights of an electoral majority--and to \n     safeguard the people in their choice of Executive. Only the \n     Senate and only the requirement of a two-thirds concurrence \n     could provide that assurance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\115\\ See e.g., U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 7, cl. 2 (two thirds \n     vote required to override Presidential veto); U.S. Const. \n     Art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2 (two thirds required for ratification \n     of treaties); U.S. Const. Art. V (two thirds required to \n     propose constitutional amendments); U.S. Const. Art. I, \n     Sec. 5, cl. 2 (two thirds required to expel members of \n     Congress).\n     \\116\\ Madison referred to majority voting as ``the \n     fundamental principal of free government.'' Federalist No. 58 \n     at 248 (G. Wills ed. 1982).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The ``Concurrence'' required is agreement that the charges \n     stated in specific articles have in fact been proved, and the \n     language of those articles is therefore critical. Since the \n     House of Representatives is vested with the ``sole Power of \n     Impeachment,'' U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 2, cl. 5, the form of \n     those articles cannot be altered by the Senate. And Rule \n     XXIII of the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate \n     when Sitting on Impeachment Trials (``Senate Rules'') \n     provides that ``[a]n article of impeachment shall not be \n     divisible for the purpose of voting thereon at any time \n     during the trial.''\n       It follows that each Senator may vote on an article only in \n     its totality. By the express terms of Article I, a Senator \n     may vote for impeachment if he or she finds that there was \n     perjurious, false and misleading testimony in any ``one or \n     more'' of four topic areas. But that prospect creates the \n     very real possibility that ``conviction'' could occur even \n     though fewer than two-thirds of the Senators actually agree \n     that any particular false statement was made.\\117\\ Put \n     differently, the article's structure presents the possibility \n     that the President could be convicted on Article I even \n     though he would have been acquitted if separate votes were \n     taken on individual allegedly perjurious statements. To \n     illustrate the point, consider that it would be possible for \n     conviction to result even with as few as seventeen Senators \n     agreeing that any single statement was perjurious, because \n     seventeen votes for one statement in each of four categories \n     would yield 68 votes, one more than necessary to convict. The \n     problem is even worse if Senators agree that there is a \n     single perjurious statement but completely disagree as to \n     which statement within the 176 pages of transcript they \n     believe is perjurious. Such an outcome would plainly violate \n     the Constitution's requirement that there be conviction only \n     when a two-thirds majority agrees.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\117\\ There remains the additional problem that the articles \n     allege not specific perjurious statements, but perjury within \n     a topic area. Perjury as to a category (rather than as to \n     specific statements) is an incomprehensible notion.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The very same flaw renders Article II unconstitutional as \n     well. That Article alleges a\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\n     scheme of wrongdoing effected through ``means'' including \n     ``one or more'' of seven factually and logically discrete \n     ``acts.'' That compound structure is fraught with the \n     potential to confuse. For example, the Article alleges both \n     concealment of gifts on December 28, 1997, and false \n     statements to aides in late January 1998. These two \n     allegations involve completely different types of behavior. \n     They are alleged to have occurred in different months. They \n     involved different persons. And they are alleged to have \n     obstructed justice in different legal proceedings. In light \n     of Senate Rule XXIII's prohibition on dividing articles, the \n     combination of such patently different types of alleged \n     wrongdoing in a single article creates the manifest \n     possibility that votes for conviction on this article would \n     not reflect any two-third agreement whatsoever.\n       The extraordinary problem posed by such compound articles \n     is well-recognized and was illustrated by the proceedings in \n     the impeachment of Judge Walter Nixon. Article III of the \n     Nixon proceedings, like the articles here, was phrased in the \n     disjunctive and charged multiple false statements as grounds \n     for impeachment. Judge Nixon moved to dismiss Article III on \n     a number of grounds, including on the basis of its compound \n     structure.\\118\\ Although that motion was defeated in the full \n     Senate by a vote of 34-63,\\119\\ the 34 Senators who voted to \n     dismiss were a sufficient number to block conviction on \n     Article III.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\118\\ See Report of the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee on \n     the Articles of Impeachment Against Judge Walter L. Nixon, \n     Jr., Hearings Before the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee, \n     101st Cong., 1st Sess. at 257, 281-84 (1989).\n     \\119\\ Judge Nixon Proceedings at 430-32.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Judge Nixon (although convicted on the first two articles) \n     was ultimately acquitted on Article III by a vote of 57 \n     (guilty) to 40 (not guilty).\\120\\ Senator Biden, who voted \n     not guilty on the article, stated that the structure of the \n     article made it ``possible . . . for Judge Nixon to be \n     convicted under article III even though two-thirds of the \n     members present did not agree that he made any one of the \n     false statements.'' \\121\\ Senator Murkowski concurred: ``I \n     don't appreciate the omnibus nature of article III, and I \n     agree with the argument that the article could easily be used \n     to convict Judge Nixon by less than the super majority vote \n     required by the Constitution.'' Id. at 464.\\122\\ And Senator \n     Dole stated that ``Article III is redundant, complex and \n     unnecessarily confusing. . . . It alleges that Judge Nixon \n     committed five different offenses in connection with each of \n     fourteen separate events, a total of seventy charges. . . . \n     [I]t was virtually impossible for Judge Nixon and his \n     attorney's to prepare an adequate defense.'' \\123\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\120\\ Id. at 435-36.\n     \\121\\ Statement of Senator Joseph R.

It says that \n     Judge Nixon concealed his conversations through `one or more' \n     of 14 false statements.\n       ``This wording presents a variety of problems. First of \n     all, it means that Judge Nixon can be convicted even if two \n     thirds of the Senate does not agree on which of his \n     particular statements were false. . . .\n       ``The House is telling us that it's OK to convict Judge \n     Nixon on Article III even if we have different visions of \n     what he did wrong. But that's not fair to Judge Nixon, to the \n     Senate, or to the American people. Let's say we do convict on \n     Article III. The American people--to say nothing of history--\n     would never know exactly which of Judge Nixon's statements \n     were regarded as untrue. They'd have to guess. What's more, \n     this ambiguity would prevent us from being totally \n     accountable to the voters for our decision.'' \\124\\\n\n     \\124\\ Statement of Senator Herbert H. Kohl, id. at 449 \n     (emphasis added). Senator Kohl did not believe that the \n     constitutional question concerning two-thirds concurrence had \n     to be answered in the Judge Nixon proceedings because he \n     believed that the bundling problem created an unfairness (in \n     effect, a due process violation) that precluded conviction. \n     Id.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     As noted, the Senate acquitted Judge Nixon on the omnibus \n     article--very possible because of the constitutional and \n     related due process and fairness concerns articulated by \n     Senator Kohl and others.\\125\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\125\\ See also Constitutional Grounds for Presidential \n     Impeachment: Modern Precedents, Report by the Staff of the \n     Impeachment Inquiry, Comm. on Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d \n     Sess. at 12 (1998) (discussing Sen. Kohl's position).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The constitutional problems identified by those Senators \n     are significant when a single federal judge (one of roughly \n     1000) is impeached. But when the Chief Executive and sole \n     head of one entire branch of our government stands accused, \n     those infirmities are momentous. Fairness and the appearance \n     of fairness require that the basis for any action this body \n     might take be clear and specific. The Constitution clearly \n     forbids conviction unless two thirds of the Senate concurs in \n     a judgment. Any such judgment would be meaningless in the \n     absence of a finding that specific, identifiable, wrongful \n     conduct has in fact occurred. No such conclusion is possible \n     under either article as drafted.\n       b. Conviction on the Articles Would Violate Due Process \n           Protections that Forbid Compound Charges in a Single \n           Accusation\n       Even apart from the Constitution's clear requirement of \n     ``Concurrence'' in Article I, section 3, the fundamental \n     principles of fairness and due process that underlie our \n     Constitution and permeate our procedural and substantive law \n     compel the same outcome. In particular, the requirement that \n     there be genuine agreement by the deciding body before an \n     accused is denied life, liberty or property is a cornerstone \n     of our jurisprudence.\\126\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\126\\ Judicial precedent is persuasive here on these due \n     process and fairness questions. Indeed, in prior impeachment \n     trials, the Senate has been guided by decisions of the \n     courts, because they reflect cumulative wisdom concerning \n     fairness and the search for justice. During the impeachment \n     trial of Judge Alcee L. Hastings, Senator Specter stated:\n     ``[T]he impeachment process relies in significant measure on \n     decisions of the court and the opinion of judges . . . [T]he \n     decisions and interpretations of the courts should be highly \n     instructive to us. In our system of Government, it has been \n     the courts that through the years have been called upon to \n     construe, define and apply the provisions of our \n     Constitution. Their decisions reflect our values and our \n     evolving notions of justice . . . Although we are a branch of \n     Government coequal with the judiciary, and by the \n     Constitution vested with the `sole' power to try \n     impeachments, I believe that the words and reasoning of \n     judges who have struggled with the meaning and application of \n     the Constitution and its provisions ought to be given great \n     heed because that jurisprudence embodies the values of \n     fairness and justice that ought to be the polestar of our own \n     determinations.'' (S. Doc. 101-18, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. at \n     740-41.)\n     (As Senator Specter observed, judicial rules have been \n     developed and refined over the years to assure that court \n     proceedings are fair, and that an accused is assured the \n     necessary tools to prepare a proper defense, including proper \n     notice.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       While in the federal criminal context due process requires \n     that there be genuine agreement among the entire jury, see \n     United States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 458, 470 (7th Cir. 1998), \n     Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624 (1991) (plurality), in the \n     impeachment context, that requirement of genuine agreement \n     must be expressed by a two-thirds supermajority. But the \n     underlying due process principles is the same in both \n     settings. This basic principle is bottomed on two fundamental \n     notions: (1) that there be genuine agreement--mutuality of \n     understanding--among those voting to convict, and (2) that \n     the unanimous verdict be understood (by the accused and by \n     the public) to have been the product of genuine agreement.\n       This principle is given shape in the criminal law in the \n     well-recognized prohibition on ``duplicitous'' charges. \n     ``Duplicity is the joining in a single count of two or more \n     distinct and separate offenses.'' United States v. UCO Oil, \n     546 F.2d 833, 835 (9th Cir. 1976.) In the law of criminal \n     pleading, a single count that charges two or more separate \n     offenses is duplicitous. See United States v. Parker, 991 \n     F.2d 1493, 1497-98 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Hawkes, \n     753 F.2d 355, 357 (4th Cir. 1985).\\127\\ A duplicitous charge \n     in an indictment violates the due process principle that \n     ``the requisite specificity of the charge may not be \n     compromised by the joining of separate offenses.'' Schad v. \n     Arizona, 501 U.S. 624, 633 (1991) (plurality).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\127\\ See also Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule \n     8(a): ``Two or more offenses may be charged in the same \n     indictment or information in a separate count for each \n     offense if the offenses charged . . . are of the same or \n     similar charter or are based on the same act or transaction \n     or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or \n     constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.'' (emphasis \n     added).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       More specifically, a duplicitous charge poses the acute \n     danger of conviction by a less-than-unanimous jury; some \n     jurors may find the defendant guilty of one charge but not \n     guilty of a second, while other jurors find him guilty of a \n     second charge but not the first. See United States v. Saleh, \n     875 F.2d 535, 537 (6th Cir. 1989); United States v. Stanley, \n     597 F.2d 866, 871 (4th Cir. 1979); Bins v. United States, 331 \n     F.2d 390, 393 (5th Cir. 1964).\\128\\ Our federal system of \n     justice simply does not permit conviction by less than \n     unanimous agreement concerning a single, identified charge. \n     See United States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 471 (7th Cir. 1998) \n     (conviction requires unanimous agreement as to particular \n     statements); United States v. Holley, 942 F.2d 916, 929 (5th \n     Cir. 1991) (reversal required where no instruction was given \n     to ensure that all jurors concur in conclusion that at least \n     one particular statement was false); see also United States \n     v. Gipson, 553 F.2d 453, 458-59 (5th Cir. 1977) (right to \n     unanimous verdict violated by instruction authorizing \n     conviction if jury found defendant committed any one of six \n     acts proscribed by statute).\\129\\ The protection against \n     conviction by less than full agreement by the factfinders is \n     enshrined in Rule 31(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal \n     Procedure which dictates that ``[t]he verdict shall be \n     unanimous.'' \\130\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\128\\ Each of the four categories charged here actually \n     comprises multiple allegedly perjurious statements. Thus, the \n     dangers of duplicitousness are increased exponentially.\n     \\129\\ The Supreme Court has stated that ``[u]nanimity in jury \n     verdicts is required where the Sixth and Seventh Amendments \n     apply.'' Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740, 748 (1948); \n     Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972) (same).\n     \\130\\ That rule gives expression to a criminal defendant's \n     due process right to a unanimous verdict. See United States \n     v. Fawley, 137 F.2d 458, 4771 (7th Cir. 1988). Because the \n     Constitution does not tolerate the risk of a less than \n     unanimous verdict in the criminal setting, ``where the \n     complexity of a case or other factors create the potential \n     for confusion as to the \n\n[[Page S212]]\n\n     legal theory or factual basis which sustains a defendant's \n     conviction, a specific unanimity instruction is required.'' \n     United States v. Jackson, 879 F.2d 85, 88 (3d Cir. 1989) \n     (citing United States v. Beros, 833 F.2d 455, 460 (3d Cir. \n     1987)). Such instructions are required where the government \n     charges several criminal acts, any of which alone could have \n     supported the offense charged, because of the need to provide \n     sufficient guidance to assure that all members of the jury \n     were unanimous on the same act or acts of illegality. Id. at \n     88. As the Seventh Circuit recently concluded in a case \n     alleging multiple false statements, ``the jury should have \n     been advised that in order to have convicted [the defendant], \n     they had to unanimously agree that a particular statement \n     contained in the indictment was falsely made.'' Fawley, 137 \n     F.2d at 470.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Thus, where the charging instrument alleges multiple types \n     of wrongdoing, the unanimity requirement ``means more than a \n     conclusory agreement that the defendant has violated the \n     statute in question; there is a requirement of substantial \n     agreement as to the principal factual elements underlying a \n     specified offense.'' United States v. Ferris, 719 F.2d 1405, \n     1407 (9th Cir. 1983) (emphasis added). Accordingly, although \n     there need not be unanimity as to every bit of underlying \n     evidence, due process ``does require unanimous agreement as \n     to the nature of the defendant's violation, not simply that a \n     violation has occurred.'' McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. \n     433, 449 n.5 (1990) (Blackmun, J., concurring). Such \n     agreement is necessary to fulfill the demands of fairness and \n     rationality that inform the requirement of due process. See \n     Schad, 501 U.S. at 637.\\131\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\131\\ In our federal criminal process, a duplicitous pleading \n     problem may sometimes be cured by instructions to the jury \n     requiring unanimous agreement on a single statement, see \n     Fawley, supra, but that option is not present here. Not only \n     do the Senate Rules not provide for the equivalent of jury \n     instructions, they expressly rule out the prospect of \n     subdividing an article of impeachment for purposes of voting. \n     See Senate Impeachment Rule XXIII. Nor is the duplicitousness \n     problem presented here cured by any specific enumeration of \n     elements necessary to be found by the factfinder. See, e.g., \n     Santarpio v. United States, 560 F.2d 448 (1st Cir. 1977) \n     (duplicitous charge harmless because indictments adequately \n     set out the elements of the federal crime; appellants were \n     not misled or prejudiced). Article I does not enumerate \n     specific elements to be found by the factfinder. To the \n     contrary, the Article combines multiple types of wrong, \n     allegedly performed by different types of statements, the \n     different types occurring in multiple subject matter areas, \n     and all having a range of allegedly harmful effects.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Where multiple accusations are combined in a single charge, \n     neither the accused nor the factfinder can know precisely \n     what that charge means. When the factfinder body cannot agree \n     upon the meaning of the charge, it cannot reach genuine \n     agreement that conviction is warranted. These structural \n     deficiencies preclude a constitutionally sound vote on the \n     articles.\n\n\n C. Conviction on These Articles Would Violate Due Process Protections \n             Prohibiting Vague and Nonspecific Accusations\n\n     1. The Law of Due Process Forbids Vague and Nonspecific \n         Charges\n       Impermissibly vague indictments must be dismissed, because \n     they ``fail[] to sufficiently apprise the defendant `of what \n     he must be prepared to meet.' '' United States v. Russell, \n     369 U.S. 749, 764 (1962) (internal quotation omitted). In \n     Russell, the indictment at issue failed to specify the \n     subject matter about which the defendant had allegedly \n     refused to answer questions before a Congressional \n     subcommittee. Instead, the indictment stated only that the \n     questions to which the answers were refused ``were pertinent \n     to the question then under inquiry'' by the Subcommittee. Id. \n     at 752. The Court held that because the indictment did not \n     provide sufficient specificity, it was unduly vague and \n     therefore had to be dismissed. Id. at 773. The Supreme Court \n     explained that dismissal is the only appropriate remedy for \n     an unduly vague indictment, because only the charging body \n     can elaborate upon vague charges:\n\n       ``To allow the prosecutor, or the court, to make a \n     subsequent guess as to what was in the minds of the grand \n     jury at the time they returned the indictment would deprive \n     the defendant of a basic protection which the guaranty of the \n     intervention of a grand jury was designed to secure. For a \n     defendant could then be convicted on the basis of facts not \n     found by, and perhaps not even presented to, the grant jury \n     which indicted him. This underlying principle is reflected by \n     the settled rule in the federal courts that an indictment may \n     not be amended except by resubmission to the grand jury . . \n     .''\n\n     Id. at 771. See also Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, \n     216 (1960); see also United States v. Lattimore, 215 F.2d 847 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1954) (perjury count too vague to be valid cannot \n     be cured even by bill of particulars); United States v. \n     Tonelli, 557 F.2d 194, 200 (3d Cir. 1978) (vacating perjury \n     conviction where ``the indictment . . . did not `set forth \n     the precise falsehood[s] alleged' '').\n       Under the relevant case law, the two exhibited Articles \n     present paradigmatic examples of charges drafted too vaguely \n     to enable the accused to meet the accusations fairly. More \n     than a century ago, the Supreme Court stated that ``[i]t is \n     an elementary principle of criminal pleading, that where the \n     definition of an offence, whether it be at common law or by \n     statute, includes generic terms, it is not sufficient that \n     the indictment shall charge the offence in the same generic \n     terms as in the definition; but it must state the species--it \n     must descend to particulars.'' United States v. Cruikshank, \n     92 U.S. 542, 558 (1875). The Court has more recently \n     emphasized the fundamental ``vice'' of nonspecific \n     indictments: that they ``fail[] to sufficiently apprise the \n     defendant `of what he must be prepared to meet.' '' Russell, \n     369 U.S. at 764.\n       The Supreme Court emphasized in Russell that specificity is \n     important not only for the defendant, who needs particulars \n     to prepare a defense, but also for the decision-maker, ``so \n     it may decide whether [the facts] are sufficient in law to \n     support a conviction, if one should be had.'' Id. at 768 \n     (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). An \n     unspecific indictment creates a ``moving target'' for the \n     defendant exposing the defendant to a risk of surprise \n     through a change in the prosecutor's theory. ``It enables his \n     conviction to rest on one point and the affirmance of the \n     conviction to rest on another. It gives the prosecution free \n     hand on appeal to fill in the gaps of proof by surmise and \n     conjecture.'' Russell, 369 U.S. at 766. Ultimately, an \n     unspecific indictment creates a risk that ``a defendant could \n     . . . be convicted on the basis of facts not found by, and \n     perhaps not even presented to, the grand jury which indicted \n     him.'' Id. at 770.\n     2. The Allegations of Both Articles Are Unconstitutionally \n         Vague\n       Article I alleges that in his August 17, 1998 grand jury \n     testimony, President Clinton provided ``perjurious, false and \n     misleading'' testimony to the grand jury concerning ``one or \n     more'' of four subject areas. Article I does not, however, \n     set forth a single specific statement by the President upon \n     which its various allegations are predicated. The Article \n     haphazardly intermingles alleged criminal conduct with \n     totally lawful conduct, and its abstract generalizations \n     provide no guidance as to actual alleged perjurious \n     statements.\n       Aritcle I thus violates the most fundamental requirement of \n     perjury indictments. It is fatally vague in three distinct \n     respects: (1) it does not identify any statements that form \n     the basis of its allegations,\\132\\ (2) it therefore does not \n     specify which of the President's statements to the grand jury \n     were allegedly ``perjurious,'' which were allegedly \n     ``false,'' and which were allegedly ``misleading,'' and (3) \n     it does not even specify the subject matter of any alleged \n     perjurious statement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\132\\ One of the cardinal rules of perjury cases is that \n     ``[a] conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623 may not stand \n     where the indictment fails to set forth the precise falsehood \n     alleged and the factual basis of its falsity with sufficient \n     clarity to permit a jury to determine its verity and to allow \n     meaningful judicial review of the materiality of those \n     falsehoods.'' United States v. Slawik, 548 F.2d 75, 83-84 (3d \n     Cir. 1977). Courts have vacated convictions for perjury in \n     instances where ``the indictment . . . did not `set forth the \n     precise falsehood(s) alleged.'' Tonelli, 577 F.2d at 200.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The first defect is fatal, because it is axiomatic that if \n     the precise perjurious statements are not identified in the \n     indictment, a defendant cannot possibly prepare his defense \n     properly. See, e.g., Slawik, 548 F.2d 75, 83-84 (3d Cir. \n     1977). Indeed, in past impeachment trails in the Senate where \n     articles of impeachment alleged the making of false \n     statements, the false statements were specified in the \n     Articles. For example, in the impeachment trial of Alcee L. \n     Hastings, Articles of Impeachment II-XIV specified the exact \n     statements that formed the bases of the false statement \n     allegations against Judge Hastings.\\133\\ Similarly, in the \n     impeachment trial of Walter L. Nixon, Jr., Articles of \n     Impeachment I-III specified the exact statements that formed \n     the bases of their false statement allegations.\\134\\ In this \n     case, Article I falls far short of specificity standards \n     provided in previous impeachment trials in the Senate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\133\\ Proceedings of the United States Senate in the \n     Impeachment Trial Alcee L.

See, e.g., Id., at \n     432 (Article I alleging that the false statement was \n     ``Forrest County District Attorney Paul Holmes never \n     discussed the Drew Fairchild case with Judge Nixon.'').\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       As to the second vagueness defect, there is a significant \n     legal difference between, on the one hand, statements under \n     oath which are ``perjurious,'' and those, on the other hand, \n     which are simply ``false'' or misleading.'' Only the former \n     could form the basis of a criminal charge. The Supreme Court \n     has emphatically held that ``misleading'' statements alone \n     cannot form the basis of a prejury charge. In Bronston v. \n     United States, 409 U.S. 352 (1973), the Court held that \n     literally true statements are by definition non-perjurious, \n     and ``it is no answer to say that here the jury found that \n     [the defendant] intended to mislead his examiner,'' since \n     ``[a] jury should not be permitted to enage in conjecture \n     whether an unresponsive answer. . . was intended to mislead \n     or divert the examiner.'' Id. at 358-60 (emphasis added). The \n     Court emphasized that ``the perjury statute is not to be \n     loosely construed, nor the statue invoked simply because a \n     wily witness succeeds in derailing the questioner so long as \n     the witness speakes the literal truth.'' Id. Thus, \n     specification of the exact statements alleged to be \n     prejurious is required, because ``to hold otherwise would \n     permit the trial jury to inject its inferences into the grand \n     jury's indictment, and would allow defendants to be convicted \n     for immaterial falsehoods or for `intent to mislead' or \n     `perjury by implication,' which Bronston specifically \n     prohibited.'' Slawik, 538 F.2d at 83-84 (emphasis added). \n     Thus, if the House meant that certain statements were \n     misleading but literally truthful, they might be subject to a\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\n     motion to dismiss on the ground that the offense was not \n     impeachable.\n       The same is true for allegedly ``false'' answers, because \n     it is clear that mere ``false'' answers given under oath, \n     without more, are not criminal. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623, the \n     statute proscribing perjury before a federal grand jury, \n     requires additional elements beyond falsity, including the \n     defendant's specific intent to testify falsely and the \n     statement's materiality to the proceeding. A defense to a \n     perjury charge is therefore tied directly to the specific \n     statement alleged to have been perjurious. Did the defendant \n     know the particular answer was false? Was it material? \\135\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\135\\ Not surprisingly, courts have specifically held that \n     because of these additional elements (the lack of which may \n     undermine a perjury prosecution), a defendant must know \n     exactly which statements are alleged to form the basis of a \n     perjury indictment to test whether the requisite elements are \n     present. See, e.g., United States v. Lattimore, 215 F.2d 847, \n     850 (D.C. Cir. 1954) (``The accused is entitled under the \n     Constitution to be advised as to every element in respect to \n     which it is necessary for him to prepare a defense''). For \n     example, because of the intent requirement, one potential \n     defense to a perjury prosecution is that the question to \n     which the allegedly perjurious statement was addressed was \n     fundamentally ambiguous, as courts have held that \n     fundamentally ambiguous questions cannot as a matter of law \n     produce perjurious answers. See, e.g., Tonelli, 577 F.2d at \n     199; United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398 (6th Cir. 1967). A \n     separate defense to a perjury prosecution is that the \n     statement alleged to have been perjurious was not material to \n     the proceeding. Thus, ``false'' statements alone are not \n     perjurious if they were not material to the proceeding. By \n     not specifying which statements are alleged to be ``false'' \n     or ``misleading,'' Article I precludes the President from \n     preparing a materiality defense, and it also fails to \n     distinguish allegedly criminal conduct from purely lawful \n     conduct. As one court explained,\n     ``It is to be observed that * * * it is not sufficient to \n     constitute the offense that the oath shall be merely false, \n     but that it must be false in some `material matter.' Applying \n     that definition to the facts stated in either count of this \n     indictment, and it would seem that there is an entire lack in \n     any essential sense to disclose that the particulars as to \n     which the oath is alleged to have been false were material in \n     the essential sense required for purposes of an indictment \n     for this offense.'' (United States v. Cameron, 282 F. 684, \n     692 (D. Ariz. 1922).).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Article I's third vagueness defect is that it does not \n     specify the subject matter of the alleged perjurious \n     statements. Instead, it simply alleges that the unspecified \n     statements by the President to the grand jury were concerning \n     ``one or more'' of four enumerated areas. The ``one or more'' \n     language underscores the reality that the President--and, \n     critically, the Senate--cannot possibly know what the House \n     majority had in mind, since it may have failed even to agree \n     on the subject matter of the alleged perjury. The paramount \n     importance of this issue may be seen by reference to court \n     decisions holding that a jury has to ``unanimously agree that \n     a particular statement contained in the indictment was \n     falsely made.'' United States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 458, 471 \n     (7th Cir. 1998) (emphasis added); see also discussion of \n     unanimity requirement in Section VI.B, supra.\n       Article II is also unconstitutionally vague. It alleges \n     that the President ``obstructed and impeded the \n     administration of justice * * * in a course of conduct or \n     scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up and conceal'' \n     unspecified evidence and testimony in the Jones case. It sets \n     forth seven instances in which the President allegedly \n     ``encouraged'' false testimony or the concealment of \n     evidence, or ``corruptly influenced'' or ``corruptly \n     prevented'' various other testimony, also unspecified. In \n     fact, not only does Article II fail to identify a single \n     specific act performed by the President in this alleged \n     scheme to obstruct justice, it does not even identify the \n     ``potential witnesses'' whose testimony the President \n     allegedly sought to ``corruptly influence.''\n       The President cannot properly defend against Article II \n     without knowing, at a minimum, which specific acts of \n     obstruction and/or concealment he is alleged to have \n     performed, and which ``potential witnesses'' he is alleged to \n     have attempted to influence. For example, it is clear that, \n     in order to violate the federal omnibus obstruction of \n     justice statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503, an accuser must prove \n     that there was a pending judicial proceeding, that the \n     defendant knew of the proceeding, and that the defendant \n     acted ``corruptly'' with the specific intent to obstruct or \n     interfere with the proceeding or due administration of \n     justice. See, e.g., United States v. Bucey, 876 F.2d 1297, \n     1314 (7th Cir. 1989); United States v. Smith, 729 F. Supp. \n     1380, 1383-84 (D.D.C. 1990). Without knowing which \n     ``potential witnesses'' he is alleged to have attempted to \n     influence, and the precise manner in which he is alleged to \n     have attempted to obstruct justice, the President cannot \n     prepare a defense that would address the elements of the \n     offense with which he has been charged--that he had no intent \n     to obstruct, that there was no pending proceeding, or that \n     the person involved was not a potential witness.\n       It follows that the requisite vote of two-thirds of the \n     Senate required by the Constitution cannot possibly be \n     obtained if there are no specific statements whatsoever \n     alleged to be perjurious, false or misleading in Article I or \n     no specific acts of obstruction alleged in Article II. \n     Different Senators might decide that different statements or \n     different acts were unlawful without any concurrence by two-\n     thirds of the Senate as to any particular statement or act. \n     Such a scenario is antithetical to the Constitution's due \n     process guarantee of notice of specific and definite charges \n     and it threatens conviction upon vague and uncertain grounds. \n     As currently framed, neither Article I nor Article II \n     provides a sufficient basis for the President to prepare a \n     defense to the unspecified charges upon which the Senate may \n     vote, or an adequate basis for actual adjudication.\n\n\n  D. The Senate's Judgment Will Be Final and That Judgment Must Speak \n                        Clearly and Intelligibly\n\n       An American impeachment trial is not a parliamentary \n     inquiry into fitness for office. It is not a vote of no \n     confidence. It is not a mechanism whereby a legislative \n     majority may oust a President from a rival party on political \n     grounds. To the contrary, because the President has a limited \n     term of office and can be turned out in the course of \n     ordinary electoral processes, a Presidential impeachment \n     trial is a constitutional measure of last resort designed to \n     protect the Republic.\n       This Senate is therefore vested with an extremely grave \n     Constitutional task: a decision whether to remove the \n     President for the protection of the people themselves. In the \n     Senate's hands there rests not only the fate of one man, but \n     the integrity of our Constitution and our democratic process.\n       Fidelity to the Constitution and fidelity to the electorate \n     must converge in the impeachment trial vote. If the Senate is \n     to give meaning to the Constitution's command, any vote on \n     removal must be a vote on one or more specifically and \n     separately identified ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' as \n     set forth in properly drafted impeachment articles approved \n     by the House. If the people are to have their twice-elected \n     President removed by an act of the Senate, that act must be \n     intelligible. It must be explainable and justifiable to the \n     people who first chose the President and then chose him \n     again. The Senate must ensure that it has satisfied the \n     Constitution's requirement of a genuine two-thirds \n     concurrence that specific, identified wrongdoing has been \n     proven. The Senate must also assure the people, through the \n     sole collective act the Senate is required to take, that its \n     decision has a readily discernible and unequivocal meaning.\n       As matters stand, the Senate will vote on two highly \n     complex Articles of Impeachment. Its vote will not be shaped \n     by narrowing instructions. Its rules preclude a vote on \n     divisible parts of the articles. There will be no judicial \n     review, no correction of error, and no possibility of \n     retrial. The Senate's decision will be as conclusive as any \n     known to our law--judicially, politically, historically, and \n     most literally, irrevocable.\n       Under such circumstances, the Senate's judgment must speak \n     clearly and intelligibly. That cannot happen if the Senate \n     votes for conviction on these articles. Their compound \n     structure and lack of specificity make genuine agreement as \n     to specific wrongs impossible, and those factors completely \n     prevent the electorate from understanding why the Senate as a \n     whole voted as it did. As formulated, these articles satisfy \n     neither the plain requirement of the Constitution nor the \n     rightful expectations of the American people. The articles \n     cannot support a constitutionally sound vote for conviction.\n\n                      VII. The Need for Discovery\n\n       The Senate need not address the issue of discovery at this \n     time, but because the issue may arise at a later date, it is \n     appropriate to remark here on its present status. Senate \n     Resolution 16 provides that the record for purposes of the \n     presentation by the House Managers and the President is the \n     public record established in the House of \n     Representatives.\\136\\ Since this record was created by the \n     House itself and is ostensibly the basis for the House's \n     impeachment vote, and because this evidence has been publicly \n     identified and available for scrutiny, comment, and rebuttal, \n     it is both logical and fair that this be the basis for any \n     action by the Senate. Moreover, Senate Resolution 16 \n     explicitly prohibits the President and the House Managers \n     from filing at this time any ``motions to subpoena witnesses \n     or to present any evidence not in the record.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\136\\ S. Res. 16 defined the record for the presentations as \n     ``those publicly available materials that have been submitted \n     to or produced by the House Judiciary Committee, including \n     transcripts of public hearings or mark-ups and any materials \n     printed by the House of Representatives or House Judiciary \n     Committee pursuant to House Resolutions 525 and 581.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In the event, however, that the Senate should later decide, \n     pursuant to the provisions of Senate Resolution 16, to allow \n     the House Managers to expand the record in some way, our \n     position should be absolutely clear. At such time, the \n     President would have an urgent need for the discovery of \n     relevant evidence, because at no point in these proceedings \n     has he been able to subpoena documents or summon and cross-\n     examine witnesses. He would need to use the compulsory \n     process authorized by Senate Impeachment Rules V and VI\\137\\ \n     to obtain documentary evidence and witness depositions. While \n     the President has access to some of the grand jury \n     transcripts and FBI interview memoranda of witnesses called \n     by the OIC, the President's own lawyers were not entitled to \n     be present when these witnesses were examined. The grand jury \n     has historically been the engine of the prosecution, and it \n     was used in that fashion in this case. The OIC sought \n     discovery of evidence with the single goal of documenting \n     facts that it believed were prejudicial to the President. It \n     did not examine witnesses with a view toward establishing \n     there was no justification for impeachment; it did not follow \n     up obvious leads when they might result in evidence helpful \n     to the President; and it did not seek out and document \n     exculpatory evidence. It did not undertake to disclose \n     exculpatory information it might have identified.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\137\\ Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When \n     Sitting on Impeachment Trials (Senate Manual 99-2, as revised \n     by S. Res. 479 (Aug. 16, 1986)). There is ample precedent for \n     liberal discovery in Senate impeachment trials. For example, \n     in the trial of Judge Alcee Hastings, the Senate issued \n     numerous orders addressing a range of pretrial issues over \n     several months including:\n      requiring the parties to provide witness lists along \n     with a description of the general nature of the testimony \n     that was expected from each witness months in advance of the \n     scheduled evidentiary hearing;\n      requiring the House Managers to turn over \n     exculpatory materials, certain prior statements of witnesses, \n     and documents and other tangible evidence they intended to \n     introduce into evidence;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page S214]]\n\n      requiring the production from the House Managers of \n     other documents in the interest of allowing the Senate to \n     develop ``a record that fully illuminates the matters that it \n     must consider in rendering a judgment;''\n      setting a briefing schedule for stipulations of \n     facts and documents;\n      setting a number of pretrial conferences;\n      designating a date for final pretrial statements; \n     and\n      permitting a number of pre-trial depositions.\n      Report of the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee on \n     the Articles of Impeachment Against Judge Alcee L. Hastings, \n     Hearings Before the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee, 101st \n     Cong. 1st Sess. at 281, 286-87, 342-43, 606-07, 740.\n     The need for discovery in this case is in fact greater than \n     in prior impeachment proceedings. In all other impeachment \n     trials, there were either substantive investigations by the \n     House or prior judicial proceedings in which the accused had \n     a full opportunity to develop the evidentiary record and \n     cross-examine witnesses. See Id. at 163-64 (pretrial \n     memorandum of Judge Hastings).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Nor did the House of Representatives afford the President \n     any discovery mechanisms to secure evidence that might be \n     helpful in his defense. Indeed, the House called no fact \n     witnesses at all, and at the few depositions it conducted, \n     counsel for the President were excluded. Moreover, the House \n     made available only a selected portion of the evidence it \n     received from the OIC. While it published five volumes of the \n     OIC materials (two volumes of appendices and three volumes of \n     supplements), it withheld a great amount of evidence, and it \n     denied counsel for the President access to this material. It \n     is unclear what the criterion was for selecting evidence to \n     include in the published volumes, but there does not appear \n     to have been an attempt to include all evidence that may have \n     been relevant to the President's defense. The President has \n     not had access to a great deal of evidence in the possession \n     of (for example) the House of Representatives and the OIC \n     which may be exculpatory or relevant to the credibility of \n     witnesses on whom the OIC and the House Managers rely.\n       Should the Senate decide to authorize the House Managers to \n     call witnesses or expand the record, the President would be \n     faced with a critical need for the discovery of evidence \n     useful to his defense--evidence which would routinely be \n     available to any civil litigant involved in a garden-variety \n     automobile accident case. The House Managers have had in \n     their possession or had access at the OIC to significant \n     amounts of non-public evidence, and they have frequently \n     stated their intention to make use of such evidence. \n     Obviously, in order to defend against such tactics, counsel \n     for the President are entitled to discovery and a fair \n     opportunity to test the veracity and reliability of this \n     ``evidence,'' using compulsory process as necessary to obtain \n     testimony and documents. Trial by surprise obviously has no \n     place in the Senate of the United States where the issues in \n     the balance is the removal of the one political leader who, \n     with the Vice-President, is elected by all the citizens of \n     this country.\\138\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\138\\ In another context, the Supreme Court has observed that \n     ``the ends of justice will best be served by a system of \n     liberal discovery which gives both parties the maximum \n     possible amount of information from which to prepare their \n     cases and thereby reduces the possibility of surprise at \n     trial.'' Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 473 (1973).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The need for discovery does not turn on the number of \n     witnesses the House Managers may be authorized to \n     depose.\\139\\ If the House Managers call a single witness, \n     that will initiate a process that leaves the President \n     potentially unprepared and unable to defend adequately \n     without proper discovery. The sequence of discovery is \n     critical. The President first needs to obtain and review \n     relevant documentary evidence not now in his possession. He \n     then needs to be able to depose potentially helpful \n     witnesses, whose identity may only emerge from the documents \n     and from the depositions themselves. Obviously, he also needs \n     to depose potential witnesses identified by the House \n     Managers. Only at that point will the President be able \n     intelligently to designate his own trial witnesses. This is \n     both a logical procedure and one which is the product of long \n     experience designed to maximize the search for truth and \n     minimize unfair surprise. There is no conceivable reason it \n     should not be followed here--if the evidentiary record is \n     opened.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\139\\ It is not sufficient that counsel for the President \n     have the right to depose the witnesses called by the \n     Managers, essential as that right is. The testimony of a \n     single witness may have to be refuted indirectly, \n     circumstantially, or by a number of witnesses; it is often \n     necessary to depose several witnesses in order to identify \n     the one or two best.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Indeed, it is simply impossible to ascertain how a witness \n     designated by the House Managers could fairly be rebutted \n     without a full examination of the available evidence. It is \n     also the case that many sorts of helpful evidence and \n     testimony emerge in the discovery process that may at first \n     blush appear irrelevant or tangential. In any event, the \n     normal adversarial process is the best guarantor of the \n     truth. The President needs discovery here not simply to \n     obtain evidence to present a trial but also in order to make \n     an informed judgment about what to introduce in response to \n     the Managers' expanded case. The President's counsel must be \n     able to make a properly knowledgeable decision about what \n     evidence may be relevant and helpful to the President's \n     defense, both in cross-examination and during the President's \n     own case.\n       The consequences of an impeachment trial are immeasurably \n     grave: The removal of a twice-elected President. Particularly \n     given what is at stake, fundamental fairness dictates that \n     the President be given at least the same right as an ordinary \n     litigant to obtain evidence necessary for his defense, \n     particularly when a great deal of that evidence is presently \n     in the hands of his accusers, the OIC and the House Managers. \n     The Senate has wisely elected to proceed on the public record \n     established by the House of Representatives, and this \n     provides a wholly adequate basis for Senate decision-making. \n     In the event the Senate should choose to expand this record, \n     affording the President adequate discovery is absolutely \n     essential.\n\n                            VIII. Conclusion\n\n       As the Senate considers these Articles of Impeachment and \n     listens to the arguments, individual Senators are standing in \n     the place of the Framers of the Constitution, who prayed that \n     the power of impeachment and removal of a President would be \n     invoked only in the gravest of circumstances, when the \n     stability of our system of government hung in the balance--to \n     protect the Republic itself from efforts to subvert our \n     Constitutional system.\n       The Senate has an obligation to turn away an unwise and \n     unwarranted misuse of the awesome power of impeachment. If \n     the Senate removes this President for a wrongful relationship \n     he hoped to keep private, for what will the House ask the \n     Senate to remove the next President, and the next? Our \n     Framers wisely gave us a constitutional system of checks and \n     balances, with three co-equal branches. Removing this \n     President on these facts would substantially alter the \n     delicate constitutional balance, and move us closer to a \n     quasi-parliamentary system, in which the President is elected \n     to office by the choice of people, but continues in office \n     only at the pleasure of Congress.\n       In weighing the evidence and assessing the facts, we ask \n     that Senators consider not only the intent of the Framers but \n     also the will and interests of the people. It is the citizens \n     of these United States who will be affected by and stand in \n     judgment of this process. It is not simply the President--but \n     the vote the American people rendered in schools, church \n     halls and other civic centers all across the land twenty-six \n     months ago--that is hanging in the balance.\n       Respectfully submitted.\n\nDavid E.

Introduction\n\n       The President's Trial Memorandum contains numerous factual \n     inaccuracies and misstatements of the governing law and the \n     Senate's precedents. These errors have largely been addressed \n     in the Trial Memorandum of the House of Representatives filed \n     with the Senate on January 11, 1999, and given the 24-hour \n     period to file this reply, the House cannot possibly address \n     them all here. The House of Representatives will address them \n     further in its oral presentation to the Senate, and it \n     reserves the right to address these matters further in the \n     briefing of any relevant motions. However, President Clinton \n     has raised some new issues in his Trial Memorandum, and the \n     House of Representatives hereby replies to those issues.\n\n                               II. Facts\n\n       The President's Trial Memorandum outlines what he claims \n     are facts showing that he did not commit perjury before the \n     grand jury and did not obstruct justice. The factual issues \n     President Clinton raises are addressed in detail in the Trial \n     Memorandum of the House.\n       A complete and impartial review of the evidence reveals \n     that the President did in fact commit perjury before the \n     grand jury and that he obstructed justice during the Jones \n     litigation and the grand jury investigation as alleged in the \n     articles of impeachment passed by the House of \n     Representatives. The House believes a review of the complete \n     record, including the full grand jury and deposition \n     testimony of the key witnesses in this case, will establish \n     that.\n       The evidence which President Clinton claims demonstrates \n     that he did not commit the offenses outlined in the Articles \n     of Impeachment are cited in Sections IV and V of his \n     Memorandum. Regarding Article I, President Clinton maintains \n     that his testimony before the grand jury was entirely \n     truthful. At the outset of his argument, he states that he \n     told the truth about the nature and details of his \n     relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and he insists that any false \n     impressions that his deposition testimony might have created \n     were remedied by his admission of ``improper intimate \n     contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky. However, his subsequent \n     testimony demonstrates that this admission is narrowly \n     tailored to mean that Ms. Lewinsky had ``sexual relations'' \n     with him, but he did not have ``sexual relations'' with her, \n     as he understood the term to be defined. In other words, he \n     admitted only what he knew could be conclusively established \n     through scientific tests. He denied what the testimony of Ms. \n     Lewinsky, the testimony of a number of her confidantes, and \n     common sense proves: that while she engaged in sexual \n     relations with him, he engaged in sexual relations with her, \n     regardless of how President Clinton attempts to redefine the \n     term.\n       Following this pattern, President Clinton discounts \n     substantial evidence as well as common sense when he \n     maintains that he testified truthfully in the grand jury \n     about, among other things, his prior deposition testimony, \n     his attorney's statements to Judge Wright during his \n     deposition, and his intent in providing a series of false \n     statements to his secretary after his deposition. Again, a \n     complete review of the record and witness testimony reveals \n     that President Clinton committed perjury numerous times in \n     his grand jury testimony.\n       In regard to Article II, President Clinton extracts \n     numerous items of evidence from the record and analyzes them \n     in isolation in an effort to provide innocent explanations \n     for the substantial amount of circumstantial evidence proving \n     his guilt. Yet when the record is viewed in its entirely, \n     including the portions of President Clinton's deposition \n     testimony concerning Ms. Lewinsky and his grant jury \n     testimony, it demonstrates that President Clinton took a \n     number of actions designed to prevent Paula Jones's \n     attorneys, the federal district court, and a federal grand \n     jury from learning the truth. These actions are described in \n     detail in the Trial Memorandum of the House.\n       To the extent that President Clinton's Trial Memorandum \n     raises issues of credibility, those issues are best resolved \n     by live testimony subject to cross-examination. The Senate, \n     weighing the evidence in its entirety, will make an \n     independent assessment of the facts as they are presented, \n     and a detailed, point-by-point argument of these matters is \n     best resolved on the Senate floor. The House is confident \n     that a thorough factual analysis will not only refute \n     President Clinton's contentions, but will prove the very \n     serious charges contained in the articles.\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\n           III. The Articles Properly State Removal Offenses\n\n\n        A. The Offenses Alleged Are High Crimes And Misdemeanors\n\n     1. The Senate Has Never Exercised Its Power To Dismiss an \n         Article of Impeachment Except When the Official Impeached \n         Has Resigned\n       The House acknowledges that the Senate has the power to \n     dismiss an article of impeachment on the ground that it does \n     not state a removable offense. Beyond that, however, \n     President Clinton completely ignores the Senate's precedents \n     concerning the use of that power. In the fifteen cases in \n     which the House has forwarded articles of impeachment to \n     the Senate, the Senate has never granted a dispositive \n     motion to preclude a trial on the articles with one \n     exception. In the 1926 case of Judge George English, the \n     Senate granted a motion to adjourn after Judge English \n     resigned from office making a trial moot on the issue of \n     removal. See Impeachment of George W. English, U.S. \n     District Judge, Eastern District of Illinois, 68 Cong. \n     Rec. 347-48 (1926). The Senate also granted a motion to \n     adjourn in the 1868 trial of President Andrew Johnson, but \n     only after a full trial and votes to acquit on three \n     articles. III Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives Sec. 2443.\n       In addition, the Senate has never granted a motion to \n     dismiss or strike an article of impeachment. However, in the \n     1936 case of Judge Halsted Ritter, the House managers \n     themselves moved to strike two counts of a multi-count \n     article to simplify the trial, and the motion was granted. 80 \n     Cong. Rec. 4898-99 (April 3, 1936). However, the remainder of \n     the article was fully considered, and Judge Ritter was \n     convicted on that article. The House managers in the 1986 \n     Judge Harry Claiborne case made the only motion for summary \n     judgment in the history of impeachment. Hearings of the \n     Senate Impeachment Trial Committee (Judge Harry Claiborne), \n     99th Cong., 2d Sess. 145 (1986). They did so on the basis \n     that Judge Claiborne had already been convicted of the \n     charges in a criminal trial. Id. The Senate postponed a \n     decision on the motion and never ruled on it, but it \n     ultimately convicted Judge Claiborne. In short, the Senate \n     precedents firmly establish that the Senate has always \n     fulfilled its responsibility to give a full and fair hearing \n     to articles of impeachment voted by the House of \n     Representatives.\n     2. The Constitutional Text Sets One Clear Standard for \n         Removal\n       a. There is Only One Impeachment Standard\n       The Constitution sets one clear standard for impeachment, \n     conviction, and removal from office: the commission of \n     ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \n     U.S. Const. art. II, Sec. 4. The Senate has repeatedly \n     determined that perjury is a high crime and misdemeanor. \n     Simple logic dictates that obstruction of justice which has \n     the same effect as perjury and bribery of witnesses must also \n     be a high crime and misdemeanor. Endless repetition of the \n     claim that this standard is a high one does not change the \n     standard.\n       President Clinton claims that to remove him on these \n     articles would permanently disfigure and diminish the \n     Presidency and mangle the system of checks and balances. \n     President's Trial Memorandum at 18. Quite the contrary, \n     however, it is President Clinton's behavior as set forth in \n     the articles that has had these effects. Essentially, \n     President Clinton argues that the Presidency and the system \n     of checks and balances can only be saved if we allow the \n     President to commit felonies with impunity. To state that \n     proposition is to refute it. Convicting him and thereby \n     reaffirming that criminal behavior that strikes at the heart \n     of the justice system will result in removal will serve to \n     strengthen the Presidency, not weaken it.\n       b. Impeachment and Removal Are Appropriate for High Crimes \n           and Misdemeanors Regardless of Whether They Are \n           Offenses Against the System of Government\n       President Clinton argues that impeachment may only be used \n     to redress wrongful public misconduct. The point is academic. \n     Perjury and obstruction of justice as set forth in the \n     articles are, by definition, public misconduct. See generally \n     House Trial Memorandum at 107-12. Indeed, it is precisely \n     their public nature that makes them offenses--acts that are \n     not crimes when committed outside the judicial realm become \n     crimes when they enter that realm. Lying to one's spouse \n     about an extramarital affair, although immoral, is not a \n     crime. Telling the same lie under oath in a judicial \n     proceeding is a crime. Hiding gifts given to an adulterous \n     lover to conceal the affair, although immoral, is not a \n     crime. When those gifts become potential evidence in a \n     judicial proceeding, the same act becomes a crime. One who \n     has committed these kinds of crimes that corrupt the judicial \n     system simply is not fit to serve as the nation's chief law \n     enforcement officer.\n       Apart from that, the notion that high crimes and \n     misdemeanors encompass only public misconduct will not bear \n     scrutiny. Numerous ``private'' crimes would obviously require \n     the removal of a President. For example, if he killed his \n     wife in a domestic dispute or molested a child, no one would \n     seriously argue that he could not be removed. All of these \n     acts violate the President's unique responsibility to take \n     care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n     3. President Clinton Cites Precedents That Do Not Apply \n         Rather Than Relying on the Senate's Own Precedents \n         Clearly Establishing Perjury as a Removable Offense\n       a. President Clinton Continues To Misrepresent the \n           Fraudulent Tax Return Allegation Against President \n           Nixon\n       In his trial memorandum, President Clinton argues that the \n     failure in 1974 of the House Judiciary Committee to adopt an \n     article of impeachment against President Nixon for tax fraud \n     supports the claim that current charges against President \n     Clinton do not rise to the level of impeachable and removable \n     offenses. President's Trial Memorandum at 21. The President's \n     lawyers acknowledge the charge in the article against \n     President Nixon of ``knowingly and fraudulently failed to \n     report certain income and claimed deductions [for 1969-72] on \n     his Federal income tax returns which were not authorized by \n     law.'' Id. The President's lawyers go on to state that \n     ``[t]he President had signed his returns for those years \n     under penalty of perjury,'' Id., trying to distinguish \n     away the Claiborne impeachment and removal precedent from \n     1986, and by extension all the judicial impeachments from \n     the 1980s which clearly establish perjury as an \n     impeachable and removable offense.\n       President Clinton's argument that a President was not and \n     should not be impeached for tax fraud because it does not \n     involve official conduct or abuse of presidential powers \n     simply is unfounded based on the 1974 impeachment proceedings \n     against President Nixon. Moreover, the fact that the \n     President and his lawyers make this argument in defense of \n     the President is telling. He effectively claims that a large \n     scale tax cheat could be a viable chief executive.\n       It is undisputed that the Judiciary Committee rejected the \n     proposed tax fraud article against President Nixon by a vote \n     of 26 to 12. A slim minority of Committee members stated the \n     view that tax fraud would not be an impeachable offense. That \n     minority view is illustrated by the comments of Rep. Waldie \n     that in the tax fraud article there was ``not an abuse of \n     power sufficient to warrant impeachment. . . .'' Debate on \n     Article of Impeachment 1974: Hearings of the Comm. on the \n     Judiciary Pursuant H. Res. 803, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess., at 548 \n     (1974) (Statement of Rep. Waldie). Similar views were \n     expressed by Rep. Hogan and Rep. Mayne. Rep. Railsback took \n     the position that there was ``a serious question,'' id. at \n     524 (Statement of Rep. Railsback), whether misconduct of the \n     President in connection with his taxes would be impeachable.\n       Other members who opposed the tax fraud article based their \n     opposition on somewhat different grounds. Rep. Thornton based \n     his opposition to the tax fraud article on the ``view that \n     these charges may be reached in due course in the regular \n     process of law.'' Id. at 549 (Statement of Rep. Thornton). \n     Rep. Butler stated his view that the tax fraud article should \n     be rejected on prudential grounds: ``Sound judgment would \n     indicate that we not add this article to the trial burden we \n     already have.'' Id. at 550 (Statement of Rep. Butler).\n       The record is clear, however, that the overwhelming \n     majority of those who expressed a view in the debate in \n     opposition to the tax fraud article based their opposition on \n     the insufficiency of the evidence, and not on the view that \n     tax fraud, if proven, would not be an impeachable offense.\n       The comments of then-Rep. Wayne Owens in the debate in 1974 \n     directly contradict the view that Mr. Owens has expressed in \n     recent testimony before the House Judiciary Committee. \n     Although Mr. Owens in 1974 expressed his ``belief'' that \n     President Nixon was guilty of misconduct in connection with \n     his taxes, he clearly stated his conclusion that ``on the \n     evidence available'' Mr. Nixon's offenses were not \n     impeachable. Id. at 549 (Statement of Rep. Owens). Mr. Owens \n     spoke of the need for ``hard evidence'' and discussed his \n     unavailing efforts to obtain additional evidence that would \n     tie ``the President to the fraudulent deed'' or that would \n     otherwise ``close the inferential gap that has to be closed \n     in order to charge the President.'' Id. He concluded his \n     comments in the 1974 debate by urging the members of the \n     Committee ``to reject this article . . . based on that lack \n     of evidence.'' Id.\n       In addition to Mr. Owens, eleven members of the Committee \n     stated the view that there was not sufficient evidence of tax \n     fraud to support the article against President Nixon. \n     Wiggins: ``fraud . . . is wholly unsupported in the \n     evidence.'' Id. at 524 (Statement of Rep. Wiggins). McClory: \n     ``no substantial evidence of any tax fraud.'' Id. at 531 \n     (Statement of Rep. McClory). Sandman: ``There was absolutely \n     no intent to defraud here.'' Id. at 532 (Statement of Rep. \n     Sandman). Lott: ``mere mistakes or negligence by the \n     President in filing his tax returns should clearly not be \n     grounds for impeachment.'' Id. at 533 (Statement of Rep. \n     Lott). Maraziti: discussing absence of evidence of fraud. \n     Id. at 534 (Statement of Rep. Maraziti). Dennis: ``no \n     fraud has been found.'' Id. at 538 (Statement of Rep. \n     Dennis). Cohen: questioning whether ``in fact there was \n     criminal fraud involved.'' Id. at 548 (Statement of Rep. \n     Cohen). Hungate: ``I think there is a case here but in my \n     judgment I am having trouble deciding if it has as yet \n     been made.'' Id. at 553 (statement of Rep. Hungate). \n     Latta: only ``bad judgment and gross negligence.'' Id. at \n     554 (Statement of Rep. Latta). Fish: ``There is not to be \n     found before us evidence that the President acted wilfully \n     to evade his taxes.'' Id. at 556 (Statement of Rep. Fish). \n     Moorhead: ``there is no\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\n     showing that President Nixon in any way engaged in any \n     fraud.'' Id. at 557 (Statement of Rep. Moorhead).\n       The group of those who found the evidence insufficient \n     included moderate Democrats like Rep. Hungate and Rep. Owens, \n     as well as Republicans like Rep. Fish, Rep. Cohen, and Rep. \n     McClory, all of whom supported the impeachment of President \n     Nixon.\n       In light of all these facts, it is not credible to assert \n     that the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 determined that \n     tax fraud by the President would not be an impeachable \n     offense. The failure of the Committee to adopt the tax fraud \n     article against President Nixon simply does not support the \n     claim of President Clinton's lawyers that the offenses \n     charged against him do not rise to the level of impeachable \n     offenses.\n       In the Committee debate in 1974 a compelling case was made \n     that tax fraud by a President--if proven by sufficient \n     evidence--would be an impeachable offense. Rep. Brooks, who \n     later served as chairman of the Committee, said:\n\n       ``No man in America can be above the law. It is our duty to \n     establish now that evidence of specific statutory crimes and \n     constitutional violations by the President of the United \n     States will subject all Presidents now and in the future to \n     impeachment.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``No President is exempt under our U.S. Constitution and \n     the laws of the United States from accountability for \n     personal misdeeds any more than he is for official misdeeds. \n     And I think that we on this Committee in our effort to fairly \n     evaluate the President's activities must show the American \n     people that all men are treated equally under the law.''\n\n     (Debate on Articles of Impeachment, 1974: Hearings of the \n     Comm. on the Judiciary Pursuant to H. Res. 803, 93rd Cong., \n     2nd Sess., at 525, 554.)\n       Professor Charles Black stated it succinctly: ``A large-\n     scale tax cheat is not a viable chief magistrate.'' Charles \n     Black, Impeachment: A Handbook, (Yale University Press, 1974) \n     at 42. What is true of tax fraud is also true of a persistent \n     pattern of perjury by the President. An incorrigible perjurer \n     is not a viable chief magistrate.\n       b. President Clinton Continues to Misrepresent The \n           Allegations Against Alexander Hamilton.\n       President Clinton continues to try to persuade the American \n     public that the House of Representatives has impeached him \n     for having an extramarital affair. See Answer of President \n     William Jefferson Clinton to the Articles of Impeachment at 1 \n     (``The charges in the two Articles of Impeachment do not \n     permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly \n     elected President. The President has acknowledged conduct \n     with Ms. Lewinsky that was improper.'') (emphasis added). In \n     doing so, the President's lawyers refer to an incident \n     involving then Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton \n     being blackmailed by the husband of a woman named Maria \n     Reynolds with whom he was having an adulterous affair. \n     However, the President's lawyers omit the relevant \n     distinguishing facts even as they cast aspersions upon \n     Alexander Hamilton: none of Hamilton's ``efforts'' to cover \n     up his affair involved the violation of any laws, let alone \n     felonies. Indeed, the fact of the matter is that Hamilton was \n     the victim of the crime of extortion.\n       Never did Hamilton raise his right hand to take a sacred \n     oath and then willfully betray that oath and the rule of law \n     to commit perjury. Never did Alexander Hamilton obstruct \n     justice by tampering with witnesses, urging potential \n     witnesses to sign false affidavits, or attempt to conceal \n     evidence from a Federal criminal grand jury.\n       Again, the significance of the distinctions are glaringly \n     obvious: it is apparent from the Hamilton case that the \n     Framers did not regard private sexual misconduct as an \n     impeachable offense. It is also apparent that efforts to \n     cover up such private behavior outside of a legal setting, \n     including even paying hush money to induce someone to destroy \n     documents, did not meet the standard. Neither Hamilton's high \n     position, nor the fact that his payments to a securities \n     swindler created an enormous appearance problem, were enough \n     to implicate the standard. These wrongs were real, and they \n     were not insubstantial, but to the Framers they were \n     essentially private and therefore not impeachable. David \n     Frum, ``Smearing Alexander Hamilton,'' The Weekly Standard \n     (Oct. 19, 1998) at 14.\n       But the Alexander Hamilton incident President Clinton cites \n     actually clarifies the precise point at which personal \n     misconduct becomes a public offense. Hamilton could keep his \n     secret only by a betrayal of public responsibilities. \n     Hamilton came to that point and, at immense personal cost, \n     refused to cross the line. President Clinton came to that \n     point and, fully understanding what he was doing, knowingly \n     charged across the line. President Clinton's public  acts of \n     perjury and obstruction of justice transformed a personal \n     misconduct into a public offense.\n     4. The Views of the Prominent Historians and Legal Scholars \n         the President Cites Do Not Stand Up to Careful Scrutiny.\n       It speaks volumes that the most distinguished of the 400 \n     historians referred to in President Clinton's trial brief is \n     Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. Professor Schlesinger had a different \n     view of impeachment 25 years ago. President Clinton himself \n     asserts that ``the allegations are so far removed from \n     official wrongdoing that their assertion here threatens to \n     weaken significantly the Presidency itself.'' President's \n     Trial Memorandum at 24. However, Schlesinger has written \n     that:\n\n       ``The genius of impeachment lay in the fact that it could \n     punish the man without the punishing the office. For, in the \n     Presidency as elsewhere, power was ambiguous: the power to go \n     good meant also the power to do harm, the power to serve the \n     republic also the power to demand and defile it.''\n\n     (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., The Imperial Presidency, (Easton \n     Press edit. 1973) (hereinafter ``Schlesinger'') at 415.)\n       The statement of the 400 historians cited with approval in \n     the President's trial memorandum makes the following \n     statement: ``[t]he Framers explicitly reserved that step for \n     high crimes and misdemeanors in the exercise of executive \n     power.'' Statement of Historians in Defense of the \n     Constitution, The New York Times (Oct. 30, 1998) at A15. The \n     400 historians then believe that commission of a murder or \n     rape by the President of the United States in his personal \n     capacity is not subject to the impeachment power of Article \n     II, Section 4.\n       President Clinton in his trial memorandum asserts that this \n     case does not fit the paradigmatic case for impeachment. \n     President's Trial Memorandum at 24. However, none of his \n     predecessors ever faced overwhelming evidence of repeatedly \n     lying under oath before a federal court and grand jury and \n     otherwise seeking to obstruct justice to benefit himself--\n     directly contradicting his oath to ``take care that the laws \n     are faithfully executed.'' But as former Attorney General \n     Griffin Bell, who served under President Carter, said before \n     the House Judiciary Committee recently, ``[a] President \n     cannot faithfully execute the laws if he himself is breaking \n     them.'' Background and History of Impeachment: Hearings \n     Before the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the House Comm. on \n     the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. at 203 (Comm. Print \n     1998) (Testimony of Judge Griffin B. Bell).\n       President Clinton goes on to state that to make the \n     offenses alleged against him impeachable and removable \n     conduct ``would forever lower the bar in a way inimical to \n     the Presidency and to our government of separated powers. \n     These articles allege (1) sexual misbehavior, (2) statements \n     about sexual misbehavior and (3) attempts to conceal the fact \n     of sexual misbehavior.'' President's Trial Memorandum at 26. \n     While President Clinton and his able counsel would like to \n     define the case this way, what is at issue in the articles of \n     impeachment before the Senate is clear: perjury and \n     obstruction of justice committed by the President of the \n     United States in order to thwart a duly instituted civil \n     rights sexual harassment lawsuit against him as well as a \n     subsequent grand jury investigation. While the President may \n     think such allegations would forever lower the bar in terms \n     of the conduct we expect from our public officials, we must \n     square his opinion and that of his lawyers with the fact that \n     his Justice Department puts people in prison for similar \n     conduct. While the President's brief again quotes Arthur \n     Schlesinger, Jr. for the proposition that we must not ``lower \n     the bar,'' President's Trial Memorandum at 26, Schlesinger \n     held a different view during the impeachment of President \n     Nixon:\n\n       ``If the Nixon White House escaped the legal consequences \n     of its illegal behavior, why would future Presidents and \n     their associates not suppose themselves entitled to do what \n     the Nixon White House had done? Only condign punishment would \n     restore popular faith in the Presidency and deter future \n     Presidents from illegal conduct.''\n     (Schlesinger at 418.)\n     5. The President and Federal Judges are Impeached, Convicted, \n         and Removed From Office Under the Same Standard\n       President Clinton's argument that Presidents are held to a \n     lower standard of behavior than federal judges completely \n     misreads the Constitution and the Senate's precedents. See \n     generally House Trial Brief at 101-06. The Constitution \n     provides one standard for the impeachment, conviction, and \n     removal from office of ``[t]the President, the Vice \n     President, and all civil officers of the United States.'' \n     U.S. Const. art II, Sec. 4. It is the commission of \n     ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \n     Id.  The Senate has already determined that perjury is a high \n     crime and misdemeanor in the cases of Judge Nixon, Judge \n     Hastings, and Judge Claiborne.\n       President Clinton argues that the standard differs because \n     judges have life tenure whereas Presidents are accountable to \n     the voters at elections. That argument fails on several \n     grounds. The differing tenures are set forth in the \n     Constitution, and there is simply no textual support for the \n     idea that they affect the impeachment standard at all. If \n     electoral accountability were a sufficient means of remedying \n     presidential misconduct, the framers would not have \n     explicitly included the President in the impeachment clause. \n     Finally, even if this argument were otherwise valid, it does \n     not apply to President Clinton because he will never face the \n     voters again. U.S. Const. amend. XXII. Indeed, all of the \n     conduct charged in the Articles occurred after the 1996 \n     election.\n       Then President Clinton rejects the Senate's own precedents \n     showing that perjury is a high crime and misdemeanor in the \n     three judicial impeachments of the 1980s arguing that all of \n     the lying involved there concerned the judges' official \n     duties. That is true with respect to Judge Hastings, but \n     completely false with respect to Judge Claiborne and Judge \n     Nixon. Judge Claiborne was\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\n     impeached and convicted for lying on his income tax returns, \n     an entirely personal matter. President Clinton tries to \n     explain this away by saying: ``Once convicted, [Judge \n     Claiborne] simply could not perform his official functions \n     because his personal probity had been impaired such that he \n     could not longer be an arbiter of others' oaths.'' \n     President's Trial Memorandum at 29. The same is true of \n     President Clinton. He ultimately directs the Department of \n     Justice which must decide whether people are prosecuted for \n     lying. If he has committed perjury and obstructed justice, \n     how can he be the arbiter of other's oaths? As Professor \n     Jonathan Turley put it:\n\n       ``As Chief Executive the President stands as the ultimate \n     authority over the Justice Department and the \n     Administration's enforcement policies. It is unclear how \n     prosecutors can legitimately threaten, let alone prosecute, \n     citizens who have committed perjury or obstruction of justice \n     under circumstances nearly identical to the President's. Such \n     inherent conflict will be even greater in the military cases \n     and the President's role as Commander-in-Chief.''\n\n     (Background and History of Impeachment: Hearings Before the \n     Subcomm. on the Constitution of the House Comm. on the \n     Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. at 274 (Comm. Print 1998) \n     (Testimony of Professor Jonathan Turley).)\n       In the same vein, President Clinton claims that Judge Nixon \n     ``employ[ed] the power and prestige of his office to obtain \n     advantage for a party.'' President's Trial Brief at 29. In \n     fact, Judge Nixon intervened in a state criminal case in \n     which he had no official role. His ability to persuade the \n     prosecutor to drop the case rested on his friendship with the \n     state prosecutor--not his official position. President \n     Clinton argues that it was Judge Nixon's intervention in a \n     judicial proceeding that ties it to his official position. \n     The same is true of President Clinton. He intervened in two \n     judicial proceedings and his actions had the same effect as \n     Judge Nixon's--to defeat a just result.\n       As the person who ultimately directs the Justice \n     Department--the federal government's prosecutorial \n     authority--the President must follow his constitutional duty \n     to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. U.S. \n     Const. art II, Sec. 3. His special constitutional duty is at \n     least as high, if not higher, than the judge's. Indeed, \n     President Clinton acknowledged as much early in his \n     Administration when controversy arose about the nomination of \n     Zoe Baird and the potential nomination of Judge Kimba Wood to \n     be Attorney General. Questions were raised about whether they \n     had properly complied with laws relating to their hiring of \n     household help. At that time, President Clinton said the \n     Attorney General ``should be held to a higher standard than \n     other Cabinet members on matters of this kind [i.e. strictly \n     complying with the law].'' Remarks of President Clinton with \n     Reporters Prior to a Meeting with Economic Advisers, February \n     8, 1993, 29 Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents 160. \n     If the Attorney General is held to a higher standard of \n     compliance with the law, then her superior, President \n     Clinton, must be also.\n\n\n  B. The Individual Consciences of Senators Determines the Burden of \n                      Proof in Impeachment Trials.\n\n       The Constitution does not discuss the standard of proof for \n     impeachment trials. It simply states that ``the Senate shall \n     have the Power to try all Impeachments.'' U.S. Const., Art I, \n     Sec. 3, clause 5. Because the Constitution is silent on the \n     matter, it is appropriate to look at the past practice of the \n     Senate. Historically, the Senate has never set a standard of \n     proof for impeachment trials. ``In the final analysis the \n     question is one which historically has been answered by \n     individual Senators guided by their own consciences.'' \n     Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Standard \n     of Proof in Senate Impeachment Proceedings, Thomas B. Ripy, \n     Legislative Attorney, American Law Division (January 7, \n     1999).\n       President Clinton argues that the impeachment trial is \n     similar to a criminal trial and that the appropriate standard \n     should therefore be ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' That \n     argument is not new: it has been made in the past, and the \n     Senate has rejected it, as indeed, President Clinton \n     acknowledges. He asserts, however, that the impeachment trial \n     of a President should proceed under special procedures that \n     do not apply to the trial of other civil officers. His \n     arguments are unpersuasive.\n     1. The Senate has Never Adopted the Criminal Standard of \n         ``Beyond a Reasonable Doubt'' or Any Other Standard of \n         Proof for Impeachment Trials.\n       The Senate has never adopted the standard of ``beyond a \n     reasonable doubt'' in any impeachment trial in U.S. history. \n     In fact, the Senate has chosen not to impose a standard at \n     all, preferring to leave to the conscience of each senator \n     the decision of how best to judge the facts presented.\n       In the impeachment trial of Judge Harry Claiborne, counsel \n     for the respondent moved to designate ``beyond a reasonable \n     doubt'' as the standard of proof for conviction. Gray & \n     Reams, The Congressional Impeachment Process and the \n     Judiciary: Documents and Materials on the Removal of Federal \n     District Judge Harry E. Claiborne, Volume 5, Document 41, X \n     (1987). The Senate overwhelmingly rejected the motion by a \n     vote of 17-75. In the floor debate on the motion, House \n     Manager Kastenmeier emphasized that the Senate has \n     historically allowed each member to exercise his personal \n     judgment in these cases. 132 Cong. Rec. S15489-S15490 \n     (daily ed. October 7, 1986).\n       The question of the appropriate standard of proof was also \n     raised in the trial of Judge Alcee Hastings. In the Senate \n     Impeachment Trial Committee, Senator Rudman said in response \n     to a question about the historical practice regarding the \n     standard of proof that there has been no specific standard, \n     ``you are not going to find it. It is what is in the mind of \n     every Senator. . . . I think it is what everybody decides for \n     themselves.'' Report of the Senate Impeachment Trial \n     Committee on the Articles Against Judge Alcee Hastings: \n     Hearings before the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee (Part \n     1) 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 73-75, (discussion involving \n     Senator Lieberman and Senator Rudman).\n     2. The Criminal Standard of Proof is Inappropriate for \n         Impeachment Trials.\n       President Clinton argues that an impeachment trial is akin \n     to a criminal trial and that, therefore, the criminal \n     standard should apply. That assertion is, of course, at \n     direct odds with his apparent opposition to the presentation \n     of evidence through witnesses, another normal criminal trial \n     procedure. The Senate Rules Committee rejected this analogy \n     in 1974, stating, ``an impeachment trial is not a criminal \n     trial,'' and advocating a clear and convincing evidence \n     standard. Executive Session Hearings, U.S. Senate Committee \n     on Rules and Administration, ``Senate Rules and Precedents \n     Applicable to Impeachment Trials'' 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. \n     (August 5-6, 1974). Indeed, it is undisputed that impeachable \n     offenses need not be criminal offenses. See Submission by \n     Counsel for President Clinton to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the United States House of Representatives, \n     105th Cong., 2d Sess. at 14 (Comm. Print Ser. No. 16 1998) \n     (``Impeachable acts need not be criminal acts.'')\n       Moreover, the result of conviction in an impeachment trial \n     is removal from office, not punishment. As the House argued \n     in the Claiborne trial, the reasonable standard was designed \n     to protect criminal defendants who risked ``forfeitures of \n     life, liberty and property'' (quoting Brinegar v. United \n     States, 338 U.S. 160, 174 (1949)). This standard is \n     inappropriate here because the Constitution limits the \n     consequences of a Senate impeachment trial to removal from \n     office and disqualification from holding office in the \n     future, explicitly preserving the option for a subsequent \n     criminal trial in the courts. U.S. Const. art. II, Sec. 3, \n     cl. 6.\n       In addition, as the House argued in the Claiborne trial, \n     the criminal standard is inappropriate because impeachment \n     is, by its nature, a proceeding where the public interest \n     weighs more heavily than the interest of the individual \n     defendant. Gray & Reams, The Congressional Impeachment \n     Process and the Judiciary: Documents and Materials on the \n     Removal of Federal District Judge Harry E. Claiborne, Volume \n     5, Document 41, X (1987). During the course of the floor \n     debate on this motion in the Claiborne trial, Representative \n     Kastenmeier argued for the House that the use of the criminal \n     standard was inappropriate where the public interest in \n     removing corrupt officials was a significant factor. 132 \n     Cong. Rec. S15489-S15490 (daily ed. October 7, 1986).\n     3. A President Who Is Impeached Should Not Receive Special \n         Procedural Benefits That Do Not Apply in the Impeachment \n         Trials of Other Civil Officers.\n       President Clinton argues that he should be exempted from \n     the weight of historical practice and precedent and be given \n     a special rule on the standard of proof. This argument is \n     based on fallacious assertions, the first of which is that \n     different constitutional standards apply to the impeachment \n     of judges and presidents. See above at 14-16 and House Trial \n     Memorandum at 101-06.\n       President Clinton also employs inflammatory rhetoric to \n     suggest that a presidential impeachment trial ought to be \n     treated differently, explaining that the criminal standard is \n     needed because ``the Presidency itself is at stake'' and \n     because conviction would ``overturn the results of an \n     election.'' President's Trial Memorandum at 32-33. The \n     presidency is, of course, not at stake, though the tenure of \n     its current office holder may be. The 25th Amendment to the \n     Constitution ensures that impeachment and removal of a \n     President would not overturn an election because it is the \n     elected Vice President who would replace the President not \n     the losing presidential candidate.\n       Finally, President Clinton argues that the evidence should \n     be tested by the most stringent standard because ``there is \n     no suggestion of corruption or misuse of office--or any other \n     conduct that places our system of government at risk in the \n     two remaining years of the President's term.'' President's \n     Trial Memorandum at 33. While the President might be expected \n     to argue that he did not act corruptly, he cannot credibly \n     assert that ``there is no suggestion of corruption,'' because \n     ``corrupt'' conduct is precisely what he is charged with in \n     the articles of impeachment. Though not persuasive as an \n     argument, this statement is significant in what it concedes--\n     that corruption is among the ``conduct that places our system \n     of government at risk.'' President's Trial Memorandum at 33. \n     Having acknowledged this, President Clinton cannot be heard \n     to complain that the House has failed to charge him with \n     conduct which rises to the level of an impeachable offense.\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\n       IV. The Structure of the Articles is Proper and Sufficient\n\n\n            a. the articles are not unconstitutionally vague\n\n       President Clinton's trial memorandum argues that the two \n     articles of impeachment are unfairly complex. To the \n     contrary, the articles present the misdeeds of President \n     Clinton and their consequences in as transparent and \n     understandable a manner as possible.\n       The first article of impeachment charges that President \n     Clinton violated his enumerated constitutional \n     responsibilities by willfully corrupting and manipulating the \n     judicial process. He did this by providing perjurious, false \n     and misleading testimony to a grand jury in regard to one or \n     more of four matters. The deleterious consequences his \n     actions had for the people of the United States are then \n     described. The second article charges that President Clinton \n     violated his enumerated constitutional responsibilities by a \n     course of conduct that prevented, obstructed, and impeded the \n     administration of justice. One or more of seven listed acts \n     constitute the particulars of President Clinton's course of \n     conduct. As in the first article, the deleterious \n     consequences his actions had for the people of the United \n     States are then described.\n       To do as President Clinton requests would require \n     separating out into a unique article of impeachment each \n     possible combination of (a) a particular violation of his \n     duties, (b) a particular wrongful act, and (c) a particular \n     consequence of his actions. This would require 48 different \n     articles in the case of the first article and 84 in the case \n     of the second. Such a multiplicity of articles is not \n     required and would assist no one. Of course, if the president \n     had violated fewer presidential duties, committed fewer \n     misdeeds, and been responsible for fewer harmful consequences \n     to the American people, the articles could have been drafted \n     more simply.\n       The trial memorandum then makes the contention that the two \n     articles of impeachment are impermissibly vague and lacking \n     in specificity in that they do not meet the standards of a \n     criminal indictment. This contention clearly misses the mark. \n     Impeachment is a political and not a criminal proceeding, \n     designed, as recognized by Justice Joseph Story, the \n     Constitution's greatest nineteenth century interpreter, ``not \n     . . . to punish an offender'' by threatening deprivation of \n     his life or liberty, but to ``secure the state'' by \n     ``divest[ing] him of his political capacity''. J. Story, \n     Commentaries on the Constitution (R. Rotunda & J. Nowak eds., \n     1987) Sec. 803. Justice Story thus found the analogy to an \n     indictment to be invalid:\n\n       ``The articles . . . need not, and indeed do not, pursue \n     the strict form and accuracy of an indictment. They are \n     sometimes quite general in the form of the allegations; but \n     always contain, or ought to contain, so much certainty, as to \n     enable the party to put himself upon the proper defense, and \n     also, in case of an acquittal, to avail himself of it, as a \n     bar to another impeachment.''\n\n     (Id. at Sec. 806).\n       In explaining the impeachment process to the citizens of \n     New York in Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton stated in \n     more general terms that impeachment ``can never be tied down \n     by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the \n     offense by the prosecutors or in the construction of it by \n     the judges, as in common cases serve to limit the discretion \n     of courts in favor of personal security.'' The Federalist No. \n     65, at 398 (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961).\n       Can the president legitimately argue that he is unable to \n     put on a proper defense? President Clinton has committed a \n     great number of impeachable misdeeds. The House Judiciary \n     Committee's committee report requires 20 pages just to list \n     the most glaring instances of the president's perjurious, \n     false, and misleading testimony before a federal grand jury \n     and it requires 13 pages just to list the most glaring \n     incidents in the president's course of conduct designed to \n     prevent, obstruct, and impede the administration of justice. \n     The House believes that President Clinton's attorneys have \n     reviewed the committee report. They know exactly what he is \n     being charged with, as is acknowledged in the president's \n     trial memorandum. The memorandum states in its introduction \n     that ``[t]ake away the elaborate trappings of the Articles \n     and the high-flying rhetoric that accompanied them, and we \n     see clearly that the House of Representatives asks the Senate \n     to remove the President from office because he . . .'' \n     President's Trial Memorandum at 2. In addition, in the House \n     proceedings, the President filed three documents: a \n     Preliminary Memorandum, an Initial Response, and a Submission \n     by Counsel. The first two documents were printed together and \n     ran to 57 pages. Preliminary Memorandum of the President of \n     the United States Concerning Referral of the Office of the \n     Independent Counsel and Initial Response of the President of \n     the United States to Referral of the Office of the \n     Independent Counsel, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., H. Doc. No. 105-\n     317 (1998). The third was printed and ran to 404 pages. \n     Submission by Counsel for President Clinton to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary of the United States House of \n     Representatives, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (Comm. Print Ser. No. \n     16 1998). He was also given 30 hours to present his case \n     before the House Committee on the Judiciary, during which he \n     called numerous witnesses. The Committee repeatedly asked \n     President Clinton to provide it with any exculpatory \n     evidence, an offer which he never accepted. Now President \n     Clinton's Trial Memorandum to the Senate runs to 130 pages. \n     Clearly, President Clinton has not suffered from any lack of \n     specificity in the articles of impeachment.\n       If he had, he would have availed himself of the opportunity \n     to file a motion for a bill of particulars. He had that \n     opportunity on January 11, 1999, and he waived it. He should \n     not now be heard to claim that he does not know what the \n     charges are.\n       Unlike the judicial impeachments of the 1980s, President \n     Clinton has not committed a handful of specific misdeeds that \n     can easily be listed in separate articles of impeachment. \n     In order to encompass the whole melange of misdeeds that \n     caused the House of Representatives to impeach President \n     Clinton, the Judiciary Committee looked to the only \n     analogous case--that of President Nixon. In 1974, the \n     Committee was also faced with drafting articles of \n     impeachment of a reasonable length against a president who \n     had committed a long series of improper acts designed to \n     achieve an illicit end.\n       The first article of impeachment against President Nixon \n     charged that in order to cover up an unlawful entry into the \n     headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and to \n     delay, impede, and obstruct the consequent investigation (and \n     for certain other purposes), he engaged in a series of acts \n     such as ``making or causing to be made false or misleading \n     statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers'', \n     ``endeavoring to misuse the Central Intelligence Agency'', \n     and ``endeavoring to cause prospective defendants and \n     individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favored \n     treatment and consideration to return for their silence or \n     false testimony.'' Impeachment of Richard M. Nixon, President \n     of the United States, H. Rept. No. 93-1305, 93rd Cong., 2d \n     Sess. 2 (1974). The article did not list each false or \n     misleading statement, did not list each misuse of the CIA, \n     and did not list each prospective defendant and what they \n     were promised.\n       In like fashion, the articles of impeachment against \n     President Clinton charge him with providing perjurious, \n     false, and misleading testimony concerning four subjects, \n     such as an his relationship with a subordinate government \n     employee, and engaging in a course of conduct designed to \n     prevent, obstruct, and impede the administration of justice, \n     such course including four generals acts such as an effort to \n     secure job assistance for that employee. An argument can be \n     made that the articles of impeachment against President \n     Clinton were drafted with more specificity than those against \n     President Nixon. Unless President Clinton is arguing that the \n     Senate should have dismissed the first article of impeachment \n     against President Nixon (had the president not resigned), he \n     has little ground to complain about the articles against \n     himself. In short, President Clinton knows exactly what the \n     charges are, and the Senate should now require him to account \n     for his behavior.\n\n\n   B. The Articles Do Not Improperly Charge Multiple Offenses in One \n                                Article.\n\n       President Clinton argues unpersuasively that the articles \n     of impeachment are ``unconstitutionally flawed'' in two \n     respects. First, he argues that ``by charging multiple wrongs \n     in one article, the House of Representatives has made it \n     impossible for the Senate to comply with the Constitutional \n     mandate that any conviction be by the concurrence of two-\n     thirds of the members.'' President's Trial Memorandum at 101. \n     Second, he argues that the articles do not provide him ``the \n     most basic notice of the charges against him required by due \n     process and fundamental fairness.'' Id. Both arguments are \n     factually deficient, ignore Senate precedent and procedure, \n     and are constitutionally flawed.\n       The articles of impeachment allege that the President made \n     ``one or more'' ``perjurious, false and misleading statements \n     to the grand jury'' and committed ``one or more'' acts in \n     which he obstructed justice. H. Res. 611, 105th Cong. 2nd \n     Sess. (1998). The articles of impeachment are modeled after \n     those adopted by the House Committee on the Judiciary against \n     President Nixon and were drafted with the rules of the Senate \n     in mind. Senate Rules specifically contemplate that the House \n     may draft articles of impeachment in this manner and prior \n     rulings of the Senate have held that such drafting is not \n     deficient and will not sustain a motion to dismiss.\n       In 1986, the United States Senate amended the Rules of \n     Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials. S. Res. 479, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess. \n     (1986). As part of the reform, Rules XXIII, which deals \n     generally with voting the final question, was amended to \n     clarify the articles of impeachment are not divisible. Rule \n     XXIII provides in relevant part that:\n\n       ``An article of impeachment shall not be divisible for the \n     purpose of voting thereon at any time during the trial. Once \n     voting has commenced on an article of impeachment, voting \n     shall be continued until voting has been completed on all \n     articles of impeachment unless the Senate adjourns for period \n     not to exceed one day or adjourns sine die.''\n\n       The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, after \n     thoroughly reviewing the impeachment rules, prior articles of \n     impeachments, and prior Senate trials, decided that articles \n     of impeachment should not be divisible. In drafting the \n     amendment to Rule XXIII providing that articles of \n     impeachment not be divided, the Senate was aware that the \n     House may combine multiple counts\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\n     of impeachable conduct in one article of impeachment. The \n     Committee report explains the Senate's position:\n\n       ``The portion of the amendment effectively enjoining the \n     divisions of an article into separate specifications is \n     proposed to permit the most judicious and efficacious \n     handling of the final question both as a general manner and, \n     in particular, with respect to the form of the articles that \n     proposed the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. The \n     latter did not follow the more familiar pattern of embodying \n     an impeachable offense in an individual article but, in \n     respect to the first and second of those articles, set out \n     broadly based charges alleging constitutional improprieties \n     followed by a recital of transactions illustrative or \n     supportive of such charges. The wording of Articles I and II \n     expressly provided that a conviction could be had thereunder \n     if supported by ``one or more of the'' enumerated \n     specifications. The general review of the Committee at that \n     time was expressed by Senators Byrd and Allen, both of whom \n     felt that division of the articles in question into \n     potentially 14 separately voted specifications might ``be \n     time consuming and confusing, and a matter which could create \n     great chaos and division, bitterness, and ill will * * *.'' \n     Accordingly, it was agreed to write into the proposed rules \n     language which would allow each Senator to vote to convict \n     under either the first or second articles if he were \n     convinced that the person impeached was ``guilty'' or one or \n     more of the enumerated specifications.''\n\n     Amending the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate \n     When Sitting on Impeachment Trials, Report of the Comm. on \n     Rules and Administration, S. Rept. 99-401, 99th Cong., 2nd \n     Sess., at 8 (1986) (emphasis added). Because the Senate was \n     aware that multiple specifications of impeachment conduct may \n     be contained in an article of impeachment, the Senate's rules \n     implicitly countenance such drafting.\n       The issue regarding whether articles of impeachment are \n     divisible is not new to the Senate. In fact, the Senate's \n     Committee on Rules and Administration reviewed the Senate's \n     impeachment procedures in 1974 to prepare for a possible \n     trial of President Richard Nixon. The Committee passed the \n     exact same language as the Committee did in 1986 prohibiting \n     the division of an article of impeachment. Because President \n     Nixon resigned, the full Senate never considered the \n     amendments.\n       Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York submitted a statement \n     to the Committee in 1974 addressing the divisibility issue \n     and advised that Rule XXIII be amended to prohibit the \n     division of an article of impeachment. His comments, as \n     follows, are instructive:\n\n       ``Rule XXIII provides for the yeas and nays to be taken on \n     each article separately but does not set any order for a vote \n     when there are several articles. In the [President] Johnson \n     trial, this was done by order of the Senate and several votes \n     were taken on the order. This procedure, setting a vote for \n     final consideration, should be stated in the rules. Also the \n     rule is silent about the division of any article. In the \n     Johnson trial a division was requested and the Chief Justice \n     attempted to devise one, but could not, and the article as a \n     whole was submitted for a vote to the Senate. I believe \n     articles should not be divided because this raises a further \n     question of whether a two-thirds vote is required on each \n     part of an article and whether the House action on the \n     construction of a particular article can be changed without \n     further action by the House. Thus the rule should provide for \n     no division of an article by the Senate.''\n\n     (Senate Rules and Precedents Applicable to Impeachment \n     Trials, Executive Session Hearings before the Comm. on \n     Standing Rules and Administration, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess. at \n     116 (August 5th and 6th, 1974) (emphasis added).)\n       In addition to implicitly recognizing that articles of \n     impeachment may contain multiple specifications of \n     impeachable offenses, the Senate has convicted a number of \n     judges on such ``omnibus'' articles, including Judges \n     Archbald, Ritter, and Claiborne. In the case of Judge Nixon, \n     the Senate acquitted on the article, but refused to dismiss \n     it.\n       The most recent example, that of Judge Nixon in 1989, is \n     instructive. Judge Walter L. Nixon filed a motion to dismiss \n     on the grounds that Article III was duplicative, among other \n     things. Senator Fowler, the chairman of the committee \n     appointed to take evidence in the impeachment trial of Judge \n     Nixon explained the reasons for denying Nixon's motion to \n     refer the motion to dismiss to the full Senate:\n\n       ``To the extent that the motion rests on the House's \n     inclusion of fourteen distinct allegations of false \n     statements in one article, we believe that Article III states \n     an intelligible and adequately discrete charge of an \n     impeachable offense by alleging that Judge Nixon concealed \n     information concerning several conversations in which he had \n     engaged by making ``one or more'' false statements to a grand \n     jury. The House has substantial discretion in determining how \n     to aggregate related alleged acts of misconduct in framing \n     Articles of Impeachment and has historically frequently \n     chosen to aggregate multiple factual allegations in a single \n     impeachment article. The House's itemization of the fourteen \n     particular statements whose knowing falsity it is alleging \n     serves to give Judge Nixon fair notice of the contours of the \n     charge against him without reducing the intelligibility of \n     the article's essential accusation that Judge Nixon knowingly \n     concealed material information from the government's law \n     enforcement agents. Because the Committee believes that \n     evidentiary proceedings may fairly be conducted on Article \n     III as it is presently drafted, Judge Nixon's motion to refer \n     his motion to dismiss Article III to the Senate at this time \n     is denied.''\n\n     (135 Cong. Rec. 19635-36 (September 6, 1989).)\n       The full Senate eventually rejected Judge Nixon's motion to \n     dismiss by a vote of 34 to 63. Mr. Manager Cardin \n     persuasively summed up the argument against the motion to \n     dismiss as follows:\n\n       ``Judge Nixon argues, in his brief, that you must find all \n     14 statements to be false to vote guilty on article III. But \n     that is untrue. Read the article closely. The question posed \n     by article III is, did Judge Nixon conceal information? Did \n     he conceal information, first by one or more false or \n     misleading statements in his interview, and then by one or \n     more false and misleading statements in his grand jury \n     testimony?\n       ``You need not find all 14 statements to be false. The \n     House is unanimously convinced that all 14 are complete and \n     utter lies. We hope you will agree. But after considering the \n     evidence, perhaps you will conclude that only 12 of the \n     statements are false. It really does not matter. Just one \n     intentionally false and misleading statement in the \n     interview, or one in the grand jury, should be enough. \n     Because if you conclude that Judge Nixon concealed \n     information, whether by 1 false statement or 14, he should be \n     removed from the bench. You should vote guilty on article \n     III.\n       ``And you need not necessarily agree on which statements \n     are false, if you reach the conclusion that he concealed \n     information. If two-thirds of the Senators present believe \n     Judge Nixon lied, regardless of how each individual Senator \n     reached that conclusion, he will properly be removed from \n     office.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``This is by no means unfair to Judge Nixon, for even if \n     you might differ on which particular statements are lies, the \n     bottom line is that two-thirds of you will have agreed that \n     he concealed information, rendering him unfit for office. \n     That is what the Constitution requires.''\n\n     (Id. at 26751.)\n       Given the clear Senate precedent permitting articles of \n     impeachment containing multiple specifications of impeachable \n     offenses, the President's attack on the construction of the \n     articles is an attack on Senate rules and precedent. The \n     President's concerns, if assumed to be valid, could be \n     addressed simply by permitting a division of the question. \n     Under the standing rules of the Senate, any Senator may have \n     the same divided if ``the question in debate contains \n     several propositions.'' Senate Rule XV. A question is \n     divisible if it contains two or more separate and distinct \n     propositions. The Senate, however, has made an affirmative \n     decision to dispense with the regular order which governs \n     bills, resolutions, and amendments thereto, and instead \n     adopted a different procedure not permitting the division \n     of articles of impeachment. The Senate has not acted \n     unconstitutionally in the past regarding prior \n     impeachments, and is not on a course to do so in the trial \n     of President Clinton.\n       The claim that President Clinton is not on notice regarding \n     the charges is ludicrous. The Lewinsky matter is arguably the \n     most reported and scrutinized story of 1998 and possibly of \n     1999. The facts of the case are contained in numerous \n     documents, statements, reports, and filings. Specifically, \n     President Clinton has had the following documents, among \n     others, containing the facts and specifics of the case: (1) \n     Referral from Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr in \n     Conformity with the Requirements of Title 28, United States \n     Code, Section 595(c), H. Doc. 105-310, 105th Cong., 2nd Sess. \n     (1998); (2) Investigatory Powers of the Comm. on the \n     Judiciary with Respect to its Impeachment Inquiry, H. Rept. \n     105-795, 105th Cong., 2nd Sess. (October 7, 1998); (3) \n     Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the \n     United States, 105th Cong., 2nd Sess., H.R. Rept. 105-830 \n     (Dec. 16, 1998); and (4) Trial Memorandum of the United \n     States House of Representatives. If all of these reports and \n     the thousands of pages of documents are not enough, President \n     Clinton will have the opportunity to review the presentation \n     of the Managers on the Part of the House for up to twenty-\n     four hours.\n\n    V. President Clinton Completely Misstates the Record as to the \n    Discovery Procedures That Were Available to Him in the House of \n                            Representatives\n\n       President Clinton's trial memorandum claimed to the Senate \n     that, should it decide ``to allow the House managers to \n     expand the record in some way . . . the President would have \n     an urgent need for the discovery of relevant evidence, \n     because at no point in these proceedings has been able to \n     subpoena documents or summon or cross-examine witnesses.'' \n     President's Trial Memorandum at 125 (emphasis added). The \n     President also states that ``the House of Representatives \n     [did not] afford the President any discovery mechanisms to \n     secure evidence that might be helpful in his defense.'' Id.\n       We will not address every discovery issue here since those \n     issues will be resolved in the coming days; however, the \n     Senate should know that these claims are absolutely false. In \n     fact, the President's own brief refutes his claims. ``The \n     Committee allowed the President's lawyers two days in which \n     to present a defense. The White House presented four panels \n     of distinguished expert witnesses. . . .'' White House \n     Counsel Charles\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\n     F.C. Ruff presented argument to the Committee on behalf of \n     the President. . . .'' Id. at 13.\n       The House Committee on the Judiciary repeatedly asked the \n     President's attorneys to supply any exculpatory evidence to \n     the Committee, both orally and in writing. They never did. \n     When, at the last minute, the President's counsel requested \n     witnesses, the Committee invited to testify every witness \n     they requested. Aside from this, President Clinton nor his \n     attorneys never asked to ``subpoena documents'' or ``summon \n     or cross-examine witnesses.'' If President Clinton's argument \n     is that the Committee did not provide his staff a stack of \n     blank subpoenas, that is correct. However, neither the House \n     of Representatives, nor the Senate, has the ability to ``turn \n     over'' its constitutionally based subpoena power to the \n     executive branch.\n       President Clinton's attorneys never asked to do the things \n     they now claim they never had the ability to do. In fact, \n     when minority members of the Committee publicly asked that \n     Judge Starr be called as a witness, Judge Starr was called. \n     In fact, President Clinton's attorney and minority counsel \n     questioned Judge Starr for over two hours. Every Member of \n     the Committee questioned him for at least five minutes each. \n     Judge Starr was a witness, and he was cross-examined by David \n     Kendall, President Clinton's private attorney. President \n     Clinton's claims are just not accurate.\n       President Clinton's attorneys raise the issue of fairness. \n     They are entitled to their own opinion about the House's \n     proceedings, but they are not entitled to rewrite history. \n     The truth is that the Committee's subpoena power could have \n     been used to subpoena documents or witnesses on behalf of the \n     President if they had so requested. They did not. All they \n     requested, is that lawyers, law professors, and historians \n     testify before the Committee. In short, President Clinton's \n     statements about what happened in the House completely \n     misstate what occurred.\n\n                             VI. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons stated herein and in the Trial Memorandum \n     of the United States House of Representatives, the House \n     respectfully submits that the articles properly state \n     impeachable offenses, that the Senate should proceed to a \n     full trial on the articles, and that after trial, the Senate \n     should vote to convict President William Jefferson Clinton, \n     remove him from office, and disqualify him from holding \n     further office.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n\n     The United States\n     House of Representatives.\n\n     Henry J.

I would like to inform Members of the Senate and \nthe parties in this case of my need to stand on occasion to stretch my \nback. I have no intention that the proceedings should be in any way \ninterrupted when I do so.\n  The Presiding Officer notes the presence in the Senate Chamber of the \nmanagers on the part of the House of Representatives and counsel for \nthe President of the United States.\n  Pursuant to the provisions of Senate Resolution 16, the managers for \nthe House of Representatives have 24 hours to make the presentation of \ntheir case. The Senate will now hear you.\n  The Presiding Officer recognizes Mr. Manager Hyde to begin the \npresentation of the case for the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel for the \nPresident, and Senators.\n  We are brought together on this solemn and historic occasion to \nperform important duties assigned to us by the Constitution.\n  We want you to know how much we respect you and this institution and \nhow grateful we are for your guidance and your cooperation.\n  With your permission, we the managers of the House are here to set \nforth the evidence in support of two articles of impeachment against \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton. You are seated in this historic \nChamber not to embark on some great legislative debate, which these \nstately walls have so often witnessed, but to listen to the evidence, \nas those who must sit in judgment.\n  To guide you in this grave duty, you have taken an oath of \nimpartiality. With the simple words ``I do,'' you have pledged to put \naside personal bias and partisan interest and to do ``impartial \njustice.'' Your willingness to take up this calling has once again \nreminded the world of the unique brilliance of America's constitutional \nsystem of Government. We are here, Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished \nSenators, as advocates for the rule of law, for equal justice under the \nlaw and for the sanctity of the oath.\n  The oath. In many ways the case you will consider in the coming days \nis about those two words ``I do,'' pronounced at two Presidential \ninaugurations by a person whose spoken words have singular importance \nto our Nation and to the great globe itself.\n  More than 450 years ago, Sir Thomas More, former Lord Chancellor of \nEngland, was imprisoned in the Tower of London because he had, in the \nname of conscience, defied the absolute power of the King. As the \nplaywright Robert Bolt tells it, More was visited by his family, who \ntried to persuade him to speak the words of the oath that would save \nhis life, even while, in his mind and heart, he held firm to his \nconviction that the King was in error. More refused. As he told his \ndaughter, Margaret, ``When a man takes an oath, Meg, he's holding his \nown self in his hands. Like water. And if he opens his fingers then--he \nneedn't hope to find himself again . . .'' Sir Thomas More, the most \nbrilliant lawyer of his generation, a scholar with an international \nreputation, the center of a warm and affectionate family life which he \ncherished, went to his death rather than take an oath in vain.\n  Members of the Senate, what you do over the next few weeks will \nforever affect the meaning of those two words ``I do.'' You are now \nstewards of the oath. Its significance in public service and our \ncherished system of justice will never be the same after this. \nDepending on what you decide, it will either be strengthened in its \npower to achieve justice or it will go the way of so much of our moral \ninfrastructure and become a mere convention, full of sound and fury, \nsignifying nothing.\n  The House of Representatives has named myself and 12 other Members as \nManagers of its case. I have the honor of introducing those \ndistinguished Members and explaining how we will make our initial \npresentation. The gentleman from Wisconsin, Representative Jim \nSensenbrenner, will begin the presentation with an overview of the \ncase. Representative Sensenbrenner is the ranking Republican member of \nthe House Judiciary Committee, and has served for 20 years. In 1989, \nRepresentative Sensenbrenner was a House manager in the impeachment \ntrial of Judge Walter L. Nixon who was convicted on two articles of \nimpeachment for making false and misleading statements before a federal \ngrand jury.\n  Following Representative Sensenbrenner will be a team of managers who \nwill make a presentation of the relevant facts of this case. From the \nvery outset of this ordeal, there has been a great deal of speculation \nand misinformation about the facts. That has been unfortunate for \neveryone involved. We believe that a full presentation of the facts and \nthe law by the House managers--will be helpful.\n  Representative Ed Bryant, from Tennessee was a United States Attorney \nfrom the Western District of Tennessee. As a captain in the Army, \nRepresentative Bryant served in the Judge Advocate General Corps and \ntaught at the United States Military Academy at West Point. \nRepresentative Bryant will explain the background of the events that \nled to the illegal actions of the President. Following Representative \nBryant,  Representative Asa Hutchinson from Arkansas will give a \npresentation of the factual basis for article II, obstruction of \njustice. Representative Hutchinson is a former United States Attorney \nfor the Western District of Arkansas. Next, you will hear from \nRepresentative Jim Rogan of California. Representative Rogan is a \nformer California State judge and Los Angeles County Deputy District \nAttorney. Representative Rogan will give a presentation of the factual \nbasis for article I, grand jury perjury. This should conclude our \npresentation for today.\n\n  Tomorrow, Representative Bill McCollum of Florida will tie all of the \nfacts together and give a factual summation. Representative McCollum is\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\nthe Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, a former Naval Reserve \nCommander and member of the Judge Advocate General Corps.\n  Following the presentation of the facts, a team of managers will \npresent the law of perjury and the law of obstruction of justice and \nhow it applies to the articles of impeachment before you. While the \nSenate has made it clear that a crime is not essential to impeachment \nand removal from office, these managers will explain how egregious and \ncriminal the conduct alleged in the articles of impeachment is. This \nteam includes Representative George Gekas of Pennsylvania, \nRepresentative Steve Chabot of Ohio, Representative Bob Barr of \nGeorgia, and Representative Chris Cannon of Utah. Representative Gekas \nis the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative \nLaw. And in 1989, Representative Gekas served as a manager of the \nimpeachment trial of Judge Alcee Hastings who the Senate convicted on \neight articles for making false and misleading statements under oath \nand one article of conspiracy to engage in a bribery. Representative \nGekas is a former assistant district attorney. Representative Chabot \nserves on the Subcommittee on Crime and has experience as a criminal \ndefense lawyer. Representative Barr is a former United States Attorney \nfor the Northern District of Georgia, where he specialized in public \ncorruption. He also has experience as a criminal defense attorney. \nRepresentative Cannon has had experience as the Deputy Associate \nSolicitor General of the Department of the Interior and as a practicing \nattorney. That should conclude our presentation for Friday.\n  On Saturday, three managers will make a presentation on \nConstitutional law as it relates to this case. There has been a great \ndeal of argument about whether the conduct alleged in the articles \nrises to the level of removable offenses. This team's analysis of the \nprecedents of the Senate and application of the facts of this case will \nmake it clear that the Senate has established the conduct alleged in \nthe articles to be removable offenses. In this presentation you will \nhear from Representative Charles Canady of Florida, Representative \nSteve Buyer of Indiana and Representative Lindsey Graham of South \nCarolina. Representative Canady is the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution and one of the leading voices on constitutional law in \nthe House. Representative Buyer served in the United States Army as a \nmember of the Judge Advocate General Corps where he was assigned as \nSpecial Assistant to the United States Attorney in Virginia. He also \nserved as a deputy to the Indiana Attorney General. Representative \nGraham served in the Air Force as a member of the Judge Advocate \nGeneral Corps and as a South Carolina Assistant Attorney.\n  Following the presentation of the facts, the law of perjury and \nobstruction of justice and constitutional law, Mr. Rogan and myself \nwill give you a final summation and closing to our initial \npresentation.\n  Mr. Sensenbrenner.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Manager Sensenbrenner is recognized.\n  Mr. Manager SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel \nto the President, and Senators, in his third annual message to Congress \non December 7, 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt said:\n\n       No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we \n     ask any man's permission when we require him to obey it. \n     Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as a \n     favor.\n\n  We are here today because President William Jefferson Clinton decided \nto put himself above the law, not once, not twice, but repeatedly. He \nput himself above the law when he engaged in a multifaceted scheme to \nobstruct justice during the Federal civil rights case of Paula Corbin \nJones versus William Jefferson Clinton, et. al. He put himself above \nthe law when he made perjurious, false and misleading statements under \noath during his grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998. In both \ninstances, he unlawfully attempted to prevent the judicial branch of \nGovernment--a coequal branch--from performing its constitutional duty \nto administer equal justice under law.\n  The United States House of Representatives has determined that the \nPresident's false and misleading testimony to the grand jury and his \nobstruction of justice in the Jones lawsuit are high crimes and \nmisdemeanors within the meaning of the Constitution. Should the Senate \nconduct a fair and impartial trial which allows each side to present \nits best case, then the American public can be confident that justice \nhas been served, regardless of the outcome.\n  We hear much about how important the rule of law is to our Nation and \nto our system of government. Some have commented this expression is \ntrite. But, whether expressed by these three words, or others, the \nprimacy of law over the rule of individuals is what distinguishes the \nUnited States from most other countries and why our Constitution is as \nalive today as it was 210 years ago.\n  The Framers of the Constitution devised an elaborate system of checks \nand balances to ensure our liberties by making sure that no person, \ninstitution, or branch of Government became so powerful that a tyranny \ncould ever be established in the United States of America.\n  We are the trustees of that sacred legacy and whether the rule of law \nand faith in our Nation emerges stronger than ever, or are diminished \nirreparably, depends upon the collective decision of the message each \nSenator chooses to send forth in the days ahead.\n  The evidence you will hear relates solely to the President's \nmisconduct, which is contrary to his constitutional public \nresponsibility to ensure the laws be faithfully executed. It is not \nabout the President's affair with a subordinate employee, an affair \nthat was both inappropriate and immoral. Mr. Clinton has recognized \nthat this relationship was wrong. I give him credit for that. But he \nhas not owned up to the false testimony, the stonewalling and legal \nhairsplitting, and obstructing the courts from finding the truth. In \ndoing so, he has turned his affair into a public wrong. And for these \nactions, he must be held accountable through the only constitutional \nmeans the country has available--the difficult and painful process of \nimpeachment.\n  Impeachment is one of the checks the Framers gave to Congress to \nprotect the American people from a corrupt or tyrannical executive or \njudicial branch of Government. Because the procedure is cumbersome and \nbecause a two-thirds vote in the Senate is required to remove an \nofficial following an impeachment trial, safeguards are there to stop \nCongress from increasing its powers at the expense-of the other two \nbranches. The process is long. It is difficult. It is unpleasant. But, \nabove all, it is necessary to maintain the public's trust in the \nconduct of their elected officials--elected officials, such as myself \nand yourselves, who through our oaths of office have a duty to follow \nthe law, fulfill our constitutional responsibilities, and protect our \nRepublic from public wrongdoing.\n\n  The Framers of the Constitution envisioned a separate and distinct \nprocess in the House and in the Senate. They did not expect the House \nand Senate to conduct virtually identical proceedings with the only \ndifference being that conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds \nvote. That is why the Constitution reserves the sole power of \nimpeachment to the House of Representatives and the sole power to try \nall impeachments to the Senate. History demonstrates different \nprocesses were adopted to reflect very different roles.\n  In the case of President Andrew Johnson, no hearings were held or \nwitnesses called by the House on the President's decision to remove \nSecretary of War Stanton from office. The House first approved a \ngeneral article of impeachment that simply stated that President \nJohnson was impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors. Five days \nlater, a special House committee drew up specific articles. Eleven \narticles were passed by the House, all but two of which were based upon \nPresident Johnson's alleged violation of the Tenure of Office Act by \nhis actions in removing Secretary of War Stanton. The trial was then \nconducted with witnesses in the Senate.\n  In the case of President Nixon, the House Judiciary Committee passed \nthree articles of impeachment based not upon their own investigation, \nbut upon the evidence gathered by the Ervin Committee, the Patman \nCommittee, the Joint Tax Committee and\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\nmaterial from the special prosecutor and various court proceedings. \nNine witnesses were called at the end of the impeachment inquiry, five \nof them at the request of the White House, and their testimony was not \nat the center of the impeachment articles.\n  In the Judge Walter Nixon impeachment in 1989, a trial with live \nwitnesses was held even after the Senate rejected by less than a two-\nthirds vote a defense motion to dismiss one article of impeachment on \nthe grounds that it did not constitute an impeachable offense.\n  The House managers submit witnesses are essential to give heightened \ncredence to whatever judgment the Senate chooses to make on each of the \narticles of impeachment against President Clinton.\n  The matter of how this proceeding will be conducted remains somewhat \nunsettled. Senate impeachment precedent has been to hold a trial. And, \nin every impeachment case, the Senate has heard from live witnesses. \nShould the President's counsel dispute the facts as laid out by the \nHouse of Representatives, the Senate will need to hear from live \nwitnesses in order to reach a proper and fair judgment as to the \ntruthful facts of this case.\n  The House concluded the President made perjurious, false and \nmisleading statements before the grand jury, which the House believes \nconstitutes a high crime and misdemeanor. Our entire legal system is \nbased upon the courts being able to find the truth. That's why \nwitnesses must raise their right hand and swear to tell the truth, the \nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth. That's why there are criminal \npenalties for perjury and making false statements under oath. The need \nfor obtaining truthful testimony in court is so important that the \nFederal sentencing guidelines have the same penalties for perjury as \nfor bribery.\n  The Constitution specifically names bribery as an impeachable \noffense. Perjury is the twin brother of bribery. By making the penalty \nfor perjury the same as that for bribery, Congress has acknowledged \nthat both crimes are equally serious. It follows that perjury and \nmaking false statements under oath, which is a form of perjury, be \nconsidered among the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' the Framers \nintended to be grounds for impeachment.\n  The three judicial impeachments of the 1980's were all about lies \ntold by a federal judge. Judge Claiborne was removed from office for \nlying on his income tax returns. Judge Hastings was removed for lying \nunder oath during a trial, and Judge Nixon was removed for making false \nstatements to a grand jury. In each case, the Senate showed no leniency \nto judges who lie. Their misconduct was deemed impeachable and more \nthan 2/3rds of the Senate voted to convict.\n  If the Senate is convinced that President Clinton lied under oath and \ndoes not remove him from office, the wrong message is given to our \ncourts, those who have business before them, and to the country as a \nwhole. That terrible message is that we as a nation have set a lower \nstandard for lying under oath for Presidents than for judges. Should \nnot the leader of our country be held to at least as high a standard as \nthe judges he appoints? Should not the President be obliged to tell the \ntruth when under oath, just as every citizen must? Should not our laws \nbe enforced equally? Your decision in this proceeding will answer these \nquestions and set the standard of conduct of public officials in town \nhalls and courtrooms everywhere and the Oval Office for generations.\n  Justice is never served by the placing of any public official above \nthe law. The framers rejected the British law of, ``The King can do no \nwrong'', when they wrote our basic law in 1787. Any law is only as good \nas its enforcement, and the enforcement of the law against the \nPresident was left to Congress through the impeachment process.\n  A Senate conviction of the President in this matter will reaffirm the \nirrefutable fact that even the President of the United States has no \nlicense to lie under oath. Deceiving the courts is an offense against \nthe public. It prevents the courts from administering justice and \ncitizens from receiving justice. Every American has the right to go to \ncourt for redress of wrongs, as well as the right to a jury trial. The \njury finds the facts. The citizens on the jury cannot correctly find \nthe facts absent truthful testimony. That's why it's vital that the \nSenate protect the sanctity of the oath to obtain truthful testimony, \nnot just during judicial proceedings but also during legislative \nproceedings as well.\n  Witnesses before Congress, whether presidential nominees seeking \nSenate confirmation to high posts in the executive or judicial \nbranches, federal agency heads testifying during investigative \nhearings, or witnesses at legislative hearings giving their opinions on \nbills are sworn to tell the truth. Eroding the oath to tell the truth \nmeans that Congress loses some of its ability to base its decisions \nupon truthful testimony. Lowering the standard of the truthfulness of \nsworn testimony will create a cancer that will keep the legislative \nbranch from discharging its constitutional functions as well.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, we are here today because William Jefferson \nClinton decided to use all means possible--both legal and illegal--to \nsubvert the truth about his conduct relevant to the federal civil \nrights suit brought against President Clinton by Mrs. Paula Jones. \nDefendants in civil lawsuits cannot pick and choose which laws and \nrules of procedure they will follow and which they will not. That's for \nthe trial judge to decide, whether the defendant be President or \npauper.\n  In this case, a citizen claimed her civil rights were violated when \nshe refused then Governor Clinton's advances and was subsequently \nharassed at work, denied merit pay raises, and finally forced to quit. \nThe court ruled she had the right to obtain evidence showing other \nwomen including Miss Lewinsky, got jobs, promotions, and raises after \nsubmitting to Mr. Clinton, and whether other women suffered job \ndetriments after refusing similar advances.\n  When someone lies about an affair and tries to hide the fact, they \nviolate the trust their spouse and family put in them. But when they \nlie about it during a legal proceeding and obstruct the parties from \nobtaining evidence, they prevent the courts from administering justice.\n  That is an offense against the public, made even worse when a poor or \npowerless person seeks the protections of our civil rights from the \nrich or powerful.\n  When an American citizen claims his or her civil rights have been \nviolated, we must take those claims seriously. Our civil rights laws \nhave remade our society for the better. The law gives the same \nprotections to the child denied entry to a school or college based upon \nrace as to an employee claiming discrimination at work. Once a hole is \npunched in civil rights protections for some, those protections are not \nworth as much for all. Many in the Senate have spent their lives \nadvancing individual rights. Their successful efforts have made America \na better place. In my opinion, this is no time to abandon that \nstruggle--no matter the public mood or the political consequence.\n  Some have said that the false testimony given by the President \nrelating to sex should be excused, since as the argument goes, \n``Everyone lies about sex.'' I would ask the Senate to stop to think \nabout the consequences of adopting that attitude. Our sexual harassment \nlaws would become unenforceable since every sexual harassment lawsuit \nis about sex, and much of domestic violence litigation is at least \npartly about sex. If defendants in these types of suits are allowed to \nlie about sex, justice cannot be done, and many victims, mostly women, \nwill be denied justice.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, the House has adopted two articles of impeachment \nagainst President William Jefferson Clinton. Each meets the standard of \n``high crimes and misdemeanors'' and each is amply supported by the \nevidence.\n  Article 1 impeaches the President for ``perjurious, false and \nmisleading'' testimony during his August 17, 1998, appearance before a \ngrand jury of the United States in four areas.\n  First, the nature and details of his relationship with a subordinate \ngovernment employee.\n  Second, prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in a \nfederal civil rights action brought against him.\n  Third, prior false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney \nto make to a federal judge in that federal civil rights lawsuit.\n  Fourth, his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses \nand to\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\nimpede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action.\n  The evidence will clearly show that President Clinton's false \ntestimony to the grand jury was not a single or isolated instance which \ncould be excused as a mistake, but rather a comprehensive and \ncalculated plan to prevent the grand jury from getting the accurate \ntestimony in order to do its job. Furthermore, it is important to \ndispel the notion that the President's false testimony before the grand \njury simply relates to details of the relationship between President \nClinton and Miss Lewinsky. These charges only make up a small part of \nArticle 1. The fact is, the evidence will show that President Clinton \nmade numerous perjurious, false and misleading statements regarding his \nefforts to obstruct justice.\n  Before describing what the evidence in support of Article 1 shows, it \nis also important to clearly demonstrate that the Senate has already \ndecided that making false statements under oath to a federal grand jury \nis an impeachable offense.\n  The last impeachment decided by the Senate, that of United States \nDistrict Judge Walter L. Nixon, Jr., of the United States District \nCourt for the Southern District of Mississippi, involved the Judge's \nmaking false statements under oath to a federal grand jury, precisely \nthe same charges contained in Article 1 against President Clinton. \nFollowing an unanimous 417 to 0 vote in the House, the Senate conducted \na full trial and removed Judge Nixon from office on the two articles \ncharging false statements to a grand jury by votes of 89 to 8 and 78 to \n19. The Senate was clear that the specific misconduct, that is, making \nfalse statements to a grand jury, which was the basis for the Judge's \nimpeachment, warranted his removal from office and the Senate proceeded \nto do just that.\n  These votes, a little more than nine years ago on November 3, 1989, \nset a clear standard that lying to a grand jury is grounds for removal \nfrom office. To set a different standard in this trial is to say that \nthe standard for judicial truthfulness during grand jury testimony is \nhigher than that of presidential truthfulness.\n  That result would be absurd. The truth is the truth and a lie is a \nlie. There cannot be different levels of the truth for judges than for \npresidents.\n  The President's perjurious, false and misleading statements regarding \nhis relationship with Ms. Lewinsky began early in his grand jury \ntestimony. These statements included parts of the prepared statement \nthe President read at the beginning of his testimony. He referred or \nreverted to his statement at least 19 times during the course of his \ntestimony.\n  Further, the evidence will show the President made other false \nstatements to the grand jury regarding the nature and details of his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky at times when he did not refer to his \nprepared statement.\n  Second, the evidence will show that the President piled perjury upon \nperjury when he provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to \nthe grand jury concerning prior perjurious, false and misleading \ntestimony given in Ms. Paula Jones' case.\n  On two occasions, the President testified to the grand jury that his \ndeposition testimony was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but \nthe truth, and that he was required to give a complete answer to each \nquestion asked of him during the deposition. That means he brought to \nthe grand jury his untruthful answers to questions at the deposition.\n  Third, the evidence will show the President provided perjurious, \nfalse and misleading testimony to a Federal grand jury regarding his \nattorney's use of an affidavit he knew to be false during the \ndeposition in Ms. Paula Jones' case before Federal Judge Susan Webber \nWright.\n  The President denied that he even paid attention to Mr. Bennett's use \nof the affidavit. The evidence will show he made this denial because \nhis failure to stop his attorney from utilizing a false affidavit at a \ndeposition would constitute obstruction of justice. The evidence will \nalso show the President did not admit that Mr. Bennett's statement was \nfalse because to do so would be to admit that he had perjured himself \nearlier that day during the grand jury testimony, as well as at the \ndeposition.\n  Fourth, the evidence will show that the President provided \nperjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning \nhis corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to \nimpede the discovery of evidence in Ms. Paula Jones' civil rights \naction.\n  The evidence will show that these statements related to at least four \nareas:\n  First, his false statements relating to gifts exchanged between the \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky. The subpoena served on Ms. Lewinsky in the \nJones case required her to produce each and every gift she had received \nfrom the President. These gifts were not turned over as required by the \nsubpoena, but ended up under Ms. Betty Currie's bed in a sealed \ncontainer. The President denied under oath that he directed Ms. Currie \nto get the gifts, but the evidence will show that Ms. Currie did call \nMs. Lewinsky about them and that there was no reason for her doing so \nunless directed by the President.\n  Second, the President made perjurious, false and misleading \nstatements to the grand jury regarding his knowledge that the Lewinsky \naffidavit submitted at the deposition was untrue. The evidence will \nshow that the President testified falsely on this issue on at least \nthree separate occasions during his grand jury testimony. He also \nprovided false testimony on whether he encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to file \na false affidavit.\n  Third, the President made false and misleading statements to the \ngrand jury by reciting a false account of the facts regarding his \ninteractions with Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie, who was a potential \nwitness against him in Ms. Jones' case.\n\n  The record reflects the President tried to coach Ms. Currie to recite \ninaccurate answers to possible questions should she be called as a \nwitness. The evidence will show the President testified to the grand \njury that he was trying to figure out what the facts were, but in \nreality the conversation with Ms. Currie consisted of a number of very \nfalse and misleading statements.\n  Finally, the President made perjurious, false and misleading \nstatements to aides regarding his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. In \nhis grand jury testimony, the President tried to have it both ways on \nthis issue. He testified that his statements to aides were both true \nand misleading--true and misleading.\n  The evidence will show that he met with four aides who would later be \ncalled to testify before the grand jury. They included Mr. Sidney \nBlumenthal, Mr. John Podesta, Mr. Erskine Bowles, and Mr. Harold Ickes. \nEach of them related to the grand jury the untruths they had been told \nby the President. I have recited this long catalogue of false \nstatements to show that the President's false statements to the grand \njury were neither few in number nor isolated, but rather pervaded his \nentire testimony.\n  There can be no question that the President's false statements to the \ngrand jury were material to the subject of the inquiry. Grand juries \nare utilized to obtain sworn testimony from witnesses to determine \nwhether a crime has been committed. The Attorney General and the \nSpecial Division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit appointed an independent counsel pursuant to law \nand added areas of inquiry because they believed there was evidence \nthat the President may have committed crimes. Grand jury testimony \nrelevant to the criminal probe is always material to the issue of \nwhether someone has committed a crime.\n  Based upon the precedent in the Judge Nixon impeachment, the law, the \nfacts, and the evidence, if you find the President made perjurious, \nfalse and misleading statements under oath to the grand jury, I \nrespectfully submit that your duty will be to find William Jefferson \nClinton guilty with respect to article I and to remove him from office.\n  Article II impeaches William Jefferson Clinton for preventing, \nobstructing and impeding the administration of justice in the Jones \ncase by either directly or through subordinates and agents engaging in \na scheme to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the existence of \nevidence and testimony relating to Ms. Jones' Federal civil rights \naction.\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\n  As in the case of article I, the President's direct and indirect \nactions were not isolated mistakes, but were multifaceted actions \nspecifically designed to prevent Ms. Paula Jones from having her day in \ncourt.\n  While the Senate determined in the Judge Nixon trial that the making \nof false statements to a Federal grand jury warranted conviction and \nremoval from office, no impeachment on an obstruction of justice charge \nhas ever reached the Senate.\n  Therefore, this article is a matter of first impression. However, the \nimpeachment inquiry of the House Judiciary Committee into the conduct \nof President Richard Nixon, as well as the relevant Federal criminal \nstatutes, clearly show President Clinton's actions to be within the \ndefinition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' contained in the \nConstitution.\n\n  The first article of impeachment against President Nixon approved by \nthe Judiciary Committee charged Mr. Nixon with ``engag(ing) personally \nand through his subordinates and agents in a course of conduct or plan \ndesigned to delay, impede and obstruct the investigation of such \nunlawful entry; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible and \nto conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful activities.''\n  The article charged that the implementation of the plan included nine \nseparate areas of misconduct. Included among these were, one, making or \ncausing to be made false and misleading statements to investigative \nofficers and employees of the United States; two, withholding relevant \nand material evidence from such persons; three, approving, condoning, \nacquiescing in and counseling witnesses with respect to the giving of \nfalse and misleading statements to such persons as well as in judicial \nand congressional proceedings.\n  History shows us that President Nixon's resignation was the only act \nthat prevented the Senate from voting on this article, and that the \nPresident's conviction and removal from office were all but certain.\n  There are two sections of the Federal Criminal Code placing penalties \non those who obstruct justice. Title 18, United States Code, section \n1503, punishes ``(whoever * * * corruptly, or by threats or force * * * \nobstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct or impede the \ndue administration of justice.''\n  The courts have held that this section relates to pending judicial \nprocess, which can be a civil action. Ms. Jones' case fits that \ndefinition at the time of the President's actions as alleged in article \nII, as does the Office of Independent Counsel's investigation.\n  Title 18, United States Code, section 1512, punishes, ``Whoever * * * \ncorruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in \nmisleading conduct toward another person, with intent to * * * \ninfluence, delay or prevent the testimony of any person in an official \nproceeding * * * (or) cause or induce any person to * * * withhold \ntestimony, or withhold a record, document, or other object from an \nofficial proceeding * * *.''\n  The evidence will show that President Clinton's actions constituted \nobstruction of justice in seven specific instances as alleged in \nArticle II. Paragraph one alleges that on or about December 17, 1997, \nthe President encouraged Miss Lewinsky, who would be subpoenaed as a \nwitness in Mrs. Jones' case two days later, to execute a sworn \naffidavit that he knew would be perjurious, false, and misleading.\n  The evidence will show the President's actions violated both federal \ncriminal obstruction statutes.\n  Second, Article II alleges that on or about that same day, the \nPresident corruptly encouraged Miss Lewinsky to give perjurious, false, \nand misleading testimony if and when called to testify personally in \nthat proceeding. Miss Lewinsky, on the witness list at that time, could \nhave been expected to be required to give live testimony in the Jones \ncase and in fact she was subsequently subpoenaed for a deposition in \nthat case.\n  The evidence will show the President's actions violated both federal \ncriminal obstruction statutes.\n  Third, Article II alleges on or about December 28, 1997, the \nPresident corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to \nconceal evidence which had been subpoenaed in Mrs. Jones' civil rights \ncase. He did so by asking Ms. Betty Currie to retrieve evidence from \nMiss Lewinsky that had been subpoenaed in the case of Jones v. Clinton.\n  The evidence will show the President's actions violated the second \nfederal criminal obstruction statute.\n  Fourth, Article II alleges that beginning on or about December 7, \n1997, and continuing through and including January 14, 1998, the \nPresident intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job \nassistance to Miss Lewinsky in order to corruptly prevent her truthful \ntestimony in the Jones case at a time when her truthful testimony would \nhave been harmful to him.\n  While Miss Lewinsky had sought employment in New York City long \nbefore the dates in question, helping her find a suitable job was \nclearly a low priority for the President and his associates until it \nbecame obvious she would become a witness in the Jones case. The \nevidence will clearly show an intensification of that effort after her \nname appeared on the witness list. This effort was ultimately \nsuccessful and the evidence will show that the President's actions \nviolated both federal obstruction statutes.\n  Fifth, Article II alleges on January 17, 1998, the President \ncorruptly allowed his attorney to make false and misleading statements \nto Judge Wright characterizing the Lewinsky affidavit in order to \nprevent questioning deemed relevant by the judge. The President's \nattorney, Robert Bennett, subsequently acknowledged such false and \nmisleading statements in a communication to Judge Wright.\n  The evidence will show the President's actions clearly violate the \nsecond federal criminal obstruction statute.\n  Sixth, Article II alleges that on or about January 18, 20, and 21, \n1998, the President related a false and misleading account of events \nrelevant to Mrs. Jones' civil rights suit to Ms. Betty Currie, a \npotential witness in the proceeding, in order to corruptly influence \nher testimony.\n  The evidence will show that President Clinton attempted to influence \nthe testimony of Ms. Betty Currie, his personal secretary, by coaching \nher to recite inaccurate answers to possible questions that might be \nasked of her if called to testify in Mrs. Paula Jones' case. The \nPresident did this shortly after he had been deposed in the civil \naction.\n  During the deposition, he frequently referred to Ms. Currie and it \nwas logical that based upon his testimony, Ms. Currie would be called \nas a witness.\n  The evidence will show that two hours after the completion of the \ndeposition, the President called Ms. Currie to ask her to come to the \noffice the next day, which was a Sunday.\n  When Ms. Currie testified to the grand jury, she acknowledged the \nPresident made a series of leading statements or questions and \nconcluded that the President wanted her to agree with him.\n  The evidence will show the President's actions violated both \nstatutes, but most particularly section 1512.\n  In United States v. Rodolitz 786 F2d 77 at 82 (2nd Cir 1986) cert. \nDen. 479 US 826 (1986), the United States Court of Appeals for the 2nd \nCircuit said,\n\n       The most obvious example of a sec. 1512 violation may be \n     the situation where a defendant tells a potential witness a \n     false story as if the story were true, intending that the \n     witness believes the story and testify to it before the grand \n     jury.\n\n  If the President's actions do not fit this example, I'm at a loss to \nknow what actions do.\n  Seventh, and last, Article II alleges on or about January 21, 23, and \n26, 1998, the President made false and misleading statements to \npotential witnesses in a federal grand jury proceeding in order to \ncorruptly influence this testimony of those witnesses. The articles \nfurther alleges these false and misleading statements were repeated by \nthe witnesses to the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive \nfalse and misleading information.\n  The evidence will show that these statements were made to \npresidential aides Mr. Sidney Blumenthal, Mr. Erskine Bowles, Mr. John \nPodesta and Mr. Harold Ickes. They all testified to the grand jury. By \nhis own admission seven months later, on August 17, 1998, during his \nsworn grand jury testimony, the President said that he told a number of \naides that he did not have an affair with Ms. Lewinsky and did not\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\nhave sex with her. He told one aide, Mr. Sidney Blumenthal, that Miss \nMonica Lewinsky came on to him and he rebuffed her. President Clinton \nalso admitted that he knew these aides might be called before the grand \njury as witnesses. The evidence will show they were called; they \nrelated the President's false statements to the grand jury; and that by \nthe time the President made his admission to the grand jury, the damage \nhad already been done.\n  This is a classic violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1512.\n  The seven specific, allegations of obstruction of justice contained \nin Article II were designed to prevent the judicial branch of \ngovernment, a separate and coequal branch, from doing its work in Ms. \nPaula Jones' lawsuit. Based upon the allegation of Article 1 against \nPresident Nixon in 1974, as well as repeated and calculated violations \nof two key criminal obstruction statutes, William Jefferson Clinton \ncommitted an impeachable offense.\n  In Article II, the evidence is conclusive that President Clinton put \nhimself above the law in obstructing justice, not once, not just a few \ntimes, but as a part of a extensive scheme to prevent Ms. Jones from \nobtaining the evidence she thought she needed to prove her civil rights \nclaims.\n  Complying with the law is the duty of all parties to lawsuits and \nthose who are required to give truthful testimony. A defendant in a \nfederal civil rights action does not have the luxury to choose what \nevidence the court may consider. He must abide by the law and the rules \nof procedure. William Jefferson Clinton tried to say that the law did \nnot apply to him during his term of office in civil cases were \nconcerned. He properly lost that argument in the Supreme Court in a \nunanimous decision.\n  Even though the Supreme Court decided that the President wasn't above \nthe law and that Ms. Jones' case could proceed, William Jefferson \nClinton decided--and decided alone--to act as if the Supreme Court had \nnever acted and that Judge Wright's orders didn't apply to him. What he \ndid was criminal time and time again. These criminal acts were in \ndirect conflict with the President's obligation to take care the laws \nbe faithfully executed.\n  Based upon the repeated violations of federal criminal law, its \neffect upon the courts to find the truth, and the President's duty to \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed, if you find that the \nPresident did indeed obstruct the administration of justice through his \nacts, I respectfully submit your duty will be to find William Jefferson \nClinton guilty with respect to Article II and to remove him from \noffice.\n  It is truly sad when the leader of the greatest nation in the world \ngets caught up in a series of events where one inappropriate and \ncriminal act leads to another, and another and another.\n  Even sadder is that the President himself could have stopped this \nprocess simply by telling the truth and accepting the consequences of \nhis prior mistakes. At least six times since December 17, 1997, William \nJefferson Clinton could have told the truth and suffered the \nconsequences. Instead he chose lies, perjury, and deception. He could \nhave told the truth when he first learned that Ms. Lewinsky would be a \nwitness in the Ms. Jones' case. He could have told the truth at his \ncivil deposition. He could have told the truth to Betty Currie. He \ncould have told the truth when the news media first broke the story of \nhis affair. He could have told the truth to his aides and cabinet. He \ncould have told the truth to the American people. Instead, he shook his \nfinger at each and every American and said, ``I want you to listen to \nme,'' and proceeded to tell a straight-faced lie to the American \npeople. Finally, he had one more opportunity to tell the truth. He \ncould have told the truth to the grand jury. Had he told the truth last \nJanuary, there would have been no independent counsel investigation of \nthis matter, no grand jury appearance, no impeachment inquiry and no \nHouse approval of articles of impeachment. And, we would not be here \ntoday fulfilling a painful but essential constitutional duty. Instead, \nhe chose lies and deception, despite warnings from friends, aides, and \nmembers of the House and Senate that failure to tell the truth would \nhave grave consequences.\n  When the case against him was being heard by the House Judiciary \nCommittee, he sent his lawyers, who did not present any new evidence to \nrebut the facts and evidence sent to the House by the Independent \nCounsel. Rather, they disputed the Committee's interpretation of the \nevidence by relying on tortured, convoluted, and unreasonable \ninterpretations of the President's words and actions.\n  During his presentation to the House Judiciary Committee, the \nPresident's very able lawyer, Charles Ruff, was asked directly, ``Did \nthe President lie?'' during his sworn grand jury testimony.\n  Mr. Ruff could have answered that question directly. He did not, and \nhis failure to do so speaks a thousand words.\n  Is there not something sacred when a witness in a judicial proceeding \nraises his or her right hand and swears before God and the public to \ntell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Do we want \nto tell the country that its leader gets a pass when he is required to \ngive testimony under oath? Should we not be concerned about the effect \nof allowing perjurious, false, and misleading statements by the \nPresident to go unpunished on the truthfulness of anyone's testimony in \nfuture judicial or legislative proceedings? What do we tell the \napproximately 115 people now in federal prison for the crime of \nperjury?\n  The answers to all these questions ought to be obvious.\n  As elected officials, our opinions are frequently shaped by \nconstituents telling us their own stories. Let me tell you one related \nto me about the poisonous results of allowing false statements under \noath to go unpunished.\n  Last October while the Starr report was being hotly debated, one \ncircuit court judge for Dodge County, Wisconsin approached me on the \nstreet in Mayville, Wisconsin. He said that some citizens had business \nin his court and suggested that one of them take the witness stand and \nbe put under oath to tell the truth. The citizen then asked if he could \ntell the truth, ``just like the President.''\n  How many people who have to come to court to testify under oath about \nmatters they would like to keep to themselves think about what that \ncitizen asked Judge John Storck? And, how will the courts be able to \nadminister the, ``equal justice under law'' we all hold so dear if we \ndo not enforce the sanctity of that oath even against the President of \nthe United States?\n  When each of us is elected or chosen to serve in public office, we \nmake a compact with the people of the United States of America to \nconduct ourselves in an honorable manner, hopefully setting a higher \nstandard for ourselves than we expect of others. That should mean we \nare careful to obey all the laws we make, execute and interpret.\n\n  There is more than truth in the words, ``A public office is a public \ntrust.''\n  When someone breaks that trust, he or she must be held accountable \nand suffer the consequences for the breach. If there is no \naccountability, that means that a President can set himself above the \nlaw for four years, a Senator for six, a Representative for two, and a \njudge for life. that, Mr. Chief Justice, poses a far greater threat to \nthe liberties guaranteed to the American people by the Constitution \nthat anything imaginable.\n  For the past 11 months, the toughest questions I've had to answer \nhave come from parents who want to know what to tell their children \nabout what President Clinton did.\n  Every parent tries to teach their children to know the difference \nbetween right and wrong, to always tell the truth, and when they make \nmistakes, to take responsibility for them and to face the consequences \nof their actions.\n  President Clinton's actions at every step since he knew Ms. Lewinsky \nwould be a witness in Mrs. Jones' case have been completely opposite to \nthe values parents hope to teach their children.\n  But being a poor example isn't grounds for impeachment. Undermining \nthe rule of law is. Frustrating the courts' ability to administer \njustice turns private misconduct into an attack upon the ability of one \nof the three branches of our government to impartially administer \njustice. This is a direct attack upon the rule of law in our country \nand a very public wrong\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nthat goes to the constitutional workings of our government and its \nability to protect the civil rights of even the weakest American.\n  What is on trial here is the truth and the rule of law. Failure to \nbring President Clinton to account for his serial lying under oath and \npreventing the courts from administering equal justice under law will \ncause a cancer to be present in our society for generations.\n  Those parents who have asked the questions should be able to tell \ntheir children that even if you are the President of the United States, \nif you lie when sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing \nbut the truth, you will face the consequences of that action even when \nyou won't accept the responsibility for it.\n  How those parents will answer those questions is up to the United \nStates Senate.\n  While how today's parents answer those questions is important, \nequally important is what parents tell their children in the \ngenerations to come about the history of our country and what has set \nour government in the United States of America apart from the rest of \nthe world.\n  Above the President's dais in this Senate chamber appears our \nnational motto. ``E pluribus unum''--``out of many, one.'' When that \nmotto was adopted more than two hundred years ago, the First Congress \nreferred to how thirteen separate colonies turned themselves into one, \nunited nation.\n  As the decades have gone by, that motto has taken an additional \nmeaning. People of all nationalities, faiths, creeds, and values have \ncome to our shores, shed their allegiances to their old countries and \nachieved their dreams to become Americans.\n  They came here to flee religious persecution, to escape corrupt, \ntyrannical and oppressive governments, and to leave behind the economic \nstagnation and endless wars of their homelands.\n  They came here to be able to practice their faiths as they saw fit--\nfree of government dictates and to be able to provide better lives for \nthemselves and their families by the sweat of their own brows and the \nuse of their own intellect.\n  But they also came here because they knew America has a system of \ngovernment where the Constitution and laws protect individual liberties \nand human rights. Everyone--yes, everyone--can argue that this country \nhas been a beacon for individual citizen's ability to be what he or she \ncan be.\n  They fled countries where the rulers ruled at the expense of the \npeople, to America, where the leaders are expected to govern for the \nbenefit of the people.\n  And, throughout the years, America's leaders have tried to earn the \ntrust of the American people, not by their words, but by their actions.\n  America is a place where government exists by the consent of the \ngoverned. And, that means our Nation's leaders must earn and re-earn \nthe trust of the people with every thing they do.\n  Whenever an elected official stumbles, that trust is eroded and \npublic cynicism goes up. The more cynicism that exists about \ngovernment, its institutions, and those chosen to serve in them, the \nmore difficult the job is for those who are serving.\n  That's why it is important, yes vital, that when a cancer exists in \nthe body politic, our job--our duty--is to excise it. If we fail in our \nduty, I fear the difficult and dedicated work done by thousands of \nhonorable men and women elected to serve not just here in Washington, \nbut in our State capitals, city halls, courthouses and school board \nrooms will be swept away in a sea of public cynicism. We must not allow \nthe beacon of America to grow dim, or the American dream to disappear \nwith each waking morning.\n  In 1974, the Congress did its painful public duty when the President \nof the United States broke the public trust.\n  During the last decade, both Houses impeached and removed three \nFederal judges who broke their trust with the people.\n  During the last 10 years, the House of Representatives disciplined \ntwo Speakers for breaking the rules and their trust with the public.\n  And, less than 6 years ago, this honorable Senate did the same to a \nsenior Senator whose accomplishments were widely praised.\n  In each case, Congress did the right thing to help restore the vital \ntrust upon which our Government depends. It wasn't easy, nor was it \nalways popular, but Congress did the right thing. Now, this honorable \nSenate must do the right thing. It must listen to the evidence; it must \ndetermine whether William Jefferson Clinton repeatedly broke our \ncriminal laws and thus broke his trust with the people--a trust \ncontained in the Presidential oath put into the Constitution by the \nFramers--an oath that no other Federal official must take--an oath to \ninsure that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  How the Senate decides the issues to be presented in this trial will \ndetermine the legacy we pass to future generations of Americans.\n  The Senate can follow the legacy of those who have made America what \nit is.\n  The Senate can follow the legacy of those who put their ``lives, \nfortunes and Sacred Honor'' on the line when they signed the \nDeclaration of Independence.\n  The Senate can follow the legacy of the Framers of the Constitution \nwhose preamble states that one of its purposes is, ``to establish \njustice.''\n  The Senate can follow the legacy of James Madison and the Members of \nthe First Congress who wrote and passed a Bill of Rights to protect and \npreserve the liberties of the American people.\n  The Senate can follow the legacy of those who achieved equal rights \nfor all Americans during the 1960s in Congress, in the courts, and on \nthe streets and in the buses and at the lunch counters.\n  The Senate can follow the legacy of those who brought President Nixon \nto justice during Watergate in the belief that no President can place \nhimself above the law.\n  The Senate can follow the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt who lived and \ngoverned by the principle that no man is above the law.\n  Within the walls of the Capitol and throughout this great country \nthere rages an impassioned and divisive debate over the future of this \npresidency. This Senate now finds itself in the midst of the tempest. \nAn already immense and agonizing duty is made even more so because the \nwhims of public opinion polls, the popularity and unpopularity of \nindividuals, even questions over the strength of our economy, risk \nsubsuming the true nature of this grave and unwelcome task.\n  We have all anguished over the sequence of events that have led us to \nthis, the conclusive stage in the process. We have all identified in \nour own minds where it could have, and should have stopped. But we have \nended up here, before the Senate of the United States, where you, the \nSenators, will have to render judgment based upon the facts.\n  A scientist in search of the basic nature of a substance begins by \nboiling away what is not of the essence. Similarly, the Senate will \nsift through the layers of debris that shroud the truth. The residue of \nthis painful and divisive process is bitter, even poisonous at times. \nBut beneath it lies the answer. The evidence will show that at its \ncore, the question over the President's guilt and the need for his \nconviction will be clear. Because at its core, the issues involved are \nbasic questions of right versus wrong--deceptive, criminal behavior \nversus honesty, integrity and respect for the law.\n  The President engaged in a conspiracy of crimes to prevent justice \nfrom being served. These are impeachable offenses for which the \nPresident should be convicted. Over the course of the days and weeks to \ncome, we, the House managers, will endeavor to make this case.\n  May these proceedings be fair and thorough. May they embody our \nhighest capacity for truth and mutual respect. With these principles as \nour guides, we can begin with the full knowledge our democracy will \nprevail and that our Nation will emerge a stronger, better place.\n  Our legacy now must be not to lose the trust the people should have \nin our Nation's leaders.\n  Our legacy now must be not to cheapen the legacies left by our \nforebearers.\n  Our legacy must be to do the right thing based upon the evidence.\n  For the sake of our country, the Senate must not fail. Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Bryant.\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, and my \ndistinguished colleagues from the bar, I am Ed Bryant, the \nRepresentative from the Seventh District of Tennessee. During this \nportion of the case, I, along with Representative Asa Hutchinson of \nArkansas, Representative James Rogan of California, and Representative \nBill McCollum of Florida, will present the factual elements of this \ncase. Our presentation is a very broad roadmap with which first I will \nprovide the history and background of the parties, followed by Mr. \nHutchinson and Mr. Rogan, who will review the articles of impeachment. \nMr. McCollum will close with a summation of these facts and evidence.\n  It is our intent to proceed in a chronological fashion, although by \nnecessity, there will be some overlap of the facts and circumstances \narising from what I have called ``the four-way intersection collision'' \nof President William Jefferson Clinton, Ms. Paula Corbin Jones, Monica \nLewinsky, and the U.S. Constitution.\n  As a further preface to my remarks, permit me to say that none of us \npresent here today in these hallowed Chambers relishes doing this job \nbefore us. But we did not choose to be involved in that reckless \nmisconduct, nor did we make those reasoned and calculated decisions to \ncover up that misconduct which underlies this proceeding. However, this \ncollision at the intersection, if you will, of the President, Ms. \nJones, and Ms. Lewinsky, is not in and of itself enough to bring us \ntogether today. No. Had truth been a witness at this collision, and \nprevailed, we would not be here. But when it was not present, even \nunder an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the \ntruth in a judicial matter, the impact of our Constitution must be \nfelt. Hence, we are together today--to do our respective duties.\n\n  By voting these articles of impeachment, the House is not attempting \nto raise the standard of conduct to perfection for our political \nleadership. Such a person does not walk the world today. Everyone falls \nshort of this mark everyday.\n  But political life is not so much about how an individual fails, but \nrather how the person reacts to that failure. For example, a person \ncampaigning for a political office admits wrongdoing in his past and \nsays he will not do that again. Most people accept that commitment. He \nis elected. Thereafter, he repeats this wrongdoing and is confronted \nagain. What does he do? He takes steps to cover up this wrongdoing by \nusing his workers and his friends. He lies under oath in a lawsuit \nwhich is very important to the person he is alleged to have harmed. He \nthen takes a political poll as to whether he should tell the truth \nunder oath. The poll indicates the voters would not forgive him for \nlying under oath. So he then denies the truth in a Federal grand jury. \nIf this person is the President of the United States, the House of \nRepresentatives would consider articles of impeachment. It did and \nvoted to impeach this President.\n  But do not let it be argued in these chambers that ``We are not \nelecting Saints, we are electing Presidents.'' Rather, let it be said \nthat we are electing people who are imperfect and who have made \nmistakes in life, but who are willing to so respect this country and \nthe Office of the President that he or she will now lay aside their own \npersonal shortcomings and have the inner strength to discipline \nthemselves sufficiently that they do not break the law which they \nthemselves are sworn to uphold.\n  Every trial must have a beginning and this trial begins on a cold day \nin January 1993.\n  [Video presentation.]\n  Mr. Manager Bryant. I had expected a video portion, but all of you \nheard the audio portion. As you can hear from the audio portion--\nperhaps some of you can see--William Jefferson Clinton, placed his left \nhand on the Bible in front of his wife, the Chief Justice and every \nAmerican watching that day and affirmatively acknowledged his oath of \noffice. On that every day and again in January of 1997, the President \njoined a privileged few. He became only the 42nd person in our Nation \nto make the commitment to ``faithfully execute'' the office of the \nPresident and to ``preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.'' He \nhas the complete executive power of the Nation vested in him by virtue \nof this Constitution.\n  As we progress throughout the day, I would ask that you be reminded \nof the importance of this oath. Before you is a copy of it and \ncertainly available as anyone would like to look at it on breaks.\n  William Jefferson Clinton is a man of great distinction. He is well-\neducated with degrees from Georgetown University and Yale Law School. \nHe has taught law school courses to aspiring young lawyers. He served \nas Governor and Attorney General for the State of Arkansas, enforcing \nthe laws of that state. The President now directs our great Nation. He \nsets our agenda and creates national policy in a very public way--he is \nin fact a role model for many.\n  President Clinton also serves as the Nation's chief law enforcement \nofficer.\n  It is primarily in this capacity that the President appoints Federal \njudges. Within the executive branch, he selected Attorney General Janet \nReno and appointed each of the 93 United States Attorneys who are \ncharged with enforcing all Federal, civil and criminal law in Federal \ncourthouses from Anchorage, Alaska to Miami, Florida and from San \nDiego, California to Bangor, Maine.\n  Before you we have another chart which shows the schematics of the \nDepartment of Justice and how it is under the direct control of the \nPresident through his Cabinet, Attorney General and then down to such \nfunctions as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, Immigration, U.S. Marshals Office, Bureau of Prisons \nand so many other very important legal functions this Federal \nGovernment performs.\n  As protectors of our Constitution, the U.S. Attorneys and their \nassistants prosecute more than 50,000 cases per year.\n  Through these appointments and his administration's policies, the \nPresident establishes the climate in this country for law and order. \nEach and every one of these 50,000 cases handled by his United States \nAttorneys is dependent upon the parties and witnesses telling the truth \nunder oath. Equally as important in these proceedings is that justice \nnot be obstructed by tampering with witnesses nor hiding evidence.\n  Quoting from the November 9, 1998 Constitution Subcommittee testimony \nof attorney Charles J. Cooper, a Washington, DC attorney, he states:\n\n       The crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice, like the \n     crimes of treason and bribery, are quintessentially offenses \n     against our system of government, visiting injury immediately \n     upon society itself, whether or not committed in connection \n     with the exercise of official government powers. Before the \n     framing of our Constitution and since, our law has \n     consistently recognized that perjury primarily and directly \n     injures the body politic, for it subverts the judicial \n     process and this strikes at the heart of the rule of law \n     itself.\n\n  Professor Gary McDowell, the Director at the Institute for United \nStates Studies at the University of London, also testified in the same \nhearing in reference to the influential writer William Paley, and this \nis also in chart form for those who would like review it later. Paley \nsaw the issue of oaths and perjury as one of morality as well as law. \nBecause a witness swears that he will speak the truth, the whole truth \nand nothing but the truth, a person under oath cannot cleverly lie and \nnot commit perjury. If the witness conceals any truth, Paley writes, \nthat relates to the matter in adjudication, that is as much a violation \nof the oath, as to testify a positive falsehood. Shame or embarrassment \ncannot justify his concealment of truth, linguistic contortions with \nthe words used cannot legitimately conceal a lie, or if under oath, \nperjury.\n  Professor McDowell concludes with a quote from Paley which accurately \nprovides, I believe the essence of a lie or perjurious statement. ``It \nis willful deceit that makes the lie; and we willfully deceive, where \nour expressions are not true in the sense in which we believe the \nhearer apprehends them.''\n  Neither has this United States Senate been silent on the issue of \nperjury. You have rightfully recognized through previous impeachment \nproceedings the unacceptable nature of a high government official lying \nunder oath, even in matters initially arising from what some would \nargue here are merely personal. In 1989, many of you present\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\ntoday, using the very same standard which is section 4 of the \nConstitution, which is set forth there, for impeaching a federal judge \nor the President, many of you actually voted in support of a conviction \nand the removal of a U.S. District judge under oath.\n  Indeed, truth-telling is the single most important judicial precept \nunderpinning this great system of justice we have, a system which \npermits the courthouse doors to be open to all people, from the most \npowerful man in America to a young woman from Arkansas.\n  On May 6, 1994, Paula Corbin Jones attempted to open that courthouse \ndoor when she filed a Federal sexual harassment lawsuit against \nPresident Clinton. The case arose from a 1991 incident when she was a \nState employee and he was the Governor. Further details of the \nunderlying allegations are not important to us today, but Ms. Jones' \npursuit for the truth is worth a careful study.\n  The parties first litigated the question of whether Ms. Jones' \nlawsuit would have to be deferred until after the President left \noffice. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the President's \ncontention and allowed the case to proceed without further delay.\n  Ms. Jones sought and, appropriately, won ``her day in court.'' \nIncumbent with this victory, however, was the reasonable expectation \nthat President Clinton would tell the truth.\n  After all, this was the most important case in the whole world to \nPaula Corbin Jones.\n  Notwithstanding this, that fact didn't happen, that the President \ntold the truth. Even after the President was ordered to stand trial, \npursuing the truth for Ms. Jones remained an elusive task. The evidence \nwill indicate that President Clinton committed perjury and orchestrated \na variety of efforts to obstruct justice, all of which--all of which--\nhad the effect of preventing the discovery of truth in the Paula Jones \ncase.\n  During the discovery phase, Judge Susan Webber Wright of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District Court of Arkansas ordered the \nPresident to answer certain historical questions about his sexual \nrelations with either State or Federal employees.\n  In part, Judge Wright said:\n\n       The Court finds, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled \n     to information regarding any individuals with whom the \n     President had sexual relations or proposed or sought to have \n     sexual relations and who were during the relevant time frame \n     state or federal employees.\n\n  Judge Wright validated Ms. Jones' right to use this accepted line of \nquestioning in sexual harassment litigation. More often than not, these \ncases involve situations where ``he said/she said,'' and they produce \nissues of credibility and are often done in private. Because of this, \nthey are really difficult for a victim to prove.\n  Such standard questions are essential in establishing whether the \ndefendant has committed the same kind of acts before or since--in other \nwords, a pattern or practice of harassing conduct. The existence of \nsuch corroborative evidence, or the lack thereof, is likely to be \ncritical in these types of cases. Both the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission guidelines and the Federal Rules of Evidence permit this \ntype of evidence. In short, a defendant's sexual history, at least with \nrespect to other employees, is ordinarily discoverable in a sexual \nharassment lawsuit.\n  To not expect a defendant in this type of litigation to speak the \ntruth creates, in its worst case, a very real danger to the entire area \nof sexual harassment law which would be irreparably damaged and, in its \nbest case, sends out a very wrong message. As such, the will and intent \nof Congress with regard to providing protection against sexual \nharassment in the workplace would be effectively undermined.\n  The ``pattern and practice'' witnesses whom Paula Corbin Jones was \nentitled to discover should have included the name of Monica Lewinsky. \nBut before I discuss the Ms. Lewinsky matter, I want to offer three \nmatters of cause to each of you as jurors in this very important \nmatter.\n  No. 1, I do not intend to discuss the specific details of the \nPresident's encounters with Ms. Lewinsky. However, I do not want to \ngive the Senate the impression that those encounters are irrelevant or \nlack serious legal implications. In fact, every day in the courtrooms \nall across America, victims of sexual harassment, of rape, assault, and \nabuse must testify, in many public cases, in order to vindicate their \npersonal rights and society's right to be free of these intolerable \nacts.\n  The President's lies about his conduct in the Oval Office with Ms. \nLewinsky also make these unseemly details highly relevant. If you are \nto accept the President's version about the relationship, you must in \neffect say to Ms. Lewinsky that she is the one who is disregarding the \ntruth. But beyond this, his denials also directly contradict Ms. \nLewinsky's testimony, not only directly contradict Ms. Lewinsky's \ntestimony, but also contradict eight of her friends and the statements \nby two professional counselors with whom she contemporaneously shared \ndetails of her relationship. By law, their testimony may serve as \nproper and admissible evidence to corroborate her side of this \nimportant story.\n  No. 2, the evidence and testimony in this proceeding must be viewed \nas a whole; it cannot be compartmentalized. Please do not be misled \ninto considering each event in isolation and then treating it \nseparately. Remember, events and words that may seem innocent or even \nexculpatory in a vacuum may well take on a sinister or even criminal \nconnotation when observed in the context of the whole plot.\n  For example, we all agree that Ms. Lewinsky testified, ``No one ever \ntold me to lie . . .'' When considered alone, this statement would seem \nexculpatory. In the context of other evidence, however, we see that \nthis one statement gives a misleading inference. Of course no one said, \n``Now, Monica, you go down there and lie.'' They didn't have to. Based \nupon their previous spoken and even unspoken words, Ms. Lewinsky knew \nwhat was expected of her. Surely, if the President were to come on to \nthe Senate floor and give testimony during this proceeding, he would \nnot tell you that he honestly expected her to tell the truth about \ntheir personal relationship. After all, the purpose of her filing the \nfalse affidavit was to avoid testifying in the Jones case and \ndiscussing the nature of their relationship. If she had told the truth \nin that affidavit, instead of lying, she would have been invited to \ntestify immediately, if not sooner.\n  No. 3, throughout our presentation of the facts, especially as it \nrelates to the various illegal acts, I ask you to pay particular \nattention to what I call the big picture. Look at the results of those \nvarious acts as well as who benefited. Please make a mental note now, \nif you can, and ask yourself always, as you look at each one of these \nillegal acts that are presented to you: A, What was the result of that \nillegal act? and, B, Who benefited from that illegal act?\n  I believe you will find that the evidence will show that while the \nPresident's ``fingerprints'' may not be directly on the evidence \nproving these illegal acts, the result of the acts usually inures to \nthe benefit of the President, and the President alone. Subordinates and \nfriends alike are drawn into this web of deceit. The President is \ninsulated. Crimes are committed. Justice is denied. The rule of law is \nsuspended. And this President is the beneficiary.\n  Some examples:\n  No. 1, subpoenaed evidence disappears from Ms. Lewinsky's apartment \nand reappears under Ms. Currie's bed. What was the result of that? Who \nhad the benefit of that?\n  No. 2, Ms. Lewinsky files a false affidavit in the Jones case. What \nis the result of filing that false affidavit and who benefited from \nthat?\n  No. 3, the President's attorney files the Lewinsky affidavit, not \nknowing it was false, representing to the Court that ``there is \nabsolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape, or form,'' while \nthe President sits in the deposition and does not object to that--very \nsilently sits in the deposition. What was the result of that? And who \nbenefited from that filing of the affidavit?\n  No. 4, and finally, Ms. Lewinsky, after months of job searching in \nNew York City, is offered a job with a Fortune 500 company in New York \nCity within 48 hours of her signing this false affidavit. Who shared \nthe results of that with Ms. Lewinsky? And who obtained the benefit of \nthat?\n  Another example occurred in a meeting between the President and Ms.\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nLewinsky in July--on July 4, 1997, to be specific--when, as a part of \ntheir conversation, she mentioned she heard someone from Newsweek was \nworking on a story about Kathleen Willey. The President has Ms. \nLewinsky back for a visit on July 14, some 10 days later, following his \nreturn from an overseas trip. She was questioned about the Willey \nstory, and specifically if Linda Tripp had been her source.\n  Important to this point--important to this point--the President then \nasked Ms. Lewinsky to try to persuade Ms. Tripp to call White House \nLegal Counsel Bruce Lindsey. The President told her to notify Ms. \nCurrie the following day, ``without getting into the details with her, \neven mentioning names with her,'' whether Ms. Lewinsky had ``mission \naccomplished'' with Linda. And as you will learn from Mr. Hutchinson, \nwho will follow me with his presentation, this is very similar to the \nmethod of operation with another job the President requested be done, \nwhich in that case succeeded with a ``mission accomplished.'' I ask you \nto watch for that in Mr. Hutchinson's presentation.\n  I want to now rewind the clock back to November of 1995. We are here \nin Washington where Ms. Lewinsky has been working at the White House \nsince July of 1995.\n  As you continue to listen to the evidence, from this point on \nNovember 15 forward, remember that Ms. Lewinsky and the President were \nalone in the Oval Office workplace area at least 21 times. And I have a \nlist of these, in chart form, beginning in November of 1995, and going \nthrough 1996 and into the early part of 1997, continuing through the \nyear. During that time, they had at least 11 of the so-called salacious \nencounters there in the workplace at various times during the day and \nnight: Three in 1995, five in 1996, and three in 1997.\n  They also had in excess of 50 telephone conversations, most of which \nappear to have been telephone calls to and from Ms. Lewinsky's home. \nAnd I have a schedule of all these telephone calls to show you, the 50-\nplus telephone calls. Also, they exchanged some 64 gifts, with the \nPresident receiving 40 of these gives and Ms. Lewinsky receiving 24 of \nthese gifts. And again we have charts that reflect the receipt of both \nsets of gifts. And again these charts will be here in the front, always \navailable for your inspection.\n  We also note that their affair began on November 15th. Interestingly, \nthere is even a conflict here with the President. According to Ms. \nLewinsky, they had never spoken to each other up to that point. Yet, he \nasked an unknown intern into the Oval Office and kissed her and then \ninvited her back to return later that day, when the two engaged in the \nfirst of the 11 acts of misconduct.\n  The contradiction is in the statement that the President relied upon \nin his grand jury testimony that has been referenced earlier--very \ncarefully worded--and that statement, the President gave in testimony \nbefore the grand jury about meeting in this relationship. And he says, \n``I regret that what began as a friendship came to include this conduct \n. . .'' Almost as if it had evolved over a period of time. So there is \nvery clearly a conflict there.\n  As Ms. Lewinsky's internship was ending that year, she did apply and \nreceive a paying job with the White House Office of Legislative \nAffairs. This position allowed her even more access to the Oval Office \narea. She remained a White House employee until April 1996 when she was \nreassigned to the Pentagon. The proof will show that Ms. Evelyn \nLieberman, Deputy Chief of Staff at the time, believed that the \ntransfer was necessary because Ms. Lewinsky was so persistent in her \nefforts to be near the President. Although Ms. Lieberman could not \nrecall hearing any rumors linking her and the President, she \nacknowledged the President was vulnerable to these kinds of rumors. \nWhile Ms. Lewinsky tried to return to work in the White House, her \nabsence was appreciated by those on the President's staff who wanted to \nprotect him.\n  After she began her job at the Pentagon in April, there was no \nfurther physical contact with the President through the 1996 election \nand the remainder of that year. The two communicated by telephone and \non occasion saw each other at public events. Their only attempt at a \nprivate visit in the Oval Office was thwarted because Ms. Lieberman was \nnearby. On December 17, she attended a holiday celebration at the White \nHouse and had a photograph made shaking hands with the President.\n  However, the evidence establishes that in 1997, Ms. Lewinsky was more \nsuccessful in arranging visits to the White House. This was because she \nused the discreet assistance of Ms. Currie, the President's secretary, \nto avoid the likes of Ms. Lieberman. Ms. Currie indicated she did not \nwant to know the details of this relationship. Ms. Currie testified on \none occasion when Ms. Lewinksy told her, ``As long as no one saw us--\nand no one did--then nothing happened.'' Ms. Currie responded, ``Don't \nwant to hear it. Don't say any more. I don't want to hear any more.''\n  Early on during their secret liaisons, the two concocted a cover \nstory to use if discovered. Ms. Lewinksy was to say she was bringing \npapers to the President. The evidence will show that statement to be \nfalse. The only papers that she ever brought were personal messages \nhaving nothing to do with her duties or the President's. The cover \nstory plays an important role in the later perjuries and the \nobstruction of justice.\n  Ms. Lewinksy stated that the President did not expressly instruct her \nto lie. He did, however, suggest, indeed, the ``misleading'' cover \nstory. When she assured him that she planned to lie about the \nrelationship, he responded approvingly. On the frequent occasions that \nshe promised that she would ``always deny'' the relationship and \n``always protect him,'' for example, the President responded, in her \nrecollection, ``That's good,'' or something affirmative. Not ``Don't \ndeny it.''\n  The evidence will establish further that the two of them had, in her \nwords, ``a mutual understanding'' that they would ``keep this private, \nso that meant deny it and . . . take whatever appropriate steps needed \nto be taken.'' When she and the President both were subpoenaed in the \nJones case, Ms. Lewinksy anticipated that ``as we had on every other \noccasion and every other instance of this relationship, we would deny \nit.''\n  In his grand jury testimony, President Clinton acknowledged that he \nand Ms. Lewinsky ``might have talked about what to do in a nonlegal \ncontext'' to hide their relationship and that he ``might well have \nsaid'' that Ms. Lewinsky should tell people she was bringing letters to \nhim or coming to visit Ms. Currie. He always stated that ``I never \nasked Ms. Lewinsky to lie.''\n  But neither did the President ever say that they must now tell the \ntruth under oath; to the contrary, as Ms. Lewinsky stated: ``It wasn't \nas if the President called me and said, `You know, Monica, you're on \nthe witness list, this is going to be really hard for us, we're going \nto have to tell the truth and be humiliated in front of the entire \nworld about what we've done,' which I would have fought him on \nprobably,'' she said. ``That was different. By not calling me and \nsaying that, you know, I knew what that meant,'' according to Monica \nLewinsky.\n  In a related but later incident that Mr. Hutchinson may refer to, \nMonica Lewinsky testified that President Clinton telephoned her at home \naround 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock one morning on December 17, 1997--2:00 or \n2:30 a.m. He told her that her name was on the list of possible \nwitnesses to be called in the Paula Jones lawsuit. When asked what to \ndo if she was subpoenaed, the President suggested that she could sign \nan affidavit. Ms. Lewinsky indicated that she was 100 percent sure that \nhe had suggested that she might want to sign an affidavit. She \nunderstood his advice to mean that she might be able to execute an \naffidavit that would not disclose the true nature of their \nrelationship.\n\n  When Ms. Lewinsky agreed to that false affidavit, she told the \nPresident by telephone that she would be signing it and asked if he \nwanted to see it before she signed it. According to Ms. Lewinsky, the \nPresident responded that he did not, as he had already seen about 15 \nothers.\n  Concurrent with these events I just described, the evidence will \nfurther demonstrate that as Ms. Lewinsky attempted to return to work at \nthe White House after the 1996 elections, she\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\nspoke with the President. According to Betty Currie, the President \ninstructed Betty Currie and Marsha Scott, Deputy Director of Personnel, \nto assist in her return to the White House. In the spring of 1997, she \nmet with Ms. Scott. She complained in subsequent notes to Ms. Scott and \nthe President about no progress being made with her getting back to the \nWhite House. On July 3rd of that year, she dispatched a more formal \nletter to the President--in fact, using the salutation, ``Dear Sir,''--\nand raising a possible threat that she might have to tell her parents \nabout why she no longer had a job at the White House if they don't get \nher another job. She also indicated a possible interest in a job in New \nYork at the United Nations. The President and Ms. Lewinsky met the next \nday in what Ms. Lewinsky characterized as a ``very emotional'' visit, \nincluding the President scolding her that it was illegal to threaten \nthe President of the United States. Their conversation eventually moved \non to other topics, though primarily her complaining about his failure \nto get her a job at the White House.\n  Continuing with Ms. Lewinsky's effort to return to work near the \nPresident, there was a July 16th meeting and September 3rd telephone \ncall with Ms. Scott. On the evening of September 30, the President \nadvised Ms. Lewinsky that he would have Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles \nhelp with a job search, and Bowles later passed this on to John \nPodesta, although each recalled their involvement occurring earlier in \nthe year.\n  A few days later, however, her hopes of a job at the White House \nquickly ended. On October 6, she had a conversation with Linda Tripp \nwho told her that she would never return to the White House, according \nto a friend of hers on the staff. Learning this ``secondhand'' was, \naccording to Ms. Lewinsky, the ``straw that broke the camel's back.'' \nShe decided to ask the President for a job in New York with the United \nNations and sent him a letter to that effect on October 7.\n  During an October 11 meeting with the President, he suggested that \nshe give him a list of New York companies which interested her. She \nasked if Vernon Jordan might also help. Five days later, she provided \nthe President with her ``wish list'' and indicated that she was no \nlonger interested in the U.N. position, although she did receive an \noffer on November 24th and declined it on January 5, 1998.\n  After this meeting with the President, arrangements were made through \nthe President and Ms. Currie for Ms. Lewinsky to meet with Mr. Jordan. \nOn the morning of November 5, 1997, Mr. Jordan spoke by telephone with \nthe President about 5 minutes and later met with Ms. Lewinsky for the \nfirst time for about 20 minutes. According to Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. Jordan \ntold her he had spoken with the President, that she came highly \nrecommended and that ``We're in business.''\n  However, the evidence reflects that Mr. Jordan took no steps to help \nMs. Lewinsky until early December of that year after she appeared on \nthe witness list in the Jones case. Actually, Mr. Jordan testified in \nhis grand jury testimony that he had no recollection of even having met \nMs. Lewinsky on November 5.\n  When he was shown documentary evidence demonstrating that his first \nmeeting with Ms. Lewinsky occurred in early November, he acknowledged \nthat such meeting ``was entirely possible.'' You can see that was not \nto be a high priority for Mr. Jordan at that time, until December.\n  For many months, Ms. Lewinsky had not been able to find a job to her \nsatisfaction--even without the perceived ``help'' of various people. \nThen in December of 1997, something happened which caused those \ninterested in finding Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York to intensify their \nsearch. Within 48 hours of her signing this false affidavit in the \nPaula Jones case, Ms. Lewinsky had landed a job with a prestigious \nFortune 500 Company.\n  It is anticipated that attorneys for the President will present \narguments which will contest much of the relationship with Monica \nLewinsky. The President has maintained throughout the last several \nmonths that while there was no sexual relationship or sexual affair, in \nfact, there was some type of inappropriate, intimate contact with her. \nWhat has now been dubbed as ``legal gymnastics'' on the part of the \nPresident has made its appearance.\n  Other examples followed. Within his definition of the word ``alone,'' \nhe denies being alone with Ms. Lewinsky at any time in the Oval Office. \nHe also questions the definition of the word ``is.'' ``It depends on \nwhat the word `is' means in how you answer a particular question.'' \nFurther, we would expect the President to continue to disavow knowledge \nof why evidence detrimental to his defense in the Jones case was \nremoved from Ms. Lewinsky's apartment and hidden beneath Ms. Currie's \nbed or knowledge of how Ms. Lewinsky found herself with an employment \noffer in New York virtually at the same time she finally executed an \naffidavit in the Jones case.\n  Unfortunately, for your search for the truth in these proceedings, \nthe President continues today to parse his words and use ``legal \nhairsplitting'' in his defense. I cite for your consideration his \nAnswer filed with this body just days ago. For instance:\n  1. Responding in part to the impeachment article I, the President \npersists in a wrongheaded fashion with his legal hairsplitting of the \nterm ``sexual relations,'' which permits him to define that term in \nsuch a way that in the particular salacious act we are talking about \nhere, one person has sex and the other person does not. As a graduate \nof one of the finest law schools in America and as a former law \nprofessor and attorney general for the State of Arkansas, the President \nknows better. I have this statement here extracted out of the \nPresident's Answer to this proceeding.\n  2. Responding to both articles of impeachment, the President now \nwould have you believe that he ``was not focusing'' when his attorney, \nBob Bennett, was objecting during the deposition and attempting to cut \noff a very important line of questioning of the President by \nrepresenting to Judge Wright that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit proved that \nthere is no need to go into this testimony about the President's life. \nHe said that this affidavit proves that ``there is absolutely no sex of \nany kind, in any manner, shape or form.'' Remember that this is the \nsame President who now pleads that he lost his focus during this very \nimportant part of this deposition. This is the very same President who \nis renowned for his intelligence and his ability ``to \ncompartmentalize,'' to concentrate and focus on whatever matter is at \nhand. And now he comes before this Senate, to each one of you, in his \nAnswer, by and through his attorneys, and pleads that he simply wasn't \npaying attention at this very important point during his own \ndeposition. In Tennessee, we have a saying for situations like that: \n``That dog won't hunt.''\n  3. In his further response to article I, the President effectively \nadmits guilt to obstruction. As I read this, his pleadings refer to the \nPresident himself, and he states that he, the President, ``truthfully \nexplained to the grand jury his efforts to answer the questions in the \nJones deposition without disclosing his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky.'' So he said he did answer the questions in the Jones \ndeposition in a way so as not to disclose his relationship with Ms. \nLewinsky. At the bottom of the same page, he denies that he attempted \n``to impede the discovery of evidence in the Jones case.'' Think about \nthis with me for a minute. Basically, the purpose of the Jones \ndeposition of the President was to secure truthful testimony about \nthese kinds of ``pattern and practice'' witnesses, and therein discover \nthe likes of Monica Lewinsky. That is the purpose of being there. The \nPresident admitted in his Answer that he purposely answered questions \nso as not to disclose his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Said another \nway, he intentionally answered questions to avoid the discovery of one \nof these female employees with whom he was sexually involved. That is \nprecisely, folks, what impeding the discovery of evidence is.\n  I ask you, if you get an opportunity, to look at this very closely.\n  4. In his answer to article II, the President ``denies that he \nencouraged Monica Lewinsky to execute a false affidavit in the Jones \ncase.'' When everything is said and done, Ms. Lewinsky had no \nmotivation, no reason whatsoever to want to commit a crime by willfully \nsubmitting a false affidavit with a court of law. She really did not\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\nneed to do this at that point in her life, but this 20-something-year-\nold young lady was listening to the most powerful man in the United \nStates, whom she greatly admired, hearing him effectively instruct her \nto file a false affidavit to avoid having to testify about their \nrelationship. And in order to do that, she had to lie about the \nphysical aspects of their relationship. According to her, the President \ndidn't even want to see that actual affidavit because he had seen 15 \nmore just like it and as such he knew what it would be.\n\n  5. In an additional response to article II, the President answers and \nasserts that ``he believed that Ms. Lewinsky could have filed a limited \nand truthful affidavit that might have enabled her to avoid having to \ntestify in the Jones case.'' That is an incredible statement. That is \nan incredible statement given the fact that the President knew \nfirsthand of the extent of their sexual relationship, and he also knew \nthat the Jones discovery efforts were specifically after that type of \nconduct. Even with the best of the legal hairsplitting, it is still \ndifficult to envision a truthful affidavit from Ms. Lewinsky that could \nhave skirted this issue enough to avoid testifying.\n  And if you really think the President had this belief, don't you \nthink he would have accepted Ms. Lewinsky's offer to review her \naffidavit and perhaps share this bit of wisdom he had with her before \nshe signed it and lied? After all, in this answer he just filed, he \nsays he had an out for her, a way for her to have the best of both \nworlds--not to have to lie and still avoid testifying in the Jones \ncase. Why didn't he share that with her when she gave him the \nopportunity if he in fact had such an idea? I suggest that perhaps that \nis a recent idea.\n  Even if, for some reason, you don't believe Ms. Lewinsky offered to \nshare that affidavit with him, don't you think it still would have been \nin the President's best interest to give Ms. Lewinsky his thoughts \nbefore she violated the law with a completely false affidavit?\n  Now, indeed, is the time to stop the legal gymnastics and \nhairsplitting and deal with these charges and facts appropriately.\n  As a House manager, I believe I can speak for all of us out of a \nsense of fairness, and again request that we and the President be \npermitted to call witnesses. I submit that the state of the evidence is \nsuch that unless and until the President has the opportunity to \nconfront and cross-examine witnesses like Ms. Lewinsky, and himself, to \ntestify if he desires, there could not be any doubt of his guilt on the \nfacts. A reasonable and impartial review of the record as it presently \nexists demands nothing less than a guilty verdict.\n  While it has been the consistent defense of the White House to be \ninconsistent, it still comes as something of a surprise that the \nPresident has not made a stronger case for the calling of witnesses. \nBefore now, he has aggressively sought the opportunity to challenge the \ntruth and veracity of witnesses in these impeachment proceedings. \nDuring the hearings in the House, which many believe are analogous to a \ngrand jury proceeding, the President's defenders and his attorneys \nconsistently complained of the failure to call witnesses and the lack \nof fairness and due process. Almost every day, there were partisan \nattacks from the White House and its emissaries who were dispatched \nthroughout the media talk shows with the same complaints of no \nwitnesses.\n  And always, our measured response was a calm assurance that there \nwould be witnesses called during the trial phase in the Senate. Is \nthere any doubt that our forefathers intended a two-step impeachment \nproceeding?\n  The House would function as the Grand Jury and determine whether to \ncharge--to impeach. Then you, as the trier of fact, would function as \nthe jury to try the case and weigh the testimony of the fact witnesses. \nIn recent days, some have publically asserted that the House is \nhypocritical because it didn't call some of the fact witnesses it now \nasks to call in the Senate. For the record, it must be noted that the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, out of an abundance of fairness, did allow \nthe President's defense team 30 hours in which to present any witnesses \nthat they could have chosen and they could have examined.\n  But any allegation of hypocrisy certainly appears to miss the point \nthat the writers of our Constitution never contemplated two separate \ntrials for an impeachment proceeding. But now we would respectfully \nsuggest is the time for witnesses.\n  All Americans, including the President, are entitled to enjoy a \nprivate family life, free from public or governmental scrutiny. But the \nprivacy concerns raised in this case are subject to limits, three of \nwhich I will briefly discuss here.\n  First. The first limit was imposed when the President was sued in \nfederal court for alleged sexual harassment. The evidence in such \nlitigation is often personal. At times, that evidence is highly \nembarrassing for both plaintiff and defendant. As Judge Wright noted at \nthe President's January 1998 deposition, ``I have never had a sexual \nharassment case where there was not some embarrassment.'' Nevertheless, \nCongress and the Supreme Court have concluded that embarrassment-\nrelated concerns must give way to the greater interest in allowing \naggrieved parties to pursue their claims. Courts have long recognized \nthe difficulties of proving sexual harassment in the work place, \ninasmuch as improper or unlawful behavior often takes place in private. \nTo excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on the ground that the \nevidence covered only ``personal'' or ``private'' behavior would \nfrustrate the goals that Congress and the courts have sought to achieve \nin enacting and interpreting the Nations's sexual harassment laws. That \nis particularly true when the conduct that is being concealed--sexual \nrelations in the workplace between a high official and a young \nsubordinate employee--itself conflicts with those goals.\n\n  Second. The second limit was imposed when Judge Wright required \ndisclosure of the precise information that is in part the subject of \nthis hearing today. A federal judge specifically ordered the President, \non more than one occasion, to provide the requested information about \nrelationships with other women, including Ms. Lewinsky. The fact that \nJudge Wright later determined that the evidence would not be admissible \nat trial, and still later granted judgment in the President's favor, \ndoes not change the President's legal duty at the time he testified. \nLike every litigant, the President was entitled to object to the \ndiscovery questions, and to seek guidance from the court if he thought \nthose questions were improper. But having failed to convince the court \nthat his objections were well founded, the President was duty bound to \ntestify truthfully and fully. Perjury and attempts to obstruct the \ngathering of evidence can never be an acceptable response to a court \norder, regardless of the eventual course or outcome of the litigation.\n  The Supreme Court has spoken forcefully about perjury and other forms \nof obstruction of justice: ``In this constitutional process of securing \na witness' testimony, perjury simply has no place whatever. Perjured \ntestimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concepts of \njudicial proceedings. Effective restraints against this type of \negregious offense are therefore imperative.''\n  The insidious effects of perjury occur whether the case is civil or \ncriminal. Only a few years ago, the Supreme Court considered a false \nstatement made in a civil administrative proceeding: ``False testimony \nin a formal proceeding is intolerable. We must neither reward nor \ncondone such a `flagrant affront' to truth-seeking function of \nadversary proceedings * * * Perjury should be severely sanctioned in \nappropriate cases.'' Stated more simply, ``perjury is an obstruction of \njustice.''\n  Third. The third limit is unique to the President. ``The Presidency \nis more than an executive responsibility. It is the inspiring symbol of \nall that is highest in American purpose and ideals.'' As the head of \nthe Executive Branch, the President has the constitutional duty to \n``take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' The President gave \nhis testimony in the Jones case under oath and in the presence of a \nfederal judge, a member of a co-equal branch of government; he then \ntestified before a federal grand jury, a body of citizens who had \nthemselves taken an oath to seek the truth. In view of the enormous \ntrust and responsibility attendant to his high Office, the President \nhas a manifest duty to ensure that\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nhis conduct at all times complies with the law of the land.\n  In sum, perjury and acts that obstruct justice by any citizen--\nwhether in a criminal case, a grand jury investigation, a congressional \nhearing, a civil trial or civil discovery--are profoundly serious \nmatters. When such acts are committed by the President of the United \nStates, those acts are grounds for conviction and removal from his \nOffice.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe a recess of the proceedings for 15 minutes.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection?\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, I have just about 1 minute, \nand I will conclude.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withhold my request.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well.\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Thank you.\n  As I reach the conclusion of my presentation, the time line is now in \nDecember of 1997. Following her November 5th meeting with Mr. Jordan, \nMs. Lewinsky had no communication with him or the President for a \nmonth. Then in early December, the parties in the Jones case exchanged \nwitness lists and Ms. Lewinsky was scheduled as a potential witness by \nthe Jones' attorneys. On or about that same day, Ms. Lewinsky attempted \nto make an uninvited visit to the White House and later that day, was \nallowed in by the President. But it was during this time, in December \nof 1997, that some of the seams began to unravel for the President.\n  I will conclude my remarks at this point and thank the Chief Justice \nand the Members of the Senate for their careful attention. My colleague \nfrom Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson will follow me now or at the end of any \nrecess as may be necessary.\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, my apologies to the manager for the \ninterruption at the end of his remarks.\n  I renew my request of unanimous consent to take a 15-minute recess.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. In the absence of an objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Thereupon, the Senate, sitting as a Court of Impeachment, at 3:07 \np.m., recessed until 3:30 p.m.)\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, we are prepared now to go \nforward with the next manager's presentation.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well, the Chair recognizes Manager \nHutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, I am Asa \nHutchinson, a Member of Congress from the Third Congressional District \nof Arkansas. I am grateful for this opportunity, although it comes with \ndeep regret, to be before you. I do want to tell you in advance that we \nhave presented to you, on your tables, a selection of charts that I \nwill be referring to here so everyone will have the advantage of being \nable to see at least in some fashion the charts to which I will be \nreferring. And we will have the charts here as well.\n  This is certainly a humbling experience for a smalltown lawyer. I \nlearned to love and to respect the law trying cases in the courtrooms \nof rural Arkansas. The scene is different in this setting, in this \nhistoric Chamber with the Chief Justice presiding and Senators sitting \nas jurors. But what is at stake remains the same.\n  In every case heard in every courtroom across this great country, it \nis the truth, it is justice, it is the law that are at stake. In this \njourney on Earth, there is nothing of greater consequence for us to \ndevote our energies than to search for the truth, to pursue equal \njustice and to uphold the law. It is for those reasons that I serve as \na manager. And as you, I hope that I can help in some way to bring this \nmatter to a conclusion for our country. This afternoon I will be \ndiscussing the evidence and the testimony from witnesses that we do \nhope to call, and during my presentation I will be focusing on the \nevidence that demonstrates obstruction of justice under article II.\n  You might wonder, well, why are we going to article II before we have \ncovered article I on perjury? And the answer is that in a chronological \nflow, article II, the obstruction facts, precede much of the perjury \nallegations. And so, following my presentation, Manager Rogan will \npresent article I on perjury.\n  The presentation I make will be based upon the record, the evidence, \nthe facts that have been accumulated, and I want you to know that I am \ngoing to be presenting those facts, and from time to time I will argue \nthose facts. I believe they are well supported in the record, but I \nurge each of you, if you ever find anything that you question, to \nsearch the record and verify the facts, because I do not intend to \nmisrepresent anything to this body. In fact, we will be submitting to \neach of your offices my presentation with annotations to the record, to \nthe grand jury transcripts which will tie in the facts that I present \nto you. Again, I believe and trust that you will find that they are \nwell supported.\n  So let's start with obstruction of justice. Later on, there will be a \nfull discussion of the law on obstruction of justice, but for our \npurposes, it is simply any corrupt act or attempt to influence or \nimpede the proper functioning of our system of justice. It is a \ncriminal offense, a felony, and it has historically been an impeachable \noffense.\n  Let me first say, it is not a crime nor an impeachable offense to \nengage in inappropriate personal conduct. Nor is it a crime to obstruct \nor conceal personal embarrassing facts or relationships. It might be \noffensive, but there are no constitutional consequences. But as we go \nthrough the facts of the case, the evidence will show in this case that \nthere was a scheme that was developed to obstruct the administration of \njustice, and that is illegal. And the obstruction of justice is of \ngreat consequence and significance to the integrity of our Nation when \ncommitted by anyone, but particularly by the Chief Executive of our \nland, the President of the United States.\n  Mr. Bryant took us factually up to a certain point pertaining to the \njob search. This is chart No. 1 that you have before you. This puts it \nin perspective a little bit, and just for a brief review. You go back \nin the calendar, back into October. That is when Ms. Lewinsky sends the \nPresident her wish list for a list of jobs. And then shortly after \nthat, Ms. Currie faxes Lewinsky the resume to Ambassador Richardson, \nand Ambassador Richardson gets involved in the job search.\n  October 30, the President promised to arrange a meeting between \nLewinsky and Jordan. This was set up in November. It was actually \nNovember 5. But preceding that, there was a job offer at the United \nNations extended to Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky decided that she was not \ninterested in a job at the United Nations, she wanted to go into the \nprivate sector. And so that was the purpose on November 5 of the \nmeeting between Jordan and Lewinsky. That is when Mr. Jordan says, \n``We're in business.'' But the facts will show that there was nothing \nreally done in November, and that is when I will get in a little bit \nmore to my presentation, and then I will get into December when some \nthings happened there that picked up speed on this issue.\n  The obstruction, for our purposes, started on December 5, 1997, and \nthat is when the witness list from the Paula Jones case was faxed to \nthe President's lawyers. At that point, the wheels of obstruction \nstarted rolling, and they did not stop until the President successfully \nblocked the truth from coming out in the civil rights case.\n  These acts of obstruction included attempts to improperly influence a \nwitness in a civil rights case--that is Monica Lewinsky--the \nprocurement and filing of a false affidavit in the case; unlawful \nattempts to influence the testimony of a key witness, Betty Currie; the \nwillful concealment of evidence under subpoena in that case, which are \nthe gifts of December 28; and illegally influencing the testimony of \nwitnesses--that is the aides who testified before the grand jury--\nbefore the grand jury of the United States. Each of these areas of \nobstruction will be covered in my presentation today.\n  As I said, it began on Friday, December 5, when the witness list came \nfrom the Paula Jones case. Shortly thereafter, the President learned \nthat the list included Monica Lewinsky. This had to be startling news \nto the President, because if the truth about his relationship with a \nsubordinate employee\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\nwas known, the civil rights case against him would be strengthened and \nit might have totally changed the outcome.\n  But to compound the problem, less than a week later, Judge Wright, \nFederal district judge in Arkansas, on December 11, issued an order, \nand that order directed that the President had to answer questions \nconcerning other relationships that he might have had during a \nparticular timeframe with any State or Federal employee. And when I say \n``relationships,'' I am speaking of sexual relationships. So Judge \nWright entered the order that is not in your stack, but I have it here. \nIt was filed on December 11 in the district court in Arkansas and \ndirects the President that he has to answer those questions within a \ntimeframe, as Mr. Bryant said, which is typical in a civil rights case \nof this nature.\n  The White House knew that Monica was on the witness list. The \nPresident knew that it was likely that she would be subpoenaed as a \nwitness and that her truthful testimony would hurt his case.\n  What did the President do? What he had to do was he made sure that \nMonica Lewinsky was on his team and under control. And then on December \n17, the President finally called Ms. Lewinsky to let her know she was \non the list. This was a call between 2 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. in the \nmorning.\n  Now, what happened in the time between the President learning Monica \nLewinsky was on the list and when he notified her of that fact on \nDecember 17 is very important. The President, during that timeframe, \ntalked to his friend, his confidante and his problem-solver, Vernon \nJordan. Mr. Jordan had come to the President's rescue on previous \noccasions. He was instrumental in securing consulting contracts for Mr. \nWebb Hubbell while Mr. Hubbell was under investigation by the \nindependent counsel.\n  Let me parenthetically go to that point, right before Mr. Hubbell \nannounced his resignation from the Justice Department.\n  During that timeframe, there was a meeting at the White House in \nwhich the President, the First Lady and others were present. After that \nmeeting, Vernon Jordan agreed to help obtain financial assistance for \nMr. Hubbell. Mr. Jordan then introduced Mr. Hubbell to the ``right \npeople.'' The introduction was successful, and Mr. Hubbell obtained a \n$100,000 contract. The ``right people'' that Mr. Jordan contacted \nhappened to be the same right people for both Mr. Hubbell and \nultimately for Monica Lewinsky, which is the parent company of Revlon. \nSo the President was aware that Mr. Jordan had the contacts and the \ntrack record to be of assistance to the President in delicate matters.\n  Now let's go back a little. Monica Lewinsky had been looking for a \ngood-paying and high-profile job in New York, since the previous July, \nas I pointed out.\n  She had been offered a job at the United Nations, but she wanted to \nwork in the private sector. She was not having much success, and then \nin early November it was Betty Currie who arranged a meeting with \nVernon Jordan, which was ultimately on November 5. At this meeting, Ms. \nLewinsky met with Mr. Jordan for about 20 minutes.\n  Now, let's refer to Mr. Vernon Jordan's grand jury testimony on that \nmeeting that occurred on November 5. And you have that, and it should \nbe your chart No. 2, or exhibit 2.\n  As Mr. Jordan testified before the Federal grand jury on March 3, \n1998, in reference to the November 5 meeting, he testifies:\n\n       I have no recollection of an early November meeting with \n     Ms. Monica Lewinsky. I have absolutely no recollection of it \n     and I have no record of it.\n\n  He goes on to testify, at page 76 of the grand jury testimony. \nQuestion:\n\n       Is it fair to say that back in November getting Monica \n     Lewinsky a job on any fast pace was not any priority of \n     yours?\n\n  His answer:\n\n       I think that's fair to say.\n\n  Now, let's stop there for a moment. What happened as a result of this \nmeeting? No action followed whatsoever. No job interviews were arranged \nand there were no further contacts with Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan made no \neffort to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky for over a month. Indeed, it was \nso unimportant to him that he ``had no recollection of an early \nNovember meeting,'' and, in fact, he testified finding her a job was \nnot a priority. And then you will see that during this timeframe the \nPresident's attitude was exactly the same.\n  And so look at the same exhibit 2, the last item on that chart, where \nit refers to Monica Lewinsky's grand jury testimony. And there she is \nreferring to a December 6 meeting with the President.\n\n       I think I said that . . . I was supposed to get in touch \n     with Mr. Jordan the previous week and that things did not \n     work out and that nothing had really happened yet [on the job \n     front].\n\n  And the question was:\n\n       Did the President say what he was going to do?\n\n  The answer:\n\n       I think he said he would--you know, this was sort of \n     typical of him, to sort of say, ``Oh I'll talk to him. I'll \n     get on it.''\n\n  So you can see from that that it was not a high priority for the \nPresident, either. It was: Sure, I'll get to that. I will do that.\n  It was clear from Monica Lewinsky that nothing was happening.\n  But then the President's attitude suddenly changed. What started out \nas a favor for Betty Currie dramatically changed after Ms. Lewinsky \nbecame a witness, and the judge's order was issued, again, on December \n11. And at that time, the President talked personally--personally--to \nMr. Jordan and requested his help in getting Ms. Lewinsky a job. And \nthat would be, again, back on exhibit 2 on that chart, the third item \nof testimony there; back to Mr. Jordan, his grand jury testimony, May \n5, 1998.\n  The question is:\n\n       But what is also clear is that as of this date, December \n     11th, you are clear that at that point you had made a \n     decision that you would try to make some calls to help get \n     her a job.\n\n  His answer:\n\n       There is no question about that.\n\n  And so what triggered--let's look at the chain of events. The witness \nlist came in. The judge's order came in. That triggered the President \nto action. And the President triggered Vernon Jordan into action. That \nchain reaction here is what moved the job search along.\n  Now, if we had Mr. Jordan on the witness stand--which I hope to be \nable to call Mr. Jordan--you would need to probe where his loyalties \nlie, listen to the tone of his voice, look into his eyes and determine \nthe truthfulness of his statements. You must decide whether he is \ntelling the truth or withholding information.\n  And so let's go to exhibit 3 in your booklet. Again, recalling Mr. \nJordan, he testifies about that meeting. He testifies, in his March 3, \n1998, grand jury testimony:\n\n       I am certain after the 11th that I had a conversation with \n     the President and as a part of that conversation I said to \n     him that Betty Currie had called me about Monica Lewinsky. \n     And the conversation was that he knew about her situation \n     which was that she was pushed out of the White House, that \n     she wanted to go to New York and he thanked me for helping \n     her.\n\n  Remember what else happened on that day, again, the same day that \nJudge Wright ruled that the questions about other relationships could \nbe asked by the Jones' attorneys.\n  Now, let's go back again to Mr. Jordan's testimony. What does he say \nabout the involvement of the President of the United States in regard \nto these jobs? You look at exhibit 4. That is in your booklet. This is, \nagain, Vernon Jordan's grand jury transcript of June 9, 1998.\n\n  Now, the question is on a different issue. The question is about why \ndid he tell the White House that Frank Carter--Frank Carter was the \nattorney for Monica Lewinsky that Vernon Jordan arranged and introduced \nto Monica Lewinsky. He was hired. And at whatever point he was \nterminated, then Vernon Jordan notified the President. So the question \nrelates to that:\n\n       Why are you trying to tell someone at the White House that \n     this has happened, [Carter had been fired]?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       Thought they had a right to know.\n\n  Question:\n\n       Why?\n\n  And here is the answer that is critical for my point:\n\n       The President asked me to get Monica Lewinsky a job. I got \n     her a lawyer. The Drudge Report is out and she has new \n     counsel. I thought that was information that they ought to \n     have. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\n\n  ``The President asked me to get Monica Lewinsky a job.'' Clear, \nstraightforward testimony; no doubt about it.\n  Then go on down to page 58 of his grand jury testimony of June 9.\n  The question:\n\n       Why did you think the President needed to know that Frank \n     Carter had been replaced?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       Information. He knew that I had gotten her a job, he knew \n     that I had gotten her a lawyer. Information. He was \n     interested in this matter. He is the source of it coming to \n     my attention in the first place.\n\n  ``He is the source of it coming to my attention in the first place.'' \nRemember he had already met with Betty Currie. Nothing was happening in \nthe November timeframe. Nothing was happening. Vernon Jordan--it was \nnot a priority. Then the President of the United States called him, and \nit became a priority. And that is who he was acting for in trying to \nget Monica Lewinsky a job.\n  At this point we do not know all that the President was telling \nVernon Jordan, but we do know that there were numerous calls back and \nforth between Mr. Jordan and the President. There were numerous calls \nbeing made by Mr. Jordan on behalf of Monica Lewinsky searching for a \njob, and that despite the fact that Monica Lewinsky did not know that \nshe was witnessed--she did not know she was a witness--the President \nknew that she was a witness during his intensified efforts to get her a \njob.\n  Now, the President's counselors have made a defense that the job \nsearch started before Monica Lewinsky was a witness and there was \nnothing wrong with that. My response to that is, it is true there is \nnothing wrong with a public official, under the right circumstances, \nhelping someone get a job. And what might have started out being \ninnocent, if you accept that argument, crossed the line--crossed the \nline--whenever it was tied and interconnected with the President's \ndesire to get a false affidavit from Monica Lewinsky, and whenever the \njob is out there and preparing the false affidavit, you will see that \nthey are totally interconnected, intertwined, interrelated; and that is \nwhere the line has crossed into obstruction.\n  For example, when the President was waiting on Ms. Lewinsky to sign \nthe false affidavit in the Jones case during the critical time in \nJanuary a problem developed. The job interviews were unproductive, \ndespite the numerous calls by Mr. Jordan. On one particular day, Monica \ncalled Mr. Jordan and said the interview with Revlon did not go well. \nMr. Jordan, what did he do? He picked up the phone to the CEO of--the \npresident of the company, Mr. Perlman, to, as Vernon Jordan testified, \n``make things happen--if they could happen.'' That is the request from \nMr. Jordan to the CEO of a company, after a job interview with Monica \nLewinsky did not go well.\n  What happened? Things happened. He did, he made things happen. Monica \nLewinsky got a job. The affidavit was signed and the President was \ninformed by Mr. Jordan, through Betty Currie, that the mission was \naccomplished.\n  The question here is not why did the President do a favor for an ex-\nintern, but why did he use the influence of his office to make sure it \nhappened? The answer is that he was willing to obstruct, impede justice \nby improperly influencing a witness in order to protect himself in a \ncivil rights case.\n  The next step in the obstruction is the false affidavit. This is \ndirectly related to the job mission. The President needed the signature \nof Monica Lewinsky on the false affidavit, and that was assured by the \nefforts to secure her a job. Again, the President brought Ms. Lewinsky \ninto the loop on December 17. Over 10 days after the witness list was \nreceived by the President, the President was ready to tell Monica the \nnews.\n  That timeframe is important. He gets the witness list. He could have \ncalled Monica Lewinsky immediately, but he needed 7 days because he \nneeded to make sure the job situation was in gear. And in fact, the day \nafter, if you look back on exhibit 1, you will see that the day after \nthe December 17 timeframe that she was informed that she was on the \nwitness list, the next day she already had lined up job interviews for \nher. So she felt confident. But she was notified on December 17. \nBetween 2 and 2:30 a.m., her phone rang. It was the President of the \nUnited States. The President said that he had seen the witness list in \nthe case and her name was on it. Ms. Lewinsky asked what she should do \nif subpoenaed, and the President responded, ``Well, maybe you can sign \nan affidavit.''\n  Well, how would this work? Both parties knew that the affidavit would \nneed to be false and misleading in order to accomplish the desired \nresult. Clearly, truthful testimony by Monica Lewinsky would make her a \nwitness, would not keep her away from testifying. Only a false \naffidavit would avoid the deposition.\n  So look at what I have marked as exhibit 4.1, which is just a review \nof the key dates on this job search. Again, November 5 was the first \nmeeting between Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky. In November nothing happened. \nAccording to Jordan, ``not a high priority.'' December 5, the President \nreceives the witness list. The 11th, things intensify with Judge \nWright's order. The 11th, the President talks to Mr. Jordan about the \njob for Monica. He gets into action. On the 17th, they are ready to \ntell Monica that she is on the witness list. And then, on the 19th, she \nis actually served with a subpoena. Again, remember, after she was \nfinally notified, it was the next day that she had the job interviews.\n  Now, still we will spend some time on the December 17 conversation, \nthe day that Monica Lewinsky was notified that she was on the witness \nlist. During that conversation, the President had a very pointed \nsuggestion for Ms. Lewinsky in a suggestion that left no doubt about \nhis purpose and the intended consequences. He did not say specifically, \n``Go in and lie.'' This is something that you will hear, and Monica \nLewinsky testified in her grand jury testimony: ``The President never \ntold me to lie.''\n  How do you tell people to lie? You can tell them the facts that they \ncan use that would, in substance, be a false statement; or you can say, \n``Go in and lie and make up your own false testimony.'' The President \nchose to give her the ideas as to what she could testify to that would \nbe false, but he never said the words, ``You need to go in and lie.'' \nSo what he did say to her was, ``You know, you can always say you were \ncoming to see Betty or that you were bringing me letters.''\n  That, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, is a false representation, \nis a false statement that he is telling Ms. Lewinsky to utter. \nRemember, at this point the President knows she is a witness, and what \ndoes he do? As evidenced by the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, he \nencourages her to lie, to say, ``You can always say you were coming to \nsee Betty or that you were bringing me letters.''\n  It should also be remembered that the President, when questioned \nabout encouraging Monica Lewinsky to lie, has denied these allegations, \nand therefore there is certainly a conflict in the testimony. It is our \nbelief that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is credible and she has the motive \nto tell the truth because of her immunity agreement with the \nindependent counsel, where she gets in trouble only if she lies; \nwhereas the President has the motive to cover up and to testify \nfalsely.\n  In order to understand the significance of this statement made by the \nPresident, it is necessary to recall the cover stories that the \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky had previously concocted in order to deceive \nthose people who might inquire. It was to deceive those people that \nthey worked with. The difference in the initial cover stories, though, \nto protect the President and Monica from an embarrassing personal \nrelationship, from friends and coworkers and the media, now it is in a \ndifferent arena, with the pending civil rights case and Ms. Lewinsky \nbeing on the witness list.\n  Despite the legal responsibilities, the President made the decision \nto continue the pattern of lying which ultimately became an obstruction \nof the administration of justice. We are still on December 17, when the \nPresident called Monica at 2 a.m. on that particular day to tell her \nshe was on the witness list, to remind her of the cover stories. Monica \nLewinsky testified, when the President brought up the cover story, she \nunderstood that the\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\ntwo of them would continue their preexisting pattern of deception and \nit became clear that the President had no intention of making his \nrelationship with a subordinate Federal employee an issue in that civil \nrights case, no matter what the Federal courts told him he needed to \nanswer. And he used lies, deceit, and deception to carry out that \npurpose.\n\n  It is interesting to note that the President, when he was asked by \nthe grand jury whether he remembered calling Monica Lewinsky at 2 a.m. \non that December 17th day, responded, ``No, sir, I don't, but it is \nquite possible that that happened.'' When he was asked whether he \nencouraged Monica Lewinsky to continue the cover stories of coming to \nsee Betty or bringing letters, he answered, ``I don't remember exactly \nwhat I told her that night.''\n  This is not a denial, and therefore I believe you should accept the \ntestimony of Monica Lewinsky. If you say in your mind, well, I'm not \ngoing to believe her, then you should first give us the opportunity to \npresent this witness so that you as jurors can fairly and honestly \ndetermine her credibility.\n  As expected, 2 days later, on December 19, Ms. Lewinsky received a \nsubpoena to testify in the Jones case. This sets about an immediate \nflurry of activity. There are a series of telephone calls between Ms. \nLewinsky, Vernon Jordan, the President, and his staff. You will see \nthis pattern of telephone calls repeated and generated at any point in \ntime when it appears that the truth may be told in the civil rights \ncase.\n  Now, let's look at exhibit 5, which is the activity on Friday, \nDecember 19. This is the day that Monica Lewinsky is served with a \nsubpoena. Now, after Mr. Jordan is notified that Monica Lewinsky is \nserved with a subpoena, what does he do? In the 3:51-3:52 notation, \nJordan telephones the President and talks to Debra Schiff, his \nassistant. The subpoena is issued. Monica calls Jordan and Jordan \nimmediately calls the President. ``Lewinsky meets with Jordan and \nrequests that Jordan notify the President about her subpoena''--this is \nat 4:47 p.m.\n  Presumably in the middle of that meeting, at 5:01 p.m., the President \nof the United States telephones Mr. Jordan and Jordan notifies the \nPresident about Ms. Lewinsky's subpoena.\n  Then that is whenever he arranged for Ms. Lewinsky's attorney--\n``Jordan telephones attorney Carter''--for representation, and that \nnight, Vernon Jordan goes to the White House to meet privately with the \nPresident on these particular issues.\n  Now, in that meeting--and I am speaking of the meeting that happened \nlate that night at the White House--Mr. Jordan told the President again \nthat Ms. Lewinsky had been subpoenaed and related to the President the \nsubstance and details of his meeting with Ms. Lewinsky. It wasn't a \ncasual consideration; the details were discussed, including her \nfascination with the President and other such issues.\n  This led Mr. Jordan to ask the President about his relationship with \nMs. Lewinsky, and the response by the President of the United States \nwas the first of many denials to his friends and aides. The President \nstated in his deposition that he does not recall that meeting. But you \nshould remind yourselves of the testimony and the description provided \nby Vernon Jordan when he said, ``The President has an extraordinary \nmemory.'' In fact, we all know that he is world famous for that memory.\n\n  Now, the subpoena had been delivered, but the testimony of Monica \nLewinsky was not scheduled until January 23, and the President's \ndeposition, which was even more critical, was not scheduled until \nJanuary 17. So the President and his team had some time to work. The \nwork was not the business of the Nation, it was the distraction and \nself-preservation in the civil rights case.\n  Under the plan, Mr. Jordan would be the buffer; he would obtain an \nattorney--Mr. Carter--and that attorney would keep Mr. Jordan informed \non the progress of the representation, including reviewing any copy of \nthe affidavit, knowing about the motion to quash, and the general \nprogress of the representation. All along the way, when Mr. Jordan gets \ninformation, what does he do with that? Mr. Jordan keeps the President \ninformed both about the affidavit and the prospects of the job in New \nYork, for which Ms. Lewinsky was totally dependent on the help of her \nfriends in high places.\n  Let me go back again. There is nothing wrong with helping somebody \nget a job. But we all know there is one thing forbidden in public \noffice: We must avoid quid pro quo, which is: This is for that. But \nVernon Jordan testified he kept the President informed on the status of \nthe false affidavit, the job search, and the status of Ms. Lewinsky's \nrepresentation. Why? Is this just idle chatter with the President of \nthe United States, or are these matters the President is vitally \ninterested in and, in fact, coordinated? Mr. Jordan answers this \nquestion himself on page 25 of his grand jury testimony, where he \ntestified, ``I knew the President was concerned about the affidavit and \nwhether or not it was signed. He was obviously.'' That was his March 5, \n1998, grand jury testimony. The President was concerned not just about \nthe affidavit but specifically about whether it was signed.\n  The President knew that Monica Lewinsky was going to make a false \naffidavit. He was so certain of the contents that when Monica Lewinsky \nasked if he wanted to see it, he told her no, that he had seen 15 of \nthem. Besides, the President had suggested the affidavit himself, and \nhe trusted Mr. Jordan to be certain to keep things under control. In \nfact, that was one of the main purposes of Mr. Jordan's continued \ncommunication with Monica Lewinsky's attorney, Frank Carter.\n  Even though Mr. Jordan testifies at one point he never had any \nsubstantive discussions on the representation with Mr. Carter, he \ncontradicts himself in his March 3 grand jury testimony where he \nstates: ``Mr. Carter at some point told me--this is after January--that \nshe had signed the affidavit, that he had filed a motion to quash her \nsubpoena and that--I mean, there was no reason for accountability, but \nhe reassured me that he had things under control.''\n  Mr. Jordan was aware of the substance of the drafting of the \naffidavit, the representation, the motion to quash, and even had a part \nin the redrafting. This was clearly important to Mr. Jordan and clearly \nimportant to the President.\n  Now, let's go to the time when the false affidavit was actually \nsigned, January 5, 1998. These will be exhibits 7, 8, and 9 in front of \nyou. Let's go to January 5. This is sort of a summary of what happened \non that day. Ms. Lewinsky meets with her attorney, Mr. Carter, for an \nhour. Carter drafts the affidavit for Ms. Lewinsky on the deposition. \nIn the second paragraph, Ms. Lewinsky telephones Betty Currie, stating \nthat she needs to speak to the President, that this is about an \nimportant matter; specifically, that she was anxious about something \nshe needed to sign--an affidavit. Frank Carter drafts the affidavit she \nis concerned about. She calls the President. The President returns Ms. \nLewinsky's call.\n\n  Big question: Should the President return Ms. Lewinsky's call? He \ndoes, that day, quickly. Ms. Lewinsky mentions the affidavit she is \nsigning and offers to show it to the President. That is where he says \nno, he had seen 15 others.\n  Let's go to the next day. The next exhibit is January 6. On this \nparticular day, Ms. Lewinsky picks up the draft affidavit. At 2:08 to \n2:10 p.m., she delivers that affidavit. To whom? Mr. Jordan. That is \nafter she got it. She delivers it to Jordan. And then, at 3:26 p.m., \nMr. Jordan telephones Mr. Carter. At 3:38, Mr. Jordan telephones Nancy \nHernreich of the White House. At 3:48, he telephones Ms. Lewinsky about \nthe draft affidavit, and, at 3:49, you will see in red that both agree \nto delete a portion of the affidavit that created some implication that \nmaybe she had been alone with the President.\n  So Mr. Jordan was very involved in drafting the affidavit and the \ncontents of that.\n  And then at 4:19, presumably in response to some of the calls by \nJordan earlier in the day, the President telephones Mr. Jordan and they \nhave a discussion. And then Mr. Jordan telephones Carter and the \nconversations go back and forth. At the end of the day, Mr. Jordan \ntelephones the White House. So the affidavit is still in the drafting \nprocess.\n  Let's go to the next day, exhibit 9. Monica signs the affidavit here. \nAt 10\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\na.m., Ms. Lewinsky signs a false affidavit in Mr. Carter's office. Then \nshe delivers the signed affidavit to Mr. Jordan. And then what does he \ndo? The usual. At 11:58, Mr. Jordan telephones the White House. At \n5:46, Mr. Jordan telephones the White House. At 6:50, Mr. Jordan \ntelephones the White House and tells the President that Ms. Lewinsky \nsigned the affidavit.\n  Is this important information for the President, to know he was \nvitally interested in it?\n  The next day, exhibit 10, January 8. After it is signed, what is \nimportant the next day? It was the other part of the arrangement, that \nshe has the job interview with MacAndrews in New York. She had that job \ninterview. The only problem was that it went poorly, very poorly. So at \n4:48 p.m. on this particular day, Ms. Lewinsky telephones Jordan and \nadvises that the New York interview went ``very poorly.''\n  What does Mr. Jordan do? He telephones Ron Perelman, the CEO of \nRevlon, the subsidiary of MFH, to make things happen if they could \nhappen. What does he do next? Jordan telephones Ms. Lewinsky, saying, \n``I'm doing the best I can to help you out.'' And they set up another \ninterview for the next day. Jordan telephones the White House Counsel's \nOffice, and, in the evening, Revlon in New York telephones Ms. Lewinsky \nto set up a follow-up interview. They said the first interview didn't \ngo well, but because Mr. Jordan intercedes--and why? Because the false \naffidavit has been signed and he wants to make sure this is carried \nout. At 9:02 p.m., Ms. Lewinsky telephones Jordan about the Revlon \ninterview in New York, and presumably it went better on that particular \nday.\n  Then on January 9--exhibit 11--Monica is confirmed that she has the \njob. Lewinsky is offered the Revlon job in New York, and accepts.\n  Lewinsky telephones Jordan. And then, at 4:14, Jordan notifies \nCurrie, calls Betty Currie, and says ``Mission accomplished,'' and \nrequests that she tell the President. Jordan notifies the President of \nLewinsky's job offer, and says, ``Thank you, very much, Mr. \nPresident.'' And then, that evening, the President telephones Currie, \nand so on. But the President is notified that the job has been secured, \n``mission accomplished.''\n  Let me ask you a question, after I have gone through these exhibits. \nWould Mr. Jordan have pushed for a second interview without cooperation \non the affidavit? Would Monica Lewinsky have received the support and \nsecured the job if she had said ``I don't want to sign an affidavit; I \nam just going to go in there and tell the truth; whatever they ask me, \nI am going to answer; I am going to tell the truth?'' Does anyone in \nthis room believe that she would have been granted the job--if Mr. \nJordan had made that call to get that second interview--that she would \never have had the help from her friend in high places? Now the \naffidavit has been signed. The job is secure. Monica Lewinsky is on the \nteam, and the President of the United States is armed for the \ndeposition.\n  So let's move there.\n  Just how important was Monica Lewinsky's false affidavit to the \nPresident's deposition? Let's look. What did the President's attorney, \nRobert Bennett, say about that affidavit to the Federal judge during \nthe deposition? That false affidavit allowed Mr. Bennett, the attorney \nfor Mr. Clinton, when talking about the question of whether the \nrelationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky--it allowed him to \nassert that `` . . . there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any \nmanner, shape or form with President Clinton * * *.''\n  That is a statement of Robert Bennett--his representation to the \ncourt about that relationship. It is a representation that he had to \nlater, probably based upon his own professional embarrassment, \nwithdraw, and to correct that inaccurate part of the record.\n  When questioned by his own attorney in the deposition, the President \nstated specifically the key paragraph of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit was \n``absolutely true.''\n  Paragraph 8 of her affidavit states:\n\n       I have never had a sexual relationship with the President. \n     . . .\n\n  If it enters your mind at this point as to what was meant by ``sexual \nrelationship,'' please remember that this affidavit was drafted upon a \ncommon understanding of that phrase at that point, and not based upon \nany definition used in the deposition of the President.\n  I am sure it was the President's hope and belief that the false \naffidavit used in the deposition to bolster his own testimony would be \nthe end of the matter. But that was not the case. We know in life that \none lie leads to another. And so it is when we attempt to thwart the \nadministration of justice--one obstruction leads to another.\n  Now we move to another key witness, Betty Currie.\n  By the time the President concluded his deposition, he knew there \nwere too many details out about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He \nknew that the only person who would probably be talking was Ms. \nLewinsky herself. He knew the cover story that he had carefully created \nand that was converted into false statements in the affidavit was now \nin jeopardy and had to be backed at this point by the key witnesses, \nMonica Lewinsky and Betty Currie. After the deposition, the President \nneeded to do two things: He had to contact Ms. Lewinsky to see if she \nwas still on the team, but he also had to make sure that his secretary, \nBetty Currie was lying to protect him. So let's look at how the concern \nbecame a frenzied and concerted effort to keep the holes plugged in the \ndike.\n  Let's look at exhibits 12 and 13.\n  What happened on the day the deposition--really the night of the \ndeposition--on January 17. The President finishes testifying in the \ndeposition around 4 p.m. At 5:38 p.m., the President telephones Mr. \nJordan at home. And then, at 7:13, the President telephones Ms. Currie \nat home. At 7:02, the President places a call to Mr. Jordan's office. \nAnd then, at 7:13, he gets Ms. Currie at home finally, and asks her to \nmeet with him on Sunday. It is vitally important that he meet with Ms. \nCurrie at this point because he knows his whole operation is coming \nunglued.\n  So the next day, on January 18, which is exhibit 13, there is a whole \nflurry of activity here.\n  I am not going to go through all of them. You can see the frantic \npace at the White House because at 6:11 in the morning, the President \nhad some more bad news. The Drudge Report was released. And that \ncreated a greater flurry. Then between 11:49 and 2:55 p.m., two phone \ncalls were made between Mr. Jordan and the President.\n  Then, at 5 p.m., we see the meetings. That is on the second page. At \n5 p.m., Ms. Currie meets with the President. And the President then \ntells Ms. Currie to find Monica Lewinsky. The telephone calls were \ngenerated, and there was no success in that.\n\n  Then, that evening the President calls Ms. Currie at home to try once \nagain to see if she had found Monica.\n  But it was on that day that there was that critical meeting on that \nSunday in the Oval Office between Betty Currie and the President of the \nUnited States.\n  For that reason, we need next to hear from Betty Currie, the \nPresident's personal secretary, as to what occurred during that most \nunusual meeting on Sunday following the deposition.\n  Betty Currie testified in the grand jury that the President said that \nhe had just been deposed and that the attorneys had asked several \nquestions about Monica Lewinsky. This is a violation of the judge's gag \norder. And the President, you know, made some comments that were not in \nline. But he had some choices to make, and he made the wrong choices.\n  But let's look at exhibit 14, which covers the series of statements \nmade to Ms. Currie. At this point there is the testimony of Betty \nCurrie. She is reciting to the grand jury each of the statements the \nPresident made to her after his grand jury testimony.\n  The first: ``I was never really alone with Monica, right?''\n  Second: ``You were always there when Monica was there, right?''\n  ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''\n  I am not going to read each one of those. You can read them. You have \nheard those as well.\n  But the President is making those simple declaratory statements to \nher.\n  There are three areas that are covered.\n  First of all, the President makes a case that he was never alone with \nMonica Lewinsky.\n  Second, he is making a point to her that ``she was the aggressor, not \nme.''\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\n  The third point he is making, ``I did nothing wrong.''\n  Those are the basic three points of those five statements that the \nPresident made to Betty Currie.\n  During Betty Currie's grand jury testimony she was asked whether she \nbelieved that the President wished her to agree to the statements.\n  Let's look at Betty Currie for a second. She is the classical \nreluctant witness. Where are her loyalties? How would you examine her \ntestimony? Where is she uncomfortable in her testimony when she is \nasked the question? How does she shift in the chair? Those are the kind \nof ways you have to evaluate the truthfulness of the testimony, where \ntheir loyalties lie, and their demeanor.\n  During the questioning she was clearly reluctant.\n  She was asked a series of questions, and she finally acknowledges \nthat the President was intending for her to agree with the statements \nthat were made. She says, ``That is correct.'' And that is page 74 of \nBetty Currie's grand jury testimony.\n  When the President testified in the August 17 grand jury, he was \nquestioned about his intentions when he made those five statements to \nMs. Currie in his office on that Sunday. And the President's \nexplanation is as follows to the grand jury:\n  The President:\n\n       . . . I thought we were going to be deluged by the press \n     comments. And I was trying to refresh my memory about what \n     the facts were.\n\n  Then he goes on to testify:\n\n       So, I was not trying to get Betty Currie to say something \n     that was untruthful. I was trying to get as much information \n     as quickly as I could.\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, you have to determine what the \npurpose of those five statements to Betty Currie were. Were they to get \ninformation, or were they to get her to falsely testify when she was \ncalled as a witness? Logic tells us that the President's argument was \nthat he was just trying to refresh his memory. Well, so much of a novel \nlegal defense argument.\n  First, consider the President's options after he left the deposition.\n  He could have abided by the judge's gag order and not say anything.\n  Second, he could have called Betty Currie in and asked her an open-\nended question: Ms. Currie, or Betty, what do you remember happened?\n  The third option was to call her in and to make these declaratory \nstatements, violate the judge's order, and tamper with the anticipated \ntestimony of Betty Currie.\n  That is the course that the President chose. He made sure it was a \nface-to-face meeting, not a telephone call. He made sure that no one \nelse was present. He made sure that the meeting was on his territory \nand in his office where he could feel comfortable and he could utilize \nthe power and prestige of his office to have the greatest influence on \nher future testimony.\n  After Ms. Currie was in the President's office, he made short, clear, \nunderstandable, declarative statements telling Ms. Currie what the \nstory was. He was not interested in what she knew. Why? Because he knew \nthe truth, but he did not want Ms. Currie to tell the truth. The only \nway to ensure that was by telling her what to say, not asking her what \nshe remembered. You do not refresh someone's memory by telling that \nperson what he or she remembers, and you certainly do not make the \ndeclarative statements to someone regarding factual scenarios of which \nthe listener was unaware.\n  The statements that were made to her, Betty Currie could not have any \npossible knowledge about as to whether they were ever alone, as to \nwhether she came on to him. No. This was not any attempt for the \nPresident to refresh his recollection. It was witness tampering, pure \nand simple.\n  Understanding the seriousness of the President's attempting to \ninfluence the testimony of Ms. Currie, his attorneys have tried to \nargue that those statements could not constitute obstruction of justice \nbecause she had not been subpoenaed and the President did not know that \nshe was a potential witness at this time. Well, the argument is refuted \nby both the law and the facts.\n  The law is clear that a person may be convicted of obstructing \njustice if he corruptly influenced the testimony of a prospective \nwitness. The witness does not actually have to give testimony. The \nwitness does not have to be under any subpoena. The witness does not \nhave to be on any witness list. And so the law is clear.\n  Secondly, let's examine the defense in light of the facts. The \nPresident himself brought Ms. Currie into the civil rights case as a \ncorroborating witness when he repeatedly used her name in the \ndeposition, and just as significantly the President had to be concerned \nabout a looming perjury charge against him in light of his false \ntestimony in the deposition. At least six times in that deposition the \nPresident challenged the plaintiff's attorneys to question Ms. Currie \nabout the particular issue.\n  You don't have it in front of you, but you will see it when we \ndistribute the copies of my remarks. I will go through those six times.\n  At page 58 of the deposition, the President, when asked whether he \nwas alone with Ms. Lewinsky said that he was not alone with her or that \nBetty Currie was there with Monica.\n  At page 70, when asked about the last time the President saw Ms. \nLewinsky, he falsely testified he only recalled that she was there to \nsee Betty.\n  At page 64, he told the Jones lawyers to ``ask Betty'' whether \nLewinsky was alone with him in the White House or not or with Betty in \nthe White House between the late hours.\n  At page 65 of the deposition, the President was asked whether Ms. \nLewinsky sent packages to him, and he stated that Betty handled the \npackages.\n  At page 72, the President was asked whether he may have assisted in \nany way with a job search. He said he thought Betty suggested Vernon \nJordan talk to her.\n  At page 74, he said Monica asked Betty to ask someone to talk to \nAmbassador Richardson. He asserted Betty as a corroborating witness at \nleast six times in the deposition.\n  There is no question that Ms. Currie was a prospective witness, and \nthe President clearly wanted her to be deposed as a witness as his \n``ask Betty'' testimony demonstrates.\n  But there is another fact that, thus far, has been overlooked, and \nlet me draw your attention to this.\n  Two days before the President's deposition, Betty Currie receives a \ncall from Michael Isikoff, a reporter with Newsweek magazine, inquiring \nabout the records, the courier records of gifts going from Ms. Lewinsky \nto the President.\n  You've got a news reporter for a national publication two days before \nthe President's deposition talking to the President's secretary, \nsaying, ``I need to see the courier records at the White House.'' What \ndoes Betty Currie do? She testified that she probably told the \nPresident this. Then she tells Bruce Lindsey, but she also goes to see \nVernon Jordan. Why? Why would the secretary go see Vernon Jordan \nbecause she had a press inquiry? The reason is, as we see later on, \nremember, this is January 15th. What happened on December 28th that we \nwill get to a little bit later? December 28th Betty Currie went and put \nthose gifts under her bed. Why is she nervous? Because Mike Isikoff is \ncalling about the gifts that are presently under her bed, and she is \nnervous. I would be nervous. And so she goes to see Bruce Lindsey. She \ngoes to see Vernon Jordan. ``I need help. What do I do?'' And she \nprobably told the President.\n  It is all breaking loose, the house of cards is falling down, and she \nis either going to report to Mr. Jordan or to seek advice from him. \nEither way, she knows it is serious, and it all has legal consequences. \nAnd she is a witness to it all.\n  And not only does Betty Currie's testimony talk about this call from \nMichael Isikoff and going to see Vernon Jordan, but Vernon Jordan's \ntestimony confirms the visit as well.\n  The President claims he called Ms. Currie in to work on that Sunday \nnight only to find out what she knew, but the President knew the truth \nabout the relationship, and if he told the truth in deposition the day \nbefore, he would have had no reason to be refreshed by Betty Currie.\n  More importantly, the President's demeanor, Ms. Currie's reaction and \nthe suggested lies clearly prove that the President was not merely \ninterviewing Ms. Currie. Rather, he was\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nlooking for corroboration for his false coverup, and that is why he \ncoached her. He needed a witness for him, not against him.\n  Now, let's go to exhibit 5, Betty Currie's testimony--excuse me, \nexhibit 15.\n  This is Betty Currie's testimony before the grand jury on January 27, \n1998. And Betty Currie is asked about this. Now, remember, it was on a \nSunday that Betty Currie was first called into the White House to go \nthrough these five statements, this coaching by the President. And then \nshe testified to the grand jury:\n\n       Question: Did there come a time after that that you had \n     another conversation with the President about some other news \n     about what was going on? That would have been Tuesday or \n     Wednesday--when he called you into the Oval Office?\n\n  Betty Currie's answer:\n\n       It was Tuesday or Wednesday. I don't remember which one \n     this was, either. But the best I remember, when he called me \n     in the Oval Office, it was sort of a recapitulation of what \n     we had talked about on Sunday--you know, ``I was never alone \n     with her''--that sort of thing.\n       Question: Did he pretty much list the same----\n       Answer: To my recollection, sir, yes.\n       Question: And did he say it in sort of the same tone and \n     demeanor that he used the first time he told you on Sunday?\n       Answer: The best I remember, yes, sir.\n\n  And this needs to be emphasized. Not only was that witness coaching \ntaking place on Sunday, but it took place a couple days later. It was \ntwice repeated by the President to Betty Currie. He needed to have her \ngood and in line.\n  This is more than witness tampering. It is witness compulsion of \nfalse testimony by an employer to a subordinate employee. This has \nnothing to do with facts, nothing to do with media inquiries. It has to \ndo with keeping his team on board, keeping the ship from sinking, and \nhiding the facts that are important. At this point we are not talking \nabout hiding personal facts from inquiring minds but an effort to \nimpede the legitimate and necessary functioning of our court system.\n  And now let's go to the Martin Luther King holiday, almost exactly a \nyear ago, Monday, January 19. Again, you will see the example of the \nfrantic search for Monica Lewinsky did continue.\n  Exhibit 16. I am not going to go through all of this, but I just want \nto briefly show the frantic activity on this particular day.\n  First of all, you will see Betty Currie is trying to fulfill her \nresponsibility to get ahold of Ms. Lewinsky. She uses the pager system, \nand she says, ``Please call Kay at home.'' Now ``Kay'' is the code name \nthat is used for Betty Currie. That is the agreed upon signal. And she \nuses three messages: ``Please call Kay. Please call Kay. Please call \nKay.''\n  Then she starts using different techniques to get her attention. \n``It's a social call.'' And then she later uses it's a ``family \nemergency.'' Then she later uses it's ``good news.'' She is using every \nmeans possible to get the attention of Monica Lewinsky. And then at \n8:50 a.m. the President telephones Currie at home. At 8:56 a.m. the \nPresident telephones Jordan at home.\n  Go on down to 10:56 a.m. ``The President telephones Jordan at his \noffice.'' And so what is going on here? They are nervous; they are \nafraid; it is all breaking loose. They are trying to get ahold of \nMonica Lewinsky to find out what is going on, who she is talking to.\n  Later that day things continued to destabilize for the President. At \n4:54 p.m. Mr. Jordan learned from the attorney, Frank Carter, that he \nno longer represented Ms. Lewinsky, and so Mr. Jordan's link had been \ncut off. Mr. Jordan continued to attempt to reach the President or \nsomeone at the White House. Between 4:58 and 5:22 p.m., he made six \ncalls trying to get ahold of someone at the White House, the President.\n  When Mr. Jordan was asked about why he was urgently trying to get \nahold of the White House, he responded, ``Because the President asked \nme to get Monica Lewinsky a job'' and he thought it was ``information \nthey ought to have.'' Jordan finally reaches the President about 6 p.m. \nand tells him that [Mr.] Carter had been fired.\n\n  Why this flurry of activity? It shows how important it was for the \nPresident of the United States to find Ms. Lewinsky. Betty Currie was \nin charge of contacting Monica, and it could not happen, it did not \nhappen. Ms. Lewinsky was a co-conspirator in hiding this relationship \nfrom the Federal court and he was losing control over her. In fact, she \nultimately agreed to testify truthfully, under penalty of perjury, in \nthis matter. This was trouble for the President.\n  And, so, now let's continue; let's continue exploring the web of \nobstruction. But to do this, we have to backtrack to what I have \nalready referred to, and that was the incident on December 28, the \nepisode with the gifts.\n  On December 28, another brick in the wall of obstruction was laid. It \nwas the concealment of evidence. Ms. Lewinsky testified that she \ndiscussed with the President the fact that she had been subpoenaed and \nthat the subpoena called for her to produce gifts. And this is what Ms. \nLewinsky was telling the President at the meeting with him on December \n28. She testified before the grand jury that she recalled telling the \nPresident that the subpoena in question had requested a hatpin and \nother items, and this concerned her--the specificity of it. And the \nPresident responded it ``bothered'' him, too.\n  Well, let's look at the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, which is exhibit \n17. This is Lewinsky testifying about the meeting.\n\n       And then at some point I said to him [the President], \n     ``Well, you know, should I--maybe I should put the gifts away \n     outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, maybe \n     Betty.'' And he sort of said--I think he responded, ``I don't \n     know,'' or, ``Let me think about that,'' and left that topic.\n\n  Not exactly the response you would hope for or expect from the \nPresident. But the answer led to action. Later that day Ms. Lewinsky \ngot a call from Ms. Currie, who said, ``I understand you have something \nto give to me,'' or, according to Ms. Lewinsky, ``The President said \nyou have something to give me.'' She wasn't exactly sure of the phrase \nbut it was either, ``I understand you have something to give me,'' what \nBetty Currie said, or Betty Currie said, ``The President said you have \nsomething to give to me.''\n  And so, ladies and gentlemen, if you accept the testimony of Monica \nLewinsky on that point, you must conclude that the directive to \nretrieve the gifts came from the President. I will concede that there \nis a conflict in the testimony on this point with the testimony of \nBetty Currie. Ms. Currie, in her grand jury testimony, had a fuzzy \nmemory, a little different recollection. She testified that, ``the best \nshe can remember,'' Ms. Lewinsky called her. But whenever she was asked \nfurther, she said that maybe Ms. Lewinsky's memory is better than hers \non that issue. But there is helpful evidence to clear up this \ndiscrepancy, or this inconsistency. Monica, you will recall, in her \ndeposition said she thought that Betty had called her and she thought \nthat the call came from her cell phone number.\n  Well, it was not known at the time of the questioning of Monica \nLewinsky, but since then the cell phone record was retrieved. And you \ndon't have it in front of you, but it will be available. The cell phone \nrecord was retrieved that showed, on Betty Currie's cell phone calls, \nthat a call was made at 3:32, from Betty Currie to Monica Lewinsky. And \nthis confirms the testimony of Monica Lewinsky that the followup to get \nthe gifts came from Betty Currie. The only way she would know about it \nis if the President directed her to go retrieve the gifts, as was \ndiscussed with Monica earlier.\n  Now, the President will argue that Monica's timeline does not fit \nwith the time of the cell phone call. But remember, the cell phone \nrecord was retrieved subsequent to both the testimony of Monica \nLewinsky and Betty Currie before the grand jury, and therefore the \nrecord was not available to refresh the recollection or to make inquiry \nwith him about that. Monica Lewinsky's time estimates as to when Betty \nCurrie arrived to pick up the gifts was based upon her memory without \nthe benefit of records.\n  The questions raised by the President on this issue are legitimate \nand demonstrate the need to call the key witnesses to a trial of this \ncase and to assess which version of the events is believable and \nsubstantiated by the corroborating evidence. This is certainly an area \nof testimony where the juror needs to hear from Betty Currie and Monica \nLewinsky and to examine all of\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\nthe circumstantial evidence and documentary evidence to determine the \ntruth. It is my belief, based upon common sense and based upon the \ndocumentary evidence, that the testimony of Monica Lewinsky is \nsupported in the record and it leads to the conclusion that it was the \nPresident who initiated this retrieval of the gifts and the concealment \nof the evidence.\n  Now, there are many lawyers here in this room, and you know that in \nFederal cases all across this country judges instruct juries on \ncircumstantial evidence. We have presented to you a great amount of \ndirect evidence, grand jury testimony, eyewitness testimony, \ndocumentary evidence. But juries can use circumstantial evidence as \nwell. And a typical line from the instruction that is given in Federal \ncourts to Federal juries all across the land:\n\n       The law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight \n     or value to be given either to direct or circumstantial \n     evidence. Nor is a greater degree of certainty required of \n     circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence.\n\n  So I think it is incumbent upon you to evaluate the circumstances \nvery carefully in addition to the testimony.\n  Now, let's examine the key question for a moment. Why did Betty \nCurrie pick up the gifts from Monica Lewinsky? Monica Lewinsky states \nthat she did not request this and the retrieval was initiated by the \ncall from Betty Currie. This was after the meeting with the President. \nMonica Lewinsky's version is corroborated by the cell phone record and \nthe pattern of conduct on the part of Betty Currie. What do I mean by \nthat? As a loyal secretary to the President, it is inconceivable that \nshe would go to retrieve gifts that she knows the President is very \nconcerned about and could bring down the whole house. Betty Currie, a \nsubordinate employee, would not engage in such activity on such a \nsensitive matter without the approval and direction of the President \nhimself.\n  In addition, let's look further to the actions of Betty Currie. It \nbecomes clear that she understands the significance of these gifts, \ntheir evidentiary value in a civil rights case, and the fact that they \nare under subpoena. She retrieves these items, and where does she place \nthem? She hides them under her bed--significantly, a place of \nconcealment.\n  Now, let's look at the President's defense. The President stated in \nhis response to questions 24 and 25, that were submitted from the House \nto the President, he said he was not concerned about the gifts. In \nfact, he recalled telling Monica that if the Jones lawyers request the \ngifts, she should just turn them over to them. The President testified \nhe is ``not sure'' if he knew the subpoena asked for gifts.\n  Now, why in the world would Monica and the President discuss turning \nover gifts to the Jones lawyer if Ms. Lewinsky had not told him that \nthe subpoena asked for gifts? On the other hand, if he knew the \nsubpoena requested gifts, why would he give Monica more gifts on \nDecember 28? This seems odd. But Ms. Lewinsky's testimony reveals the \nanswer. She said that she never questioned ``that we were ever going to \ndo anything but keep this private,'' and that means to take ``whatever \nappropriate steps need to be taken.'' That is from Monica's grand jury \ntestimony of August 6.\n  Why would the President even meet with Monica Lewinsky on December 28 \nwhen their relationship was in question and he had a deposition coming \nup? Certainly he knew he would be questioned about it. Certainly if \nMonica became a witness she would be questioned about the relationship, \nthat she would be asked when was the last time you met with the \nPresident, and now they have to say December 28, if they were going to \ntell the truth.\n  The answer is, the President knew that he had to keep Monica Lewinsky \non the team and he was willing to take more risks so that she would \ncontinue to be a part of the conspiracy to obstruct the legitimate \nfunctions of the Federal court in a civil rights case.\n  It should be remembered that the President has denied each and every \nallegation of the two articles of impeachment, he has denied each \nelement of the obstruction of justice charges, including this \nallegation that he encouraged a scheme to conceal evidence in a civil \nrights case. This straightforward denial illustrates the dispute in the \nevidence and testimony. It sets the credibility of Monica Lewinsky, the \ncredibility of Betty Currie, the credibility of Vernon Jordan, and \nothers against the credibility of the President of the United States.\n  How can you, as jurors, determine who is telling the truth? I have \npointed to the corroborating evidence, the circumstantial evidence, as \nwell as common sense supporting the testimony of Monica Lewinsky. But \nlet me ask you two questions: Can you convict the President of the \nUnited States without hearing personally the testimony of one of the \nkey witnesses? The second question is: Can you dismiss the charges \nunder this strong set of facts and circumstances without hearing and \nevaluating the credibility of key witnesses?\n  Let me take this a step further and evaluate the credibility of the \nPresident. Let's first look back at his testimony on the December 28 \nmeeting that he gave in his deposition. In that case, he seriously \nmisrepresented the nature of his meeting with Ms. Lewinsky, and that \nwas the gift exchange. First he was asked:\n\n       Question: Did she tell you that she had been served with a \n     subpoena in this case?\n\n  The President answered flatly, ``No. I don't know if she had been.''\n  Again, this is his testimony in the deposition. He was also asked in \nthe deposition if he ``ever talked to Monica Lewinsky about the \npossibility of her testifying.'' His answer: ``I'm not sure * * *,'' he \nsaid. He then added that he may have joked that the Jones lawyers might \nsubpoena every woman he has ever spoken to, and that ``I don't think we \never had more of a conversation than that about it * * *.''\n  Not only does Monica Lewinsky directly contradict his testimony, but \nthe President later had to answer questions in the grand jury about \nthese same set of circumstances and the President directly contradicted \nhimself. Speaking of this December 28 meeting, he said that he ``knew \nby then, of course, that she had gotten a subpoena'' and they had a \n``conversation about the possibility of her testifying.''\n  I submit to this body that the inconsistencies of the President's own \ntestimony, as well as common sense, seriously diminish his credibility \non this issue.\n  Now let's go forward, once again, to the time period in which the \nPresident gave his deposition in the Paula Jones case. The President \ntestified under oath on January 17, and immediately thereafter, \nremember, he brought Betty Currie in to present a set of false facts to \nher, seeking her agreement and coaching her.\n  But the President is fully convinced that he can get by with his \nfalse denials because no one will be able to prove what did or did not \nhappen in the Oval Office. There were no witnesses, and it boils down \nto a ``he said, she said'' scenario, and as long as that is the case, \nhe believes he can win. If the President can simply destroy Monica \nLewinsky's credibility in public and before the grand jury, then he \nwill escape the consequences for his false statements under oath and \nobstruction in the civil rights case. Now, remember, this viewpoint, \nthough, is all before the DNA tests were performed on the blue dress, \nforcing the President to acknowledge certain items.\n  In order to carry out this coverup and obstruction, the President \nneeded to go further. He needed not only Betty Currie to repeat his \nfalse statements, but also other witnesses who would assuredly be \ncalled before the Federal grand jury and who would be questioned by the \nnews media in public forums. And this brings us to the false statements \nthat the President made to his White House staff and Presidential \naides.\n  Let's call Sydney Blumenthal and John Podesta to the witness stand. I \nconcede they would be adverse witnesses. This is referred to in exhibit \n18 that you have in front of you.\n  First, the testimony of Sydney Blumenthal. Mr. Blumenthal, to put \nthis in perspective, is testifying about his conversations when the \nPresident called him in to go through these facts of what happened. So \nMr. Blumenthal testified that ``it was at that point that he''--\nreferring to the President--``gave his account as to what happened to \nme and he said that Monica--and it came\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\nvery fast. He said, `Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual \ndemand on me.' He rebuffed her. He said, `I've gone down that road \nbefore, I've caused pain for a lot of people and I'm not going to do \nthat again.' ''\n  Look at this next line. ``She threatened him. She said that she would \ntell people they'd had an affair, that she was known as the stalker \namong her peers, and that she hated it and if she had an affair or said \nshe had an affair then she wouldn't be the stalker any more.''\n  He talks about this character in a novel, and I haven't read that \nbook. But the last line: ``And I said to him, I said, ``When this \nhappened with Monica Lewinsky, were you alone?' He said, `Well, I was \nwithin eyesight or earshot of someone.' ''\n\n  Let's go to John Podesta's testimony where he was called in the same \nfashion. The President talked to him about what is happening:\n\n       Question: Okay. Share that with us.\n       Answer: Well, I think he said--he said that--there was some \n     spate of, you know, what sex acts were counted, and he said \n     that he had never had sex with her in any way whatsoever.\n       Question: Okay.\n       Answer: --that they had not had oral sex.\n\n  Very briefly, Dick Morris. You have heard this. I will refer to the \nlast line: `` `They're just not ready for it,' meaning the voters. And \nhe [The President] said, `Well, we just have to win, then.' ''\n  As the President testified before the grand jury, he knew these \nwitnesses would be called before the grand jury. At page 106 of the \nPresident's testimony before the grand jury--I just want to confirm \nthis point because it is important--he testified--the question was: \n``You know that they''--and this is referring to John Podesta, Sydney \nBlumenthal and his aides-- ``that they might be witnesses, you knew \nthey might be called into the grand jury, didn't you?''\n  His answer: ``That's right.''\n  So there is no question these were witnesses going to testify before \nthe grand jury. He was giving them false information, and he did not \nlimit it to that. The false statements to them constitute witness \ntampering and obstruction of justice.\n  I think there are two significant points in the statements the \nPresident made to his aides.\n  First of all, the President who wants to do away with the politics of \npersonal destruction indicates a willingness to destroy the credibility \nand reputation of a young person who worked in his office for what \nreason? In order to preserve not only his Presidency but, more \nsignificantly, to defeat the civil rights case against him. It is not a \nmatter of saying he didn't do it, because he could have simply uttered \na denial, but he engaged in character assassination that he knew would \nbe repeated to the Federal grand jury and throughout the public--she \nwas a stalker, she threatened me, she came on to me, and it was--it was \nrepeated.\n  Secondly, he makes it clear in his statements to John Podesta that he \ndenies any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, including oral sex. \nThere is no quibbling about definitions in this statement. It clearly \nreflects an attempt to deceive, lie and obstruct our system of justice.\n  In this case, at every turn, he used whatever means available to \nevade the truth, destroy evidence, tamper with witnesses and took any \nother action required to prevent evidence from coming forward in a \ncivil rights case that would prove a truth contrary to the President's \ninterest. He had obstructed the administration of justice before the \nU.S. district court in a civil rights case and before the Federal grand \njury. But as we move toward a conclusion, let's not focus just on the \nsupporting cast we talked about, but we need to look at the direct and \npersonal actions of the President.\n  I want to look at exhibit 20. This just summarizes the seven pillars \nof obstruction. What did the President do that constitutes evidence of \nobstruction?\n  No. 1, he personally encouraged a witness, Monica Lewinsky, to \nprovide false testimony.\n  No. 2, the President had direct involvement in assuring a job for a \nwitness--underlining direct involvement. He made the calls, Vernon \nJordan did, and it is connected with the filing of the false affidavit \nby that witness.\n  No. 3, the President personally, with corrupt intentions, tampered \nwith the testimony of a prospective witness, Betty Currie.\n  No. 4, the President personally provided false statements under oath \nbefore a Federal grand jury.\n  No. 5, by direct and circumstantial evidence the President personally \ndirected the concealment of evidence under subpoena in a judicial \nproceeding.\n  No. 6, the President personally allowed false representations to be \nmade by his attorney, Robert Bennett, to a Federal district judge on \nJanuary 17.\n  No. 7, the President intentionally provided false information to \nwitnesses before a Federal grand jury knowing that those statements \nwould be repeated with the intent to obstruct the proceedings before \nthat grand jury and that is the statements that he made to the aides.\n  The seven pillars of this obstruction case were personally \nconstructed by the President of the United States. It was done with the \nintent that the truth and evidence would be suppressed in a civil \nrights case pending against him. The goal was to win, and he was not \ngoing to let the judicial system stand in his way.\n\n  At the beginning of my presentation, I tried to put this case into \nperspective for myself by saying that this proceeding is the same as to \nwhat takes place in every courtroom in America--the pursuit of truth, \nseeking equal justice, and upholding the law. All of that is true. But \nwe know there is even more at stake in this trial. What happens here \naffects the workings of our Constitution, it will affect the Presidency \nin future decades, and it will have an impact on a whole generation of \nAmericans. What is at stake is our Constitution and the principle of \nequal justice for all.\n  I have faith in the Constitution of the United States, but the checks \nand balances of the Constitution are carried out by individuals--\nindividuals who are entrusted under oath with upholding the trust given \nto us by the people of this great land. If I believe in the \nConstitution, that it will work, then I must believe in you.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I trust the Constitution of the \nUnited States. But today it is most important that I believe in you. I \nhave faith in the U.S. Senate. You have earned the trust of the \nAmerican people, and I trust each of you to make the right decision for \nour country.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that we take \nanother 15-minute break in the proceedings. And I urge the Senators to \nreturn promptly to the Chamber so we can begin after the 15-minute \nbreak.\n  There being no objection, at 4:51 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n5:10 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we are ready to resume final \npresentation of the afternoon. Several Senators have inquired what will \nhappen the balance of the day. I believe the presentation by \nCongressman Rogan will be the last of the day. It is anticipated we \nwill complete today's presentation around 6:30 or 6:45.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Rogan.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, counsel for the President, \nMembers of the United States Senate, my name is Congressman James E. \nRogan. I represent the 27th District of California.\n  May I say at the outset that some of the facts and evidence you will \nhear in my presentation may sound familiar in light of the last \npresentation. Although at times the facts may appear to be a crossover, \nthe relevance will be presented in a different light.\n  Mr. Manager Hutchinson's presentation offered the evidence as it \nrelates to the obstruction of justice charge against the President in \narticle II. I will be inviting this body to view the evidence within \nthe framework of article I, perjury before the grand jury.\n  On behalf of the House of Representatives and in the name of the \npeople of the United States, I will be presenting\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nto the Senate evidence against the President to demonstrate he \ncommitted perjury before a Federal grand jury as set forth in article I \nof the articles of impeachment.\n  Article I of the impeachment resolution against President Clinton \nalleges that he committed perjury before the grand jury.\n  On August 17, 1998, President Clinton swore to tell the truth, the \nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth. The evidence shows that \ncontrary to that oath, the President willfully provided perjurious, \nfalse, and misleading statements to the grand jury in four general \nareas:\n  First, he perjured himself when he gave a false accounting to the \ngrand jury about the nature and details of his relationship with a 21-\nyear-old intern, Ms. Monica Lewinsky, who was a subordinate Federal \nGovernment employee.\n  Second, he perjured himself before the grand jury when he repeated \nprevious perjured answers he gave under oath in a sexual harassment \nsuit, which was a Federal civil rights action brought against him by \nPaula Jones.\n  Third, he perjured himself before the grand jury when he repeated \nprevious perjured answers to justify his attorney's false \nrepresentations to a Federal judge in the Paula Jones sexual harassment \nlawsuit against him.\n  Finally, he perjured himself before the grand jury when he testified \nfalsely about his attempts to get other potential grand jury witnesses \nto tell false stories to the grand jury, and to prevent the discovery \nof evidence in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against him.\n  In a judicial proceeding, a witness has a very solemn obligation to \ntell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Perjury is a \nserious crime because our judicial system can only succeed if citizens \nare required to tell the truth in court proceedings. If witnesses may \nlie with impunity for personal or political reasons, ``justice'' is no \nlonger the product of the court system, and we descend into chaos. That \nis why the U.S. Supreme Court has placed a premium on truthful \ntestimony and shows no tolerance for perjury.\n  More than 20 years ago, the Supreme Court addressed this very concept \nof perjury and its dangerous effect on our system of law. Listen to the \nwords of the U.S. Supreme Court:\n\n       In this constitutional process of securing a witness' \n     testimony, perjury simply has no place whatever. Perjured \n     testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic \n     concepts of judicial proceedings. . . . Congress has made the \n     giving of false answers a criminal act punishable by severe \n     penalties; in no other way can criminal conduct be flushed \n     into the open where the law can deal with it.\n\n  That is the framework under which the House of Representatives acted \nin impeaching the President of the United States, and now respectfully \nurges this body to call the President to constitutional accountability.\n  The key to understanding the facts of this case is to understand why \nthe President was asked, under oath, questions about his private life \nin the first place.\n  Despite the popular spin, it wasn't because Members of Congress or \nlawyers from the Office of the Independent Counsel, or a gaggle of \nreporters suddenly decided to invade the President's privacy. No. This \nall came about because of a claim against the President from when he \nwas the Governor of Arkansas.\n  During the discovery phase of the Paula Jones sexual harassment case \nagainst the President, Federal Judge Susan Webber Wright ordered him to \nanswer questions under oath relating to any sexual relationship he may \nhave had while Governor and President with subordinate female \nGovernment employees. These orders are common in similar cases, and the \nquestions posed to President Clinton are questions routinely posed to \ndefendants in civil rights sexual harassment cases every single day in \ncourthouses throughout the land.\n  During the President's deposition in the Paula Jones case, he was \nasked questions about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The judge \nallowed these questions because they possibly could lead Mrs. Jones to \ndiscover if there was any pattern of conduct to help prove her case. \nThe President repeatedly denied that he had a sexual relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky.\n  A few days later, the story about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky \nbroke in the press. A criminal investigation began to determine whether \nthe President perjured himself in the Paula Jones sexual harassment \ncase and obstructed justice by trying to defeat her claim against him \nby corrupt means.\n  On the afternoon of August 17, 1998, President Clinton raised his \nright hand and took an oath before the grand jury in their criminal \ninvestigation.\n  (Text of Videotape presentation:)\n\n       William Jefferson Clinton, Do you solemnly swear that the \n     testimony you are about to give in this matter will be the \n     truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help \n     you God?\n\n  Note the incredibly solemn obligation of the oath the President took:\n\n       Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to \n     give in this matter will be the truth, the whole truth, and \n     nothing but the truth?\n\n  When the President made that solemn pledge, he was not obliging \nhimself to tell the grand jury the partial truth, he was not obliging \nhimself to tell the ``I didn't want to be particularly helpful'' truth; \nhe was not obliging himself to tell the ``this is embarrassing so I \nthink I'll fudge on it a little bit'' truth. He was required to tell \nthe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and he made that \npledge in the name of God.\n  The attorneys for the Office of the Independent Counsel showed great \ndeference to the President when they questioned him that day. The \nPresident's attorneys were allowed to be there with him during the \nentire proceeding so that he could confer with them at his leisure if \nhe was unsure of how to respond to a question. As a matter of fact, the \nattorney who questioned the President encouraged him to confer with his \nlawyers if there arose in the President's mind any reason to hesitate \nbefore answering a question.\n  The following exchange occurred at the beginning of the President's \ntestimony. The President was told:\n\n       Normally, grand jury witnesses, while not allowed to have \n     attorneys in the grand jury room with them, can stop and \n     consult with their attorneys. Under our arrangement today, \n     your attorneys are here and present for consultation and you \n     can break to consult them as necessary. . . . Do you \n     understand that, sir?\n\n  The President responded: ``I do understand that.''\n  As a practical matter, the President had three options as he appeared \nbefore the grand jury to testify.\n  First, the President could tell the truth about his true relationship \nwith Miss Lewinsky.\n  However, the evidence will clearly show that the president rejected \nthe option of telling the truth.\n  Second, the President knew he could invoke his Fifth Amendment \nprivilege against self-incrimination.\n  The independent counsel's attorney explicitly reminded the President \nabout his right to refuse to answer any question that might tend to \nincriminate him.\n  The President was asked:\n\n       You have a privilege against self-incrimination. If a \n     truthful answer to any question would tend to incriminate \n     you, you can invoke the privilege and that invocation will \n     not be used against you. Do you understand that?\n\n  The President's response was: ``I do.''\n  The President knew he had the right to refuse to answer any \nincriminating questions and that no legal harm would have come to him \nfor doing so.\n  But he rejected this option, just as he rejected the option of \ntelling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n  Instead, he selected a third path.\n  He continued to lie about corrupt efforts to destroy Paula Jones' \ncivil rights lawsuit against him.\n  If a trial is permitted before this body where live witnesses can be \ncalled, and where their credibility can be scrutinized, the evidence \nwill show this distinguished body that the course the President charted \nwas a course of perjury.\n  Despite the president's unique level of judicial sophistication and \nexpertise, the attorneys at the grand jury were careful to make sure \nthe president understood his responsibilities to tell the truth, the \nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n  They did this at the outset of his testimony, before any questions \nwere asked that might tempt the president to lie under oath.\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\n  And they specifically warned him that if he were to lie or \nintentionally mislead the grand jury, he could face perjury and \nobstruction of justice charges, both of which are felonies under \nfederal law.\n  This exchange occurred before the President's testimony:\n\n       Q: Mr. President, you understand that your testimony here \n     today is under oath?\n       A: I do.\n       Q: And you understand that because you have sworn to tell \n     the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, that \n     if you were to lie or intentionally mislead the grand jury, \n     you could be prosecuted for perjury and/or obstruction of \n     justice?\n       A: I believe that's correct.\n       Q: Is there anything that . . . I've stated to you \n     regarding your rights and responsibilities that you would \n     like me to clarify or that you don't understand?\n       A: No, sir.\n\n  Despite this ominous warning, the prosecutors continued emphasizing \nthe need for the President to resist lying to the grand jury.\n  Still intent on making sure the President understood his obligations, \nthe attorneys further advised him:\n\n       Q: Mr. President, I would like to read for you a portion of \n     Federal Rule of Evidence 603, which discusses the important \n     function the oath has in our judicial system.\n       It says that the purpose of the oath is . . . calculated to \n     awaken the witness' conscience and impress the witness' mind \n     with the duty to tell the truth.\n       Could you please tell the grand jury what that oath means \n     to you for today's testimony?\n       A: I have sworn an oath to tell the grand jury the truth, \n     and that's what I intend to do.\n  When the President said in that very last answer I just read that he \nswore an oath to tell the grand jury ``the truth,'' the prosecutor \nimmediately followed up with this question. Here is what he was told.\n  Question to the President:\n\n       Q: You understand that [the oath] requires you to give the \n     whole truth, that is, a complete answer to each question, \n     sir?\n       A: I will answer each question as accurately and fully as I \n     can.\n\n  One would think these repetitive explanations would be enough to warn \neven the most legally unsophisticated witness about the need to treat a \ngrand jury criminal investigation seriously, and the need to tell the \nwhole truth at any cost.\n  No reasonable person could believe at this point that the President \ndid not understand his obligations.\n  Yet, just to be sure, the attorneys again impressed on the President \nhis solemn duty to tell the truth:\n  Question to the President:\n\n       Q: Now, you took the same oath to tell the truth, the whole \n     truth, and nothing but the truth on January 17th, 1998, in a \n     deposition in the Paula Jones litigation; is that correct, \n     sir?\n       A: I did take an oath then.\n       Q: Did the oath you took on that occasion mean the same to \n     you then as it does today?\n       A: I believed then that I had to answer the questions \n     truthfully. That is correct.  . . .\n       Q: And it meant the same to you then as it does today?\n       A: Well, no one read me a definition then and we didn't go \n     through this exercise then.\n       I swore an oath to tell the truth, and I believed I was \n     bound to be truthful and I tried to be.\n\n  Having just received his ``refresher course'' on either ``taking the \nFifth'' and remaining silent, or telling the whole truth and nothing \nbut the truth, the president acknowledged he was required to tell the \ntruth when he gave answers to questions 8 months earlier in the Paula \nJones sexual harassment civil rights lawsuit.\n  Question to the President:\n\n       Q: At the Paula Jones deposition, you were represented by \n     Mr. Robert Bennett, your counsel, is that correct?\n       A: That is correct.\n       Q: He was authorized by you to be your representative \n     there, your attorney, is that correct?\n       A: That is correct.\n       Q: Your counsel, Mr. Bennett, indicated . . . and I'm \n     quoting, ``The President intends to give full and complete \n     answers as Ms. Jones is entitled to have.''\n       My question to you is, do you agree with your counsel that \n     a plaintiff in a sexual harassment case is, to use his words, \n     entitled to have the truth?\n       A: I believe that I was bound to give truthful answers, \n     yes, sir.\n       Q: But the question is, sir, do you agree with your counsel \n     that a plaintiff in a sexual harassment case is entitled to \n     have the truth?\n       A. I believe when a witness is under oath in a civil case, \n     or otherwise under oath, the witness should do everything \n     possible to answer the questions truthfully.\n\n  Thus, the groundwork was laid for the President to testify under \noath.\n  He knew how the rules worked respecting testimony before the grand \njury.\n  If a question was vague or ambiguous, the President could ask for a \nclarification.\n  If he was unsure how to answer, or indeed whether to answer a \nquestion, he could stop the questioning, take a break, and consult \nprivately with his attorneys who were present with him.\n  If giving an answer would tend to incriminate him, he could refuse to \nanswer the question by claiming his Fifth Amendment rights.\n  But if, after all of this, he decided to give an answer, the answer \nhe gave was required to be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but \nthe truth. And it was no different than the obligation when he \ntestified in the Paula Jones deposition--the same oath, the same \nobligation.\n\n  Let's look at how the President chose to meet his obligation.\n  As noted in my opening remarks, the President's grand jury perjury is \nthe basis for article I of the impeachment resolution. The evidence \nshows, and live witnesses clearly will demonstrate, that the President \nrepeatedly committed perjury before the grand jury when he testified as \na defendant in a sexual harassment civil rights lawsuit against him.\n  He intentionally failed in his lawful obligation to tell the truth in \nfour general areas. First, the President committed perjury before the \ngrand jury when he testified about the nature of his relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky, a 21-year-old White House intern who, by definition, \nwas a subordinate Government employee.\n  On December 5, 1995, Monica Lewinsky's name appeared on the Paula \nJones witness list. Later, the President was ordered by Federal Judge \nSusan Webber Wright to answer questions about Monica Lewinsky because \nthe President was a defendant in a sexual harassment case.\n  At his deposition in the Paula Jones case, the President was shown a \ndefinition approved by Judge Wright of what constitutes sexual \nrelations. I am going to read the definition that was presented to the \nPresident.\n  And let me say at the outset that I am going to slightly sanitize it. \nYou have in your materials, Members of this body, a copy of the actual \ndefinition that was given to you, so you will be able to understand \nprecisely what was put before the President.\n  Definition of sexual relations: ``For the purposes of this \ndeposition, a person engages in sexual relations when the person \nknowingly engages in or causes contact with the [certain enumerated \nbody parts] of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the \nsexual desire of any person.''\n  Members of the Senate, just for clarification, I did not feel the \nneed to actually relate to this body what those enumerated body parts \nare.\n  After reviewing the deposition, the President then denied that he \never had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. As we have already \nseen, from the day in January when the President testified in the Jones \ndeposition until the day he appeared in August for his grand jury \ntestimony, he vehemently denied ever having a sexual relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky.\n  Listen to the President addressing the American people on the subject \nof his credibility. The date is January 26, 1998, 5 days after the \nLewinsky story broke in the press.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       ``But I want to say one thing to the American people. I \n     want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again.''\n       ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman--Miss \n     Lewinsky.''\n       ``I never told anybody to lie--not a single time. Never. \n     These allegations are false. And I need to go back to work \n     for the American people.''\n       ``Thank you.''\n\n  Beginning in January 1998, the President went on an 8-month campaign, \nboth under oath and in the press, denying any sexual relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky in any way, shape, or form. But 8 months after his \ndeposition testimony and these passionate denials, the tide had turned \nagainst his story. By August, Monica Lewinsky was now cooperating with \nthe office of the independent counsel. If she was telling the truth in \nher sworn testimony, then the President's January denial in the Paula \nJones case would\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nhave been a clear case of him committing perjury and obstructing \njustice.\n  Why? Because she was describing, in very graphic detail, conduct \noccurring between her and the President that clearly fit the definition \nof ``sexual relations'' as used in the Paula Jones deposition--conduct \nthat he repeatedly denied under oath.\n  So by the time the President sat down for his grand jury testimony to \nanswer these questions under oath, he had put himself in a huge box. He \ncould not continue the outright lie because Ms. Lewinsky had turned \nover her blue dress for DNA testing, and at the time of his grand jury \ntestimony he didn't know what the results were of that FBI test. Under \nsuch circumstances, continuing the lie was too risky of a strategy even \nfor the most accomplished of gamblers. But if he told the truth, his \nearlier perjury and obstruction of justice would have ended his \nPresidency. He was sure he would have been driven from office.\n  Remember that the President had actually authorized that a poll be \ntaken for him by Dick Morris, and the poll wasn't just taken on whether \nthe American people would forgive him for adultery; the President asked \nDick Morris to poll in two other areas. He asked Dick Morris to poll \nwhether the American people would forgive him for perjury and \nobstruction of justice. When he got the poll results back, he learned \nthat the American people would forgive him for the adultery but they \nwould not forgive him for perjury or for obstruction of justice.\n  Once he got the bad news from Dick Morris that his political career \nwas over if he perjured himself, he told Dick Morris, ``We'll just have \nto win.'' So at his grand jury testimony, once the first question was \nasked about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the President \nproduced a prepared statement and read from it. This prepared statement \nhe read to the grand jury on August 17, 1998, was the linchpin in his \nplan to ``win.''\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n       Q. Mr. President, were you physically intimate with Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       A. Mr. Bittman, I think maybe I can save you and the grand \n     jurors a lot of time if I read a statement, which I think \n     will make it clear what the nature of my relationship with \n     Ms. Lewinsky was and how it related to the testimony I gave, \n     what I was trying to do in that testimony. And I think it \n     will perhaps make it possible for you to ask even more \n     relevant questions from your point of view. And, with your \n     permission, I'd like to read that statement.\n       Q. Absolutely. Please, Mr. President.\n       A. When I was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions \n     in early 1996 and once in early 1997, I engaged in conduct \n     that was wrong. These encounters did not consist of sexual \n     intercourse. They did not constitute sexual relations as I \n     understood that term to be defined at my January 17th, 1998 \n     deposition. But they did involve inappropriate intimate \n     contact.\n       These inappropriate encounters ended, at my insistence, in \n     early 1997. I also had occasional telephone conversations \n     with Ms. Lewinsky that included inappropriate sexual banter.\n       I regret that what began as a friendship came to include \n     this conduct. I take full responsibility for my actions. \n     While I will provide the grand jury whatever other \n     information I can, because of privacy considerations \n     affecting my family, myself, and others, and in an effort to \n     preserve the dignity of the office I hold, this is all I will \n     say about the specifics of these particular matters.\n       I will try to answer to the best of my ability other \n     questions, including questions about my relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, questions about my understanding of the term of \n     sexual relations, as I understood it to be defined at my \n     January 17th, 1998, deposition, and questions concerning \n     alleged subordination of perjury, obstruction of justice and \n     intimidation of witnesses.\n       That . . . is my statement.\n\n  Beyond that statement, the President generally refused to answer \nspecific questions about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The \nPresident used that prepared statement as a substitute answer for \nspecific questions about his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky 19 separate \ntimes during his testimony before the grand jury. The purpose of the \nprepared statement was to avoid answering the types of specific \nharassment lawsuit questions for which the U.S. Supreme Court and Judge \nSusan Webber Wright had earlier cleared the way. The evidence shows the \nPresident used this prepared statement in order to justify the \nperjurious answers he gave at his deposition which were intended to \naffect the outcome of the Paula Jones case. The fact that this \nstatement was prepared in advance shows his intent to mislead the grand \njury in this very area. Ironically, this prepared statement was \nsupposed to inoculate the President from perjury. Instead, it opened \nhim up to 19 more examples of giving perjurious, false, and misleading \nanswers under oath.\n\n  For example, in that prepared statement, the President said his \nsexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky began in 1996, and not in 1995, as Ms. \nLewinsky had testified. This was not a mere slip of memory over a \nmeaningless timeframe; there is a discrepancy in the dates for a \nreason. You see, under the President's version, in 1996 Monica Lewinsky \nwas a paid White House employee. Under the facts as testified to by Ms. \nLewinsky, when the relationship really began in 1995, she was not a \npaid employee at the White House, she was a young, 21-year-old White \nHouse intern.\n  The concept of a President having a sexual relationship in the White \nHouse with a young intern less than half his age was a public relations \ndisaster for the President, as everyone vividly remembers. It is clear \nthat the President somehow viewed the concept as less combustible if he \ncould take the ``young intern'' phrase out of the public lexicon. Yet, \nin his deposition testimony, the President admitted he met her and saw \nher when she was an intern working in the White House in November 1995, \nduring the Government shutdown. Monica Lewinsky confirmed this. In \nfact, she testified that the first time she ever spoke to the President \nwas on November 15, 1995, during the Government shutdown. And she also \nsaid that the very first time that she ever spoke to the President was \nthe same day he invited her back to the Oval Office and began a sexual \nrelationship with her.\n  It is obvious that the reference in the President's prepared \nstatement to the grand jury that this relationship began in 1996 was \nintentionally false.\n  The President's statement was intentionally misleading when he \ndescribed being alone with Ms. Lewinsky only on certain occasions. \nActually, they were alone in the White House at least 20 times and had \nat least 11 sexual encounters at the White House. The President \nattempted to use language that subtly minimized the number of times \nthey were alone.\n  The President's statement was intentionally misleading when he \ndescribed his telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky as \n``occasional.'' In fact, there are at least 55 documented telephone \nconversations between the President of the United States and the young \nintern. And, without going into further graphic detail, the evidence \nshows that, at least on 17 of those occasions, those conversations \nincluded much more than mere sexual banter, as the President described \nit.\n  The most unsettling part of that statement was uttered near the \nclose. Listen to what the President said: ``I regret that what began as \na friendship came to include this conduct.'' ``Friendship.'' The very \nday the President met and spoke with a young White House intern for the \nfirst time was the day he invited her back to the Oval Office to \nperform sex acts on him.\n  In fact, Monica Lewinsky said that after their sexual relationship \nwas over a month old, she didn't even think the President knew her \nname. The President's statement about his relationship with Monica \nLewinsky beginning as a friendship is a callous and deceptive \nmischaracterization of how his relationship with this young woman \nreally began.\n  Thus, the President began his deposition testimony by reading a false \nand misleading statement to the grand jury. He then used that statement \nas an excuse not to answer specific questions that were directly \nrelevant to allowing the grand jury to complete its criminal \ninvestigation. Had he given specific answers to specific questions \nabout the true nature of his relationship, the grand jury would have \nbeen able to learn the whole truth about whether the President perjured \nhimself and obstructed justice in the Paula Jones sexual harassment \ncivil rights lawsuit.\n  Paula Jones had a legal and constitutional right to learn if the \nPresident, while as President or Governor, used his position of power \nand influence to get sexual favors from subordinate female employees in \nthe workplace or to reward subordinate female employees\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\nfor granting such favors to him. Instead, the President intentionally \nprovided on 19 separate occasions a misleading statement instead of \ngiving a true characterization of his conduct, as required by his oath.\n  He had no legal or constitutional right to refuse to answer such \nquestions without claiming a fifth amendment privilege and then \nallowing Judge Wright to make a determination as to whether the \nprivilege applied. The President's preliminary statement delivered 19 \ntimes was an initial shot across the perjury bow offered by the \nPresident throughout his grand jury testimony. It showed a premeditated \neffort to thwart the grand jury's criminal investigation, to justify \nhis prior wrongdoing, and to deny Paula Jones her constitutional right \nto bring forward her claim in a court of law.\n  The President gave further perjurious, false, and misleading \ntestimony regarding the nature and details of his relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky. One of the ways the President tried to justify his \nperjurious answers in the Jones deposition about his relationship was \nto deconstruct the English language. Remember, the President was shown \na copy of the definition of ``sexual relations'' that Judge Wright \napproved in his January deposition. This definition was directed by \nJudge Wright to be used as the guide under which the President was to \nanswer questions about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. After \ncarefully reviewing that definition, the President said under oath that \nit did not apply to his relationship with her.\n\n  It is important to remember that at the time the President testified \nthat he never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, this was not a \nrisky perjury strategy. After all, he had successfully used Vernon \nJordan to get Monica Lewinsky a good job in New York, despite her \nquestionable qualifications. She had filed a false affidavit in the \nJones case denying a sexual relationship with the President. She and \nthe President had previously agreed to comprehensive cover stories to \ndeny the truth of their relationship if anyone ever confronted them \nabout it. And the bevy of gifts the President had given to Monica were \nnow nestled safely under Betty Currie's bed so that they would never be \nproduced to or discovered by Mrs. Jones' attorneys in compliance with \ntheir subpoena to have those gifts produced.\n  The perjury strategy was a safe bet in January at his deposition, but \nit soon turned upside-down for the President. By the time of his grand \njury testimony in August, the President knew things had changed \ndrastically, but not in his favor. In light of Ms. Lewinsky's \ncooperation with the independent counsel, the impending FBI report on \nthe DNA testing on the blue dress, and the President's decision not to \nconfess to his crime, the President needed to come up with some excuse. \nHere is how the President, at his August grand jury appearance, tried \nto explain away his January deposition denial of engaging in sexual \nrelations with Monica Lewinsky.\n  (Text of video tape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Did you understand the words in the first portion of the \n     [Jones deposition] exhibit, Mr. President, that is, ``For the \n     purposes of this deposition, a person engages in `sexual \n     relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes . . \n     .''?\n       Did you understand, do you understand the words there in \n     that phrase?\n       A. Yes . . . I can tell you what my understanding of the \n     definition is, if you want . . . My understanding of this \n     definition is it covers contact by the person being deposed \n     with the enumerated areas, if the contact is done with an \n     intent to arouse or gratify. That's my understanding of the \n     definition.\n       Q. What did you believe the definition to include and \n     exclude? What kinds of activities?\n       A. I thought the definition included any activity by the \n     person being deposed, where the person was the actor and came \n     into contact with those parts of the bodies with the purpose \n     or intent of gratification, and excluded any other activity. \n     For example, kissing's not covered by that, I don't think.\n       Q. Did you understand the definition to be limited to \n     sexual activity?\n       A. Yes, I understood the definition to be limited to \n     physical contact with those areas of the body with the \n     specific intent to arouse or gratify. That's what I \n     understood it to be.\n       Q. What specific acts did the definition include, as you \n     understood the definition on January 17th, 1998?\n       A. Any contact with the areas that are mentioned, sir. If \n     you contacted those parts of the body with an intent to \n     arouse or gratify, that is covered.\n       Q. What did you understand . . .\n       A. The person being deposed. If the person being deposed \n     contacted those parts of another person's body with an intent \n     to arouse or gratify, that was covered.\n\n  If that answer sounds confusing to you, there is a reason for that. \nIt was meant to be.\n  What the President now was saying to the grand jury is that during \ntheir intimate relationship in the Oval Office, Monica Lewinsky had \nsexual relations with him; he didn't have sexual relations with her.\n  Consider that for a minute.\n  The President is asking everyone to believe that between the years \n1995 and 1997, while Monica Lewinsky was engaged in a pattern of \nexplicit availability for him as she described in her testimony, the \nPresident carefully avoided having any intimate contact with her as \ndescribed in Judge Wright's very detailed definition.\n  And, according to the President, since he never intimately touched \nher as described in the definition--she only touched him--then he was \nunder no obligation to answer questions in the harassment suit about \nMonica Lewinsky as Federal Judge Susan Webber Wright ordered him to do \nunder oath.\n  Not only does the President's claim strain all boundaries of common \nsense, it is directly in conflict with Monica Lewinsky's detailed and \ncorroborated accounts of their relationship.\n  As if this ridiculous expansion of Judge Wright's definition of what \nconstituted sexual relations wasn't enough, the President then decided \nto take his interpretation of the judge's definition one step further. \nHe added a new element as to why he claimed the definition didn't apply \nto him.\n  When asked again, at his grand jury testimony, what he thought the \ndefinition of sexual relations meant, here is the new twist that the \nPresident came up with.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       A. As I remember from the previous discussion this was some \n     kind of definition that had something to do with sexual \n     harassment. So, that implies it's forcing to me. And I--there \n     was never any issue of forcing in the case involving--well, \n     any of these questions they were asking me. They made it \n     clear in this discussion I just reviewed that what they were \n     referring to was intentional sexual conduct, not some sort of \n     forcible abusive behavior.\n       So I basically--I don't think I paid any attention to it \n     because it appeared to me that that was something that had no \n     reference to the facts that they admitted they were asking me \n     about.\n\n  The President now took the position that the definition didn't apply \nto him because it would only have applied if he forced himself on \nMonica Lewinsky. Remember the definition. And I will read it again:\n\n       For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in \n     sexual relations when the person knowingly engages in or \n     causes--\n       (1) contact with the [certain enumerated body parts] of any \n     person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire \n     of any person[.]\n\n  As you can see, this straightforward definition did not include the \nsubject of force or harassment.\n  Yet when the independent counsel's attorney tried to clarify the \nPresident's newfound position, the President gave no ground. He simply \nplowed ahead with his new interpretation.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. I'm just trying to understand, Mr. President. You \n     indicated that you put the definition in the context of a \n     sexual harassment case . . .\n       A. No, no, I think it was not in the context of sexual \n     harassment. I just re-read those four pages, which obviously \n     the grand jury doesn't have. But there was some reference to \n     the fact that this definition apparently bore some--had some \n     connection to some definition in another context and that \n     this was being used not in that context, not necessarily in \n     the context of sexual harassment.\n       So I would think that this causes would be--means to force \n     someone to do something. That's what I read it. That's the \n     only point I'm trying to make. Therefore, I did not believe \n     that any one had ever suggested that I had forced anyone to \n     do anything and I did not do that. And so, that could not \n     have had any bearing on any questions relating to Ms. \n     Lewinsky.\n\n  The evidence clearly shows from Monica Lewinsky's sworn testimony \nthat the President deconstructed the English language to deny Paula \nJones the opportunity to find out if other witnesses were out there who \nwould help bolster her case against the President, and she was legally \nentitled to do that under our sexual harassment laws.\n  No reasonable interpretation of the President's testimony could be \nmade\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\nthat he fulfilled his legal obligation to testify to the truth, the \nwhole truth and nothing but the truth.\n  His statements were perjurious. They were designed to defeat Paula \nJones' right to pursue her sexual harassment civil rights lawsuit \nagainst this President.\n  And by the way, in his testimony, the President conceded that if \nMonica Lewinsky's recitation of the facts was true, he would have \nperjured himself both in his deposition testimony and in repeating his \ndenials before the grand jury. Listen to this.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. And you testified that you didn't have sexual relations \n     with Monica Lewinsky in the Jones deposition under that \n     definition, correct?\n       A. That's correct, sir.\n       Q. If the person being deposed touched the genitalia of \n     another person, would that be in--with the intent to arouse \n     the sexual desire, arouse or gratify, as defined in \n     definition one, would that be, under your understanding, then \n     and now, sexual relations?\n       A. Yes, sir.\n       Q. Yes, it would?\n       A. Yes, it would if you had a direct contact with any of \n     these places in the body, if you had direct contact with \n     intent to arouse or gratify, that would fall within the \n     definition.\n       Q. So you didn't do any of those three things with Monica \n     Lewinsky?\n       A. You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did \n     not have sexual relations as I understood this term to be \n     defined.\n  So, who is telling the truth? The only way to really know is to bring \nforth the witnesses, put them under oath and give each juror, each \nMember of this body the opportunity to make that determination of \ncredibility, because the record shows that Monica Lewinsky delivered \nconsistent and detailed testimony under oath regarding many specific \nencounters with the President that clearly fell within the definition \nof sexual relations from the Jones deposition.\n  Monica Lewinsky's memory and accounts of these incidents are \namazingly corroborated by her recollection of dates, places and phone \ncalls which correspond with the official White House entrance logs and \nphone records.\n  Monica Lewinsky's testimony is further corroborated through DNA \ntesting and the testimony of her friends and family members, to whom \nshe made near contemporaneous statements about the relationship.\n  Most importantly, Monica Lewinsky had every reason to tell the truth \nto the grand jury. She was under a threat of prosecution for perjury, \nnot only for her grand jury testimony, but also for the false affidavit \nshe filed on behalf of the President in the Jones case.\n  She knew then and she knows today that her immunity agreement could \nbe revoked at any time if she lies under oath or if she lied under oath \nin the past. Truthful testimony was and remains a condition for her \nimmunity from prosecution.\n  By way of contrast, the President was under obligation to give \ncomplete answers. Instead, he offered false answers that violated his \noath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And \nincidentally, during his grand jury testimony, the President actually \nsuggested that he had a right to give less than complete answers. Why? \nBecause he questioned the motives of Ms. Jones in bringing her lawsuit.\n\n  If this standard is acceptable, what does that do to the search for \nthe truth when an oath is administered in a courtroom to one who claims \nto question the ``motives'' of their opponent in a trial? This \nsuggestion has no basis in law. And it is destructive to the truth-\nseeking function of the courts.\n  The President's perjurious legal hairsplitting used to bypass the \nrequirement of telling the complete truth denied Paula Jones her \nconstitutional right to have her day in court and an orderly \ndisposition of her claim in the sexual harassment case against the \nPresident.\n  To dismiss this conduct with a shrug because it is ``just about sex'' \nis to say that the sexual harassment laws protecting women in the \nworkplace do not apply to powerful employers or others in high places \nof privilege. As one wag recently noted, if this case is ``just about \nsex,'' then robbery is just a disagreement over money.\n  Next, the President perjured himself before the grand jury when he \nrepeated previous perjured answers he gave in the deposition of the \nPaula Jones case. In his grand jury testimony in August, the President \nadmitted he had to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the \ntruth when he testified in the Paula Jones deposition.\n  The question to the President:\n\n       Now, you took the same oath to tell the truth, the whole \n     truth, and nothing but the truth on January 17th, 1998, in a \n     deposition in the Paula Jones litigation; is that correct, \n     sir?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I did take an oath then.\n\n  Question:\n\n       Did the oath you took on that occasion mean the same to you \n     then as it does today?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I believe then that I had to answer the questions \n     truthfully; that is correct.\n\n  When the President testified in his January deposition, he knew full \nwell that Monica Lewinsky's affidavit she filed in the case stating \nthat they never had sexual relations was false. Yet, when this \naffidavit was shown to him at the deposition, he testified that her \nfalse claim was, in his words, ``absolutely true.''\n  He knew that the definition of ``sexual relations'' used in the \nearlier Jones deposition was meant to cover the same activity that was \nmentioned in Monica Lewinsky's false affidavit. Rather than tell the \ncomplete truth, the President lied about the relationship, the cover \nstories, the affidavit, the subpoena for gifts, and the search for a \njob for Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Later he denied to the grand jury in August that he committed any \nperjury during his January deposition. This assertion before the grand \njury that he testified truthfully in the Jones case is in and of itself \nperjurious testimony because the record is clear he did not testify \ntruthfully in January in the Paula Jones case. He perjured himself.\n  Thus, when the President testified before the grand jury in August, \nhe knew he had given perjurious answers in the January deposition. If \nthe President really thought, as he testified, that he had told the \ntruth in his January deposition testimony, he would not have related a \nfalse account of events to his secretary, Betty Currie, whom he knew, \nby his own admission, might be called as a witness in the Jones case; \nhe would not have repeatedly denied he was unable to recall being alone \nwith Monica Lewinsky; and he would not have told false accounts to his \naides whom he knew, by his own admission, were potential witnesses in \nlater proceedings.\n  The evidence of perjury and obstruction of justice is overwhelming in \nthis case. He continued to use illegal means to defeat Ms. Jones' \nconstitutional right to bring her harassment case against him.\n  Next, the President committed perjury before the grand jury when he \ntestified that he did not allow his attorney to make false \nrepresentations while referring to Monica Lewinsky's affidavit before \nthe judge in the Jones case, an affidavit that he knew was false.\n  Remember, at the Jones deposition in January 1998, Monica Lewinsky \npreviously had filed a false affidavit that said, ``I have never had a \nsexual relationship with the President'' and that she had no relevant \ninformation to provide on the subject to Ms. Jones.\n  When Ms. Jones' attorneys attempted to question the President about \nhis relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the President's attorney, Mr. \nBennett, objected to him even being questioned about the relationship.\n  Mr. Bennett claimed that in light of Monica Lewinsky's affidavit \nsaying that there was no sexual relationship between the two, and there \nnever had been, that Paula Jones' lawyer had no good faith belief even \nto question the President about a relationship with Monica Lewinsky.\n  Listen to what Mr. Bennett told Judge Wright in the deposition.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n       Mr. Bennett. Your Honor, excuse me, Mr. President, I need \n     some guidance from the Court at this point. I'm going to \n     object to the innuendo. I'm afraid, as I say, that this will \n     leak. I don't question the predicates here. I question the \n     good faith of counsel, the innuendo in the question. Counsel \n     is fully aware that Ms. Jane Doe 6 [Monica Lewinsky] has \n     filed, has an affidavit which they are in possession of \n     saying that there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any \n     manner, shape or form, with President Clinton, and yet \n     listening to the innuendo in the questions----\n       Judge Wright. No, just a minute, let me make my ruling. I \n     do not know whether\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\n     counsel is basing this question on any affidavit, but I will \n     direct Mr. Bennett not to comment on other evidence that \n     might be pertinent and could be arguably coaching the witness \n     at this juncture. Now, Mr. Fisher is an officer of this \n     court, and I have to assume that he has a good faith basis \n     for asking the question. If in fact he has no good faith \n     basis for asking this question, he could later be sanctioned. \n     If you would like, I will be happy to review in camera any \n     good faith basis he might have.\n       Mr. Bennett. Well, Your Honor, with all due respect, I \n     would like to know the proffer. I'm not coaching the witness. \n     In preparation of the witness for this deposition, the \n     witness is fully aware of Ms. Jane Doe 6's (Monica \n     Lewinsky's) affidavit, so I have not told him a single thing \n     he doesn't know, but I think when he asks questions like this \n     where he's sitting on an affidavit from the witness, he \n     should at least have a good faith proffer.\n       Judge Wright. Now, I agree with you that he needs to have a \n     good faith basis for asking the question.\n       Mr. Bennett. May we ask what it is, Your Honor?\n       Judge Wright. And I'm assuming that he does, and I will be \n     willing to review this in camera if he does not want to \n     reveal it to counsel.\n       Mr. Bennett. Fine.\n       Mr. Fisher. I would welcome an opportunity to explain to \n     the Court what our good faith basis is in an in camera \n     hearing.\n       Judge Wright. All right.\n       Mr. Fisher. I would prefer that we not take the time to do \n     that now, but I can tell the Court I am very confident there \n     is substantial basis.\n       Judge Wright. All right, I'm going to permit the question. \n     He's an officer of the Court, and as you know, Mr. Bennett, \n     this Court has ruled on prior occasions that a good faith \n     basis can exist notwithstanding the testimony of the witness, \n     of the deponent, and the other party.\n\n  May I say as an aside that by presenting that, I am in no way \nquestioning the quality or the integrity of the President's attorney, \nMr. Bennett, on that day. Mr. Bennett was doing his job as the \nPresident's lawyer. He had an affidavit from Monica Lewinsky that said \nnone of this ever happened. And so I hope that none of you will assume \nthat by my showing this deposition tape today that I am trying to draw \nany unfair inference against the President's attorney on that date. But \nyou can tell from what you have just observed that Mr. Bennett was \nusing Monica Lewinsky's false affidavit in an attempt to stop \nquestioning of the President about Ms. Lewinsky.\n  What did the President do during that exchange? He sat mute. He did \nnot say anything to correct Mr. Bennett, even though the President knew \nthat the affidavit upon which Mr. Bennett was relying was utterly \nfalse.\n  Judge Wright overruled Mr. Bennett's objection and allowed the \nquestioning about Monica Lewinsky to proceed.\n  Later in the deposition, Mr. Bennett read to the President the \nportion of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit in which she denied having a sexual \nrelationship with the President. Mr. Bennett then asked the President, \nwho was under oath, if Ms. Lewinsky's statement that they never had a \nsexual relationship was true and accurate.\n  Listen to the President as he responds.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q: In paragraph eight of her affidavit, she says this, ``I \n     have never had a sexual relationship with the President, he \n     did not propose that we have a sexual relationship, he did \n     not offer me employment or other benefits in exchange for a \n     sexual relationship, he did not deny me employment or other \n     benefits for reflecting a sexual relationship.''\n       Is this a true and accurate statement as far as you know \n     it?\n       A: That is absolutely true.\n\n  The President's answer: ``That is absolutely true.''\n  When President Clinton was asked during his grand jury testimony 8 \nmonths later how he could have sat silently at his earlier deposition \nwhile his attorney made the false statement that ``there is no sex of \nany kind,'' in any manner, shape, or form, to Judge Wright, the \nPresident first said that he was not paying ``a great deal of \nattention'' to Mr. Bennett's comments.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n       Q. Mr. President, I want to--before I go into a new subject \n     area, briefly go over something you were talking about with \n     Mr. Bittman. The statement of your attorney, Mr. Bennett, at \n     the Paula Jones deposition--counsel is fully aware--it's page \n     54, line 5. ``Counsel is fully aware that Ms. Lewinsky is \n     filing, has an affidavit, which they were in possession of, \n     saying that there was absolutely no sex of any kind in any \n     manner, shape or form with President Clinton.'' That \n     statement was made by your attorney in front of Judge Susan \n     Webber Wright.\n       A. That's correct.\n       Q. Your--that statement is a completely false statement. \n     Whether or not Mr. Bennett knew of your relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, the statement that there was ``no sex of any kind \n     in any manner, shape or form with President Clinton'' was an \n     utterly false statement. Is that correct?\n       A. It depends upon what the meaning of the word ``is'' \n     means. If ``is'' means is, and never has been, that's one \n     thing. If it means, there is none, that was a completely true \n     statement. But as I have testified--I'd like to testify \n     again--this is --it is somewhat unusual for a client to be \n     asked about his lawyer's statements instead of the other way \n     around. I was not paying a great deal of attention to this \n     exchange. I was focusing on my own testimony.\n\n  The President added to this explanation he was giving to the attorney \nquestioning him. This is what the President said: ``And I'm not sure . \n. . as I sit here today that I sat there and followed all these \ninterchanges between the lawyers. I'm quite sure that I didn't follow \nall the interchanges between the lawyers all that carefully. And I \ndon't really believe, therefore, that I can say Mr. Bennett's testimony \nor statement is testimony and is imputable to me. I didn't--I don't \nknow that I was really paying attention, paying that much attention to \nhim.''\n  This denial of the President while his attorney was proffering a \nfalse statement to Judge Wright in an effort to keep the Paula Jones \nlawyers from even questioning the President about his relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky simply does not withstand the test of truth. The \nvideotape of the President's January deposition shows the President \npaying very close attention to Mr. Bennett when Mr. Bennett was making \nthe statement about ``no sex of any kind.''\n  View again the video clip of the President during Mr. Bennett's \nargument that the Jones lawyers have no right to ask questions about \nMonica Lewinsky, only this time watch the President as he focuses on \nhis lawyer speaking about one of the most important subjects he has \never faced in his entire life--the survival of his Presidency.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Mr. Bennett. Your Honor, excuse me, Mr. President, I need \n     some guidance from the Court at this point. I'm going to \n     object to the innuendo. I'm afraid, as I say, that this will \n     leak. I don't question the predicates here. I question the \n     good faith of counsel, the innuendo in the question. Counsel \n     is fully aware that Ms. Jane Doe 6 [Monica Lewinsky] has \n     filed, has an affidavit which they are in possession of \n     saying that there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any \n     manner, shape or form, with President Clinton, and yet \n     listening to the innuendo in the questions----\n       Judge Wright. No, just a minute, let me make my ruling. I \n     do not know whether counsel is basing this question an any \n     affidavit, but I will direct Mr. Bennett not to comment on \n     other evidence that might be pertinent and could be arguably \n     coaching the witness at this juncture. Now, I Mr. Fisher is \n     as officer of this court, and I have to assume that he has a \n     good faith basis for asking the question. If in fact he has \n     no good faith basis for asking this question, he could later \n     be sanctioned. If you would like, I will be happy to review \n     in camera any good faith basis he might have.\n       Mr. Bennett. Well, Your Honor, with all due respect, I \n     would like to know the proffer. I'm not coaching the witness. \n     In preparation of the witness for this deposition, the \n     witness is fully aware of Ms. Jane Doe 6's (Monica \n     Lewinsky's) affidavit, so I have not told him a single thing \n     he doesn't know, but I think when he asks questions like this \n     where he's sitting on an affidavit from the witness, he \n     should at least have a good faith proffer.\n       Judge Wright. Now, I agree with you that he needs to have a \n     good faith basis for asking the question.\n       Mr. Bennett. May we ask what it is, Your Honor?\n       Judge Wright. And I'm assuming that he does, and I will be \n     willing to review this in camera if he does not want to \n     reveal it to counsel.\n       Mr. Bennett. Fine.\n       Mr. Fisher. I would welcome an opportunity to explain to \n     the Court what our good faith basis is in an in camera \n     hearing.\n       Judge Wright. All right.\n       Mr. Fisher. I would prefer that we not take the time to do \n     that now, but I can tell the Court I am very confident there \n     is substantial basis.\n       Judge Wright. All right, I'm going to permit the question. \n     He's an officer of the Court, and as you know, Mr. Bennett, \n     this Court has ruled on prior occasions that a good faith \n     basis can exist notwithstanding the testimony of the witness, \n     of the deponent, and the other party.\n\n  By the way, lest there be any doubt in the minds of any Member of \nthis body as to whom the President was\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\nlooking at and focusing at, we are fully prepared to bring in a witness \nfor you who was present at the deposition and who will draw a map for \nevery Member of this body and show the location of the President and \nevery other person around the table.\n  Just in case the President's ``I wasn't paying any attention'' excuse \ndidn't fly, the President, in his grand jury testimony, decided to try \nanother argument on for size. He suggested that when Mr. Bennett made \nhis statement about ``there is no sex of any kind,'' the President was \nfocusing on the meaning of the word ``is.''\n  He then said that when Mr. Bennett made the assertion that ``there is \nno sex of any kind,'' Mr. Bennett was speaking only in the present \ntense, as if the President understood that to mean ``there is no sex'' \nbecause there was no sex occurring at the time Mr. Bennett's remark was \nmade.\n  The President stated, ``It depends on what the meaning of the word \n`is' is.''\n  And that if it means there is none, that was a completely true \nstatement. Listen and watch again to the same video clip from the \nPresident's grand jury testimony that we saw a few moments ago. Only \nthis time, pay close attention to the President's excuse as to why he \ndid not have to comply with the truth, because in his mind there is \nsome question as to what the meaning of the word ``is'' is.\n  (Text of videotape presentation:)\n\n       Q. Mr. President, I want to, before I go into a new subject \n     area, briefly go over something you were talking about with \n     Mr. Bittman. The statement of your attorney, Mr. Bennett, at \n     the Paula Jones deposition ``counsel is fully aware''--it's \n     page 54 line 5.--``counsel is fully aware that Ms. Lewinsky \n     has filed, has an affidavit which they were in possession of \n     saying that there is no sex of any kind in any manner, shape \n     or form, with President Clinton?'' That statement is made by \n     your attorney in front of Judge Susan Webber Wright, correct?\n       A. That's correct.\n       Q. That statement is a completely false statement. Whether \n     or not Mr. Bennett knew of your relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, the statement that there was ``no sex of any kind \n     in any manner, shape or form, with President Clinton,'' was \n     an utterly false statement. Is that correct?\n       A. It depends on what the meaning of the word ``is'' is. If \n     ``is'' means is, and never has been, that is one thing. If it \n     means there is none, that was a completely true statement. \n     But, as I have testified, and I'd like to testify again, this \n     is--it is somewhat unusual for a client to be asked about his \n     lawyer's statements, instead of the other way around. I was \n     not paying a great deal of attention to this exchange. I was \n     focusing on my own testimony.\n\n  In essence, here is what the President says in his own defense: I \nwasn't paying any attention to what my lawyer was saying when he \noffered the false affidavit on my behalf to the judge. However, if I \nwas paying attention, I was focusing on the very narrow definition of \nwhat the word ``is'' is and the tense in which that was presented.\n  Now, I am a former prosecutor, and that is like the murderer who \nsays: I have an ironclad alibi. I wasn't at the crime scene, I was home \nwith my mother eating apple pie. But if I was there, it is a clear case \nof self-defense.\n  The President now asks this body of lawmakers to give acceptance to \nthese ludicrous definitions of ordinary words and phrases. He asks you \nto believe this is what he really thought when he was asked if he ever \nhad sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and when he was asked about \nher false affidavit.\n  By the way, as to the President's ``tense'' argument that he \npresented about what the meaning of the word ``is'' is, this fails to \ntake into account another important fact. The false affidavit of Monica \nLewinsky that Mr. Bennett was waiving that day before the judge made no \nsuch distinction. Her affidavit never said in the present tense, ``I am \nnot now having a sexual relationship with the President.'' Her \naffidavit said, ``I have never had a sexual relationship with the \nPresident.''\n  The President perjured himself when he said that Mr. Bennett's \nstatement that there was no sex of any kind was ``absolutely true,'' \ndepending on what the meaning of the word ``is'' is.\n  The President did not admit to the grand jury that Mr. Bennett's \nstatement was false, because to do so would have been to admit that the \nterm ``sexual relations'' as used in Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit meant \n``no sex of any kind.'' Admitting that would be to admit that he \nperjured himself previously in his grand jury testimony and in his \ndeposition.\n\n  Now, interestingly, Ms. Lewinsky doesn't bother attempting to match \nthe President's linguistic deconstructions of the English language. \nAfter she was granted immunity, Monica Lewinsky testified under oath \nthat the part of her affidavit denying a sexual relationship with the \nPresident was a lie.\n  I read from page 204 of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony:\n\n       Question: Let me ask you a straightforward question. \n     Paragraph 8--\n\n  Referring to her affidavit--\n\n     at the start says, ``I have never had a sexual relationship \n     with the President.'' Is that true?\n       Answer: No.\n\n  Thus, the President engaged in an evolving series of lies during his \nsworn testimony in order to cover previous lies he told in sworn \ntestimony, and to conceal his conduct that obstructed justice in the \nPaula Jones sexual harassment suit against him. He did this to deny \nPaula Jones her constitutional right to bring a case of sexual \nharassment against him, and to sidetrack the investigation of the \nOffice of Independent Counsel into his misconduct.\n  Finally, the President committed perjury before the grand jury when \nhe testified falsely about his blatant attempts to influence the \ntestimony of potential witnesses and his involvement in a plan to hide \nevidence that had lawfully been subpoenaed in the civil rights action \nbrought against him.\n  This perjurious testimony breaks down into four categories:\n  First, he made false and misleading statements to the grand jury \nconcerning his knowledge of Monica Lewinsky's false affidavit.\n  Second, he made false and misleading statements to the grand jury \nwhen he related a false account of his interaction with his secretary, \nBetty Currie, when he reasonably knew she might later be called before \nthe grand jury to testify.\n  Third, he made perjurious and misleading statements to the grand jury \nwhen he denied engaging in a plan to hide evidence that had been \nsubpoenaed in the Jones civil rights case against him.\n  Finally, he made perjurious and misleading statements to the grand \njury concerning statements he made to his aides about Monica Lewinsky \nwhen he reasonably knew these aides might be called later to testify.\n  Let's look briefly at the first area.\n  The President made false and misleading statements before the grand \njury regarding his knowledge of the contents of Monica Lewinsky's \naffidavit.\n  As we now know conclusively, Monica Lewinsky filed an affidavit in \nthe Jones case in which she denied ever having a sexual relationship \nwith the President, and that was a lie when it was filed.\n  Remember--during his deposition in the Jones case, the President said \nthat Ms. Lewinsky's denial of ever having a sexual relationship was \n``absolutely true.''\n  Monica Lewinsky later testified that she is ``100 percent sure'' that \nthe President suggested she might want to sign an affidavit to avoid \ntestifying in the case of Jones versus Clinton. In fact, the President \ngave the following testimony before the grand jury:\n\n       And did I hope she'd be able to get out of testifying on an \n     affidavit? Absolutely. Did I want her to execute a false \n     affidavit? No, I did not.\n\n  This testimony is false because it could not be possible that Monica \nLewinsky could have filed a truthful affidavit in the Jones case, an \naffidavit acknowledging a sexual relationship with the President, that \nwould have helped her to avoid having to appear as a witness in the \nPaula Jones case.\n  The attorneys for Paula Jones were seeking evidence of sexual \nrelationships with the President, and ones that the President might \nhave had with other State or Federal employees.\n  This information was legally obliged to be produced by the President \nto Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against him to help \nprove her claim.\n  Judge Susan Webber Wright had already ruled that Paula Jones was \nentitled to this information from the President for purposes of \ndiscovery.\n  If Monica Lewinsky had filed a truthful affidavit that acknowledged a \nsexual relationship with the President,\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\nthen she certainly could not have avoided having to testify in a \ndeposition.\n  The President knew this.\n  His grand jury testimony on this subject is perjury.\n  Next, the President provided false testimony concerning his \nconversations with his personal secretary Betty Currie about Monica \nafter he testified in the Jones deposition.\n  Recall Mr. Manager Hutchinson's presentation a short time ago. The \nPresident had just testified on January 17, 1998, in the Paula Jones \ndeposition. He said he could not recall being alone with Monica \nLewinsky and that he did not have a sexual relationship with her.\n  After his testimony, on the very next day and in a separate \nconversation with her a few days later, President Clinton made \nstatements to Ms. Currie that he knew were false.\n  He made them to coach Ms. Currie and to influence her potential \nfuture testimony.\n  He coached her by reciting inaccurate answers to possible questions \nthat she might be asked if she were called to testify in the Paula \nJones case.\n  By the way: the President discussed his deposition testimony with Ms. \nCurrie in direct violation of Judge Wright's order that he not discuss \nhis testimony with anyone. Judge Wright warned the President at the \ndeposition:\n\n       Before he leaves, I want to remind him, as the witness in \n     this matter, . . . that this case is subject to a Protective \n     Order regarding all discovery, . . . [A]ll parties present, \n     including . . . the witness are not to say anything \n     whatsoever about the questions they were asked, the substance \n     of the deposition, . . ., any details . . .\n\n  After he coached her, the President wanted Betty Currie to be a \nwitness.\n  During his deposition testimony, the President did everything he \ncould to suggest to the Jones lawyers they needed to depose Betty \nCurrie. He did this by referring to her over and over again as the one \nwith the information they need for information about him and Monica \nLewinsky.\n  He stated to the Jones lawyer in his deposition, for example, that:\n\n     . . . the last time he had seen Ms. Lewinsky was when she had \n     come to the White House to see Ms. Currie; that Ms. Currie \n     was present when the President had made a joking reference \n     about the Jones case to Ms. Lewinsky; that Ms. Currie was his \n     source of information about Vernon Jordan's assistance to Ms. \n     Lewinsky; and that Ms. Currie had helped set up the meetings \n     between Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan regarding her move to New \n     York.\n\n  Because the President referred so often to Ms. Currie, it is obvious \nhe wanted her to become a witness in the Jones matter, particularly if \nspecific allegations of the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky \ncame to light.\n  According to Ms. Currie, President Clinton even told her at some \npoint that she might be asked about Monica Lewinsky.\n  Two and a half hours after he returned from the Paula Jones \ndeposition, President Clinton called Ms. Currie at home and asked her \nto come to the White House the next day, a Sunday.\n  Ms. Currie testified that it was rare for the President to ask her to \ncome in on a Sunday.\n  At about 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, January 18, Ms. Currie went to meet \nwith President Clinton at the White House.\n  Listen to what Betty Currie told the grand jury:\n\n       He said that he had had his deposition yesterday, and they \n     had asked several questions about Monica Lewinsky. And I was \n     a little shocked by that or--(shrugging). And he said--I \n     don't know if he said--I think he may have said, ``There are \n     several things you may want to know,'' or ``There are \n     things--'' He asked me some questions.\n\n  According to Ms. Currie, the President then said to her in rapid \nsuccession:\n\n       You were always there when she was there, right? We were \n     never really alone.\n       You could see and hear everything.\n       Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?\n       She wanted to have sex with me, and I can't do that.\n\n  Ms. Currie indicated that these remarks were ``more like statements \nthan questions.''\n  Ms. Currie concluded that the President wanted her to agree with him.\n  Ms. Currie also said that she felt the President made these remarks \nto see her reaction.\n  Ms. Currie said that she indicated her agreement with each of the \nPresident's statements, although she knew that the President and Ms. \nLewinsky had in fact been alone in the Oval Office and in the \nPresident's study.\n  Ms. Currie also knew that she could not, and did not hear or see the \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky while they were alone.\n  Ms. Currie testified that two or three days after her conversation \nwith the President at the White House, he again called her into the \nOval Office to discuss this.\n  She described their conversation as, quote, ``sort of a \nrecapitulation of what we had talked about on Sunday--you know, I was \nnever alone with her''--that sort of thing.''\n\n       Q: [To Ms. Currie] Did he pretty much list the same?\n       A. To my recollection, sir, yes.\n\n  In his grand jury testimony, the president was asked why he might \nhave said to Ms. Currie in their meeting on that Sunday ``we were never \nalone together, right?'' and ``you could see and hear everything.''\n  Here is how the President testified:\n\n       [W]hat I was trying to determine was whether my \n     recollection was right and that she was always in the office \n     complex when Monica was there, and whether she thought she \n     could hear any conversations we had, or did she hear any--I \n     was trying to--I knew . . . to a reasonable certainty that I \n     was going to be asked more questions about this. I didn't \n     really expect you to be in the Jones case at the time. I \n     thought what would happen is that it would break in the \n     press, and I was trying to get the facts down. I was trying \n     to understand what the facts were.\n\n  The President told the grand jury that he was putting those questions \nto Betty Currie on that Sunday to refresh his recollection and trying \nto pin down what the facts were.\n  Later, the President stated that he was referring to a larger area \nthan simply the room where he and Ms. Lewinsky were located. He also \ntestified that his statements to Ms. Currie were intended to cover a \nlimited range of dates.\n  Listen to the President's answer.\n\n       A. [W]hen I said, we were never alone, right, I think I \n     also asked her a number of other questions, because there \n     were several times, as I'm sure she would acknowledge, when I \n     either asked her to be around. I remember once in particular \n     when I was talking with Ms. Lewinsky when I asked Betty to be \n     in the, actually, in the next room in the dining room, and, \n     as I testified earlier, once in her own office. But I meant \n     that she was always in the Oval Office complex, in that \n     complex, while Monica was there. And I believe that this was \n     part of a series of questions I asked her to try to quickly \n     refresh my memory. So, I wasn't trying to get her to say \n     something that wasn't so. And, in fact, I think she would \n     recall that I told her to just relax, go in the grand jury \n     and tell the truth when she had been called as a witness.\n\n  Now the President was treating the grand jury to his construction of \nwhat the word ``alone'' means to him.\n  When asked he answered:\n\n       it depends on how you define alone, and ``there were a lot \n     of times when we were alone, but I never really thought we \n     were.\n\n  The President also was asked about his specific statement to Betty \nCurrie that ``you could see and hear everything.'' He testified that he \nwas uncertain what he intended by that comment:\n  Question to the President:\n\n       Q: When you said to Mrs. Currie, you could see and hear \n     everything, that wasn't true either, was it, as far as you \n     knew. . . .\n       A. My memory of that was that, that she had the ability to \n     hear what was going on if she came in the Oval Office from \n     her office. And a lot of times, you know, when I was in the \n     Oval Office, she just had the door open to her office. Then \n     there was--the door was never completely closed to the hall. \n     So I think there was--I'm not entirely sure what I meant by \n     that, but I could have meant that she generally would be able \n     to hear conversations, even if she couldn't see them. And I \n     think that's what I meant.\n\n  The President also was asked about his comment to Ms. Currie that Ms. \nLewinsky had ``come on'' to him, but that he had ``never touched her.''\n  Question to the President:\n\n       Q: [I]f [Ms. Currie] testified that you told her, Monica \n     came on to me and I never touched her, you did, in fact, of \n     course, touch Ms. Lewinsky, isn't that right, in a physically \n     intimate way?\n       A. Now, I've testified about that. And that's one of those \n     questions that I believe is answered by the statement that I \n     made.\n       Q: What was your purpose in making these statements to \n     Mrs. Currie, if it weren't for the purpose to try to \n     suggest to her what she should say if ever asked?\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\n       A. Now, Mr. Bittman, I told you, the only thing I remember \n     is when all this stuff blew up, I was trying to figure out \n     what the facts were. I was trying to remember. I was trying \n     to remember every time I had seen Ms. Lewinsky. . . . I knew \n     this was all going to come out. . . . I did not know [at the \n     time] that the Office of Independent Counsel was involved. \n     And I was trying to get the facts and try to think of the \n     best defense we could construct in the face of what I thought \n     was going to be a media onslaught.\n\n  Finally, the President was asked why he would have called Ms. Currie \ninto his office a few days after the Sunday meeting and repeated the \nstatements about Ms. Lewinsky to her.\n  The President testified that although he would not dispute Ms. \nCurrie's testimony to the contrary, he did not remember having a second \nconversation with her along these lines.\n  Thus, the president referred to Ms. Currie many times in his \ndeposition when describing his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  He himself admitted that a large number of questions about Ms. \nLewinsky were likely to be asked in the very near future.\n  The President reasonably could foresee that Ms. Currie either might \nbe deposed or questioned, or might need to prepare an affidavit.\n  When he testified he was only making statements to Ms. Currie to \n``ascertain what the facts were, trying to ascertain what Betty's \nperception was,'' this statement was false, and it was perjurious.\n  We know it was perjury, because the President called Ms. Currie into \nthe White House the day after his deposition to tell her--not ask her, \nto tell her--that\n\n       he was never alone with Ms. Lewinsky;\n       to tell her that Ms. Currie could always hear or see them\n       and to tell her that he never touched Ms. Lewinsky.\n\n  These were false statements, and he knew that the statements were \nfalse at the time he made them to Betty Currie.\n  The President's suggestion that he was simply trying to refresh his \nmemory when talking to Betty Currie is nonsense.\n  What if Ms. Currie had confirmed these statements--statements the \npresident knew were false? It could not in any way remind the President \nof what really happened in the Oval Office with Monica Lewinsky because \nthe President already knew he was alone with Monica Lewinsky. The \nPresident already knew that obviously Ms. Currie could not always see \nhim back in the Oval Office area with Monica Lewinsky. And the \nPresident already knew that he had an intimate sexual relationship with \nMonica Lewinsky.\n\n  There is no logical way to justify his claim that he made these \nstatements to Ms. Currie to refresh his recollection.\n  The only reasonable inference from the President's conduct is that he \ntried to enlist a potential witness to back up his perjury from the day \nbefore at the deposition.\n  The circumstances surrounding the president's statements clearly \nshow, clearly show that he improperly sought to influence Ms. Currie's \npotential future testimony.\n  His actions were an obstruction of justice, and a blatant attempt to \nillegally influence the truthful testimony of a potential witness.\n  And his later denials about it under oath were perjurious.\n  Next, the President gave perjurious, false and misleading testimony \nbefore the grand jury when he denied he was engaged in a plot to hide \nevidence that had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones case.\n  On December 19, 1997, Monica Lewinsky was served with a subpoena in \nthe Paula Jones case.\n  The subpoena required her to testify at a deposition in January, and \nthe subpoena required her to produce each and every gift President \nClinton had given her.\n  Nine days after she received this subpoena, Ms. Lewinsky met with the \nPresident for about 45 minutes in the Oval Office.\n  By this time, President Clinton knew that she had been subpoenaed in \nthe case.\n  At this meeting they discussed the fact that the gifts that he had \ngiven Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed, including a hat pin--the \nfirst gift the president had ever given Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Monica Lewinsky testified that at some point in this meeting she said \nto the President,\n\n       Well, you know, I--maybe I should put the gifts away \n     outside my house somewhere or give them to someone, maybe \n     Betty.\n       And he sort of said--I think he responded, ``I don't know'' \n     or ``Let me think about that.'' And left that topic.\n\n  President Clinton provided the following explanation to the grand \njury and to the House Judiciary Committee regarding this conversation:\n\n       Ms. Lewinsky said something to me like, ``what if they ask \n     me about the gifts you've given me,'' but I do not know \n     whether that conversation occurred on December 28, 1997, or \n     earlier.\n       Whenever this conversation occurred, I testified, I told \n     her ``that if they [the Jones Lawyers] asked her for gifts, \n     she'd have to give them whatever she had. . . .''\n       I simply was not concerned about the fact that I had given \n     her gifts. Indeed, I gave her additional gifts on December \n     28, 1997.\n\n  The President's statement that he told Ms. Lewinsky that if the \nattorneys for Paula Jones asked for the gifts, then she had to provide \nthem, is perjurious.\n  It strains all logic to believe the President would encourage Monica \nLewinsky to turn over the gifts. To do so would have raised questions \nabout their relationship and would go against all of their other \nefforts to conceal the relationship, including filing a false affidavit \nabout their relationship. The fact that the President gave Monica \nLewinsky additional gifts on December 28, 1998, doesn't exonerate the \nPresident. It demonstrates that the President never believed that \nMonica Lewinsky in light of all of their relationship, all of the cover \nstories, all of the plans that they had put forward, her willingness to \nsubject herself to a perjury prosecution by filing a false affidavit, \nall of that was because he knew that Monica Lewinsky would never turn \nthose gifts over pursuant to the subpoena. And as Ms. Lewinsky \ntestified, she never questioned, as she said, ``that we were ever going \nto do anything but keep this quiet.''\n  This meant that they would take, in her words, ``whatever steps \nneeded to be taken'' to keep it quiet.\n  By giving more gifts to Monica Lewinsky after she received a subpoena \nto appear in the Jones case, the President believed that Monica \nLewinsky would never testify truthfully about their relationship.\n  Additionally, Ms. Lewinsky said she could not answer why the \nPresident would give her more gifts on the 28th when he knew she had to \nproduce gifts in response to the subpoena. She did testify, however, \nthat----\n\n       To me it was never a question in my mind and I--from \n     everything he said to me, I never questioned him, that we \n     were never going to do anything but keep this private, so \n     that meant deny it and that meant do--take whatever \n     appropriate steps needed to be taken, you know, for that to \n     happen. . . . So by turning over these gifts, it would at \n     least prompt [the Jones attorneys] to question me about what \n     kind of friendship I had with the President. . . .\n\n  After this meeting on the morning of December 28, Betty Currie called \nMonica Lewinsky and made arrangements to pick up gifts the President \nhad given to Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Monica Lewinsky testified under oath before the grand jury that a few \nhours after meeting with the President on December 28, 1997, where they \ndiscussed what to do about the gifts he gave to her, Betty Currie \ncalled Monica Lewinsky.\n  Monica Lewinsky explained it to the grand jury as follows:\n\n       Question: What did [Betty Currie] say?\n       Answer: She said, ``I understand you have something to give \n     me.'' Or, ``The President said you have something to give \n     me.'' Along those lines. . . .\n       Question: When she said something along the lines of ``I \n     understand you have something to give me,'' or ``The \n     President says you have something for me,'' what did you \n     understand her to mean?\n       Answer: The gifts.\n\n  Later in the day on December 28, Ms. Currie drove to Monica \nLewinsky's home.\n  Ms. Lewinsky gave Ms. Currie a sealed box that contained several \ngifts Ms. Lewinsky had received from the President, including the hat \npin that was specifically named in the Jones subpoena.\n  As further corroboration, Monica Lewinsky had told the FBI earlier \nthat when Betty Currie called her about these gifts, it sounded like \nBetty Currie was calling on her cell phone.\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\n Ms. Lewinsky gave her best guess on the time of day the call came on \nDecember 28.\n  Although Ms. Lewinsky's guess on the hour the call came was a bit \noff, phone records were later produced revealing that Betty Currie in \nfact called Monica Lewinsky on her cell phone, just as Ms. Lewinsky had \ndescribed it. The only logical conclusion is that Betty Currie called \nMonica Lewinsky about retrieving the President's gifts. There would \nhave been no reason for Betty Currie, out of the blue, to return gifts \nunless instructed to do so by the President. Betty Currie didn't know \nabout the gift issue ahead of time. Only the President and Monica \nLewinsky had discussed it. There is no other way Ms. Currie could have \nknown to call Monica Lewinsky about the gifts unless the President told \nher to do it.\n  President Clinton perjured himself when he testified before the grand \njury on this issue and reiterated to the House Judiciary Committee that \nhe did not recall any conversation with Ms. Currie around December 28. \nHe also perjured himself when he testified before the grand jury that \nhe did not tell Betty Currie to take possession of the gifts that he \nhad given Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Question to the President:\n\n       After you gave her the gifts on December 28th, did you \n     speak with your secretary, Ms. Currie, and ask her to pick up \n     a box of gifts that were some compilation of gifts that Ms. \n     Lewinsky would have----\n       Answer: No, sir, I didn't do that.\n       Question: --to give to Ms. Currie?\n       Answer: I did not do that.\n\n  The President had a motive to conceal the gifts because both he and \nMs. Lewinsky were concerned that the gifts might raise questions about \ntheir relationship. By confirming that the gifts would not be produced, \nthe President ensured that these questions would never arise. The \nconcealment of these gifts from Paula Jones' attorneys allowed the \nPresident to provide perjurious statements about the gifts at his \ndeposition in the Jones case.\n  Finally, the President gave perjurious testimony to the grand jury \nconcerning statements he gave to his top aides regarding his \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky. Here is a portion of his grand jury \ntranscript, when the President testified about his conversation with \nkey aides, once the Monica Lewinsky story became public.\n  Question to the President:\n\n       Question: Did you deny to them or not, Mr. President?\n       Answer: . . . I did not want to mislead my friends, but I \n     want to define language where I can say that. I also, \n     frankly, do not want to turn any of them into witnesses \n     because I--and sure enough, they all became witnesses.\n       Question: Well, you knew they might be witnesses, didn't \n     you?\n       Answer: And so I said to them things that were true about \n     this relationship. That I used--in the language I used, I \n     said, there is nothing go[ing] on between us. That was true. \n     I said, I have not had sex with her as I defined it. That was \n     true. And did I hope that I would never have to be here on \n     this day giving this testimony? Of course. But I also didn't \n     want to do anything to complicate this matter further. So, I \n     said things that were true. They may have been misleading, \n     and if they were, I have to take responsibility for it, and \n     I'm sorry.\n\n  The President's testimony that day that he said things that were true \nto his aides is clearly perjurious. Just as the President predicted, \nseveral of the President's top aides were later called to testify \nbefore the grand jury as to what the President told them. And when they \ntestified before the grand jury they passed along the President's false \naccount, just as the President intended them to do.\n  I will not belabor the point any further with the Members of this \nbody because I think Mr. Manager Hutchinson ably presented that \ntestimony.\n  But we know from the evidence that Erskine Bowles, John Podesta, \nSidney Blumenthal, all came before the grand jury. They all provided \ntestimony to the grand jury establishing that the President's comments \nto them were the truth. The President had them go in. The President \ngave them that information so false information would be shared with \nthe grand jury so that the grand jury would never be armed with the \ntruth. And when witnesses are called to come before this body, you will \nhave an opportunity to make that determination.\n  Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the United States Senate, posterity \nlooks to this body to defend in a courageous way the public trust and \ntake care that the basis of our Government is not undermined. On \nJanuary 17, 1998, President Clinton, while a defendant in a civil \nrights sexual harassment lawsuit, gave sworn testimony in a deposition \npresided over by a Federal judge. In this deposition he raised his hand \nand he swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the \ntruth.\n  On August 17th, President Clinton testified before a Federal grand \njury in a criminal investigation. At this appearance he raised his hand \nand he swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the \ntruth. The evidence conclusively shows that the President rejected his \nobligations under oath on both occasions. He engaged in a serial \npattern of perjury and obstruction of justice. These corrupt acts were \ndone so he could deny a U.S. citizen, Mrs. Paula Jones, her \nconstitutional right to bring her claim against him in a court of law. \nIn so doing, he intentionally violated his oath of office, his \nconstitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, \nand his solemn obligation to respect Mrs. Jones' rights by providing \ntruthful testimony under oath.\n  The evidence reviewed by the House of Representatives and relied upon \nby our body in bringing articles of impeachment against the President \nwas not political. It was overwhelming. He has denied all allegations \nset forth in these articles. Who is telling the truth? There is only \none way to find out.\n  On behalf of the House of Representatives, we urge this body to bring \nforth the witnesses and place them all under oath. If the witnesses can \nmake the case against the President, if the witnesses that make the \ncase against the President who, incidentally, are his employees, his \ntop aides, his former interns, and his close friends--if all of these \npeople in the President's universe are lying, then the President has \nbeen done a grave disservice. He deserves not just an acquittal, he \ndeserves the most profound of apologies.\n  But, if they are not lying, if the evidence is true, if the Chief \nExecutive Officer of our Nation used his power and his influence to \ncorruptly destroy a lone woman's right to bring forth her case in a \ncourt of law, then there must be constitutional accountability, and by \nthat I mean the kind of accountability the framers of the Constitution \nintended for such conduct and not the type of accountability that \nsatisfies the temporary mood of the moment.\n  Our Founders bequeathed to us a Nation of laws, not of polls, not of \nfocus groups, and not of talk show habitues. America is strong enough \nto absorb the truth about their leaders when those leaders act in a \nmanner destructive to their oath of office. God help our country's \nfuture if we ever decide otherwise.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                              Adjournment\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the court \nstand in adjournment until 1 p.m. tomorrow, and that all Members remain \nstanding at their desks as the Chief Justice departs the Chamber. I \nfurther ask that after the court adjourns in a moment, the Senate will, \nwhile in legislative session, stand in recess subject to the call of \nthe Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE.
