The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I believe there is a 1-hour time agreement on this amendment, in \naccordance with the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. That allows me 30 minutes. I may not require all of that \ntime today, Mr. President. I do have a second amendment on which there \nwas an agreement, I believe last week, Thursday or Friday, which would \nlimit the time to 3 hours to be equally divided in accordance with the \nusual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if I might offer that amendment today but \ntake no time on it but just to be sure that it is offered and before \nthe Senate? I would prefer that the final action be taken on that \namendment following action on this first amendment on which I will be \ntalking today. Final action at such time as the two leaders may agree.\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator propound that as a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may offer, \nbefore I yield the floor, that I may offer a second amendment on which \nthere is already a time agreement of 3 hours in accordance with the \nusual form. I have no desire to debate that amendment today or to have \na vote on it, but I simply want to get it into the mix, and at such \ntime as the Senate would vote on the first amendment concerning which I \nwould refer to as the subsidy amendment, then once time has run on that \nand we have a vote, I would be happy if we could take up the second \namendment and have the debate on it and vote on it. If this causes any \nproblem with respect to the Thompson amendment, I would be agreeable to \nreducing the time on my second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the Senator's \nrequest? The Chair hears none and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will soon consider the subsidy disclosure \namendment that I offered last Friday. And I say soon. I do not mean to \nimply that it will be today but it could be. I simply state that within \nthe next day or so there will be a vote on that amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in support of my amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4117\n\n (Purpose: To require disclosure by the People's Republic of China of \n  certain information relating to future compliance with World Trade \n                   Organization subsidy obligations)\n\n  Mr. President, I am informed that the amendment has not been called \nup. I ask that the amendment be called up and stated by the clerk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The bill \nclerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 53, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 402. PRC COMPLIANCE WITH WTO SUBSIDY OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A significant portion of the economy of the People's \n     Republic of China consists of state-owned enterprises.\n       (2) Chinese state-owned enterprises receive significant \n     subsidies from the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China.\n       (3) These Chinese state-owned enterprises account for a \n     significant portion of exports from the People's Republic of \n     China.\n       (4) United States manufacturers and farmers should not be \n     expected to compete with these subsidized state-owned \n     enterprises.\n       (b) Commitment To Disclose Certain Information.--The United \n     States Trade Representative--\n       (1) acting through the Working Party on the Accession of \n     China to the World Trade Organization, shall obtain a \n     commitment by the People's Republic of China to disclose \n     information--\n       (A) identifying current state-owned enterprises engaged in \n     export activities;\n       (B) describing state support for those enterprises; and\n       (C) setting forth a time table for compliance by the \n     People's Republic of China with the subsidy obligations of \n     the World Trade Organization; and\n       (2) shall vote against accession by the People's Republic \n     of China to the World Trade Organization without such a \n     commitment.\n       (c) State-Owned Enterprise.--The term ``state-owned \n     enterprise'' means a person who is affiliated with, or wholly \n     owned or controlled by, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China and whose means of production, products, \n     and revenues are owned or controlled by a central or \n     provincial government authority. A person shall be considered \n     to be state-owned if--\n       (1) the person's assets are primarily owned by a central or \n     provincial government authority;\n       (2) in whole or in part, the person's profits are required \n     to be submitted to a central or provincial government \n     authority;\n       (3) the person's production, purchases of inputs, and sales \n     of output, in whole or in part, are subject to state, \n     sectoral, or regional plans; or\n       (4) a license issued by a government authority classifies \n     the person as state-owned.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Parliamentary inquiry: The time utilized by the clerk in \nreading the amendment is not to be charged against my time, is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Voting in support of this amendment sends a message that the U.S. \nSenate seeks transparency to China's likely accession to the World \nTrade Organization (WTO). It sends a message that the Senate is \nprepared to ``stand up'' for U.S. industries, such as iron and steel, \ncoal mining, and petroleum, as well as U.S. agriculture producers, such \nas the apple industry, and the beef industry. A vote in support of this \namendment places members on record that they demand China's compliance \nwith the promises that China has made under the bilateral trade \nagreement that it signed with the United States.\n  This amendment is simple and straightforward. There is no hidden \npoison pill! There is no trick procedure! There is no so-called catch \ntwenty-two to this amendment! It does not impede the possible benefits \nof China's accession to the WTO that many of my colleagues are hoping \nfor.\n  My amendment would require the United States Trade Representative \n(USTR) to obtain a commitment by the People's Republic of China to \ndisclose information relating to China's plans to comply with the World \nTrade Organization (WTO) subsidy obligations. The amendment requires \nthe USTR to obtain a commitment by China to disclose essential subsidy \ninformation unique to China's communist market. Specifically, the \namendment would require China to identify, up front, current state-\nowned enterprises engaged in export activities; describe state support \nfor those enterprises; set forth a time table for compliance by China \nwith the subsidy obligations of the WTO, and the amendment provides the \nUSTR with authority to vote against China's WTO accession without such \na commitment.\n  This amendment only seeks to disclose information that confirms \nChina's promised compliance with the WTO subsidy rules! It simply seeks \nthat China disclose essential subsidy information forthright, openly, \nin the bright light of sunshine on a cloudless day. If China is serious \nabout the promises that it has made to the United States on subsidies, \nthis information should easily be provided. This amendment also helps \nwith the many questions that have surrounded the transparency of the \nWTO rules, in general.\n  Let us not place U.S. industries in the position of being unfairly \ninjured by Chinese imports illegally subsidized. Without his \ninformation, U.S. industries will be required to pay the huge fees \nassociated with filing antidumping and countervailing duty cases in \norder to pursue data on illegal subsidy behavior in China.\n  We know that a significant portion of the economy of the People's \nRepublic of China consists of state-owned enterprises! We know that \nChinese enterprises receive significant subsidies from the Chinese \ngovernment! We know that Chinese state-owned enterprises account for a \nsignificant portion of exports from the Chinese government!\n  This is a matter of fact. So I say to my friends here in the Senate, \ndo not fool yourselves! State-owned enterprises continue to be the most \nsignificant source of employment in most areas in China, and some \nreports suggest that these subsidized enterprises accounted for as much \nas 65 percent of the jobs in many areas of China in 1995--the most \nrecent data that the Library of Congress could provide on this matter. \nThat's right. State-owned enterprises likely account for 65 percent of \nthe jobs in most areas of China. What kind of funds and other \nassistance do state-owned enterprises in China receive from their \ngovernment? We should know. Help me find out by voting in support of \nthis amendment!\n  We should know. We ought to know. I ask that other Senators help us \nto know by helping us to find out this information. They can do that by \nvoting in support of this amendment.\n  I understand that China has stepped up to the plate and signed a \nbilateral agreement with the United States that proclaims that China \nwill cease the use of subsidies prohibited under the WTO Agreement on \nSubsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), including those \nsubsidies contingent upon export performance and subsidies contingent \nupon the use of domestic over imported goods, which are strictly \nprohibited under the SCM. But, guess what? On July 21, 2000--just a few \nweeks ago--the President of the Export-Import Bank of China, Yan Zilin, \nwas quoted in the China Daily as saying that China's state-backed \nfinancing played a strong role in boosting China's exports in the first \nhalf of this year! China is subsidizing its products to ensure that \nthey can be exported\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\ninto foreign markets--including our market. U.S. companies cannot \ncompete with such subsidies. Are Senators aware that China's machinery \nand electronic exports grew by 42.1 percent in the first half of 2000 \nreaching $47.1 billion and accounting for 41.1 percent of total \nexports?\n  Moreover, since having signed the bilateral agreement with the U.S., \nChina has expressed a view that it should be included in the grouping \nof the poorest countries in the WTO--thus exempting China from the \ndisciplines of the WTO subsidy codes altogether. We need to send the \nChinese a strong message about the use of subsidies. We need to put in \nplace some disclosure procedures that improve transparency about the \nuse of such subsidies to Chinese industries.\n  My colleagues who are dead set against any amendments to this bill \nare bound to reflect back to the U.S.-China bilateral agreement and \nargue that the USTR has already secured an agreement from China to \neliminate all WTO illegal subsidies, and that the WTO requires certain \ncompliance procedures already.\n  However, the Chinese government oversees the top-to-bottom operations \nof many industries such as iron and steel, coal mining, petroleum \nextraction and refining, as well as the electric power utilities, \nbanking, and transportation sectors. The staunchest supporters of \npassing PNTR to China acknowledge that the trade rules that the Chinese \nhave agreed to will likely in the short term cause widespread \nemployment. If the past is an accurate indicator, the Chinese \ngovernment will be very tempted to simply ignore the rules that they \nagreed to and to use their domestic state-owned enterprises as a jobs \nprogram.\n  Former Secretary of Commerce William Daley stated that ``I do not \npretend to think that this implementation of this agreement by the \nChinese will be easy for them (the Chinese), and I would assume that we \nwill have to, in the next administration, have to be very aggressive in \ntheir enforcement of the commitments that have been made.''\n  Let me remind you that, without doubt, subsidies with all of our \ntrading partners have been very difficult issues to resolve, and not \nall subsidies are actionable. In fact, with years of trade relations \nand negotiations, the U.S. has yet to reach a subsidy understanding \nwith the European Union on agriculture or on some industrial sectors \nsuch as aeronautics.\n  There is no harm in the extra measure of protection that is provided \nby my subsidy disclosure amendment. It provides transparency and will \nhelp many U.S. industries make improved, more educated decisions. So I \nurge members to support U.S. steelworkers, apple growers, electronic \nproducers and vote for this amendment.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor and I reserve the balance of the time on \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my \ngood friend from West Virginia. I do so because of my concern about the \nimpact that amendments could have on this legislation, but also because \nof substantive concerns I have about his proposal.\n  Before I address the merits of his amendment, I wanted to take a few \nminutes to respond to the comments he made last week regarding the \nmanner in which this legislation is being considered.\n  He very colorfully described this legislation as a ``greased pig'' \nand protested that the Senate had not had adequate time to consider its \nmerits.\n  I am sorry that he feels this way, because with all the time I've \nspent on this legislation and with all the time I've waited for PNTR to \nbe brought to the floor, I can say that this is no greased pig.\n  This legislation has been given a full and adequate hearing. The \nFinance Committee, which I chair, held three hearings on PNTR this year \nalone. At these hearings we heard from a full range of witnesses, pro \nand con, who discussed the significance of this agreement, not just \nfrom the perspective of trade, but also from the perspectives of \nforeign policy, human rights, religious freedom, labor rights, and \nothers.\n  We have also benefited from the careful reviews by the Congressional \nResearch Service, the International Trade Commission and the General \nAccounting Office, which has a team of analysts who have been following \nthe China negotiations closely for several years now.\n  My committee also held an open markup, where the committee approved \nPNTR all but unanimously, by a vote of 19 to 1. My committee also \nconsidered the House-passed legislation in executive session, where my \ncolleagues agreed with me and the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nMoynihan, that we should support the legislation as passed.\n  Those actions, together with the hearings on PNTR that have been \nconducted by the Foreign Relations Committee, the Commerce Committee, \nand others hardly constitute rushed consideration of this important \nlegislation.\n  Let us not forget that this legislation has been on the floor for \nconsideration by the full Senate for 6 days, and will likely be here \nfor another week. During this time we have been in regular order, and \nhave welcomed all amendments. I would be hard pressed to think of \nanother piece of recent legislation that has received more time and \nscrutiny that this has.\n  All of us who support PNTR understand well that amending this bill \nwill threaten its passage. Our opponents, I think, understand this even \nbetter.\n  In the end, it is an exercise of our prerogatives to vote against \namendments, given the threat they pose to the legislation. It is \nentirely appropriate for us to do so.\n  After all, there is nothing that can be added or subtracted from the \nlegislation that will enhance our access to the Chinese market. There \nis also nothing that can be added or subtracted that will strengthen \nthe unequivocal support contained in this legislation for human rights, \nlabor rights, and the rule of law.\n  With that said, let me take a few minutes to discuss my colleague's \namendment regarding subsidies. Although I unequivocally share Senator \nByrd's views regarding the importance of compliance and regarding the \nsignificance of China's subsidies commitments, I must still oppose his \nproposal. I do so, not just because of my already stated concern about \namendments, but also because of the substance of this amendment, which, \nin my view, is both redundant and flawed.\n  I would point my good friend to section 1106 of the Trade Act of \n1988. The provision already conditions the President's extension of \nPNTR to China on a finding that China's state-owned enterprises are not \ndisruptive to our trading interests. While I know that my colleague's \namendment is crafted somewhat differently, the fundamental purpose of \nhis amendment is already contained in section 1106. As such, it is \nredundant, and not necessary.\n  Moreover, this amendment overlooks the fact that we already have a \nspecific time table for China to come into compliance with its \ncommitments in this area--and that is the date of accession.\n  The amendment directs that China identify every entity receiving \nstate support, yet the key feature of WTO disciplines is that they \napply to the subsidy programs themselves. The Chinese have already \nagreed to end all prohibited subsidies, which is far more important \nthat asking for a detailed company-by-company accounting of who gets \nwhat prior to China's entry into the WTO. Such an accounting, \nironically, would delay accession, undermining the goal of achieving \nthe subsidy disciplines in the first place.\n  All this is not to say that I, as chairman of the Finance Committee, \nbelieve that China's integration into the WTO system will be without \ncomplications. Setbacks and conflicts are inevitable. Anyone who thinks \notherwise misunderstands the magnitude of the task that lays ahead for \nthe Chinese.\n  That is why H.R. 4444 already directs USTR to provide a detailed \nannual report on China's compliance with its WTO commitments. That is \nalso why the legislation authorizes the funds necessary to allow USTR, \nthe Department of Commerce and other agencies to have the personnel \nnecessary to monitor China's compliance and to take whatever actions \nnecessary to enforce our rights.\n\n[[Page S8300]]\n\n  The WTO process also takes full account of the imperative of \nmonitoring China's compliance. That is why the WTO will establish a \ntransitional review mechanism, through which WTO members will conduct \nregular reviews of all aspects of China's compliance. These reviews \nwill be conducted as a matter of course and will avoid the need to \nresort to dispute settlement each time a conflict arises.\n  The Chinese have already agreed to such a review, though the \nspecifics are still being worked out. That is why H.R. 4444 contains an \nunequivocal statement of Congress's support for such a review. I will \ntake this opportunity to restate to both the administration and to the \nChinese that it is imperative that the PRC be subjected to as rigorous \na review as possible. This is essential not just for the United States, \nbut also for the viability of the WTO.\n  In the end, I say to my good friend from West Virginia that we share \na common objective, to end and I emphasize end--China's prohibited \nsubsidies. At best, however, this amendment simply delays that goal.\n  None of the benefits of China's compliance will become available to \nus unless we pass PNTR. As I have said many times, any amendment added \nto this bill will likely kill this legislation, and kill the benefits \nof China's WTO commitments for our farmers and our workers. That is why \nI must oppose the amendment of my good friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the number attached to the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The number attached to the amendment is \namendment No. 4117. The distinguished Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4131\n\n  (Purpose: To improve the certainty of the implementation of import \n  relief in cases of affirmative determinations by the International \n    Trade Commission with respect to market disruption to domestic \n          producers of like or directly competitive products)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier I received the permission of the \nSenate to offer a second amendment, not to have it debated but to have \nit in line for debate. I send that amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4131.\n       Beginning on page 16, strike line 11 and all that follows \n     through line 2 on page 17 and insert the following:\n       ``(k) Standard for Presidential Action.--\n       ``(1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       ``(A) market disruption causes serious harm to the United \n     States industrial and agricultural sectors which has grave \n     economic consequences;\n       ``(B) product-specific safeguard provisions are a critical \n     component of the United States-China Bilateral Agreement to \n     remedy market disruptions; and\n       ``(C) where market disruption occurs it is essential for \n     the Commission and the President to comply with the timeframe \n     stipulated under this Act.\n       ``(2) Timeframe for action.--Not later than 15 days after \n     receipt of a recommendation from the Trade Representative \n     under subsection (h) regarding the appropriate action to take \n     to prevent or remedy a market disruption, the President shall \n     provide import relief for the affected industry pursuant to \n     subsection (a), unless the President determines and certifies \n     to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate \n     that provision of such relief is not in the national economic \n     interest of the United States or, in extraordinary cases, \n     that taking action pursuant to subsection (a) would cause \n     serious harm to the national security of the United States.\n       ``(3) Basis for presidential certification.--The President \n     may determine and certify under paragraph (2) that providing \n     import relief is not in the national economic interest of the \n     United States only if the President finds that taking such \n     action would have an adverse impact on the United States \n     economy clearly greater than the benefits of such action.\n       ``(4) Automatic relief.--\n       ``(A) In general.--If, within 70 days after receipt of the \n     Commission's report described in subsection (g), the \n     President and the United States Trade Representative have not \n     taken action with respect to denying or granting the relief \n     recommended by the Commission, the relief shall automatically \n     take effect.\n       ``(B) Period relief in effect.--The relief provided for \n     under subparagraph (A) shall remain in effect without regard \n     to any other provision of this section.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the clerk. I thank the Chair. As I \nunderstand it, the number on the amendment which was pending is No. \n4117?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I inquire of the Chair, what will be the designation of \nthe new amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senate amendment No. 4131.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4117 be set \naside temporarily and that amendment No. 4131 may be the pending \namendment, with the understanding that it will be temporarily set aside \nalso for the rest of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 1 p.m. having arrived, the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, is recognized to offer an \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4132\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the application of certain measures to covered \n countries in response to the contribution to the design, production, \ndevelopment, or acquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons \n                    or ballistic or cruise missiles)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4132.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it has been said that the vote on \npermanent normal trade relations with China is one of the most \nsignificant pieces of legislation this body will have voted on in a \nlong time. That very well may be true.\n  For a number of reasons, I think most of the Members of this body are \nfirmly committed to the concept of free trade. It has done the United \nStates very well. We all know we are in the midst of a technological \nrevolution that is increasing our productivity in this country and is \ngiving us advantages we have never known before in the international \nmarketplace. But it is not a zero sum game either; it has been \nbeneficial for the whole world.\n  I sign on to the concept that free trade leads to free markets and \nthat free markets can lead to freer societies. The new trade \narrangement we will be entering into with the People's Republic of \nChina is also unique in many respects. As we know, they have 1.2 \nbillion-plus people in China. It is a tremendous market upon which \neveryone now is focused. While our trade with China only constitutes \nabout 2 percent of our international trade at this point, there are \nthose who believe that can be increased substantially.\n  Usually we are trading with people who share our ideals and who share \nour\n\n[[Page S8301]]\n\nvalues. This is not always true as far as the People's Republic of \nChina is concerned. We have just been reminded again by our own State \nDepartment that the religious persecution that has been going on in \nChina for some time actually is not only not showing any improvement; \nit seems to be deteriorating. Yet there are many here who argue--most \nof the people in this Chamber, I assume--that PNTR represents something \nso attractive to this country that we must adopt it, that it is a good \ndeal.\n  That argument is powerfully set forth, even though the PRC has not \nkept agreements in times past. Even its foremost advocates would have \nto acknowledge that its record on compliance with agreements in times \npast has been spotty at best. When it comes to intellectual property, \nfor example, it has been a haven of piracy. They have been major \nexporters of pirated goods from this country.\n  One must also wonder whether or not the Chinese can really comply \nwith the commitments they have made in light of the economic conditions \nin their country. They are experiencing slower growth rates. They are \nexperiencing greater unemployment. We are seeing indications of rioting \nin various parts of China because of unemployment and because of some \nof the things we have seen happen in Russia and other countries. When \nthey begin to privatize a little bit, some of the governmental \nofficials seem to wind up with the goods and the property, and the \naverage people see that and don't like it. It causes instability and in \nsome cases rioting. That is prevalent in China right now. If they lower \nthe barriers in ways they are talking about, it will only increase that \ninstability. Obviously, it will have to be done gradually and over a \nvery long period of time.\n  That is why it is wise for us not to overhype the benefits we may get \nout of this action. We do about 2 percent of our trade with China now. \nMost people think the maximum probably is going to be up to 2.5 percent \nof our trade. So it is important to our country, but it is not of \nmonumental importance, in my opinion, especially in the short run, in \nlight of all these immediate difficulties they are going to have in \nimplementing what they say they are going to implement.\n  We should be realistic, too, especially in light of the fact that we \nare going to be giving up many of the unilateral actions we could take \nunder present circumstances. When we go into a WTO context, we will be \nhaving to depend upon that body, that organization, and the \ninternational community, as it were, in order to seek compliance. Many \nwriters have pointed out this is going to be very difficult because \nChina is not a transparent society. How do we prove unfair trade \npractices or violations of WTO if there are no records that are \ndecipherable with which to prove it?\n  So there are many difficulties with the implementation of this \nagreement which might result in greater riches to this country and \ndoing something about the $68, $69 million trade imbalance we have with \nChina right now.\n  So it is a gamble. It is a gamble on our part that by gradually \nlowering these barriers to trade, by gradually opening up society, this \ntrade will lead to a gradual opening up of society with the Internet \nand what not, additional travel and additional exchange programs and \nadditional trade; that we will wake up one day and China will be a \ndemocratic society. And in the meantime, we will maintain their \nfriendship so that the world will not be a more dangerous place but a \nless dangerous place.\n  That is the gamble we are making because clearly if this is carried \nout the way that people on both sides hope it will be, China will \nbecome even more powerful economically with all those great numbers of \npeople, and therefore they will become much more powerful militarily. \nYou only have to read a little bit of what is coming out of China these \ndays by their intelligentsia concerning military plans and their view \nof the United States and the fact that many in their country see \nconflict as inevitable, and that they are laying the firm economic \ngroundwork so that they can have a growing and more powerful military \nin the future. That should be of great concern to us. We are limited as \nto what we can do about that.\n  So we take this gamble, before that comes into fruition--if that is \ntheir path--that they can open up that society somewhat and lead to a \nmore open society, a democratic society. On the other hand, the Chinese \nare taking a gamble in that they can open up economic trade somewhat, \nand they can adopt a more capitalistic society and still maintain \ndictatorial control from the top, and that it will not get away from \nthem. Our people say that once that starts happening, once we get in \nthere, there will be no stopping it; democracy is right down the road.\n  The Chinese don't see it that way. They are gambling. I think it is a \ngamble worth taking. I think it is a gamble worth taking because of our \nleadership and free markets and free economies and democratic society \nin this country. I think we should go down that road and we should take \nthat chance. And I am not sure we have much of an option in that \nregard. But while we take that chance, we should be very mindful of the \ndangers that are presented to this country down the road from China and \nothers. And we should be especially mindful of one particular category \nof Chinese conduct right now of all the categories that concern us, \nincluding human rights, religious freedom, and all the rest.\n  The one particular category that poses a mortal threat to the welfare \nof this Nation has to do with the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The fact is that while we are willing to take this chance \nand we go down the road to trade with China, they are engaging in \nactivities that pose a mortal danger to the welfare of this country. \nThat is the subject of the amendment that I have just offered.\n  The China nonproliferation amendment seeks to do something about \nthis. I have sought to have a separate vote on this amendment because I \ndon't consider it to be a trade-related amendment. I have sought, for \nabout a month now, to have a debate in the context of our relationship \nwith China but not to have it as an amendment to PNTR. I have been \nthwarted in that effort. I only have two choices--either relenting \naltogether or doing what I said I would do; that is, filing it as an \namendment to PNTR. Well, that choice is obvious. I have made that \nchoice today because of the importance that I attach to it.\n  Mr. President, the world is a more dangerous place today because of a \ngrowing number of so-called rogue nations such as North Korea, Iran, \nand Libya, who have obtained and are in the process of obtaining \nadditional weapons of mass destruction and the missile means by which \nto deliver them. Now, Congress has been informed of this on numerous \noccasions. It doesn't get a lot of attention but the information has \nbeen consistent. Two years ago, the bipartisan Rumsfeld Commission \nconcluded that rogue states such as North Korea and Iran could develop \nan intercontinental ballistic missile within 5 years of deciding to do \nso. It is pretty clear that they have decided to do so.\n  Shortly thereafter, North Korea surprised our intelligence agencies \nby successfully launching a three-stage rocket over Japan, essentially \nconfirming what the Rumsfeld Commission had told us. Last September, \nthe National Intelligence Estimate, released a report that ``During the \nnext 15 years, the United States most likely will face ICBM threats \nfrom Russia, China, and North Korea, probably from Iran, and possibly \nfrom Iraq.'' It went ahead to point out that as soon as economic \nsanctions were lifted against Iraq, they will probably be back in \nbusiness. Saddam will be reinstituting his ability to wreak havoc in \nvarious parts of the world along with the rest. We have received other \nintelligence reports. Much of it is classified, so I invite my \ncolleagues to avail themselves of these reports, which are even more \ntroubling than what has been made public.\n  Earlier this year, Robert Walpole, National Intelligence Officer for \nStrategic and Nuclear Programs, testified that the threats to our \nNation's security are real and increasing. Mr. President, it is clear \nthat these rogue nations may have ICBMs much sooner than previously \nthought, and that they will be more sophisticated and dangerous. And we \nhave taken note in this Congress--finally, last year--by passing the \nNational Missile Defense Act. That is the primary reason that we need a \nnational missile defense system\n\n[[Page S8302]]\n\nin this country. We belatedly recognized that because of this threat I \nspeak of from the rogue nations.\n  But that is only half of the story. Equally alarming is the fact that \nCongress has also been repeatedly informed that these rogue nations are \nbeing supplied by major nations with whom the United States is entering \ninto increased cooperative arrangements. Last month, the Director of \nthe CIA provided to Congress the intelligence community's biannual \nreport on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We get \nthese reports sent to Congress twice a year.\n  Basically, they have always been in recent history, the same. This \nreport identified China, Russia, and North Korea as key players in \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons technology. According to this \nreport, the Chinese activity has actually increased in support of \nPakistan's activities. And China has also ``provided missile-related \nitems, raw materials, and/or assistance to several countries of \nproliferation concern--such as Iran, North Korea, Libya.'' China, of \ncourse, has a long history of proliferating chemical weapons \ntechnologies to Iran--nuclear, chemical, and biological.\n  The DCI's report also describes Russia's efforts to proliferate \nballistic missile-related goods and technical know-how to countries \nsuch as Iran, India, and Libya. Russia is also identified as a key \nsupplier of nuclear technology to Iran and to India. They also have \nprovided a considerable biological and chemical expertise and \ntechnology to Iran.\n  North Korea, of course, was identified as a key supplier. This is an \ninteresting country because they have a nation full of people who are \napparently starving to death. Yet they not only have managed to become \na threat themselves, they have become the clearinghouse for that part \nof the world. They have become a vendor of weapons of mass destruction. \nThey get help from the big powers, and then with regard to the other \nsmaller powers in that part of the world they begin to assist them. The \nreport identified North Korea as a supplier of ballistic missile \nequipment, missile components, and material expertise to countries in \nthe Middle East, south Asia, and North Africa, just as North Korea is \ndoing.\n\n  This latest CIA report is consistent with past reports. We have seen \nit throughout the 1990s. China is supplying Pakistan with everything \nfrom soup to nuts for their mass destruction capabilities, and \nassistance to North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and missile \nprograms. Just this summer, it was reported that China was helping \nPakistan build a second missile factory, transferring missile equipment \nto Libya, assisted Iran with its missile program, and diverted a U.S. \nsupercomputer for use to its own nuclear programs. All of this occurred \nin violation of a variety of international treaties, agreements, and \nU.S. laws.\n  The bottom line is that these activities by China, Russia, and North \nKorea pose a serious threat to the United States. That threat is \ngrowing. This is at a time when we are granting permanent normal trade \nrelations to China. This is at a time when we are sending over $1 \nbillion a year to Russia and providing other assistance to North Korea.\n  It is inconceivable to me that while we discuss trade issues and a \nnew relationship with China, we will not address what China is doing to \nendanger our country. It is just that simple. That is what this \namendment does.\n  I know people in this body want to pass PNTR. They do not want any \ncomplications. They want to get it done, wrapped up; the President \nwants his legacy, and we want to please our friends in the business \ncommunity; and we all know trade is a good thing, and so forth. But it \nis inconceivable to me that we can address these trade-related issues \nand embrace our new trading partner--China--in a new regime without \nalso addressing and doing something about the fact that they are making \nthis world, and particularly the United States, a more dangerous place \nto live. The Federal Government's first responsibility is national \nsecurity.\n  In July of 1999, the bipartisan Commission to Assess the Organization \nof the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of \nMass Destruction--commonly known as the Deutch Commission--concluded \nthat ``the U.S. Government is not effectively organized to combat \nproliferation,'' despite the fact that ``Weapons of mass destruction \npose a grave threat to United States citizens and military forces, to \nour allies, and to our vital interests in many regions of the world.''\n  It couldn't be any plainer than that, from one of our bipartisan \ncommissions of experts that look at this and try to come to us and warn \nof what is happening.\n  Therefore, Senator Torricelli and I have introduced the China \nNonproliferation Act. Now we have introduced it as an amendment to \nPNTR. This amendment provides for an annual report to Congress and to \nthe American people as to the proliferation activities of these three \nnations because they are the ones on which the CIA is required to \nreport now anyway because they have already been identified as key \nsuppliers--the three nations I have mentioned: China, Russia, and North \nKorea.\n  It authorizes the President, if he makes the determination based on \nthe credible evidence he has before him, to impose some non-trade-\nrelated sanctions on these Chinese companies that are selling these \nweapons of mass destruction. It authorizes the President to take \nvarious actions. There is a list of them.\n  One of the things it authorizes him to do is to cut these companies \nout of our capital markets in this Nation. China raises billions of \ndollars in our capital markets on the New York Stock Exchange to go \nback and spend on its own military. Most people do not know that, I \nassume. I am not here suggesting we stop that, unless the President \ndetermines that they or their companies are engaging in activities, \nwhich are controlled by them, that are dangerous to this Nation.\n  Is this not the minimum we can do in this legislation? There is other \nlegislation on the books, certainly. But this legislation, by a more \nextensive report, requires the President to come to Congress, \nbasically--it does not force the President to take any action, but if \nhe doesn't take action against these companies that are found to be \nproliferating, he has to tell Congress why.\n  In this legislation, if 20 percent in Congress decide they don't \naccept the President's conclusion, they can introduce a resolution of \ndisapproval and get a vote on certain sanctions against these \nproliferating entities. The President, of course, can veto that. It \nwould be tremendously difficult for Congress to force anything through. \nBut it would be a very good debate, and in egregious circumstances that \nwe have seen in times past, I think Congress actually could get some \nresponses through.\n  The legislation also provides for increased transparency. When the \nPresident determines that these companies are proliferating and selling \nweapons of mass destruction, the legislation provides that the \nPresident has to inform Wall Street, and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission has to come up with rules and regulations that will inform \ninvestors they are investing with a company that our country and our \nPresident has determined to be a seller of mass destruction. They can \nstill do that, if they want to. But they ought to know about it. It is \namazing that this law is not already on the books.\n  Lastly, it provides for a Presidential waiver based on national \nsecurity if the President decides, for his good reasons, that is \nappropriate. The bottom line is that with all of this concern, talk, \nand hullabaloo about what this legislation does and doesn't do, until \nthe President makes a determination that these companies are engaging \nin activities that are a threat to this Nation, if our President does \nthat, do we not want to take action?\n  We made changes to this legislation. The critics came out of the \nwoodwork. No one wants anything that will complicate our trade bill \nwith China these days, it seems. I am afraid some of the pro-trade \npeople have their blinders on. I agree with them on how important free \ntrade is and how important this bill is, and so forth. But we have an \nadditional obligation which I tried to suggest to my friends. We have \nan additional obligation not just to put money in our pockets in trade \ntoday but to look down the road for our kids and grandkids to see if \nour trading partners are doing something that will endanger their \nwelfare.\n\n[[Page S8303]]\n\n  We have listened to our critics. We have made changes. We have tried \nto make sure our response was reasonable and measured.\n  Instead of singling out China, we added the other two countries.\n  Instead of having mandatory sanctions tying the President's hands, we \ngave the President additional flexibility where he must find that there \nis cause for a determination to be made against these companies.\n  The bill now contains a blanket provision that protects the \nagricultural community from adverse impact.\n  The bill's penalties only apply to key supplier countries and not to \nU.S. companies and will not affect U.S. workers.\n  We made changes in the congressional review procedure so one person \ncouldn't tie up the whole body. It has to be one-fifth of the Members \nof either House to sign a joint resolution of disapproval. It is a \nmeasured response to a very serious problem.\n  Our critics have been numerous, persistent, and vociferous. They \nclaim that the world will come to an end basically if, while we are \npassing PNTR, we irritate the Chinese by informing them there will be \nconsequences to their irresponsible behavior. I don't think the world \nwill come to an end if we do that. I think the world will be a more \ndangerous place if we don't do that.\n  Let's take a look at some of the things that have been said: Existing \nlaws are sufficient, that we already have the authority on the book. If \nthat is true, why do we see an increasing problem? All we need to do is \nlook at the latest report from the Director of the Central \nIntelligence. Behavior has worsened in the past year. On the eve of \nconsidering PNTR, the behavior has worsened. What will it be after we \napprove PNTR?\n  On the eve of the Senate's consideration of PNTR for China, and after \nthe House had already voted, it was revealed that China was assisting \nLibyan experts with that country's missile program, illegally diverting \nU.S. supercomputers for the use of the PRC's nuclear weapons program, \nand helping to build a second M-11 missile plant in Pakistan. And Iran \ntest fired a Shahab-3 missile capable of striking Israel, capable of \nstriking American troops, capable of striking Saudi Arabia or American \nbases located within the border of our NATO ally, Turkey. This missile \nwas developed and built with significant assistance from the People's \nRepublic of China, and the classified reports of Chinese proliferation \nare even more disturbing.\n  If everything is so hunky-dory, why is this happening? Why does this \ncontinue to happen? I don't think the critics are that concerned that \nwe are duplicating existing law or it might be useless. I think they \nare concerned that it might be useful and that it will substantially \nget the attention of the Chinese. That is exactly what I intend to do.\n  Some say: We don't want to upset them while we are entering into this \nnew trade relationship. I say that is exactly the time when we should \nupset them, if, in fact, they are making this a more dangerous world \nand posing a threat to the United States of America.\n  Some say: Let us continue with our diplomacy; we can talk to them and \nwe can work things out. Where is the evidence of this? All I see is \nevidence of three delegations of senior administration officials going \nto Beijing, hat in hand, asking them to stop the proliferation \nactivities, and each was sent back to Washington emptyhanded and told \npointblank, according to the newspaper accounts and according to the \nquotation of those who were on the delegation, that as long as we \npersisted in a national missile defense system and as long as we \npersisted in supporting Taiwan, they were going to persist in their \nproliferation activities.\n  Basically, we can like it or lump it. Last Friday, I was interested \nto see three different delegations, including our Secretary of Defense, \nour Secretary of State--not minor; first in the administration--\nperceive this problem. They just don't want to do anything to \nacknowledge the shortcomings of this administration in having dealt \nwith this problem or failing to deal with it.\n  Last Friday, the President got a face-to-face meeting with Jiang \nZemin. I was interested in the subject of proliferation, and their \nactivities with Pakistan, totally throwing that place out of balance. \nIt is a tinderbox waiting to explode. Most accounts have Pakistan far \nand away leading India now in terms of their abilities. That is a \ndangerous situation.\n  According to the New York Times International on Saturday, September \n9, ``President Clinton yesterday urged Jiang Zemin to put a stop to \nChina's missile exports to Pakistan.'' Well, better late than never. \n``But in what had already been a week of diplomatic frustration for Mr. \nClinton, Mr. Jiang offered little more than good wishes for the \nPresident's retirement in 4 months and thanks for supporting China's \nbid to join the World Trade Organization.''\n\n  The article went on to say: ``Mr. Clinton's aides had played down the \nprospects of any major progress on Chinese missile exports, Tibet or \nTaiwan, during Mr. Clinton's last months in office. But they had hoped \nthat the expected Senate approval this month of permanent normal trade \nrelations with China--which the United States promised as part of its \naccord with China that ushers it into the World Trade Organization--\nwould be rewarded.'' We were hoping that by doing all this the Chinese \nwould reward us for this. ``They hoped to claim political progress on \nissues that have bedeviled Washington's relations with Beijing since \nthe two first met in 1993.\n  ``In a measure of the two leaders' continuing communications problems \nafter seven years of interchanges, a senior administration official \nsaid yesterday the meeting was designed to get these two men on the \nsame wavelength. . . .\n  ``The conversation on China's missile exports to Pakistan came after \nMr. Clinton, earlier this summer, sent a delegation to China to try to \ncut off the supply. The administration worries that any new missile \ntechnology would heighten Pakistan's ability to strike India.\n  ``But Mr. Jiang, by all accounts, has paid little attention to the \nissue.''\n  I can't be bothered with you, son. We will continue our activities \nwhile we expect you to approve PNTR--no questions asked and no \namendments added.\n  We, in the United States, ought to be embarrassed and ashamed at that \nturn of events.\n  Some say the unilateral sanctions can never be effected. I prefer \nbilateral sanctions, but we have apparently lost the ability to do much \nbilaterally these days. We can't even get a resolution through the \nUnited Nations condemning China for its obvious human rights \nviolations. Our bill recognizes the value of this multilateral \napproach. It would be preferable. But over the years we have seen, \nthough, that sometimes we need to act ourselves.\n  The major threat to these missiles and weapons of mass destruction is \nnot Belgium, or any of our allies; it is the United States of America. \nWe can't wait until we get everybody together on the same page which, \nas I said, is more and more difficult to act. In times past, we have \nseen that U.S. economic pressure in the late 1980s and early 1990s led \nChina's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992. In \n1991, the Bush administration applied sanctions against the PRC for \nmissile technology transfers to Pakistan. And on and on. Even the \nClinton administration took measures that led to the imposition of \nsanctions on the PRC for M-11 missiles on one occasion, M-11 missile \nequipment to Pakistan in violation of the Missile Technology Control \nRegime.\n  Anyway, they backed down and Mr. Berger acknowledged that sometimes \nthese unilateral actions can be beneficial. Some say the dialog will \nassist, and perhaps it will, but only in conjunction with firm action.\n  The leaders of PRC are not irrational people. They only can go as far \nas they can. We have, obviously, allowed them to do what they are \ndoing. When we take actions detrimental to them, they will respond to \nthat, as they have in times past.\n  We need this amendment more than we did even a few days ago. The \nPresident recently decided not to move forward on a national missile \ndefense. As I said earlier, national missile defense, of course, is in \nprimary response to these threats of rogue nations. According to our \nestimates, they will have the ability to be a threat to us in 2005. By \nthe President's actions, now we will be unguarded for at least a year, \nand maybe 2 or 3.\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\n  Doesn't it make sense to take this opportunity to at least have the \nthreat of some sanctions for their activities during that period of \ntime? Of course, China and Russia are vociferously opposing a national \nmissile defense. I find that ironic: The same countries supplying these \nrogue nations with technology and missile equipment to build missiles \nof mass destruction are the ones that are doing the complaining.\n  I talked about the provision concerning transparency and giving the \nPresident, if he finds that it is justified, the authority to do \nsomething about their access to our capital markets. To date, over a \ndozen Chinese firms have raised billions of dollars in the U.S. capital \nmarkets.\n  The Deutch Commission again stated:\n\n       The Commission is concerned that known proliferators may be \n     raising funds in the United States capital markets.\n\n  The Cox Commission review of the U.S. national security concerns with \nChina also conclude:\n\n       [I]ncreasingly, the PRC is using U.S. capital markets as a \n     source of central government funding for military and \n     commercial development and as a means of cloaking technology \n     acquisition by its front companies.\n\n  As we stand idly by.\n  In conclusion, I understand there are many who are saying: Thompson, \nwe think you are trying to do a good thing here. Yes, we really do need \nto address this. Yes, we let it go unattended for too long. But, as an \namendment to PNTR, if you add it to PNTR it will have to go back to the \nHouse and, goodness, we don't know what will happen over there if it \ngoes back to the House.\n  The idea is that, I guess, what, 40 people would change their votes? \nWith the Democratic Party thinking that they are very close to taking \nover the House of Representatives, and with the labor organizations \nhaving lined up support for Vice President Gore for President, the \nthinking is going to be that the labor unions are going to press 40 \nMembers to change their votes so going into the election they will have \na vote on each side of this issue? I think that is absurd on its face. \nIf we agree to this amendment, the House will ratify it within 24 \nhours.\n  Besides, doesn't that beg the question? Should our primary question \nbe whether or not the House would ratify what we do? Since when does \nthe Senate vote on an item simply because they are afraid of what the \nHouse of Representatives might or might not do?\n  House Members included provisions in their bill regarding prison \nlabor, import surges, religious freedom, increases in funding for Radio \nFree Asia. All of that was in their bill. And we are saying we can't \nadd nuclear proliferation to that list of items? Are we going to tell \nthe world that nuclear proliferation is not as much a concern as is \nfunding for Radio Free Asia?\n  I think we should ask what we would be signaling to the world if, at \na time when we say we need a national missile defense system, we act as \nthough we are not concerned about nuclear proliferation at all. What \nsignals are we sending to our allies, such as those in Taiwan? If we \ndon't have the wherewithal to defend ourselves, how can they ever \ndepend upon us to have the fortitude to defend them, if it really comes \ndown to it?\n  What does it say about ourselves in dealing with a country that \nthreatens Los Angeles? Since the last MFN vote--even besides and in \naddition to the increasing religious clampdown that we are seeing over \nthere--they have sent missiles across the Taiwan Strait and they have \nunashamedly stolen nuclear secrets. They continue their proliferation \nactivities. They tell our delegations, and even our President, that \nthey are not going to be responsive at all to our concerns. They are \nnot going to deny at all what they are doing. They are just going to \ntell us they are going to keep on doing it.\n  And sending major delegations to Belgrade and praising Milosevic and \nsaying the United States of America is making the world a more \ndangerous place because of what we did in Yugoslavia? All of that has \nhappened since the last time we approved PNTR.\n  What have we done in return? The President goes over and chastises \nour allies in Taiwan. He adopts the four ``noes'' the Chinese wanted \nhim to. We grant concessions on WTO; We grant concessions on export \ncontrol; We give China and Russia a veto on our national missile \ndefense system; and we turn a blind eye to the proliferation activities \nthey continue.\n  We must ask ourselves, Is this the road to peace? Is this the road to \npeace? The strategic ambiguity may have worked for a little while in an \nisolated place, but it is getting to a place now where the Chinese do \nnot know where we are coming from, where we will draw the line, or if \nwe will not draw the line. I don't know, and I daresay the American \ncitizens don't know. But there have been a couple of other wars that \nsome historians say, because of this ambiguous kind of posture, became \nmore likely. It has been more likely to get us into wars than to keep \nus out of wars. Leaving the impression that we will not act when, in \nfact, we might is just the kind of thing that is going to cause us to \nget into trouble.\n  I finish by saying I support PNTR. There is no reason why we cannot \ntrade, even with those who are engaging in some of the activities I \nhave described. But we cannot do so while turning a blind eye to all of \nthese reports of all of this dangerous activity, all of this continued \nactivity by these countries. Because if we ever signal to the world \nthat we are more concerned with the trade dollar than we are with our \nown national security, we will not remain a superpower for very long. \nTherefore I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment of my \ndistinguished colleagues from Tennessee and New Jersey. While my \nfriends have in good faith tried to address a critical issue--the \nserious national security threat posed by the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction and their means of delivery--I believe the approach \nthey take in this legislation is flawed.\n  I say this as a former chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee--the committee with jurisdiction over nuclear export policy. \nIndeed, it was during my tenure in that position that the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty came up for extension. I spent a good deal of my \ntime in 1995 working to build congressional support for the NPT's \npermanent and unconditional extension.\n  Without the backing of Congress, the U.S. would not have been able to \nexercise the strong leadership essential to overcoming opposition from \nan assortment of countries. Fortunately, on May 11, 1995, the more than \n170 countries party to the NPT agreed to extend the treaty without \ncondition or qualification.\n  That was a proud day for me and a truly historic day in our ongoing \nefforts to make ours a safer and more peaceful world. The amendment \nbefore us today reflects similar admirable intentions.\n  However, there is a gap in this legislation between intention and \nresult. In particular, this legislation relies on sanctions that are \ntoo widely drawn and too loosely conceived to prove effective in \ncountering proliferation.\n  In addition, this amendment will harm our workers and businesses, our \nkey alliances, and the multilateral non-proliferation regime that is \nessential to stemming proliferation in a global economy.\n  Finally, I believe this legislation will significantly compromise our \nability to address the two most important foreign policy challenges \nthis country faces--China's rise and Russia's potential slide into \ninstability.\n  I will discuss each of these problems in turn, beginning with \nsanctions.\n  This amendment uses as its principal tool unilateral sanctions. \nIndeed, this amendment represents the single largest expansion in our \nreliance on unilateral sanctions since the end of the cold war.\n  And if there is one thing Congress should recognize after so many \nattempts at using such methods to force other countries to change their \nbehavior, it is that, as Brent Scowcroft put it:\n\n       . . . the record of U.S. unilateral sanctions is one of \n     unblemished failure.\n\n  In a global economy, shutting off Chinese and Russian access to \nAmerican goods and capital markets will not change Chinese or Russian \nbehavior.\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\nIndeed, as Frank Carlucci noted in a letter he recently sent me, such \nactions\n\n       . . . would likely isolate the United States, not China, \n     giving our European and Asian competitors an open field in \n     providing goods, services and financing to the most populous \n     nation in the world.\n\n  The fact is that telling China or Russia to buy machinery, aircraft \nand agricultural products from our competitors in Europe, Canada and \nJapan, instead of from the United States, does not provide us any \nleverage. That is because American workers and companies will be \npunished rather than Chinese or Russian proliferators.\n  Moreover, for the first time, U.S. securities markets will be used as \na sanctioning tool. This is a particularly troubling aspect of this \namendment because our capital markets have played such an enormously \nimportant role in fueling America's record-breaking economic expansion, \nand the strength of our capital markets is based on a degree of \npredictability and political certainty that this amendment would \nundermine.\n  That is one of the reasons why Alan Greenspan opposes this \nlegislation.\n  But there are other reasons he took this position. Let me quote what \nhe said in testifying before the Senate Banking Committee a couple of \nmonths ago. I will do so at some length because I think his views--\nespecially when expressed in such strong and unusually unambiguous \nterms--are worth heeding:\n\n       In addition to questioning the value of this amendment, \n     there's a very serious question as to whether it will produce \n     indeed what is suggested it will produce.\n       First let me just say that the remarkable evolution of the \n     American financial system, especially in recent years, had \n     undoubtedly been a major factor in the extraordinary economy \n     we've experienced, and it's the openness and the lack of \n     political pressures within the system which has made it such \n     an effective component of our economy and indeed has drawn \n     foreigners generally to the American markets for financing as \n     being the most efficient place where they can, in many cases, \n     raise funds.\n       But it is a mistake to believe that the rest of the world \n     is without similar resources. Indeed, there's huge dollar \n     markets all over the world to lend dollars.\n       Because of the arbitrage that exists on a very \n     sophisticated level throughout the world, the interest rates \n     and the availability of funds are not materially different \n     abroad than here. We do have certain advantages, certain \n     techniques, which probably give us a competitive advantage, \n     but they are relatively minor.\n       But most importantly, to the extent that we block \n     foreigners from investing or raising funds in the United \n     States, we probably undercut the viability of our own system.\n       But far more important is I'm not even sure how such a law \n     could be effectively implemented because there is a huge \n     amount of transfer of funds around the world.\n       For example, if we were to block China or anybody else from \n     borrowing in the United States, they could very readily \n     borrow in London and be financed by American investors. Or, \n     if not in London, if London were financed by American \n     investors, London could be financed, for example, by Paris \n     investors, and we finance the Paris investors.\n       In other words, there are all sorts of mechanisms that are \n     involved here. So the presumption that somehow we block the \n     capability of China or anybody else borrowing in essentially \n     identical terms abroad as here in my judgment is a mistake.\n       So a most fundamental concern about this particular \n     amendment is it doesn't have any capacity of which I'm aware \n     to work. And by being put in effect, the only thing that \n     strikes me is a reasonable expectation that it would harm us \n     more than it would harm others.\n\n  The sanctions in this amendment are not only unilateral and uniquely \nencompass our securities markets; they are also indiscriminate in their \napplication. Sanctions in the amendment would apply to ``persons'' \ndefined as ``any individual, or partnership, business association, \nsociety, trust, organization, or any other group created or organized \nunder the laws of a country; and any government entity.''\n  The problem with mandatory sanctions is that they force a rigid \nresponse, one as likely to exacerbate a problem as solve it. At a \nminimum, they do not permit the discretion necessary to determine \nwhether or not the sanctions provide the best approach to achieving the \nnon-proliferation goals we all share.\n  Let us not forget that the mandatory sanctions of the Glenn amendment \ndid not deter India or Pakistan from testing nuclear weapons. Those \nsanctions, however, did have an impact. Unfortunately, the impact was a \nnegative one, causing harm to our farmers grievous enough for Congress \nto provide relief by passing the Brownback amendment.\n  Now even though the President is theoretically able to waive \nsanctions, Congress gains the power to overturn the President's \ndecision through a procedure similar to and as cumbersome, disruptive \nand counterproductive to American interests as, the one we currently \nuse in annually renewing normal trade relations with China.\n  For example, the amendment provides fast-track procedures for \nautomatic consideration of joint resolutions, automatic referral of \njoint resolutions to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the \nHouse International Relations Committee, automatic discharge from \ncommittee, and privileged status on the floor of both the House and \nSenate for the resolutions.\n  In other words, this amendment provides for procedures virtually \nidentical to those specified in the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which has \nforced Congress to engage in it annual--and notably sterile--debates on \nChina's trade status.\n  PNTR would end this counterproductive process, unless of course this \namendment were to pass. If it did, annual votes would resume on \nsanctions, and not only on China, but also on Russia, North Korea, and \nundoubtedly other countries as well.\n  In fact, the amendment defines a ``covered country'' to include any \ncountry that was previously listed in the Director of Central \nIntelligence's Section 721 report and identified as a ``source or \nsupply of dual-use and other technology,'' unless that country has not \nbeen identified by the DCI for 5 consecutive years.\n  In 1997, the section 721 report listed some of our closest allies, \nsuch as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France, as targets of \nacquisition for WMD programs.\n  The amendment thus could force us to sanction some of our closest \nallies, including those who work most closely with us in the fight \nagainst proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  I cannot believe that sanctioning allies who have actively worked \nwith the United States to enforce international nonproliferation \nagreements will help us in furthering mutual nonproliferation efforts. \nSurely such actions will make future multilateral cooperation--which is \nabsolutely essential to solving proliferation problems--far more \ndifficult.\n  In fact, that point was made by the Ambassadors of Sweden and France \nand the Charge of the European Commission in a joint letter they sent \nme. Here is a part of what they said:\n\n       We would like to emphasize the member states of the EU are \n     strictly adhering to and enforcing the provisions of the \n     multilateral export control regimes (Nuclear Suppliers' \n     Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, Australia Group, \n     Wassenar Arrangement) and are parties to all the relevant \n     Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Treaties, including the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. The EU works closely with the US \n     in stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \n     We have worked jointly to strengthen the non-proliferation \n     regimes and to address specific cases.\n       Against this background, we are concerned that [the \n     Thompson amendment] could potentially be used to threaten EU \n     entities with US sanctions. These EU entities are fully \n     subject to EU member states' controls in compliance with all \n     non-proliferation and export control regimes. We are also \n     highly concerned by attempts to broaden the scope of export \n     controls beyond those agreed at the multilateral level.\n       Let us reiterate that the EU and its Member States fully \n     share the United States' determination to effectively combat \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as we \n     express it in the Joint Statement on Non-Proliferation, which \n     was issued at the May 1998 US-EU Summit . . . However, we \n     urge you to clearly target these pieces of legislation and \n     thus to avoid the surely unintended consequence of \n     undermining US-EU cooperation on non-proliferation matters.\n       We would also like to remind you that any legislation of \n     this type undermines the credibility of multilateral efforts \n     in the field of non-proliferation.\n\n  This last point the Europeans make--about how this legislation may \nundermine multilateral nonproliferation efforts is one shared by \nAmerican proliferation experts such as Frank Carlucci. As he said in \nhis letter to me:\n\n       The important and serious issue of Chinese arms transfers \n     requires a concerted and effective multilateral--\n\n  I emphasize the word ``multilat- eral''--\n\n     response, not the imposition of unilateral sanctions which \n     would have no effect on the\n\n[[Page S8306]]\n\n     sources of the transfers. The United States must provide \n     leadership to the international community on this issue, not \n     isolate itself from our allies by pursuing a course of action \n     that no other nation will follow.\n\n  Just as troubling as the sanctions themselves are the evidentiary \nstandards used to trigger the sanctions. The measure of proof for \nviolation of U.S. nonproliferation and export control policies, and \nthus the threshold for invoking sanctions contemplated by this \namendment, is one of ``credible information.'' When this term has been \nused in the past, it has been defined as ``information which produces a \nfirm suspicion, but by itself, may not be sufficient to persuade a \nreasonable person with confidence'' that the sanctionable activity took \nplace.\n  Surely, critical national security actions should be based on a \nhigher standard, especially when they are being applied to our closest \nallies.\n  There is one other aspect of this amendment that concerns me. Indeed, \nit is the one I find most troubling of all. This amendment will \nseverely constrain the next administration in developing the sort of \ncoherent, consistent, and comprehensive policies toward China and \nRussia that the United States has so sorely lacked for 8 years.\n  As important as curbing Chinese and Russian proliferation activities \nis, we must deal with the whole broad range of challenges these two \ncountries present to U.S. interests.\n  In the case of China, for example, we have an interest in peacefully \nresolving the cross-straits issue as well as the potentially incendiary \nproblems afflicting the Korean Peninsula, South Asia, and the South \nChina Sea. We have an interest in encouraging China's transition to \ncapitalism and the attendant political reform I believe that transition \nwill help foster. And we have an interest in continuing to press China \nto provide its citizens basic human rights and religious freedoms.\n  In the case of Russia, we have an interest in fostering the evolution \nof true democracy, capitalism, and the rule of law; in curbing \ncorruption and in resolving the deadly conflict in Chechnya and the \ncontinuing instability in the Balkans.\n  Given these and other critical foreign policy challenges posed by \nChina's rise and Russia's potential slide into instability, we will not \nhold our policies hostage to individual issues, as important as those \nissues may be.\n  Stemming proliferation by China, Russia, and other countries will \nonly be possible if we get our overall policies toward those countries \nright. Let me read something from a report on China put out recently by \nthe Carnegie Non-Proliferation Project which I think is instructive. \nHere is what it says:\n\n       Encouraging Chinese acceptance of global non-proliferation \n     norms has been a long-term process, concurrent with the \n     larger effort to normalize relations with China . . . During \n     the years of isolation from the West, China's posture \n     rhetorically favored nuclear weapons proliferation, \n     particularly in the Third World, as a rallying point for \n     anti-imperialism. Through the 1970s, China's policy was not \n     to oppose nuclear proliferation, which it still saw as \n     limiting U.S. and Soviet power. After China began to open to \n     the West in the 1970s, its rhetorical position gradually \n     shifted to one of opposing nuclear proliferation, explicitly \n     so after 1983.\n       China's nuclear and arms trade practices did not, however, \n     conform to international non-proliferation regime standards, \n     and major efforts over two decades were required to persuade \n     China to bring its nuclear trade practices into closer \n     alignment with the policies of the other nuclear supplier \n     states. [Yet] there is still a gap that needs to be closed . \n     . .\n       China is still on a learning curve, and endemic problems of \n     a political, cultural and organizational nature exist in \n     China's decision-making apparatus . . . Thus, continued \n     vigilance and diplomatic interchange with China will \n     certainly be necessary on nuclear matters.\n       The missile, chemical and biological areas will also \n     require diligent attention. Up to 1994, China made progress \n     on MTCR requirements. But it is still not clear that its \n     professed restraint applies, as the MTCR requires, to \n     missile components and technology--nor, indeed, that the \n     restraint applies to more than complete `ground-to-ground' \n     missiles. Compliance in this area, which is not defined by \n     treaty, is harder to nail down with standards that China \n     can accept politically--and also entails more scope for \n     ambiguities. The chemical area is defined by treaty, \n     provides for declarations, and lists restricted items, but \n     it covers a very large industrial domain.\n\n  In short, Mr. President, stemming proliferation by China--or by \nRussia, for that matter--is a complicated matter that cuts across our \nbroader bilateral relationship.\n  To achieve the goals we all share of ending proliferation, sustained \nexamination, discussion and debate by the Congress and the next \nAdministration is essential. And negotiation and diplomatic interchange \nwith the Chinese and the Russians must not be constrained by unilateral \nsanctions, as frustrating as those negotiations have been and will \ncontinue to be.\n  Proliferation is a matter of vital national interest. In voting \nagainst this amendment, I will vote against its flaws but not its \nintent. In fact, I applaud my friend from Tennessee for raising this \nissue, and I hope he will continue his work in this critical area next \nyear, when we will have the time to examine the issue thoroughly, and I \nhope come to agreement on a measure that will gain the support of an \noverwhelming majority of this Chamber.\n  Only then can we send the Chinese and other proliferators the right \nmessage about the urgency with which we view stemming the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction and missile technology.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, \nSeptember 12, the Senate proceed to a vote on amendment No. 4117, with \ntime tomorrow morning before 10 o'clock equally divided in the usual \nform for closing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I compliment my distinguished colleague \nfrom Tennessee for offering this amendment. I do support it. I think it \nis a significant step forward. As I listened to the Senator from \nTennessee speak, I was persuaded, however, that the consequence or the \nconclusion of his eloquence was that the entire bill for permanent \nnormal trade relations with China should be defeated.\n  I thought the Senator from Tennessee made a very strong case that it \nis necessary for the United States to be wary of where the People's \nRepublic of China is heading. It is my hope--and I know it is the hope \nof the Senator from Tennessee--that we will have good relations with \nChina and that we will have a peaceful world.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee enumerated the problems with nuclear \nproliferation and the potential difficulties from the People's Republic \nof China, it underscored in my own mind the grave concerns about making \na concession at this stage to permanent normal trade relations with \nChina instead of advancing that economic benefit to China on a year-by-\nyear basis so that the United States would retain some leverage as to \nthe conduct of China. It is important to have the kind of an annual \nreport about which the Senator from Tennessee talks. I think it is a \ngood idea to have it as to Russia and North Korea as well as to China.\n  The reality is, as documented substantially by the Senator from \nTennessee, there are real potential problems on the horizon.\n  At the outset, I wish to make it clear that I support the concept of \nfree trade. I believe history is on the side of free trade. I voted in \nfavor of the North America Free Trade Agreement, in the face of \nconsiderable opposition from my constituency in Pennsylvania. \nSimilarly, I voted for the African Growth and Opportunity/United \nStates-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. Although not without some \nqualms, I have supported most-favored-nation status for China. That was \na hot concern on this floor and in the House of Representatives for \nsome time because of China's violations of human rights. It was my \njudgment that we should have given China most-favored-nation status to \ntry to build their country in the hope that it would move toward \ndemocracy and that it would move toward a greater recognition of human \nrights. In one fell swoop, to grant permanent normal trade relations \nwith China seems to me to be a mistake.\n  I spoke on this subject at some length back on May 17 of this year. I \nknow there are others who wish to speak. I will not repeat what I said \nat that time but would incorporate my comments at that time by \nreference.\n  On the issue of proliferation, there is very substantial evidence \nthat the People's Republic of China is harming the\n\n[[Page S8307]]\n\ninterests of world peace. When they sold the M-11 missiles to Pakistan, \nthey put Pakistan in a position to move forward on a potential nuclear \nconfrontation with India, putting that area of the world at risk. When \nthe People's Republic of China has assisted North Korea's missile \nprogram in providing special accelerometers, again, there is a country, \na rogue country where the People's Republic of China threatens the \ninterests of world peace. And when they have provided assistance to \nLibya's long-range missile program by assisting in the building of a \nhypersonic wind tunnel, there again, they assist a rogue nation which \nreally has the potential of threatening world peace.\n  There has been a very elaborate chart prepared by the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, which is on every desk in the \nroom. I know Senator Helms came to the floor a few moments ago and will \ndoubtless speak about it. It particularizes the problem we face on \nnuclear proliferation by the Chinese, which raises the question: Why \ngive away our bargaining power? The People's Republic of China is \nvitally interested in normal trade relations with the United States. \nWhy not grant it to them this year but reserve judgment next year as to \nwhat happens?\n  The record of the People's Republic of China on human rights is \ndreadful. The massacres at Tiananmen Square constitute only one issue \nin a long line of flagrant violations of human rights. These are \ndetailed in a statement which is a part of the Record of my speech from \nMay 17. I shall not detail them again, except to refer to the case of \nthe Dickinson College librarian, Mr. Yongyi Song, a constituent of mine \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. Song went to China in August of 1999 to study the Cultural \nRevolution. While in China, he was unceremoniously arrested without \ncause, without any justification, and kept in jail for months. When I \nfound out about the case and consulted with Mr. Song's family and with \nDickinson College, I sponsored a resolution, cosponsored by many of my \ncolleagues, and I spoke on the floor of the Senate. I said if the \nPeople's Republic of China wanted to be accorded a seat with the \nnations of the world on matters such as trade, or on matters generally, \nthey would have to have a decent legal system and they would have to \nnot arrest people without any cause. Shortly thereafter, I sought a \nmeeting with the Chinese Ambassador to the United States. The morning \nof our meeting, I heard a rumor that Yongyi Song was going to be \nreleased, and in late January, he was in fact released.\n  I had a very interesting discussion with the PRC Ambassador to the \nUnited States. He admonished me about meddling in internal PRC affairs. \nI had a few responses about the PRC record on human rights, especially \nas they related to the detention of my constituent for many months \nwithout any justification. Then I said that I personally was concerned \nabout having good relations between the United States and the People's \nRepublic of China, a nation of 1.2 billion people. The PRC Ambassador \nquickly corrected me, saying it is not 1.2 billion people, it is 1.250 \nbillion people.\n  There is no doubt about the PRC's recognition of the PRC's power. \nThey are emerging as the second major superpower in the world. That is \nfine so long as they comply with the norms of a civilized world. That \nrequires nonproliferation, and that requires respect for human rights.\n  We have two other matters that have come to the fore recently--both \nissues where the Senator from Tennessee and I have been involved \ncollaboratively. One is on the issue of the efforts by the People's \nRepublic of China to influence U.S. elections, and the second is the \neffort of the People's Republic of China on espionage. China has \nportrayed a very aggressive posture, in my judgment. China has moved \nahead with many people who have made contributions in the political \narena in flat violation of U.S. law, and there are cases--now \ndocumented--of the aggressive efforts of the People's Republic of China \non espionage.\n  The Judiciary subcommittee that I chair on the Department of Justice \noversight has prepared a very lengthy report on Dr. Peter Hoong-Yee \nLee. Dr. Peter Lee on October 7 and 8, 1997, confessed to the FBI that \nhe had provided classified nuclear weapons design and testing \ninformation to scientists of the People's Republic of China on two \noccasions in 1985 and had given classified anti-submarine-warfare \ninformation to the Chinese in May of 1997.\n  Now it is true that espionage is not limited to the People's Republic \nof China. But when they recruit a scientist in the United States and \nacquire information about our classified nuclear weapons design and \ninformation on our anti-submarine-warfare procedures, that is a matter \nof considerable importance.\n  There is another major case which is very much in the forefront today \nand has been for some considerable period of time, and that is the case \ninvolving Dr. Wen Ho Lee, where this morning's media accounts disclose \nthat later today, within a few hours, the Department of Justice has \nagreed to a plea negotiation for 1 count of a 59-count indictment \nconcerning taking classified material and not maintaining the \nappropriate classification. This is a case that was under investigation \nby the Department of Justice Oversight Subcommittee, which I chair, and \nwe had looked into it from October of last year until December 14 when \nthe FBI asked that we cease our oversight inquiries because Dr. Wen Ho \nLee was being indicted. We complied with that request so there would be \nno question at all about any interference in the prosecution of Dr. Wen \nHo Lee. Now that the matter is finished, we will move ahead very \npromptly on that oversight investigation.\n  But the case against Dr. Wen Ho Lee is an extraordinary one which \nraised very serious questions about whether Dr. Wen Ho Lee provided the \nPeople's Republic of China highly classified information.\n\n  The investigation as to Dr. Lee proceeded from 1982, was accelerated \nin 1993 and 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997. Then there was a request by the \nFBI, which was a personal request from FBI Director Louis Freeh, \ntransmitted by Assistant Director John Lewis, who went personally to \nAttorney General Reno. Attorney General Reno assigned the matter to a \nman named Daniel Seikaly who had never had any experience with an \napplication for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct. In a context that was reasonably clear that the warrant should \nhave been granted, Attorney General Reno rejected that application.\n  Then, inexplicably, from August of 1998 until December of 1999, the \nFBI did not act to further investigate Dr. Wen Ho Lee. Then, when the \nCox Commission was about to publish a report in January of 1999, \nsuddenly the Department of Justice and the FBI sprang into action, but \ndid not take any steps to terminate Dr. Lee until March, and no steps \nto get a search warrant until April.\n  Now there is no doubt that Dr. Wen Ho Lee is entitled to the \npresumption of innocence as to passing any matters to the People's \nRepublic of China, which was the essence of the FBI investigation. \nEqually, there is no doubt that the Department of Justice has been \nconvicted of extraordinary incompetence in the way this case has been \nhandled, and the questions as to whether the People's Republic of China \ngathered key information remain unanswered and perhaps will be \nilluminated by oversight by our Judiciary Subcommittee. But it is hard \nto understand how the Department of Justice could maintain last week \nthat Dr. Wen Ho Lee had information at his disposal that would ``change \nthe global strategic balance'' or could ``result in the military defeat \nof America's conventional forces,'' posing the ``gravest possible \nsecurity risk to the supreme national interests'' of the United States.\n  So when the matter is concluded--as we have every reason to suspect \nit will be--with the plea bargain, the Department of Justice is going \nto have a great many questions to answer in terms of why they permitted \nDr. Wen Ho Lee to have access to classified information for such a \nprotracted period of time when they had very substantial probable \ncause, as shown in the application for the warrant under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, that there were connections with the \nPeople's Republic of China, which might have access to very important \nnuclear secrets.\n  I mention that case because here is another illustration like the Dr. \nPeter\n\n[[Page S8308]]\n\nLee case where there were questions in the Dr. Peter Lee case, and he \nconfessed and was convicted of passing secrets to the People's Republic \nof China. But in the long investigation on Dr. Wen Ho Lee, the \nDepartment of Justice is going to have some very important questions to \nanswer about why Dr. Wen Ho Lee was enabled to have access to this \nclassified information for such a long period of time, and why they \nkept him in detention with arguments which they have made. They argued \neven that on his release he should not have contact with his wife on \ntheir assertion that she might pass this highly classified information \non, and fought it even to the Court of Appeals. Now, suddenly, in a day \nof reversal of position, which by the accounts will result in Dr. Wen \nHo Lee's release later today, is really very extraordinary.\n  The incompetence of the Department of Justice is obvious. The \nDepartment of Justice owes an explanation perhaps to Dr. Wen Ho Lee and \nto the people of the United States for their bungling of that case. But \nthe point of the matter is, and it is sufficient really for Dr. Peter \nLee's case, that you have an aggressive People's Republic of China \nwhich is after U.S. military secrets.\n  Then there is the issue of the efforts by the People's Republic of \nChina to influence our elections. That, too, has been documented in \ngreat length. I shall not speak about it at any length this afternoon \nexcept to comment about the conviction of Maria Hsia linking the \nPeople's Republic of China and the plea bargain with John Huang, \nCharlie Trie, Johnny Chung, and many, many others where there is \ndocumentation that the People's Republic of China had transferred funds \nto people in the United States to make campaign contributions, which \nwere flatly illegal under U.S. laws, in the interests of the People's \nRepublic of China in influencing our elections.\n  While it is not unusual for one country to engage in espionage \nagainst another country, I believe it is quite unusual for a country to \nseek to influence U.S. elections. Those are matters which weigh in the \nbalance.\n  In essence, what we have before us at the moment is the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee who seeks to have a report \nfrom the President on the question of nuclear proliferation involving \nthe People's Republic of China, and with all due respect, it is subject \nto being avoided by waivers which the President can exercise. But at \nleast it is a step in the right direction.\n  But when we take a hard look at what China has been doing in \ninternational affairs with Taiwan, with their threats and blackmail, \nhaving missile tests off the coast of Taiwan, what they have done with \nhuman rights, what they have done with proliferation, and what they \nhave done in so many of the activities, there is very strong reason to \nconclude that the United States should not grant permanent normal trade \nrelations to the People's Republic of China.\n  Let's trade with them on a year-by-year basis. It is an insufficient \nanswer to say that if we don't trade with the People's Republic of \nChina, other nations will. The United States ought to assert U.S. \nleadership in trying to lead our allies not to trade with China to the \nbenefit of China, if China is to maintain its current course of \nproliferation, of violating human rights, of espionage activities, and \ntrying to influence the internal elections of a country such as the \nUnited States.\n  At a minimum, in conclusion--the two most popular words of any \nspeech--I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. I urge my colleagues to accept the strong persuasion of \nthe Senator from Tennessee to vote no on the entire bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand that the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina earlier indicated that he wished to speak \nat about 2:30. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from \nNorth Carolina finishes, I be recognized to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order for me to deliver my remarks at \nmy desk from my seat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, for the past two months there has been a deluge of \nclaims regarding the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. While Mr. Thompson, \nthe able Senator from Tennessee, has leaned over backward to \naccommodate all concerns raised in good faith, there is clearly no \nsatisfying that particular crowd of ``beltway lobbyists'' who will stop \nat nothing to secure corporate profits. It is just as simple as that.\n  Virtually every argument the pro-Communist China industrial lobby \nmakes regarding this amendment misses one crucial point: Chinese \nproliferation of weapons of mass annihilation poses a grave threat to \nU.S. national security.\n  If there cannot be agreement on this basic premise, then there is no \ncommon ground to be found on the Thompson-Torricelli amendment.\n  But I, for one, find China's trade in those commodities abhorrent and \nintolerable.\n  It is especially unconscionable for China to continue supplying the \nIslamic radicals in Iran with chemical weapons precursors and missile \ntechnology. Lest we forget, Iran's interests are antithetical to the \nUnited States. For the past twenty years the fanatics in Teheran have \npoured money, weaponry, and technology into terrorist groups worldwide. \nThe mullahs have orchestrated dozens of bombings and the cold-blooded \nmurder of hundreds of U.S. servicemen and citizens, including the \nbombing of Khobar Towers, in Saudi Arabia--killing 19 U.S. troops and \nwounding 240 others--and the Hizbollah bombing of the U.S. Marine \nbarracks in Lebanon, which killed 241 Americans.\n  So all this clap trap about reformists in Iran is hogwash--pure and \nsimple. As the saying once went: ``Read my lips''--read mine--Iran is \nruled by an Islamic fundamentalist regime that calls the United States \nthe ``Great Satan'' and continues to spew anti-Semitic, anti-Israeli \nvenom between each and every flight test of its new ``Shahab'' medium-\nrange missiles, supplied, by the way, by Russia and China.\n  Iran is the last country on Earth that the United States should want \nto possess deadly chemical nerve agents, nuclear weapons, or medium-\nrange ballistic missiles.\n  Why on Earth would the United States not do everything possible to \nstop China's supply of nerve agent precursors and specialized glass-\nlined production equipment to Iran?\n  Why on Earth would the Senate look the other way as China continues \nto build a research reactor and other nuclear facilities in Iran, and \nto supply missile testing equipment, guiding systems, technology, and \nspecialized material to Iran's missile program? Why, Mr. President, \nwhy? Surely Iran is the last country on Earth that the United States \nwould ever want to gain possession of advanced cruise missiles capable \nof sinking warships from the United States of America.\n  According to the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, China's C-\n802 missile is ``roughly the equivalent of the French EXOCET missile \nthat Iraq used in 1987 to attack the frigate U.S.S. Stark in the Gulf, \nkilling 37 Americans.''\n  Why, Mr. President, would the United States not do everything in its \npower, including the imposition of sanctions, to prevent China from \nsupplying hundreds of these missiles to the Iranian military?\n  Iran is by no means the only dangerous country to which Communist \nChina continues to ship deadly weaponry. There is that little regime in \nLibya which today is on trial in The Hague for the cowardly terrorist \nbombing of a plane over Lockerbie, Scotland. Do you remember that, Mr. \nPresident? That cruel, beastly attack killed 270 people; 189 of whom \nwere Americans.\n  Libya is getting from the Chinese all sorts of missile testing \nequipment and training. Just bear in mind, for example, this is a \nregime that once drew a ``line of death'' across the Gulf of Sidra\n\n[[Page S8309]]\n\nand launched war planes to attack the U.S. Navy. Under no circumstances \nwould the United States want Libya to possess a ballistic missile \ncapable of dropping chemical or biological weapons on the U.S. troops \nstationed in Italy. But that is precisely the capability that the PRC--\nthe People's Republic of China--is supplying to Libya to date.\n  Then there is North Korea. We must not leave out North Korea, that \nCommunist dictatorship that engaged in a massive surprise attack \nagainst the United States and South Korea in 1950 which ultimately \nkilled more than 35,000 Americans. North Korea is acting today as if it \nis going to make amends, and we will see about that. I think it is \nabout time. The point remains that North Korea still maintains a \nmillion-man army with thousands of tanks and artillery pieces deployed \nwithin a few miles of Seoul. North Korea is a country which recently \nlaunched that ballistic missile over Japan--do you remember that?--a \nmissile capable of reaching the United States of America with a small \nchemical or biological warhead.\n  North Korean boats periodically engage in shooting matches with South \nKorean ships. North Korea has deployed assassination squads on \nminisubmarines to infiltrate its neighbors to the south, and they \ncontinue to harbor vicious terrorists wanted in Japan for a variety of \nmurders, and they are working overtime on the development of nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons. This is not a country that the United \nStates wants to possess long-range ICBMs--but Communists insist on \nsupplying Pyongyang with missile technology and specialized steel.\n  I haven't even touched on the subject of Chinese missile and nuclear \nassistance to Pakistan or its supply relationship with the dictatorship \nin Syria or the help it was giving to Saddam Hussein's horrible \nprograms.\n  The world today is a very dangerous place, populated with tyrants and \ndespots hostile to the United States. These are countries which have \nkilled Americans by the hundreds. At every turn in the road we discover \nthat Communist China is supplying all of these countries with \ntechnology which ultimately can be used in the future to kill Americans \nagain.\n\n  No matter how many times the United States raises the matter of \nChina's military exports, the Communist leadership in Beijing refuses \nto cease and desist. They change the subject. Indeed, the history of \nU.S.-Chinese relations on nonproliferation matters is one littered with \nbroken promises. It is a tale of deceit and trickery by Communist \nChina.\n  I call attention to this chart, which the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania referred to earlier, which shows China has made at least \n14 major nonproliferation commitments since 1984, 7 relating to the \nproliferation of nuclear technology. The People's Republic of China has \nmade five--count them, five--separate pledges regarding the transfer of \nmissile technology and two pledges on chemical and biological \ntransfers. During the past 20 years, the PRC has violated every one of \nthose promises.\n  Immediately following Communist China's 1984 pledge not to help other \ncountries develop nuclear weapons, what do you think happened? Yes, \nthat is right, China signs a little ``secret'' protocol with Iran to \nsupply nuclear materials. Beginning in the early 1980s, China helped \nPakistan get the bomb, sharing weapons design information. In 1996, \nChina was caught having to shift a large number of specialized ring \nmagnets for weapons-grade enrichment of uranium to Pakistan.\n  In 1998, at the very time China was telling Congress that China had \nquit assisting Pakistan--in order to secure congressional support for \ncommercial nuclear cooperation--the Clinton administration knew for a \nfact about ongoing PRC contacts with Pakistan's nuclear weapons \nprogram. It is abundantly clear, 2 years later, that China has never \nadhered even once to its nuclear nonproliferation pledges. In fact, \naccording to the latest unclassified intelligence assessment of a month \nago:\n\n       Chinese entities have provided extensive support in the \n     past to Pakistan's nuclear programs. In May 1996, Beijing \n     promised to stop assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear \n     facilities, but we cannot preclude ongoing contacts.\n\n  That is a nice way of saying it is still going on. It is the same old \nsong: second verse same as the first, in the case of missile transfers. \nAgain, China has repeatedly broken its pledges.\n  A claim in 1989 that it had no ``plans'' to sell medium-range \nmissiles to the Middle East was almost immediately contravened by \nseveral transactions. A subsequent pledge, in early 1991, to refrain \nfrom medium-range sales to the Middle East--also rubbish.\n  So we come to 1992, when China made yet another promise--written down \nthis time--that it would not transfer any category I or category II \nmissile items to Syria, Pakistan, or Iran. A lot of good people just \nsaid, OK, that is great; peace, peace, peace is right around the \ncorner. The Chinese pledge specifically covered M-9 and M-11 missiles, \nand extended to existing contracts.\n  But this, of course, did not stop China from selling M-1 or M-11 \nmissiles to Pakistan or from selling missile technology to Iran and \nSyria--no siree. So what happened? The Clinton administration extracted \na further pledge, don't you know, in 1994--from whom? That's right, \nChina--that it really did intend to abide by the MTCR. China said: Oh, \nyes, yes, sir; we are going to abide by it.\n  But that Chinese commitment to observe the MTCR guidelines--which, by \nthe way, explicitly, clearly prohibit the transfer of missile \nproduction equipment--was observed no better than the earlier pledges. \nNot only did M-11 sales continue but Communist China was discovered \nsupplying a production facility for such missiles to Pakistan. \nAccording to various press accounts, China recently completed work on \nthis facility for Pakistan.\n  Oh, boy, you can trust these Chinese, can't you? ``I think we ought \nto sign this thing and go ahead and trust them and be done with it.'' \nIf you believe that, you will believe anything because there are a lot \nof facts regarding the current exports of China's military that I have \nuncovered.\n  The point is, and I say this reluctantly because these are my \nfriends, too--or they have been--as much as various business lobbyists \nmay wish to portray the Communist leadership in Beijing as being \ntrustworthy and responsible, the truth is that the Chinese regime is \nneither trustworthy nor responsible. It has never been responsible. It \nhas given terrorist regimes deadly chemical capabilities and nuclear \ntechnology to vaporize entire cities and missiles capable of raining \nterror on innocent people from above. Nor has Beijing proven \ntrustworthy. They have broken pledge after pledge and pledge.\n  I have to say this for the Clinton-Gore administration. It was not \nthe first to allow itself to be duped by the PRC in order to pursue \nthis commercial objective. But the current administration has coupled \nits willingness to subordinate nonproliferation concerns to trade with \nan alarming disregard for the law, in my judgment.\n  I deeply regret the appalling legal hijinks of the administration in \ntrying to avoid sanctioning Communist China for its military trade. \nMaybe somebody else will remember, as I do, that New York Times quote \nthat President Clinton was declared to have made, that U.S. sanctions \nlaws put--as the President put it:\n\n       . . . enormous pressure on whoever is in the Executive \n     Branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is really \n     going on.\n\n  The fact that the President would say such a thing, I have to admit, \ndoesn't come as too much of a surprise. The Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee--of which I happen to be chairman--has in particular been on \nthe receiving end of this sort of business of ``fudging the facts'' for \nthe past 8 years. Time and time again it has happened. I am sick of it. \nWhile no administration has ever voluntarily imposed sanctions that it \nbelieved would be counterproductive, the Clinton-Gore administration's \ncallous disregard of U.S. law is bouncing around at a new low.\n\n  Because the administration has no stomach for nonproliferation \nsanctions, and because the Chinese obviously know it, the United States \nnonproliferation dialog with China has become nothing more than an \nopportunity for Beijing to uncover how the U.S. intelligence community \nknows things about China's weapons trade. At\n\n[[Page S8310]]\n\nthis point, I think it must be patently obvious to Communist China that \nthis administration does not have--what? The right stuff, I guess is \nthe right way to put it--the right stuff to impose missile sanctions \nand make them stick.\n  The exponential growth in China's deadly exports, clearly shown on \nthis chart, is occurring in the face of weakening U.S. resolve.\n  In the name of my children and grandchildren, your children and \ngrandchildren, Mr. President and all other Senators, that is such a \ndangerous, dangerous combination.\n  As I see it, the obvious benefit of the Thompson-Torricelli amendment \nnow pending is twofold. First and foremost, the amendment underscores \nthe Senate's concern about Red China's ongoing trade in the deadliest \ntypes of weapons technology with terrorist nations. Under no \ncircumstance should the Senate let this moment pass without deploring--\nwithout deploring it loudly--China's behavior and raising the stakes \nfor China's continued assistance to the likes of North Korea and Iran \nand Libya. It is impossible to overstate how critical this is at a time \nwhen the commercial interests of the United States clearly predominate \nover national security concerns, and that is exactly what is happening.\n  Second, it also raises the ante on an executive branch which has come \nto think of mandatory sanctions as optional things. You don't have to \ndo them. I recognize that it is clearly impossible to compel this \nadministration to adhere to the supreme law of the land. But surely the \nSenate can make flagrant disregard for the law a little more \nuncomfortable for some in the administration by requiring expanded \nreporting on China's proliferation behavior based on a reasonable \nevidentiary standard.\n  Mr. President, for all of these reasons I strongly support the \nThompson-Torricelli amendment. I not only hope, I pray that other \nSenators will join in sending a strong message to Beijing that its \ndangerous exports must stop forthwith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4444, \nwhich would provide for the extension of Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations, PNTR, to the People's Republic of China.\n  The proponents of this measure would have us believe that the \ndecision to support PNTR is completely one-sided, with all the benefits \ngoing to the United States and none to the Chinese. If that analysis \nwere correct, one would have to believe that the Chinese are either \nnaive or simply being charitable to the United States. I don't think \neither of those propositions is true.\n  In my view, it would not only be counter to the trade interests of \nthe United States to grant PNTR to China, but it would undermine other \nimportant bilateral U.S. interests with that country, including \nnational security, foreign policy, human rights, religious freedom, \nlabor rights, and environmental protection. We should be seeking \npermanent normal relations with China which would link all of our \ndiverse interests with China into an integrated policy, but I do not \nsupport Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China in the absence of \nachieving permanent normal relations. In other words, we should not \nseparate out the trade relationship alone without addressing these \nother important matters that are at issue between us.\n\n  Let me address then why I do not think it is in the U.S. national \ninterest to grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China at this \ntime.\n  The decision to grant PNTR to China is linked to China becoming a \nmember of the WTO, the World Trade Organization. Under the rules of the \nWTO, member countries are obliged to grant unqualified most-favored-\nnation treatment to each other. In the view of the supporters of PNTR, \nthe United States must grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China \nso the United States will be able to utilize the dispute resolution \nmechanism of the WTO to enforce compliance by China with trade \nagreements. In fact, the WTO agreement has been characterized as being \ncompletely one-sided in favor of the United States. A summary of the \narguments in favor of the agreement prepared by the Administration \nstated:\n\n       This is not a trade agreement in the traditional sense. \n     This is a one-way deal. We would simply maintain the market \n     access policies that we already apply to China.\n\n  I believe this assertion overlooks some very important \nconsiderations. Until now, the United States has been free to link \ntrade to any of our other concerns with China--national security, \nforeign policy, human rights, religious freedom, labor rights, \nenvironmental protection. With the exception of national security, \ngranting PNTR to China would effectively end the ability of the United \nStates to link trade with any of our other concerns with China because \nit would violate WTO rules. Even national security, for which the WTO \nhas an exemption, would be subject to challenge and review within the \nWTO. Further, within the trade area itself, the United States would not \nbe able to use U.S. trade laws to enforce compliance by China with its \ntrade commitments.\n  If one stops and thinks about this for a moment, it seems clear that \nChina is achieving a fundamental strategic objective which, from its \npoint of view, is enormously in its self-interest. The proponents of \ngranting PNTR to China want the decision to be viewed through the \nnarrow prism of trade relations because on that basis they believe the \nagreement is defensible. Even on those terms, I believe extending PNTR \nto China is an unwise decision, but it completely ignores the broader \nand more fundamental interests the United States is abandoning by \ngranting PNTR to China.\n  I will review the U.S. trade relationship with China and why, even \nfrom the narrow perspective of trade, granting PNTR to China is not in \nthe U.S. national interest. I will then review the broader interests \nthe United States has at stake in this decision, some of which are \nunderscored by the amendment that is now pending.\n  Let me turn first to the bilateral trade relationship. Our bilateral \ntrade relationship with China is our most one-sided significant \nbilateral trade relationship. We have been running a steadily \nincreasing trade deficit with China for nearly two decades. In 1985, we \nhad a trade deficit of $9 million. Since then, it has set a new record \nevery year, rising from $1.6 billion in 1986 to $10.4 billion in 1990, \nto $29.4 billion in 1994, and $56.8 billion in 1998. In 1999, the \nCommerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit with China \nreached a record $69 billion. This chart shows very clearly this \nincredible deterioration in the trade relationship as it takes a \ndownward plunge in terms of our trade balance.\n  The trade balance has continued to deteriorate in 2000. The Commerce \nDepartment reports that the U.S. trade deficit with China for the first \n6 months of this year is over 23 percent higher than over the first 6 \nmonths of last year. In fact, it is very close to becoming the largest \nsingle bilateral trade deficit of the United States. At the moment, it \nis surpassed only by Japan.\n\n  This chart traces back to 1975. These are U.S. exports to China which \nhave risen a bit, but not very much, and these are U.S. imports from \nChina which, of course, are ascending at a very steep pace, and the \ndifference gives us, of course, the trade balance which was shown in \nthe previous chart. On this very small amount of trade, $95 billion--\nthere is $13 billion in exports from the United States to China and $82 \nbillion in imports from China--we now are on our way, I think, to where \nwe will shortly have our largest trade deficit with China.\n  It is important to appreciate this point because it underscores how \nimportant our trade relationship is with China and, in my judgment, \ntherefore, underscores the necessity of not putting this trade \nrelationship to one side, which would prevent us from trying to solve \nthe other problems in our relationship.\n  What is not fully appreciated, however, is that relative to the size \nof the overall volume of trade with China, the U.S. trade relationship \nwith China is far more one-sided than with any other country in the \nworld. For example, in 1999 we had a trade deficit with Japan of $74 \nbillion. That was based on a total volume of trade with Japan of $189 \nbillion. In contrast, the $69 billion U.S. trade deficit with China was \nbased on a\n\n[[Page S8311]]\n\ntotal volume of trade of $95 billion. With Japan, we have twice as much \ntrade and almost the same deficit, a little more than we have with \nChina. With China, the trade relationship is virtually a one-way \nstreet, and we need to understand and appreciate that.\n  This pattern is repeated to an even greater extreme with other large \nU.S. trading partners--Canada, the European Union, and Mexico. This \nchart shows U.S. exports as a percent of bilateral trade with China, \nwith Japan, with Canada, with the E.U., and with Mexico. As one can \nsee, even with Japan, exports make 30 percent of the total volume of \ntrade--a little above 30 percent. With Canada and Europe and Mexico, it \nis in the mid-40 percent. With China, it is at 14 percent. The trade \nrelationship with China is virtually a one-way street. It is Chinese \nexports coming to this country; it is not American exports going to \nChina.\n  Even if one compares it with the Asian countries, we find the same \nsituation. U.S. exports to China as a percent of bilateral trade is, \nagain, at about 14 percent. As you can see with Taiwan, Korea, and \nSingapore, it ranges anywhere from under 40 percent to almost 50 \npercent.\n\n  One may say: Well, maybe China has this kind of trade relationship \nwith everybody. So let's briefly examine its trade relationship with \nJapan and the European Union as compared with the United States.\n  China's total trade volume in 1999 with the United States, $95 \nbillion; with the European Union, $73 billion; with Japan, $69 billion. \nYet the surpluses that China ran with us were by far the largest \nrelative to the overall amount of trade with these countries. So you \ncan see that once again the trade relationship with the United States \nis extremely one sided.\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair.)\n  Some argue that most exports from China to the United States are not \nmade in the United States and, therefore, do not compete with U.S. \nproducts. Some advance that argument. As a result, it is argued that \nsome increase in Chinese exports to the United States comes at the \nexpense of exporters in third countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, \nand Taiwan, and not at the expense of U.S. manufacturers.\n  It is worth noting that although these other countries run trade \nsurpluses with the U.S., the U.S. balance of trade with these countries \nis not nearly as one sided as with China. In fact, I think it is \nreasonable to suppose that if we were taking goods from these other \ncountries instead of China, those countries would be more willing to \ntake our goods because that is the nature of the relationship that we \nhave with Mexico, or South Korea, or Taiwan. It is much closer towards \nbalance, although not in full balance. But with China, it is a terribly \none-sided relationship.\n  Furthermore, the Congressional Research Service, in its analysis, has \nsaid the nature of Chinese exports into the United States is shifting \nand moving towards high-technology sectors--office and data processing \nmachines, electrical machinery and appliances, and telecommunications \nand sound equipment. So the character of imports from China is shifting \nto increasingly sophisticated categories of products which compete very \ndirectly with goods made in the United States.\n  Proponents of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China assert that \nthe WTO agreement with China will open China's market to U.S. exports \nand, thereby, reduce the one-sided nature of the U.S. trade \nrelationship. Well now, this is a plausible-sounding argument. They say \nthis will create an opening in the relationship and, therefore, these \nbalances that you are pointing to will begin to change and there will \nbe an improvement.\n  The U.S. International Trade Commission was asked to conduct a study \non the economic effects on the United States with China's accession to \nthe WTO; in other words, to project out what the consequences would be.\n  The ITC study assessed the impact the tariff cuts provided in the \nChina WTO agreement would have on the U.S. balance of trade with China. \nThey concluded that there would be an increase in the U.S. trade \ndeficit with China. Let me repeat that. The ITC study, which was \nconducted at the request of the U.S. Trade Representative, found that \nthe China WTO agreement would actually increase the U.S. bilateral \ntrade deficit with China.\n  So it is obviously important to understand that while these \nextraordinary claims have been made for the supposed benefits of the \nChina WTO agreement for the United States, the reality is that it would \nnot address the extraordinarily unbalanced trade relationship of the \nU.S. with China.\n  A closer examination of the specifics of the China WTO accession \nagreement with the United States may help explain these results of the \nITC study. Under the China WTO agreement, average tariff rates will \nfall from 16.9 percent to 10.2 percent--a drop of 6.7 percentage \npoints. However, average applied tariff rates already fell from 42.8 \npercent in 1992 to the 16.9 percent in 1998 under the previous trade \nagreements that we have negotiated.\n\n  During that period when these tariffs came down, the U.S. trade \ndeficit with China increased from $20 billion to $61 billion. Of \ncourse, that simply underscores a very common sense point, if you stop \nand think about it. One must recognize that, while tariffs may be cut, \nthe remaining tariffs may still be sufficiently high to block out \nimports. In other words, we are constantly being told these tariffs are \ncoming down. Even assuming that is the case, as long as they remain at \na sufficient level to block out imports, they, in effect, are \naccomplishing their results.\n  For example, under this agreement, tariffs on automobiles are \nscheduled to fall from 100 percent to 25 percent. This is obviously a \nsubstantial reduction, but it still leaves in place a 25-percent \ntariff--a very significant tariff that may be highly effective as a \ndeterrent to auto imports.\n  Under the agreement, nontariff barriers, such as quotas, licensing, \nand tendering procedures, will be liberalized for some 360 product \ncategories; however, the product categories for which this is taking \nplace account for only 8.5 percent of our exports to China. Their total \nvalue in 1998 was only $1.2 billion.\n  Furthermore, China is still in the process of negotiating its \nmultilateral accession protocol with the 44-member WTO working party. \nAccording to a GAO report on the status of the negotiations, \ndifferences remain between China and the working party in three areas: \nChina's trade-distorting industrial policies, including subsidies and \nprice controls; foreign currency reserve-related restraints on trade, \nincluding foreign exchange controls; and a miscellaneous category of \nother issues, including Government procurement, civil aircraft, and \ntaxes.\n  In fact, currency manipulation, subsidies, and licensing by China \nhave been significant factors in its trade relationship with the United \nStates and have, of course, an impact on this trade deficit.\n  There is a final point I want to make with regard to the U.S. trade \nrelationship with China before I turn to the broader considerations and \nthe impact of PNTR.\n  Observers have pointed out that China is much more open to foreign \ninvestment than other Asian countries were--Japan and Korea, for \nexample--and that this may set the basis for an improvement in the \ntrade relationship. In fact, China has actively sought foreign direct \ninvestment as sources of Western capital and technology. It is a key \nitem in their development strategy.\n  But China's receptiveness to foreign investment does not necessarily \nmean an openness to imports.\n  In fact, trade barriers in sectors such as automobiles have been part \nof China's strategy to encourage foreign investment. Since the Chinese \nmarket could not be accessed easily through exports because of the \nvarious restrictions, Western automakers who want a portion of the \nChinese market were being forced to invest in China. Once inside the \nmarket, many Western companies took a different view of Chinese trade \nbarriers because they now also are protected from competition from \noutside China.\n  The unstated premise of those supporting PNTR on this issue is that \nopenness to foreign investment will eventually lead to openness to \nforeign trade. However, it is not at all clear that changes undertaken \nto encourage foreign investment will inevitably lead to lower trade \nbarriers and more imports. In fact, the Chinese insistence\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\nupon domestic production and transfer of technology suggests that the \nopposite may be the case.\n  An article in the Wall Street Journal of May 25, the day after the \nHouse voted on PNTR, focused on the investment aspects of the China WTO \nagreement and stated:\n\n       Even before the first vote was cast yesterday in Congress's \n     decision to permanently normalize U.S. trade with China, \n     Corporate America was making plans to revolutionize the way \n     it does business on the mainland. And while the debate in \n     Washington focused mainly on the probable lift for U.S. \n     exports to China, many U.S. multinationals have something \n     different in mind. ``This deal is about investment, not \n     exports,'' says Joseph Quinlan, an economist with Morgan \n     Stanley Dean Witter & Co. U.S. foreign investment is about to \n     overtake U.S. exports as the primary means by which U.S. \n     companies deliver goods to China.''\n\n  If we look at the increase in investment over the recent decade, it \nis highly instructive. It has risen at an incredibly steep rate. U.S. \ninvestment in China has gone from just over $300 million in 1991 to \n$4.5 billion in 1999. Whereas the United States ranked behind Japan, \nbehind Europe, behind Taiwan as a source of exports to China, it ranked \nahead of all of them as a source of foreign direct investment. Rather \nthan expanding exports and reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, \nthe extension of Permanent Normal Trade Relations and WTO membership \nfor China may simply be a way for China to secure expanded foreign \ndirect investment from the United States. This may serve China's \ndevelopment strategy and please U.S. companies seeking to invest in \nChina. However, it is not clear that it will be the great benefit to \nU.S. exports and jobs that those who support PNTR claim.\n  Indeed, in my view, a principal motivation for China's support for \nPNTR and WTO membership is to separate its trade and investment \nrelationship with the United States from its other relationships with \nthe United States and to separate it from the enforcement of U.S. trade \nlaws, thereby securing an unimpeded flow of investment from the United \nStates. Once they can lock this into place, they can put trade and \ninvestment off the radar screen, as we look at other outstanding issues \nbetween our two countries.\n  A major argument made by proponents of PNTR for China is that if the \nUnited States does not grant it, the United States will not be able to \nutilize the WTO dispute resolution mechanism to enforce compliance by \nChina with trade agreements.\n  What they fail to mention is that if the United States grants PNTR to \nChina, we will no longer be able to utilize directly U.S. trade laws, \nsuch as 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and other provisions in our law \nto enforce compliance by China with trade agreements. The question is, \nthen, what may better serve U.S. national interests, enforcement \nthrough the WTO dispute resolution mechanism or enforcement through \nU.S. trade laws? In my view, on balance, at this time the United States \nwill be better off relying on U.S. trade laws.\n  Let me give a few reasons. It is often noted that China has a weak \nrule of law, even assuming the central government wants to comply with \nthe trade agreement, which in itself may be a very large assumption. \nThis means there is no reliable domestic mechanism to keep various \nministries, state-owned businesses, and provincial governments from \nignoring the legal requirements of trade agreements.\n\n  The WTO is a rules-based institution, and it is poorly equipped to \nenforce its rules in China. Given the lack of a clear paper trail, in \nmany cases it could be impossible even to establish the existence of \nthe trade barriers at issue, much less win a dispute settlement panel \nruling.\n  The reality is that enforcement of compliance by China with trade \nagreements would be a problem whether or not PNTR applies. Although the \nU.S. experience with bilateral trade agreements with China has been \nfrustrating, at least the utilization of U.S. trade laws to enforce \nthem remains under the control of the United States. Aggressive and \npersistent use of bilateral trade pressure has resulted at least in \nsome compliance by the Chinese with these agreements. It is not at all \nclear that the highly legalistic WTO dispute resolution mechanism, \nunder which adjudication of trade disputes would be given over to an \ninternational body, will produce better results. The difficulties in \nU.S. experience when it attempted to bring a WTO case against Japan \nover photographic film suggests the limitations of the WTO in \naddressing problems when the nature of the underlying government \npractice is uncertain. It is not difficult to imagine similar disputes \nwith China in which the existence of the questionable policy is in \ndispute.\n  In the remaining portion of my remarks, I will return to the point I \nraised at the beginning; that is, that in my view it is critical for \nthe United States to pursue a policy toward China which integrates its \ntrade and economic policy concerns with the range of other concerns, \nincluding national security, foreign policy, human rights, religious \nfreedom, labor rights, and environmental protection.\n  In other words, our objective should be to try to get permanent \nnormal relations across the board in an integrated fashion and not to \nhand off, right in the beginning, the trade relation dimension which is \nobviously of such importance to the PRC given the one-sided character \nof our trade relationship.\n  This is an enormously important economic benefit to China and, \nsurely, in the course of considering the trade relationship, we should \nbe seeking to use it as leverage to obtain an improvement in the \nrelationships in the other areas that I want to discuss.\n  Of all of its relationships with the United States, China derives by \nfar the most benefit from its trade relationship, which is heavily \nskewed in its favor. Approval by the Congress of PNTR would make it \ndifficult, if not impossible, to use the leverage of this heavily \nskewed trade relationship to influence our relationships in other \ncritical areas. It is my view, as I have asserted, that we need to use \nit to improve the trade relationship itself. But over and above that, \nwe need to look at influencing other critical areas.\n  This, of course, is a critical strategic objective of China, which is \nwhy it is so eager for approval of PNTR. The China WTO agreement makes \nno provision for addressing labor rights, human rights, and \nenvironmental protection. We know--I think with reasonable assurance--\nthat if China joins the WTO, it will be a vigorous opponent of U.S. \nefforts to have labor rights, human rights, and environmental \nprotection become a part of the WTO agreements.\n  People say: Let's move ahead on WTO, and then we will include these \nthings in the WTO agreements. I can, with almost complete assurance, \nsay to you that if this moves forward, China will be one of those \nwithin the WTO opposing such inclusion.\n  Let me review some of these other important policy concerns for China \nto underscore the importance of pursuing an integrated policy approach.\n  First of all, human rights, labor rights and religious freedom. The \nState Department's 1999 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \nsummarizes in a single page the depth of the problems posed by China, \nand I would like to read that into the Record. This is our own State \nDepartment's human rights report about China. It is the last published \nreport:\n\n       The government's poor human rights record deteriorated \n     markedly throughout the year, as the government intensified \n     efforts to suppress dissent, particularly organized dissent. \n     A crackdown against a fledgling opposition party, which began \n     in the fall of 1998, broadened and intensified during the \n     year. By year's end, almost all of the key leaders of the \n     China Democracy Party (CDP) were serving long prison terms or \n     were in custody without formal charges, and only a handful of \n     dissidents nationwide dared to remain active publically.\n       Tens of thousands of members of the Falun Gong spiritual \n     movement were detained after the movement was banned in July; \n     several leaders of the movement were sentenced to long prison \n     terms in late December and hundreds of others were sentenced \n     administratively to reeducation through labor in the fall. \n     Late in the year, according to some reports, the government \n     started confining some Falun Gong adherents to psychiatric \n     hospitals.\n       The government continued to commit widespread and well-\n     documented human rights abuses, in violation of \n     internationally accepted norms. These abuses stemmed from the \n     authorities' extremely limited tolerance of public dissent \n     aimed at the government, fear of unrest, and the limited \n     scope of inadequate implementation of laws protecting basic \n     freedoms. The Constitution and laws provide for fundamental \n     human rights; however, these protections often are ignored in\n\n[[Page S8313]]\n\n     practice. Abuses included instances of extrajudicial \n     killings, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced \n     confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy \n     incommunicado detention, and denial of due process. Prison \n     conditions at most facilities remained harsh. In many cases, \n     particularly in sensitive political cases, the judicial \n     system denies criminal defendants basic legal safeguards and \n     due process because authorities attach higher priority to \n     maintaining public order and suppressing political opposition \n     than to enforcing legal norms.\n       The government infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The \n     government tightened restriction on freedom of speech and of \n     the press, and increased controls on the Internet; self-\n     censorship by journalists also increased. The government \n     severely restricted freedom of assembly, and continued to \n     restrict freedom of association. The government continued to \n     restrict freedom of religion, and intensified controls of \n     some unregistered churches. The government continued to \n     restrict freedom of movement. The government does not permit \n     independent domestic non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to \n     monitor publicly human rights conditions.\n       Violence against women, including coercive family planning \n     practices--which sometimes include forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization; prostitution; discrimination against women; \n     trafficking in women and children; abuse of children; and \n     discrimination against the disabled and minorities are all \n     problems. The government continued to restrict tightly worker \n     rights, and forced labor in prison facilities remains a \n     serious problem. Child labor persists. Particularly serious \n     human rights abuses persisted in some minority areas, \n     especially in Tibet and Xinjiang, where restrictions on \n     religion and other fundamental freedoms intensified.\n\n  That is the U.S. State Department talking in its 1999 human rights \nreport. Listen to what the United States Commission on International \nReligious Freedom, a commission established by this Congress just a \ncouple of years ago, said with respect to the People's Republic of \nChina. It said the following:\n\n       The government of China and the Communist Party of China \n     (CPC) discriminate, harass, incarcerate, and torture people \n     on the basis of their religion and beliefs. Chinese law \n     criminalizes collective religious activity by members of \n     religious groups that are not registered with the state. It \n     registers only those groups that submit to membership in one \n     of the government-controlled associations affiliated with the \n     five officially recognized religions. Members of registered \n     religious groups can only engage in a limited range of what \n     the state deems ``normal'' religious activities.\n       The religious and belief communities that resist \n     registration or that have been denied permission to register, \n     including Catholics loyal to the Pope and Protestants who \n     worship in ``house churches,'' have no legal standing in \n     China. Adherents are often harassed, detained and fined. \n     Meetings are broken up, unauthorized buildings are destroyed, \n     and leaders are arrested and frequently imprisoned.\n       Over the past several years, Chinese officials have been \n     employing increasingly strict laws and regulations as \n     instruments to harass religious groups and maintain control \n     over religious activities. Officials responsible for \n     enforcing the strict laws continue to be guided by CPC policy \n     directives on religion. Furthermore, the Chinese legal system \n     does not protect human rights from state interference, nor \n     does it provide effective remedies for those who claim that \n     their rights have been violated.\n\n  The Commission then went on to say this. Listen carefully to this \nrecommendation. This is the recommendation the Commission which the \nCongress established on international religious freedom made with \nrespect to extending PNTR to China, which is the issue before this \nbody:\n\n       Given the sharp deterioration in freedom of religion in \n     China during the last year, the Commission believes that an \n     unconditional grant of PNTR at this moment may be taken as a \n     signal of American indifference to religious freedom. The \n     government of China attaches great symbolic importance to \n     steps such as the grant of PNTR, and presents them to the \n     Chinese people as proof of international acceptance and \n     approval. A grant of PNTR at this juncture could be seen by \n     Chinese people struggling for religious freedom as an \n     abandonment of their cause at a moment of great difficulty. \n     The Commission therefore believes that Congress should not \n     approve PNTR for China until China makes substantial \n     improvements in respect for religious freedom.\n\n  Turning briefly to the environment, I simply want to observe that a \ncoalition of environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and \nFriends of the Earth, have argued strongly that the U.S.-China WTO \nagreement ignores critical environmental concerns regarding China and \nthat PNTR should not be granted to China. They outline the incredibly \nsevere pollution situation which now exists in China. Five of the \nworld's 10 most polluted cities are in China. An estimated 2 million \npeople die each year in China from air and water pollution.\n  Let me turn for a moment to the national security and foreign policy \nfield. The United States has, of course, fundamental national security \nand foreign policy concerns with regard to China which remain \nunresolved.\n  It is, of course, well known that China has undertaken a very \nsubstantial buildup of its military over the past decade designed to \nundergird China's ability to confront Taiwan. In fact, we have seen \ninstances of such confrontation. This includes, among other things, a \nmissile buildup across the Taiwan Strait that has greatly increased \ntensions between China and Taiwan. This military buildup also raises \nsignificant foreign policy and national security concerns for the \nUnited States in regard to Japan, South Korea, India, and indeed the \nrest of Asia.\n  China has been the subject of longstanding concern about transfers of \ntechnology that contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction or of missiles that could deliver them. Of course, this is \nthe subject area that is the direct focus of the amendment pending \nbefore this body.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence, the DCI, submitted a report to \nCongress in June of 1997 stating that during July-December 1996 ``China \nwas the most significant supplier of weapons of mass destruction \ntechnology to foreign countries.'' The DCI's latest report, which was \ndelivered in August 2000, named China, Russia, and North Korea as key \nsuppliers of such technology.\n  In July of 1998, the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile \nThreat to the United States concluded:\n\n       China poses a threat as a significant proliferator of \n     ballistic missiles, weapons of mass destruction, and enabling \n     technology. It has carried out extensive transfers to Iran's \n     solid fuel ballistic missile program and has supplied \n     Pakistan with a design for nuclear weapons and additional \n     nuclear weapons assistance. It has even transferred complete \n     ballistic missile systems to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. \n     China's behavior thus far makes it appear unlikely it will \n     soon effectively reduce its country's sizable transfers of \n     critical technologies, experts, or expertise, to the emerging \n     missile powers.\n\n  As recently as this July, U.S. intelligence agencies disclosed that \nChina has continued to aid Pakistan's efforts to build long-range \nmissiles that could carry nuclear weapons.\n  In addition, China has been a strong opponent of a number of major \nU.S. foreign policy and military undertakings. In June, Li Peng, \nchairman of the Chinese National People's Congress, visited Yugoslavia \nto express China's support for President Slobodan Milosevic and to \ncondemn NATO and U.S. intervention in Kosovo.\n  In conclusion, I oppose this proposed extension of PNTR to China.\n  From the narrow perspective of trade policy, the United States would \nhave to give up its ability to utilize U.S. trade laws to enforce \ncompliance by China with its trade commitments. Aggressive and \npersistent use of U.S. trade laws to enforce compliance are more likely \nto produce results with China than the legalistic dispute resolution \nmechanism of the WTO.\n  More broadly and more fundamentally, extending PNTR would separate \nU.S. trade policy interests with China from the range of our other \ncritical interests, including national security, foreign policy, human \nrights, religious freedom, labor rights, and environmental protection.\n  The United States would be severing its relationship of greatest \nleverage with China, the trade relationship which is so heavily skewed \nin China's favor, far exceeding China's relationship with any of its \nother major trading partners. But we, in effect, would be taking that \nrelationship and severing it from all of these other important issues.\n  This may be in China's interest. But I do not perceive it to be in \nthe interest of the United States. And, in fact, it is my view that it \nwill become more difficult to achieve permanent normal relations with \nChina--that is, across the breadth of these important issues at stake \nbetween us--more difficult if, in fact, we have put to one side and \nsevered any connection with the trade relationship.\n  My view is that we should be seeking to achieve a permanent normal \nrelationship with China in all of these areas, including the trade \nrelationship.\n\n[[Page S8314]]\n\nBut given the significance of the trade relationship, to sever that, as \nthe measure before us would do, it seems to me will undercut or make \nmore difficult our ability to achieve normal relationships in these \nother critical areas which I have enumerated.\n  I can understand China's strategic interest here. I think those who \nhave come out on the floor and said this agreement is all in our favor, \nthere is nothing in it for China, as I said at the outset, to think \nthat the Chinese would agree to such an arrangement is to think they \nare either naive or being very charitable. I certainly don't think they \nare naive, and I certainly don't think they are going to be very \ncharitable. I think that is a very important strategic objective they \nare out to accomplish. I think it is a very significant matter for \nthem. As I say, it is clear to me that it serves China's interests, but \nI do not see it at this time as serving the interests of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe conclusion of my remarks Senator Enzi be recognized, and following \nthe conclusion of Senator Enzi's remarks, Senator Kyl be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I note that \nwould be three Republicans in a row. I don't see Senator Kyl on the \nfloor. I am wondering if that could be modified so I could speak \nfollowing Senator Enzi.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Enzi \nis speaking in favor of PNTR. I just agreed to have Senator Sarbanes \nprecede my speaking on PNTR despite the fact that it was a far more \nlengthy statement, although a very well-reasoned one, and Senator Kyl \nhas been waiting for several hours to speak.\n  I renew my unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Further reserving the right to object, this is one of the \nstrange situations where nobody is in charge and it is very \ndisorganized. I came to the floor and I have been prepared to speak on \nthis issue since the Senate came in session today. I was told there was \nno set order for speakers, and I talked to the staff on the committee \nthat has jurisdiction over this bill. I am here and I don't see Senator \nKyl.\n  I again ask my good friend from Maine if she would revise her \nunanimous consent request so I could speak after Senator Enzi.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Montana how \nmuch time he desires.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. About 15 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to try to move things forward, I modify \nmy unanimous-consent request. Following the conclusion of my remarks, \nthe Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, would be recognized; and the \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, would be recognized; to be followed \nby Mr. Kyl, the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator from Maine for her generosity.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \njoin the Presiding Officer and several of my colleagues in discussing \nan issue of critical importance to our national security. That issue is \nthe continued proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and whether \nwe are willing to take action, at this time, to stem this dangerous \ntrend. I rise today in enthusiastic support of the amendment offered by \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, who \nhas worked so hard to present a reasoned and reasonable response to \nthis threat to world peace. Senator Thompson's amendment imposes \nsanctions on key suppliers of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Let me start by stating that while this is not a new problem, it does \nrepresent a growing threat. The United States has long been concerned \nabout transfers of technology by the People's Republic of China that \ncontribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the \npast few years, however, some of our worst fears have been realized. \nLet's just look at China's record: In June of 1997, the Director of \nCentral Intelligence submitted a report to Congress stating that from \nJuly through December of 1996, ``China was the most significant \nsupplier of weapons of mass destruction and technology to foreign \ncountries.''\n  In July of 1998, the Rumsfeld Commission reported: ``China poses a \nthreat to the United States as a significant proliferator of ballistic \nmissiles, weapons of mass destruction, and enabling technologies.''\n  In January 1998, the bipartisan Cox report stated bluntly: ``China \nstole and used classified design information on the neutron bomb, and \nconcluded that China stole design information on our most advanced \nnuclear weapons, including every nuclear warhead the United States \ncurrently has deployed.''\n  In July of 1999, yet another year goes by, but the same problem \npersists. The Deutch Commission concluded that ``weapons of mass \ndestruction pose a grave threat to U.S. citizens and our military \nforces, to our allies, and to our vital interests in many regions of \nthe world.''\n  Once again, in January of this year, the Director of Central \nIntelligence named China, Russia, and North Korea as ``key suppliers'' \nof such technology. And just last month, the CIA's latest report again \nlists China as the key supplier of weapons of mass destruction and \nmissile technologies to rogue states.\n  We need no further proof. The record is crystal clear. The time has \ncome to act. We should not continue to turn a blind eye to this grave \nthreat to our national security and to world peace. The fact is, we \nknow China is selling missile and chemical technology to Pakistan. We \nknow China has also assisted Syria, Iran, North Korea, and Libya by \ntransferring critical technology. In fact, the CIA's January 2000 \nreport states that China is perhaps the most significant supplier of \nweapons of mass destruction and missile technology in the world. Let me \nrepeat that: China is the worst proliferator of weapons of mass \ndestruction and related technologies in the world.\n  We all know there is no easy panacea to this problem, no single \nanswer. Senator Thompson's amendment provides reasonable and effective \nresponses to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, missile \ntechnologies, and advanced conventional weapons. This legislation is a \nstep in the right direction to ensure that the United States no longer \ntolerates China's role in continuing to be the world's No. 1 \nproliferator of weapons of mass destruction.\n  This legislation has been revised to address legitimate concerns \nraised by the business community, our farmers, and the Administration. \nThe amendment has been broadened to apply not only to China, but to \nother countries identified by the Director of Central Intelligence as \nother key suppliers of weapons--that list currently includes Russia and \nNorth Korea. This legislation ensures that appropriate action will \nfinally be taken against these proliferators, that we will no longer \nignore these serious transgressions, that we will no longer turn a \nblind eye to what is happening.\n\n  This amendment is well crafted. It provides for discretionary, not \nmandatory, sanctions against countries that supply proliferating \ntechnologies. Frankly, I think a case could be made for mandatory \nsanctions. But the author of this amendment has bent over backwards to \nmake sure it is a reasonable, well-crafted response.\n  Another change was in the evidentiary standard. It has been raised \nfor imposing mandatory sanctions for companies identified as \nproliferators to give the President more discretion.\n  My hope is we will pass this amendment by a strong vote tomorrow, \nthat we will send a strong signal to China and to other countries \nengaged in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, that we will \ntell them there will be consequences, there will be penalties in \nresponse to spreading weapons of mass destruction.\n  Now is the time for us to act. Let us enact these reasonable, well-\ncrafted changes to our foreign and national security policies.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his leadership on this very \nimportant issue, and I also thank him for taking the chair so I could \ndeliver my statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8315]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate since \nit began 3 hours ago. I am afraid colleagues and their staff and people \nwatching this debate might be under the impression we are debating \nwhether to limit Chinese imports. That isn't going to happen. That \nisn't part of this bill at all. This isn't about limiting what China is \nsending here, although maybe it would be a good idea. This is talking \nabout the limitations placed on our trade in their country.\n  It has also been mentioned a number of times that the Chinese do not \nkeep agreements. It is a great chart. We have a copy of it on every \ndesk. It has been mentioned that they are stealing our secrets. I do \nnot think that is a secret to anybody but the Justice Department. This \nbill is not about stopping them from stealing our secrets. This bill is \nabout sending our goods to China. I will go into that in a little bit \nmore depth.\n  I do rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Tennessee. It is not the goal of the amendment--reducing \nproliferation--that I oppose; I do not want proliferation. I want the \nChinese under control. We all want to see the elimination of the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. But I think the amendment takes a flawed approach toward solving \nthe problems. Contrary to what the sponsors of this amendment indicate, \nthis is a trade and economic sanctions bill. The amendment remains a \ncounterproductive unilateral sanctions amendment that would impose \ntrade and economic sanctions.\n  I appreciate the author changing it so that it is not mandatory. \nUnder the only version I had seen before this amendment was submitted, \nit was to be a mandatory 5-year penalty, regardless of what was done \nand regardless of the size of the offense. So some flexibility is \nappreciated. The countless revisions made to the legislation further \nunderscore why it would greatly benefit from committee input and \nconsideration. This is sweeping legislation, and it has had no \ncommittee hearings and no committee consideration--at least I am not \naware of a single vote or a single amendment proposed to this bill in a \ncommittee meeting. It is a little different from when we do major \nlegislation.\n  Sponsors of the amendment are clearly frustrated at a perceived lack \nof enforcing sanctions contained in the nonproliferation laws that are \nnow on the books. It is reasonable to conclude that the President \nshould have imposed some very targeted sanctions as a result of certain \nmissile-related transfers to Pakistan. However, I do not advocate, nor \ndoes this justify, making sweeping changes to our nonproliferation \npolicy, which is what this bill will do. It singles out countries. It \nused to single out just one. It has been expanded a little bit. It \nstill singles out specific countries--and they do need more scrutiny. \nWe said these people steal, perhaps do not abide by agreements.\n  I am reminded of a quote by my grandpa. When he was talking about \npeople he didn't trust, he said:\n\n       I don't trust them as far as I can spit. And my chin is \n     always wet.\n\n  You don't have to trust them to work with them, but you have to watch \nthem.\n  I remind my colleagues, this bill will not have an effect on this \nPresident, but it will certainly have a tremendous impact on the \nPresident's ability to conduct foreign policy. It is not in our \nsecurity interests to tie the hands of the President.\n  I have had a little experience with an industry in my State on this \nsanctions stuff. We have been working for years to be able to send soda \nash to India. Soda ash--we call it trona in Wyoming--is used in making \nsoda, but you also use it in glass manufacture and hundreds of other \nproducts. It is something needed in every single country. Southern \nWyoming happens to have the largest single natural deposit of it in the \nworld. We export that to most places around the world. Some places make \nit synthetically, and they put high tariffs on it or completely ban it \nfrom their country to give their country a better trade situation.\n\n  We had already gotten trona into India. We had everything moving, in \nplace, to get it into India. And they had to touch off one of those \nnuclear bombs. They had to prove they had nuclear proliferation. Do you \nknow what we did? We imposed immediate sanctions on them. Now we need \nto tell the countries what the problem is and what we are going to do, \nand I agree with that. But here is the effect it had on India.\n  They said: Oh, Wyoming, you know that product we did not want anyway? \nYou are not going to let us have it, and we are glad. Now we are back \nto square one, trying to get trona into their country. It did not \naffect their economy, it did not stop their proliferation, it has not \nhad any effect on them, but it has had a huge effect on us.\n  Trade is out of balance with China, but it is not proliferation that \nis doing it; it is people in the United States buying products from \nChina. This bill and the proliferation amendment do not stop that. \nThere are reductions in tariffs they will have to follow if they become \na part of the World Trade Organization. They have already signed some \nagreements that say they will do that. That is our hope so we will be \nable to get a more competitive situation. Of course, we are also hoping \nto open up some new markets over there, and there are some other things \nthat Wyoming and the United States will benefit from selling over \nthere. We have to be careful not to spite ourselves while we teach \nChina a lesson they will not hear.\n  Many in this body think the President currently has more than \nadequate authority to respond to proliferation undertaken by China or \nany other country. Some of the statutory examples are the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Act, the Export-Import Bank Act, the Arms Export \nControl Act, the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, the \nNuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, and the Export \nAdministration Act, which at the present time is implemented by \nExecutive order under the authority of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, IEEPA.\n  If there is something that needs to be strengthened, that last item \nis the one where it needs to be done. A lot of the things we talk about \nto be able to control what China is able to use are embodied in that \nact. Right now, we encourage people to violate that law. We do not have \nsufficient penalties in that law. As I mentioned, it is operating under \nExecutive order, and that takes away a lot of the capability of the \nUnited States to control what China has from us. It is important that \nthat be done. But there are people in this body who evidently think we \nhave enough of that because the ability to bring up the Export \nAdministration Act has been thwarted.\n  This amendment we are debating, the nonproliferation amendment--great \ntitle--also authorizes a new and, in my view, a very harmful tool for \nconducting foreign policy; that is, restricting the access of capital \nmarkets in the United States. Just sending the signal to the rest of \nthe world that we are willing use our capital markets for the conduct \nof foreign policy would have a chilling effect on the competitiveness \nof our markets.\n  Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testified \nbefore the Senate Banking Committee on July 20. There he issued a \npronouncement of his concern about any proposal which could restrict or \ndeny access to our capital markets. Besides the harm this would \ncertainly cause to our own markets, Chairman Greenspan questioned \nwhether this provision would be an effective tool. After all, the \nUnited States is not the only source of capital in the world.\n  I will read just a portion of Chairman Greenspan's response to a \nquestion about using our capital markets as a foreign policy tool, \nspecifically as provided for in this amendment. He said:\n\n       But most importantly, to the extent that we block \n     foreigners from investing or raising funds in the United \n     States, we probably undercut the viability of our own system.\n       But far more important is I'm not even sure how such a law \n     could be effectively implemented because there is a huge \n     amount of transfer of funds around the world. For example, if \n     we were to block China or anybody else from borrowing in the \n     United States, they could very readily borrow in London and \n     be financed by American investors. Or, if not in London, if \n     London were financed by American investors, London could be \n     financed by Paris investors, and we finance the Paris \n     investors.\n\n\n[[Page S8316]]\n\n\n  So you can move it down the road as many steps as are needed in order \nto make the same transfer of dollars.\n\n       In other words, there are all sorts of mechanisms that are \n     involved here. So the presumption that somehow we block the \n     capability of China or anybody else borrowing in essentially \n     identical terms abroad as here in my judgment is a mistake.\n\n  Claims have been made by sponsors of the China Nonproliferation Act \nsuggesting that all of the major concerns about the bill have been \naddressed. Let's take a little closer look at these claims.\n  The first claim is the bill has been broadened to include countries \nin addition to China, so as not to single out China.\n  However, while the bill expands the list of potential sanctioned \ncountries, the bill title and focus remains the same: the China \nNonproliferation Act. This clearly infers that the singular political \ntarget of the bill is China. Regardless, expanding the bill to include \nmore potentially sanctioned countries does not correct the flawed \nunilateral approach of the legislation. Since the bill would use the \npast five Director of Central Intelligence proliferation report country \nlists, those countries which could be subject to unilateral sanctions \ninclude--these are ones that could be included under these sanctions \nbecause we are going back 5 years and using the Director of Central \nIntelligence proliferation reports. You will find Germany, the United \nKingdom, which includes Great Britain, Italy, France, and other more \nlikely suspects. These countries were listed in the 1997 DCI \nproliferation report. This means this amendment could sanction some of \nour allies for 5 consecutive years.\n  The second claim by the sponsor of the China Nonproliferation Act is \nthat the sanctions against supplier countries has been made \ndiscretionary, as opposed to the mandatory sanctions contained in the \noriginal bill. This is correct, but there is more than meets the eye. \nThe sponsors of the bill leave out a crucial fact. If the President \ndetermines proliferation has occurred, he is required to apply all five \nof the sanctions provided for in section 4 of the bill. This is the \nmandatory, all-or-nothing aspect of the bill.\n  The third claim is that the revised bill raises the evidentiary \nstandard from credible information to a Presidential determination, \ngiving the President complete discretion in making a sanction \ndetermination. Once again, the sponsors leave out crucial facts. Unlike \nother nonproliferation laws, the revised bill does not give the \nPresident any discretion over the types of sanctions that should be \nimposed on proliferating entities or the length of time those sanctions \nshould remain. It requires the sanctions to be in place for a minimum \nof 1 year regardless of the circumstances. It also does not give \ndiscretion to the President regarding the SEC disclosure required in \nthe bill if an entity is included in the President's proliferation \nreport. Remember, no conclusive proof is necessary for an entity to be \nincluded in the report.\n  It is also important to point out the dichotomy between the threshold \nlevel for the President's report--credible information--and that for \ntriggering the mandatory sanctions--Presidential determination. This \nputs the President in the impossible position of labeling a certain \nactivity, whether it occurred or not, as a concern sufficient to \njustify inclusion in the report to Congress but insufficient to justify \naction against the proliferator.\n  The bill's authors' next claim is that it would not affect Wyoming \nfarmers and ranchers, but they fail to recognize that regardless of who \nis sanctioned by the bill, it would still punish American agricultural \nproducers. That is because foreign countries sanctioned as a result of \nthe bill may retaliate by not buying U.S. farm and industrial products. \nMost of the agricultural groups recognize this and, as a result, remain \nopposed to this legislation.\n  The last claim of the sponsors is that the latest charges of the bill \nmake it ``consistent with current law and similar to the Iran \nNonproliferation Act of 2000.'' The reality is this bill does not track \nthe Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 at all, except for the credible \ninformation standard for the President's proliferation report to \nCongress. This amendment would only add another layer onto the 11 or \nmore statutes available for the President to presently use against \nproliferators.\n\n  I will mention just a few of the differences. I could have some of \nthem wrong because the bill we have may not be the same as the one we \nwere able to look at yesterday.\n  I have mentioned a few of the differences in the amendment. As I \nmentioned before, there are mandated five different types of sanctions \nif the President determines proliferation occurred. In contrast, the \nINA allows for optional sanctions. The amendment before us requires \nsanctions for at least 1 year, whereas the INA does not require a \nspecified period of time for sanctions to remain intact. If this is to \ntrack the Iran Nonproliferation Act, then I question the need for it, \ntoo.\n  This amendment provides for an expedited legislative procedure for \nCongress to use if it disagrees with the President's determination, \nwhereas the INA does not. These facts clearly demonstrate that the \nChina Nonproliferation Act contains significant and substantive \ndifferences from the recently passed Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000.\n  I would be remiss not to mention the significant impact this \namendment would have on the operation of our export control system. It \nwould add an additional layer to the current patchwork of dual-use \nexport control law. Instead, the focus should be on a complete reform \nand reauthorization of the Export Administration Act to address \nproliferation of the dual-use items.\n  Last year, the Banking Committee, as I mentioned, unanimously \nreported S. 1712, the Export Administration Act. This bill, the EAA, \nrecognizes that the current system is broken and needs a complete \nmodernization and overhaul to be fixed. The committee's EAA would \ncreate a country tiering system to take into account the risks of \ndiversion and misuse of sensitive items if exported to any given \ncountry.\n  Among the other nonproliferation enhancements, it would require the \ndenial of licensed exports to entities that do not cooperate with U.S. \npostshipment verifications, with the possibility of license denial to \nthe affiliate or parent company. It keeps us from shipping items that \nwould help them. It also allows controls to be imposed based upon the \nend use or end user on the export of any item that contributes to the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the means to deliver \nthem.\n  In conclusion, I remind my colleagues that the amendment we are \nconsidering is a unilateral sanctions bill. It could easily replace the \ncurrent China NTR votes with annual proliferation votes on China and on \nother countries, including our allies.\n  These are serious issues at stake, so it is not to the benefit of \nthis body or to the people of the United States to hastily consider \nthis legislation without the benefit of committee consideration. I \nshare the concerns about proliferation, but this counterproductive \namendment takes the wrong approach and would have harmful consequences \non the U.S. national security and economy. I encourage my colleagues to \ntake a careful look at it, to defeat the amendment, and to pass NTR.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Thompson-\nTorricelli Amendment.\n  I am very concerned, along with all of my colleagues, about missile \nproliferation and the development of weapons of mass destruction. \nHowever, this particular amendment does not enhance our ability to \nprevent dangerous proliferation. Just the reverse. The amendment will \nmake it even harder for the United States to contain proliferation. It \nwill seriously damage important American economic interests. And, if \nadded to H.R. 4444, it will kill PNTR.\n  Let me outline some of the principal problems I see in this proposal.\n  First, we already have a broad body of law covering proliferation of \nmissiles, weapons of mass destruction, and the inputs to those weapons. \nThose laws provide sufficient authority to the President to take \naction. Some may argue that there are cases where the President has not \nacted in a timely fashion or in the appropriate way. But he does have \nthe proper authority and needs no more.\n\n[[Page S8317]]\n\n  Second, the proposal effectively ties the hands of the next President \nand all future Presidents. The proposal reduces a President's \nflexibility in using the threat of sanctions as leverage to force a \nchange in behavior by a proliferating state. In recent months, we have \nseen, for the first time in 50 years, that reconciliation between South \nKorea and North Korea seems possible. We have been able to resume \ndiscussions with the North on missiles. What a tragedy it would be if \nwe were required to impose sanctions against North Korea just at the \nmoment when significant progress is possible in that potential \ntinderbox!\n  Third, the scope of this proposal is so broad that sanctions would \nhurt innocent people and innocent entities. It could restrict purely \ncommercial transactions. Stop scientific and academic exchanges that \nare important to our nation. And reduce military-to-military \ndiscussions that provide our own military forces with the information \nand insight necessary for them to do their job.\n  Fourth, these sanctions are unilateral. We have seen, repeatedly over \nthe last two decades, that unilateral sanctions don't work. \nMultilateral sanctions do work. Enactment of this legislation would \nantagonize some of our closest allies, with the result that they may \nnot cooperate with us in the future on multilateral non-proliferation \nregimes. It may feel good to take a unilateral sanction, but any \neffective program to stop proliferation must involve all of our allies.\n  Unilateral sanctions also hurt American farmers, workers, and \nbusinesses. While we are taking these unilateral measures and reducing \nthe ability of Americans to pursue commercial activities with China, \nour Japanese and European competitors will be very happy to take our \nplace in that growing market. Little harm to China. Great economic harm \nto America. A real boon for Japan and Europe. And once markets are \nlost, getting them back at some later time will be very, very hard.\n  The impact of this proposal on our agricultural sector could be very \nserious. It would prevent the use of various commodity credit programs \nfor sales to China. Our European, Canadian, and Australian competitors \nwould happily step in. Also, our farmers would be the likely first \ntarget of Chinese counter-retaliation. For these reasons, almost every \nmajor agricultural organization involved in trade opposes this \nlegislation.\n\n  Finally, possible sanctions in this amendment include being barred \nfrom access to U.S. capital markets. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Bank, testified on July 20 at the Senate Banking \nCommittee. He said:\n\n       Most importantly, to the extent we block foreigners from \n     investing or raising funds in the United States, we probably \n     undercut the viability of our own system. . .The only thing \n     that strikes me as a reasonable expectation is it can harm us \n     more than it would harm others.\n\n   This would be the first time America's capital markets have been \nused as a unilateral foreign policy sanction. This idea is plain nutty. \nWhy would we want to damage the capital markets that have contributed \nso much to our current prosperity?\n  As we vote on granting China permanent Normal Trade Relations status, \nthis amendment would effectively nullify much of the progress we have \nmade in our economic negotiations with China.\n  We need to integrate China into the international community. Chinese \nparticipation in the World Trade Organization and our granting them \nPNTR is a critically important first step. We also need to work closely \nwith our allies to bring China into the Missile Technology Control \nRegime and to ensure Chinese compliance with it and other weapons \ncontrol agreements. We need to work with our allies to address Chinese \nhuman rights abuses forcefully at the United Nations Commission on \nHuman rights and elsewhere. We need to work with the international \ncommunity to help ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n  I support strong action against proliferation of missiles or weapons \nof mass destruction by China or any other country. But the Thompson-\nTorricelli amendment moves us backwards in these efforts.\n  In addition to these very important substantive reasons to vote \nagainst this amendment, there is another reason--the very survival of \nthe underlying PNTR legislation. This amendment, like all amendments, \nis a killer. An amendment to H.R. 4444 means a conference will be \nrequired. At this stage of the Congressional session in this \nPresidential election year, there can be no conference. There will be \nno conference. A positive vote on this amendment is a vote to kill \nPNTR. Every Senator must understand this and decide whether you want to \nkill PNTR, with all the negative ramifications for our economy and our \nability to influence China in the future.\n  If this, or any, amendment passes, it will be a sign that the Senate \nhas voted to kill PNTR. I will not be complicit in that effort. \nTherefore, if there is a successful amendment, I will vote against \ninvoking cloture, and I will encourage all my colleagues to join me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak briefly in response to one point my colleague made \nbefore Senator Kyl begins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Reserving the right to object, it was my understanding \nthere was agreement that Senator Kyl would be the next speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator is seeking \nto modify that.\n  Mr. THOMAS. How much time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will take about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, we have had a good discussion of the \nissues today, but recently the Senator from Montana has taken to the \nroad of describing one of the ideas in the amendment as ``nutty.'' It \ndoesn't really bother me if the Senator from Montana calls an idea of \nmine nutty. I assume that Senator Torricelli from New Jersey doesn't \nmind, either. But he is wondering where this nutty idea comes from. I \nwill address that.\n  The Deutch Commission stated that:\n\n       The commission is concerned that known proliferators may be \n     raising funds in the U.S. capital markets.\n\n  They concluded:\n\n       It is clear that the United States is not making optimal \n     use of its economic leverage in combating proliferators. \n     Access to capital markets is among a wide range of economic \n     levers that could be used as carrots or sticks as part of an \n     overall strategy to combat proliferation. Given the \n     increasing tendency to turn to economic sanctions rather than \n     military action in response to proliferation activities, it \n     is essential that we begin to treat this economic warfare \n     with the same level of sophistication and planning we devote \n     to military options.\n\n  That is the source of that idea. The Deutch Commission, of course, is \ncomprised of several distinguished U.S. citizens who gave up \nsubstantial portions of their time to serve on this Commission: Mr. \nJohn Deutch; Senator Arlen Specter; Anthony Beilenson of California, \nserved 20 years in the House; Stephen A. Cambone, director of research \nat the Institute of National Strategic Studies of the National Defense \nUniversity; M.D.B. Carlisle, who was chief of staff to Senator Cochran; \nHenry Cooper, who is chairman of Applied Research Associates, Inc., a \nprivate consultant; Mr. James Exon, Nebraska, former Senator of the \nUnited States; Robert Gallucci, currently dean of the School of Foreign \nService at Georgetown; David McCurdy of Oklahoma, former Member of the \nHouse of Representatives; Janne Nolan, professor of national security \nstudies at Georgetown and director of the Ethics and National Security \nProject at the Century Foundation; Daniel Poneman, attorney at law, \nHogan & Hartson; William Schneider, who is a former member of the \nrecent Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United \nStates and was Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, \nScience and Technology from 1982 to 1986; Henry Sokolski, executive \ndirector of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, a Washington-\nbased nonprofit organization.\n  These are the people who came up with this nutty idea. I am proud to \nassociate myself with them.\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I will be supporting the Thompson amendment and will \nexplain why in a moment. But before the Senator from Montana leaves the \nfloor, let me say that I am astonished that the Senator from Montana \nand others in his position have so little confidence in the underlying \nprovision here that their view is that any amendment--the words of the \nSenator from Montana, ``any amendment''--would have to be opposed \nbecause it would jeopardize the passage of PNTR for China. I find that \nto be astounding.\n  This passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote, by \nover 40 votes. It is supported very strongly by the Clinton-Gore \nadministration. It is supported by the leadership, the minority and \nmajority in both Houses. I am certain it will pass the Senate when it \ncomes to a vote.\n  Given that, it seems to me quite strange, indeed, that any amendment \nthat the Senate puts on this legislation will doom it to failure. Even \namendments that arise from circumstances which occur after the House \nacted, I ask? For example, the representatives of the People's Republic \nof China, in their twice weekly briefings, have recently begun to \ninsist on a condition to China's support for Taiwan's entry into the \nWTO. Taiwan, they say, must be admitted as a province of China rather \nthan a separate customs territory, which is the way it has been \nnegotiated among all of the countries involved. The wording is to the \neffect ``separate customs territory, China, Taipai'' I believe is the \nway it reads. Then there is the separate customs territory, Matsu, and \nI think two others.\n  Why is this important? It is a fact that has arisen after the House \nof Representatives acted. I am certain that everybody who voted for \nPNTR for China in the House of Representatives and everyone who \nsupports it in the Senate, and I know the Clinton-Gore administration, \nall support the entry of Taiwan into the WTO as a separate customs \nterritory. We do not support--President Clinton has sent me a letter \nconfirming that he does not support--China's effort to redefine the \ncircumstances under which Taiwan will enter into the WTO as the \ndefinition that China wants to make the political point that it \nbelieves Taiwan is strictly a province of China.\n  So this is a new fact. Now, are we to ignore this? Here China is \nasking us to grant them entry into WTO, and we are willing to do that. \nAnd China is saying: By the way, you are only going to get Taiwan's \nentry into WTO as we will define it, not as you all have already \nnegotiated it.\n  The President of the United States and his Trade Representative, Ms. \nBarshefsky, have said no to the representatives of China, that is not \ncorrect. We will not go along with Taiwan's entry in that way. The \nChinese continue to insist upon it.\n  Are we, the Senate, to ignore that development? Are we nothing but \nciphers here to simply rubber stamp whatever the House of \nRepresentatives does? I don't think so. We have a constitutional \nresponsibility, and to absolutely ignore it--in fact, to reject that \nresponsibility, as Members of this body are apparently willing to do \nall in the name of getting this passed exactly as the House of \nRepresentatives did it, is to abdicate our responsibility. I think that \nis wrong.\n  As my colleagues know, the bill we are debating would grant permanent \ntrade status to China. It is eventually going to pass and become law. \nTrade with China is an important issue, primarily due to the expansive \nnature of that country's economy and the desire of U.S. firms to \nparticipate in that economy. Trade alone doesn't define our \nrelationship with China, as the present Presiding Officer made clear \nearlier, and as Senator Thompson made crystal clear in presenting his \namendment. There are other troubling aspects to this, such as China's \ntransfer of technology used to make ballistic missiles and weapons of \nmass destruction that I don't think can be ignored.\n  I am very pleased, therefore, that Senator Thompson has brought this \namendment to the floor and that we are now debating it. I, too, would \nhave preferred that it come up in a different context so that we could \nnot have the argument raised against it--not on the merits, but for \npolitical reasons you don't dare support the Thompson amendment; \notherwise, the bill will have to go back to the House of \nRepresentatives, and who knows what will happen. It might not pass. We \nwould not be subjected to that argument if he could have raised the \namendment as a freestanding bill. The supporters of PNTR would not \npermit him to bring it up as a freestanding bill. They knew they would \nhave a better chance to defeat this if he had to propose it as an \namendment to PNTR. But then they complain he is presenting it as an \namendment to PNTR.\n  That is not an appropriate substantive position, it seems to me. It \nis clever from a parliamentary point of view, but I don't think it \nallows Senator Thompson to present the issue in the most dispassionate, \nobjective, and appropriate way. We are now being relegated to the \nposition that if this amendment passes, then PNTR is in jeopardy. \nNobody wants that argument to be raised against them.\n  Let me make arguments which I think are on the merits. The Thompson \namendment is meant to combat China's irresponsible trade in the \nsensitive technologies that I mentioned. In response to concerns \nexpressed by the administration, the amendment has been revised to also \ncover the proliferation behavior of other countries, such as Russia, \nNorth Korea, and any other country that engages in this irresponsible \nbehavior.\n  As a cosponsor, as I said, even though my comments will focus on \ncases of Chinese proliferation, as Senator Thompson has done, I also \nnote that the administration's track record in responding to Russia and \nNorth Korea and their proliferation is, frankly, similar to the \nresponse with respect to China. I will comment about the proliferation. \nSenator Thompson made this point earlier, and I will raise a couple of \nnew points.\n\n  It is very clear that over the past decade China has been the world's \nworst proliferator of the technology used to develop and produce \nnuclear, chemical, and ballistic missiles, narrowly edging Russia and \nNorth Korea for this dubious distinction. Beijing has sold ballistic \nmissile technology to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, and Pakistan, at \nleast. It has sold nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan. It has \naided Iran's chemical weapons program and sold that nation advanced \ncruise missiles. China's assistance has been vital to the weapons of \nmass destruction program in these countries. It is not a trivial \nmatter. Because of that assistance, the American people, our forces, \nand our friends abroad face a much greater threat.\n  That is what this boils down to. We want trade with China, but we \nalso want to ensure that China doesn't endanger the American people and \nour allies and forces deployed abroad by their proliferation of these \nweapons of mass destruction. Sadly, the efforts of the Clinton \nadministration to end Beijing's proliferation have not succeeded. Since \ntaking office in 1993, the administration has engaged in numerous \ndiscussions with Chinese officials concerning their failure to live up \nto international nonproliferation norms. But it has failed to impose \nsanctions on Chinese organizations and Government entities, as required \nby several U.S. laws. Time and time again, the Clinton administration \nhas either refused to follow the laws requiring sanctions, or has done \nso in a way deliberately calculated to undermine the intent of the \nsanctions.\n  To understand the need for the Thompson amendment, it is instructive \nto examine a few of the cases of Chinese proliferation and the \nadministration's response.\n  First, the transfer of the M-11 missiles to Pakistan. Since taking \noffice, the Clinton administration has been faced with the issue of \nChina's transfer of M-11 missiles and production technology to \nPakistan. The M-11 is a modern, solid-fuel surface-to-surface missile \nthat is more accurate, mobile, and easier to fire than the Scuds that \nwere used in Iraq during the gulf war. For the past 7 years, the \nadministration has ignored mounting evidence in this case and has \neither failed to impose sanctions altogether or has taken steps to \nlimit their effect. One month prior to President Clinton's \ninauguration, the Los Angeles Times reported that China had delivered \nabout two dozen M-11s to Pakistan, breaking its pledge to the United \nStates to abide by the\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\nMissile Technology Control Regime, the MTCR.\n  The MTCR is a voluntary arrangement under which the 32 member nations \nagree to restrict exports of ballistic missiles capable of carrying a \npayload of at least 500 kilograms to a range of 300 kilometers, as well \nas key missile components and technology to nonmembers of the regime. \nWhile the MTCR does not have an enforcement provision, U.S. law \nrequires sanctions to be imposed on nations that transfer technology \nregulated by this agreement. There are two categories. Category I of \nthe MTCR covers transfers of complete missile systems, such as missile \nstages and some production equipment. Category II regulates transfers \nof specific missile components and dual-use goods used to produce \nmissiles.\n\n  In August of 1993, the Clinton administration imposed sanctions on \nPakistan's Ministry of Defense and 11 Chinese defense and aerospace \nentities for violations of category II of the MTCR. Shortly after the \nimposition of the sanctions, the Washington Times quoted State \nDepartment and intelligence sources as saying that despite ``. . . \noverwhelming intelligence evidence that China in November of 1992 \nshipped Pakistan key components of its M-11 missile''--an MTCR category \nI violation--Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided China had \nonly committed a category II violation and imposed the mildest form of \nsanctions possible. Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis defended the \ndecision, saying the U.S. did not have conclusive evidence Pakistan had \nreceived complete M-11s.\n  In October 1994, the Clinton administration waived these sanctions in \nreturn for another Chinese promise not to export ``ground-to-ground \nmissiles'' covered by the MTCR, and for China's reaffirmation to the \n``guidelines and parameters'' of the MTCR.\n  Since the waiver, despite a steady stream of press reports, \ncongressional testimony, and unclassified reports by the intelligence \ncommunity that have described China's continued missile assistance to \nPakistan, the Clinton administration has not imposed sanctions as \nrequired by law.\n  For example, in 1995, the Washington Post reported that satellite \nreconnaissance photos, intercepted communications, and human \nintelligence reports indicated Pakistan had indeed acquired M-11s. The \nM-11s were reportedly stored at Pakistan's Sargodha Air Force Base \nwhere the Pakistani military has constructed storage facilities for the \nmissiles and mobile launchers, as well as related maintenance \nfacilities and housing for the launch crews. Soldiers have reportedly \nbeen sighted practicing launches with advice from visiting Chinese \nexperts.\n  The Washington Post also reported in June of 1996 that all U.S. \nintelligence agencies believe with ``high confidence'' that Pakistan \nhas obtained M-11 missiles and that Islamabad had probably finished \ndeveloping nuclear warheads for them. An August 1996 article in that \nnewspaper further disclosed that a national intelligence estimate, \nwhich represents the consensus judgments of U.S. intelligence agencies, \nconcluded Pakistan was capable of an M-11 launch within 48 hours. It \nalso confirmed Pakistan was constructing a factory to produce M-11s \nfrom Chinese-supplied blueprints and equipment.\n  In addition, an unclassified National Intelligence Estimate titled \nForeign Missile Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat to the \nUnited States Through 2015 published in September 1999, states, \n``Pakistan has Chinese-supplied M-11 short-range ballistic missiles.'' \nAnd lest anyone believe Chinese missile assistance to Pakistan has \nceased, on July 2nd of this year, the New York Times reported that \n``China [has] stepped up the shipment of specialty steels, guidance \nsystems and technical expertise to Pakistan * * * Chinese experts have \nalso been sighted around Pakistan's newest missile factory, which \nappears to be partly based on a Chinese design, and shipments to \nPakistan have been continued over the past 8 to 18 months. * * *''\n  According to the Washington Times, evidence of the M-11 sale also \nincludes photographs of missile canisters in Pakistan and electronic \nintercepts regarding payments by Pakistan to China for the missiles. \nYet despite this evidence, the administration has not imposed the \nsanctions required under U.S. law.\n  As Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn \nsaid in Senate testimony in 1997, sanctions have not been invoked on \nChina for the sale of M-11's to Pakistan ``* * * because our level of \nconfidence is not sufficient to take a decision that has very far-\nreaching consequences.'' But the administration appears to have \npurposely set a standard of evidence so high that it is unattainable. \nAs Gary Milhollin, Director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms \nControl, testified to the Senate in 1997, ``I think the State \nDepartment just continues to raise the level over which you have to \njump higher and higher as the evidence comes in so that sanctions will \nnever have to be applied and the engagement policy can simply be \ncontinued. The effect is to really nullify the act of Congress that \nimposes sanctions, because unless the State Department is willing to go \nforward in good faith and complete the administrative process, then the \nlaw cannot take any effect.''\n  Another area where the administration has not lived up to its legal \nobligations concerns the sale of advanced Chinese C-802 anti-ship \ncruise missiles to Iran. These missiles pose a grave threat to U.S. \nforces operating in the crowded Persian Gulf. I would remind my \ncolleagues of one example of this danger; in 1987, a similar Exocet \ncruise missile killed 37 sailors on the U.S.S. Stark.\n  Of course, parenthetically, when these events occur, everyone in the \nCongress and all of the pundits and a lot of American people say: Who \nare the people in charge? What are they doing? When did they know? What \ndid they know? Why aren't they doing something to protect our soldiers \nand sailors and our folks deployed abroad? Why aren't they doing \nsomething?\n  The next time Americans are killed by a missile, the technology for \nwhich came from China, I am going to answer that question. I am going \nto say I stood on the floor of the Senate when we were debating PNTR \nand begged all of you to support an amendment which would at least \nallow us to impose sanctions on China when it engages in proliferation, \nand you wouldn't. No, no. PNTR with China is far more important than \nprotecting American sailors or American soldiers or American citizens \nabroad. God forbid that time should come. I will be here again \nreminding my colleagues of what they are failing to do today to protect \nagainst the threat which probably will have an adverse impact on \nAmerica in the future.\n  Continuing on about the Iranian issue, it is very interesting.\n  Iran's possession of this missile was first disclosed in January 1996 \nby Vice Admiral Scott Redd, then-commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet. \nAdmiral Redd said the C-802 gave the Iranian military increased \nfirepower and represented a new dimension to the threat faced by the \nU.S. Navy, stating, ``It used to be we just had to worry about land-\nbased cruise missiles. Now they have the potential to have that \nthroughout the Gulf mounted on ships.'' In addition, Secretary of \nDefense Cohen has said that Iran has tested an air-launched version of \nthe anti-ship cruise missile.\n  According to the Washington Times, in 1995, Defense Department \nofficials recommended declaring that China had violated the Gore-McCain \nIran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, which requires sanctions \nfor the transfer to either country of ``. . . destabilizing numbers and \ntypes of advanced conventional weapons. . . .'' Yet State Department \nofficials opposed invoking sanctions to avoid damaging relations with \nChina.\n  In his Senate testimony in 1997, Assistant Secretary of State Einhorn \nacknowledged the transaction, stating, ``. . . the question of whether \nChina transferred the C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran is not in \ndoubt.'' He noted that ``Such missiles increase China's maritime \nadvantage over other Gulf states, they put commercial shipping at risk, \nand they pose a new threat to U.S. forces operating in the region.'' \nBut Mr. Einhorn maintained that the transfer was not ``destabilizing'' \nand thus did not meet the legal requirement for sanctions to be \nimposed.\n  Such thinking illustrates how the Clinton administration has refused \nto\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\nimplement nonproliferation laws. If the arrival of weapons which \ndirectly threaten the U.S. Navy is not ``destabilizing,'' it is hard to \nimagine what the administration might find sufficiently destabilizing \nfor sanctions under the Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation \nAct.\n  The Senate has specifically addressed the issue of Chinese cruise \nmissile sales. In June 1997, we passed an amendment offered by Senator \nBennett by a vote of 96 to 0, stating: ``The delivery of cruise \nmissiles to Iran is a violation of the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation \nAct of 1992. It is the sense of the Senate to urge the Clinton \nadministration to enforce the provisions of the [Act] with respect to \nthe acquisition by Iran of C-802 model cruise missiles.'' Despite this \nunanimous expression by the Senate of the need to enforce the law, the \nadministration has refused to take action in this case.\n  I note, parenthetically, that is the reason Senator Thompson is \nforced to come to the floor and offer this amendment. Time after time \nafter time, we have said to the administration: Enforce the law that \nexists--the act I just spoke of, and others--and it won't be necessary \nto take action such as this. But when, time after time, existing laws \nare ignored or are enforced in ways that undercut their intent, \neventually, if you are serious about the defense of the United States, \nyou have to take action.\n  That is what has forced Senator Thompson to bring this issue to a \nhead now at the moment when we are considering PNTR for China.\n  There have been several instances of Chinese proliferation where the \nadministration has not invoked sanctions as required by law.\n  According to press reports, China has sold Iran ballistic missile \nguidance components, test equipment, computerized machine tools used to \nmanufacture missiles, and telemetry equipment which sends and collects \nmissile guidance data during flight tests.\n  Earlier this year, the Washington Times disclosed that China is \nassisting Libya's missile program. According to the Times, China's \npremier training center for missile scientists and technicians is \ntraining Libyan missile specialists; the director of Libya's Al-Fatah \nmissile program was planning to visit China; and Beijing is building a \nhypersonic wind tunnel in Libya used to design rockets and simulate \nmissile flight.\n  China has reportedly supplied missile guidance components and \nspecialty steel to North Korea. This January, the CIA's semi-annual \nreport to Congress on the proliferation of ballistic missiles and \nweapons of mass destruction indicated that China has aided Syria's \nliquid-fuel ballistic missile program.\n  And yet despite this evidence, the Clinton administration has not \ncompleted the necessary findings and imposed sanctions as required by \nlaw in any of these cases.\n  On rare occasions, the Clinton administration has obeyed sanctions \nrequirements in laws, but only symbolically, thereby undermining the \neffectiveness of the action. For example, in May 1997, it sanctioned \ntwo Chinese companies, five Chinese executives, and a Hong Kong firm \nfor knowingly assisting Iran's chemical weapons program. The companies \nand executives were banned from trading with the United States for one \nyear, pursuant to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and \nWarfare Elimination Act of 1991.\n  Because the sanctions were not applied to the Chinese government, but \nonly to a handful of Chinese individuals and companies, while they met \nthe bare requirements of the law their impact was minimal. As the \nWashington Post reported ``The sanctions announced yesterday will have \nminimal economic effect on China, officials said, because they are \naimed at individuals and companies that do little business with this \ncountry.''\n  Secretary of State Albright defended the administration's decision \nnot to sanction the Chinese government, stating that the United States \nhad ``. . . no evidence that the Chinese government was involved'' in \nthe chemical sales to Iran. But other administration officials \nacknowledge that the U.S. has raised concerns about chemical weapons-\nrelated sales to Iran with Beijing on numerous occasions. China's \ngovernment may or may not have approved the sales, but government \nofficials in Beijing clearly knew of the transfers, if only because of \nthe concerns expressed by U.S. officials. We should not allow China's \nGovernment to take a ``see no evil, hear no evil'' approach to \nproliferation.\n\n  Finally, let me point out when the Clinton administration has levied \nmodest sanctions, they have had some success in curbing Chinese \nproliferation. While the China's nuclear proliferation behavior seems \nto have improved in response to U.S. sanctions, it has not been trouble \nfree. Some nuclear assistance to Pakistan may be continuing.\n  The CIA report from January 21 also states that our intelligence \nagencies cannot preclude ongoing contacts between Chinese and Pakistani \nnuclear organizations. In addition, in May of this year, the Washington \nTimes disclosed that sales of U.S. nuclear reactors to China have been \nheld up because China has refused to provide the necessary assurances \nthat it will not re-export U.S. nuclear technology to other countries. \nThe administration has correctly refused to approve 16 export licenses \nfrom American firms until China provides these assurances. My point in \ndiscussing China's response to even mild sanctions imposed by the U.S. \nin these particular cases is to illustrate that economic sanctions have \naltered China's proliferation behavior in the past. They can do so in \nthe future, if we are serious.\n  I am not satisfied that even in this particular area the Clinton \nadministration has lived up to the requirements of the law. The 1994 \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Act requires additional sanctions beyond the \nsuspension of Export-Import Bank loans by the Clinton administration in \nthe ring magnet case. I referred to Assistant Secretary of State for \nNonproliferation Robert Einhorn, who explained in Senate testimony that \nthe administration avoided this legal requirement by claiming that it \nlacked proof that China's senior most leaders had approved the ring \nmagnet sale and that the transaction, therefore, did not constitute ``a \nwillful aiding or abetting of Pakistan's unsafeguarded nuclear program \nby the Government of China.''\n  This is a flawed argument, of course, because the Chinese company \ninvolved, the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation, is owned by \nthe Chinese Government. Most companies owned by the Chinese Government \ncan't act in China without the knowledge of the Government. In fact, \nmost people in China can't act without the knowledge of the Chinese \nGovernment.\n  As Professor Gary Milhollin, Director of the Wisconsin Project on \nNuclear Arms Control explained,\n\n       These [ring magnets] are specialized items. We are not \n     talking about dual-use equipment. We are talking about \n     magnets that are made specifically to go into centrifuges \n     that make enriched uranium for bombs. Those were sold by an \n     arm of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is an \n     arm of the Chinese government. This was a sale by a Chinese \n     government organization directly to a secret nuclear weapon-\n     making facility in Pakistan of items that were specifically \n     designed to help make nuclear weapon material. In my opinion, \n     it violated China's pledge under the Nuclear Nonproliferation \n     Treaty, which China signed in 1992. The treaty says if you \n     export something like that, you have to export it with \n     international inspection. China did not.\n\n  Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis made a similar assessment in \ntestimony to the House International Relations Committee in 1996, \nsaying China's ring magnet sale was ``. . . not consistent with their \nobligations as a party to the Nonproliferation Treaty.''\n  It is clear that time and time again the Clinton administration has \nnot lived up to its legal obligations under several U.S. laws requiring \nsanctions to combat the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons \nof mass destruction. In some very revealing remarks in 1998, President \nClinton explained his administration's record in this area. In what it \ndescribed as ``. . . unusually frank remarks during an appearance \nbefore a group of 60 evangelical Christian leaders at the White \nHouse,'' the New York Times reported on April 28, 1998 that ``President \nClinton criticized laws today that automatically impose sanctions on \ncountries for behavior that Americans find unacceptable. He said such \nlegislation put pressure on the executive branch to `fudge,' or \noverlook, violations so that it would not have to carry out the \nsanctions.''\n  What the President acknowledged is only what many, many people in the\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\nknow have been saying for a long time; namely, that the relationship \nwith China has gotten to be so important to this administration that it \nis willing to ``fudge'' the requirements of U.S. law to impose \nsanctions because they would get in the way of this budding \nrelationship between President Clinton and the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  According to the New York Times, in response to criticism that his \nadministration has ``ignor[ed] or excus[ed] obvious violations of \nUnited States sanction laws to justify continuing to do business with \ncertain countries,'' President Clinton said, ``What happens if you have \nautomatic sanctions legislation is it puts enormous pressure on whoever \nis in the executive branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what \nis going on.''\n  It might put enormous pressure on the President of the United States \nto follow the law. When repeatedly he hasn't done so, a Senate that is \nworth its salt will stand up and finally do what Senator Thompson has \ndone and say: Enough of this. The U.S. Government has got to see to it \nthat our national security needs are protected, at least if we are \ngoing now to grant PNTR, permanent trading relations with China, and \ngrant its admission to the World Trade Organization, thus precluding us \nfrom a whole series of unilateral actions that otherwise we could have \ntaken. When you are in the WTO, you abide by its rules. You can't just \nwilly-nilly be imposing sanctions on countries; otherwise, you will be \nheld accountable under the WTO.\n  Fortunately, the way Senator Thompson has drafted his amendment, the \nPresident of the United States would be able, under limited \ncircumstances, to impose sanctions based upon national security \nrequirements, and he would also incidentally have the ability to waive \nthose requirements in the national security interest. He is not bound \nto do anything that he shouldn't do.\n  One wonders, however, if a President is suggesting that he needs to \n``fudge'' the requirements of the law in order to maintain this great \nrelationship with China, what even the requirements of the Thompson \namendment would do. Fortunately, he has accounted for that possibility \nby also requiring a report of the President to the Congress of why he \ndidn't impose sanctions, if he didn't, and requiring some specificity \nso we will at least understand what is at stake and whether or not the \nPresident should have imposed sanctions so that we might at least take \nsome other steps.\n  Senator Levin, incidentally, summarized the view of many when he said \nthe examination of China's proliferation record at a 1997 Senate \nhearing had shed light on ``an area where I think we have not lived up \nfully to our own domestic requirements in terms of the imposition of \nsanctions where evidence is plenty clear, or clear enough for me, at \nleast.''\n  Senator Stevens made a similar point during the same Senate hearing \nin 1997, stating, ``I am coming to the conclusion that maybe the \nadministration is so narrowly interpreting our laws that we would have \nthe situation that if a country moved a missile or a poison gas or \nbacterial warfare system piece by piece, grain by grain, you could not \ndo anything about it until all the grains were there and then it would \nbe a fait accompli.''\n  The Thompson amendment would significantly improve the current \nsituation. It would require an annual report to Congress on the people, \norganizations, and countries on which our government has credible \ninformation indicating they have been engaged in the proliferation of \nnuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or ballistic or cruise \nmissiles. This requirement for full disclosure should eliminate the \nability of the Clinton administration or those of future \nadministration's to ``fudge'' the facts. They use the President's \nwords. It should greatly improve the ability of the Congress to \nexercise effective oversight over this and future administrations.\n  Second, it will send a clear signal to organizations in China and \nother nations, such as Russia and North Korea, that if they engage in \nproliferation, sanctions will surely follow. As I mentioned earlier, \nsanctions have been one of the foreign policy tools that have moderated \nChina's behavior. When our Government has been serious about effective \nchange in China and has been willing to use sanctions, we have seen \nresults. Perhaps had the administration been more willing to implement \nthe laws in this area and used sanctions more frequently, we would have \nseen less proliferation of these extraordinarily lethal technologies to \nrogue nations.\n  Finally, I point out the amendment contains a waiver provision, as I \nsaid before, which allows the President to waive the requirement for \nsanctions under the legislation if it is important to the national \nsecurity of the United States not to apply these provisions.\n  So there is no reason for anyone to suggest that this amendment is a \npoison pill; that it would somehow tie the President's hands; or that \nit should not be adopted because it would jeopardize the passage of \nPNTR or the future security of the United States.\n  Madam President, sanctions should not be the first or only tool used \nin the fight against proliferation. But this tool should not grow rusty \nfrom disuse either. As the Washington Post noted in an editorial as \nrecently as July 14 of this year:\n\n       . . . China's continuing assistance to Pakistan's weapons \n     program in the face of so many U.S. efforts to talk Beijing \n     out of it shows the limits of a nonconfrontational approach.\n\n  The United States must back our frequent expressions of concern with \nactions if our words are to be perceived by China and other \nproliferators as credible. We must enforce our own laws if we are to be \nsuccessful in persuading other nations to live up to their \ninternational commitments in treaties and other international \nagreements. And we need to be realistic in our dealings with nations \nsuch as China, Russia, and North Korea.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Thompson amendment. It is an \namendment which will help to guarantee the national security interests \nof the United States. It will do nothing to impede trade or otherwise \ninterfere with the operation of the WTO or the passage of the PNTR.\n  Therefore, Madam President, as I said, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Thompson amendment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that now, \nfollowing the conclusion of the statement by Senator Kyl, the following \nSenators be recognized: Senator Kerry, Senator Inhofe, Senator Graham \nof Florida, and Senator Smith of New Hampshire, in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise to oppose the Thompson amendment. \nI want to talk a little bit about the reasons I oppose it, and perhaps \nrespond a little bit to some of the comments that have been made in the \ncourse of the afternoon.\n  Having been part of these debates now for some period of time, I have \nbegun to notice the ebb and flow on how we approach these issues of \nconcern about foreign countries, about issues of national security and \nhow they do and do not impact us. It is interesting because we tend to \ngo to the extremes. That is perhaps part of the nature of the Senate. \nIt is part of the nature of the political process. But what is clear to \nme, after observing this over a long period of time, is that it is not \nalways beneficial to furthering the larger national security concerns \nof the country.\n  I approached this issue originally with much the same concern as the \nSenator from Tennessee. I think all of us are deeply concerned about \nthe degree to which certain countries seem to be contributing to the \npotential of instability in the world. Obviously, there is nothing more \ndestabilizing or threatening than weapons of mass destruction. We have \nspent an enormous amount of time and energy focused on Iraq, on Iran, \non Russia, on loose nukes, on nuclear materials, and of course on China \nand on the issue of the transfer of technology to Pakistan.\n  So I took the time to go to the Intelligence Committee briefing on \nthis subject, to really get a handle and try to get a sense of how \nconcerned should I be about this: Are we really at a point where this \nis so clear-cut and such an egregious violation of Presidential \ndiscretion that the Congress of the United States ought to step in and, \nin a sense,\n\n[[Page S8322]]\n\ntake away from the President whatever flexibility he has been left with \nto date?\n  May I say I went into that briefing with a sense of: Boy, these guys \nhave really screwed up and now is the time to bring the hammer down. I \ncame out of it, however, with a much different sense of the road that \nhas been traveled and of the choices we ought to be making and we face \nin the Senate today.\n  The fact is, on nuclear issues--separate from missile technology \ntransfers--we have made rather remarkable progress in the last 8 years, \nwith a country that very recently accepted no norms of international \nproliferation behavior.\n  On March 9, 1992--let's recollect here, this is only 8 years ago, a \nvery short span of time in terms of the evolutionary process occurring \nin China, and particularly a short span of time in terms of our period \nof real engagement with China.\n  On March 9, 1992, China acceded to the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty.\n  Later in 1992, China agreed not to export complete missile systems \nwhich fall within the payload and range parameters governed by the \nMissile Technology Control Regime.\n  On January 13, 1993, China signed the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  In May of 1996, China agreed not to provide any assistance to nuclear \nfacilities not under the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.\n  In September of 1996, China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  In September of 1997, China promulgated new export controls, and that \ncontrol list is substantively identical to the dual-use list used by \nthe Nuclear Suppliers Group.\n  On October 16, 1997, China joined the Zangger Committee which \ncoordinates nuclear export policies among NPT members.\n  On April 25, 1997, China ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention and \nbegan to enforce export controls on the dual-use chemical technology.\n  In June of 1998, China published a detailed export control regulation \ngoverning dual-use nuclear items.\n  In 1998, China agreed to phase out all support for Iran's nuclear \nenergy program, even support to safeguarded facilities, which was not \nprohibited by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  So that is a rather remarkable series of progressive movements \ntowards the community of nations whereby China not only signed \nagreements but began to lay down a substantive record of making choices \nto enforce and to adhere to those standards.\n  With respect to missiles and missile control technology, I am not \ngoing to stand here in front of the Senator from Tennessee or my other \ncolleagues and suggest there are not some concerns. I am not going to \nsuggest that, with respect to the 1994 agreement under the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime, that with respect to the complete production \nfacility there is not a question about Pakistan being in violation. \nThat is what, in fact, prompted me to suggest perhaps the \nadministration had erred and we ought to be doing more.\n  After 1997, that progress clearly tapers off. But I ask my colleagues \nto think hard about this--how do you best build a relationship with a \nnation that is neither friend nor enemy but a nation with which you \nhave a developing relationship? How do you best build the capacity to \nachieve the kind of national security standards you want adhered to.\n  I suggest very respectfully that this unilateral, rather draconian, \ninflexible approach that is being offered in the Thompson amendment is \nprecisely not the kind of step we should be taking.\n  Some colleagues of mine will focus on the PNTR components of this, \nthe clean PNTR component. I am not going to focus on that now. That is \na pretty simple argument, and they have done their part in articulating \nit.\n  I know the Senator from Tennessee did not intend to wind up in this \npredicament, offering his amendment to PNTR. In fairness to the \nSenator, there are colleagues in the Senate who saw political advantage \nin guaranteeing we come to the floor in the particular parliamentary \nknot we are in. He would have preferred an alternative venue for \nconsidering his amendment. That does not mean the argument can be \nignored. I want my colleagues to vote against the Thompson amendment \nnot only to preserve a ``clean'' PNTR, but because there are \nsubstantive reasons that thoughtful foreign policy and thoughtful \nrelationships between the Senate and the executive branch mandate we \nrefuse to accept this amendment in its current form. Specifically, let \nme talk about that for a minute.\n  There are a number of questions the Thompson amendment in its current \nform presents the Senate with. One, and the most evident of all, is \nwill this amendment cause China to clean up its act on the issue of \nproliferation?\n  I say to my colleagues, if you look at the record of China's \nstatements with respect to the annex of the missile technology and \ncontrol regime, and if you measure where China has traveled in these \npast years, I think this act could have the opposite effect. It could \ndrive China away from this slow process of understanding we have been \nworking toward on proliferation.\n  I ask my colleagues to remember that as recently as only 1997, China \ndid not even have an office that dealt with the issues of missile \ntechnology exports. In the last 5 or 6 years, China had no record \nwhatsoever of restraining its companies from making any sales \nwhatsoever. Yet already, because the United States of America has \nraised this issue again and again in a diplomatic context, we now are \nat a point where companies in China are being refused export rights for \ncertain kinds of technology that are deemed to be dual use. In other \nwords, China is moving towards the international community in its \nefforts to enforce the spirit--not the letter because they have not \nsigned on to the law yet--but to enforce the spirit of the law.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you want China to sign on to the letter of \nthe law and to sit down and negotiate with you a realistic regime by \nwhich we can lay out a mutual agreement on these issues, I guarantee \nthat adopting this amendment will end those discussions and push us in \nthe opposite direction from the direction in which we are trying to \nmove.\n  We should also ask ourselves the question: Will this legislation \nforce the President to sanction China for a proliferation violation? \nDoes this legislation accomplish the goal which it sets out to \naccomplish? For all of the talk on the floor of the Senate and for all \nof the rhetoric about we have to send China a signal and we have to \nmake certain that China toes the line, the bottom line is that even if \nthis were passed and signed into law, it simply will not force the \nPresident to do what it sets out to do, because it offers the \nopportunity for the President to define a waiver in national security \nterms that can not be overridden by the Congress, under the procedures \noutline in this bill.\n\n  I will set out a series of reasons why I believe colleagues should \noppose this amendment, strictly on substantive grounds.\n  No. 1, this amendment takes a piecemeal approach to the global \nproblem of proliferation by focusing on just a few countries. \nOriginally, it was focused on China. Russia and North Korea are add-\nons, afterthoughts, if you will, to try to make it more palatable and \nto somehow suggest there is a rationale for doing what we are doing. \nBut the fact is, if the rationale is proliferation, it ought to apply \nto every country. There is no reason to have a specific China-centric \neffort when, in fact, there are many other countries about which we are \nequally concerned.\n  No. 2, it uses the blunt instrument of mandatory, unilateral \nsanctions to respond to any violation of the law no matter how \ninconsequential or unintentional.\n  No. 3, it bases those sanctions on unreasonably low standards of \nevidence.\n  No. 4, it imposes a burdensome reporting requirement on agencies \nwhose time is arguably better spent stopping proliferation rather than \nsimply collating thousands of pieces of information, some of which is \nbased on such a low standard with respect to ``credible information'' \nthat it could literally tie you up forever, and I will show evidence of \nthat a little later.\n  No. 5, it introduces the U.S. capital markets for the first time in \nhistory into proliferation policy, a concept that Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan has strongly questioned.\n  In short, in my judgment, this legislation as currently drafted, \nwould hinder rather than help U.S. efforts to\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\naddress the problem of proliferation in China or particularly elsewhere \nin the world.\n  I think the problems with this amendment start at the very beginning. \nThe legislation is titled ``The China Nonproliferation Act.'' While \nSenator Thompson has, as I said, included a couple of other countries \nas targets, China remains singled out in the title and China remains \nthe focus, as everybody understands.\n  Whether or not he intends it, that will certainly be the way it is \nread by the Chinese, and I know no observer, neutral or biased, who \nwould not agree that would, in fact, be the result of this legislation.\n  So rather than heeding the next President and his advisers when they \ntell China its proliferation of WMD and ballistic missile technology \nhas to end, China's leadership is going to point to this legislation as \nevidence that the United States is simply using the proliferation as an \nexcuse to single them out.\n  Again, I repeat, we have spent decades working to pull China into a \nserious dialog about serious issues. China has come to acknowledge that \nit is important to embrace some of these international norms. And we \nshould not force the next administration, whoever it is, to waste \nvaluable diplomatic energy persuading China that we take proliferation \nseriously, whatever the source, even though the Senate in the context \nof this particular treaty is singling them out.\n  I do not believe we should set aside U.S. national interests simply \nto avoid angering the nations targeted by this amendment. That is not \nwhat I am suggesting. But I do think it is foolish of us to ignore real \nsensitivities and real reactions that occur and which we have \nespecially seen historically with China.\n  This amendment essentially sends a signal to the world that we are \nless bothered by proliferation that does not come from the three states \nnamed in this legislation: If you are not China, if you are not North \nKorea, and if you are not Russia, somehow there we care less about your \nproliferation activities. I think that is a mistake in terms of any \nmessages sent by the Senate.\n  The second major flaw in the amendment is its reliance on mandatory \nunilateral sanctions. We have had a number of debates on the floor of \nthe Senate in the last couple of years about the negative impact of \nmandatory sanctions. It has almost, I think, become a consensus in the \nSenate that we want to move away from mandatory unilateral sanctions.\n  The sanctions that have been proven to work globally are the \nsanctions that are applied multilaterally. That is what happened in \nSouth Africa with apartheid. We have a long list of sanctions \nunilaterally applied by the United States of America which simply open \nup opportunities to other countries to fill the vacuum created we are \nunilaterally taken off the playing field. The question is whether or \nnot that really helps us in terms of our nonproliferation objectives.\n  There is, in effect in this legislation a sledge-hammer approach; \nthere is no subtlety. There is no ability to provide a President with \nflexibility. There is no ability even to allow a sufficient amount of \ntime for the diplomatic process to work.\n  Because the requirement of this legislation is that the President has \nto impose all of the sanctions simultaneously in response to one \nproliferation violation. This is a heavyhanded, one-size-fits-all \napproach that destroys some of the flexibility to calibrate appropriate \nresponses to inappropriate proliferation behavior. It destroys any \npotential that we might be able to change China's behavior as we go \ndown the road.\n  I know it is not easy to argue for that sort of approach. It is \nalways easier to come to the floor and talk tough or pass a tough kind \nof signal. But every time we have done that in the Senate, we have come \nback later questioning why it is that other countries are not following \nus, questioning why it is that other countries are, in fact, engaged in \nan overt effort to circumvent what the United States is doing, \nquestioning how, in fact, we could have had a more effective policy in \nthe first place.\n  I will fault this administration on its lack of focus and energy on \nthe proliferation issue as a whole. They will not like to hear that. \nNevertheless, I am convinced that unless you have a more visible, \nmultilateral effort, then you are simply opening a Pandora's box of \nopportunity for the competitive marketplace to undermine what you are \ntrying to achieve and, in the process, making it far more difficult to \nachieve a larger set of goals which require a more sophisticated \napproach.\n  The Thompson amendment also does not allow the United States to \ncoordinate its proliferation response in China, North Korea, or Russia \nwith our allies. By forcing the President to impose sweeping unilateral \nsanctions within 30 days of submitting a report to Congress on \nproliferation it severely limits the President's ability to consult \nwith either the government of the covered country or with U.S. allies \nin order to develop the most effective response.\n\n  This amendment ensures that the United States will therefore come \ninto conflict with key allies in Europe and in Asia over how to best \nmanage important relationships with China, Russia, and North Korea. I \nthink that is of enormous concern. It is also, I may say, almost \nguaranteed to fail in changing the proliferation activity of a \nparticular country.\n  Let's say China were caught in some particular effort, and we were \nunsuccessful, and you wind up unilaterally imposing the sanction. Do \nyou really believe that at that point you have made it more likely they \nare going to acknowledge it, at least in the near term, by suddenly \nputting up their hands and saying, OK, you caught us red-handed? No pun \nintended.\n  The fact is, you have a much greater opportunity of holding people \naccountable if you use diplomacy to allow people sufficient opportunity \nto back down or to find alternative forms of behavior.\n  The third major failing of this amendment is that it creates an \nunreasonable standard for imposing sanctions, targeting even \ninadvertent and immaterial transfers of technology. All of the power \nthe President needs to be able to hold a country accountable for \nproliferation violations already exists in the law today. You do not \nhave to do what the Senator from Tennessee is seeking to do in order to \nhold these countries accountable.\n  I understand why he is doing it. He is doing it because the \nadministration does not seem to want to do it.\n  So supporters of this amendment are trying to legislate the political \nwill for a President to do something that, for whatever reasons, the \ncurrent President has decided not to do. They have every right in the \nworld to try to do that. But I ask my colleagues if we ought to take \nthe permanent normal trade relations and put that on the table with \nrespect to achieving something that is already in the law?\n  We have the Arms Export Control Act, section 3(f). We have the Arms \nExport Control Act, section 101, 102. We have section 129 of the Atomic \nEnergy Act. We have section 821 of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention \nAct of 1994. We have section 824 of the Nuclear Proliferation \nPrevention Act of 1994. We have section 2(b)(4) of the Export-Import \nBank Act. We have sections 72 and 73 of the Arms Export Control Act; \nsection 11(b) of the Export Administration Act. We have section \n498(a)(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act. We have section 81 of the Arms \nExport Control Act; section 11(c) of the Export Administration Act with \nrespect to chemical and biological weapons proliferation. We have \nExecutive Order No. 12938 with respect to all weapons of mass \ndestruction technology and delivery systems. We have the Iran-Iraq Arms \nNonproliferation Act of 1992 and the Iran Nonproliferation Act of the \nyear 2000.\n  In fact, missile technology transfers are already subject to U.S. \nlaw, and the President has the authority to sanction those violations.\n  Senator Thompson will argue: Well, we are going to make the \nAdministration do it because they haven't done it.\n  That is the whole purpose of being here. I understand that argument. \nBut in fact he won't necessarily make them do it because, of course, \nthere is the waiver.\n  Well, then they have a redress. They can have one-fifth of the \nCongress, either House, which is 20 Senators who don't particularly \nlike trade with China, they can come back and tell the President: Well, \nwe don't like the fact\n\n[[Page S8324]]\n\nthat you haven't applied sanctions. So they can try to go around that \ndecision, which means we could be tied up on a standard that simply \ndoesn't make sense for the Congress of the United States to be tied up \non with respect to the potential of some kind of ``credible \ninformation'' suggesting some dual-use technology transfer that might \ncontribute to the creation of a missile or some kind of missile \ncapacity. That is the standard in here. Those U.S. sanctions laws I \ncited--with only one or two exceptions--includes the standard that a \nviolation must be a knowing transfer of sensitive technology that makes \na material contribution to a weapon of mass destruction program. A \nknowing transfer with a material contribution. The standard in this \nlegislation requires any kind of contribution made with no deliberate \nknowing whatsoever.\n  So you have all five mandatory sanctions that could be put in place \nabsent, obviously, the waiver I described, or if the Congress wanted to \nfight over it, which we can all find 100,000 reasons why it might \nchoose to do so, given the nature of this institution in the last \nyears. I don't think we should open ourselves up to that situation.\n  The new standard under this is any transfer that ``contributes to'' \ninstead of the ``materially contributes to,'' the design, development, \nproduction, or acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. That could \nmean that the President could be required to impose sanctions on a \ncompany that makes legal and legitimate sales to a person or a \ngovernment engaged in WMD development.\n  Fourth, the Thompson amendment requires a rather remarkably \nburdensome report identifying every person in China, Russia, and North \nKorea for whom there is ``credible information indicating that that \nperson is engaged in proliferation activity.'' The flood of information \nguaranteed by this amendment will tie up already limited resources in \nthe executive branch that could, in fact, be doing a far more serious \njob of working on proliferation itself.\n  The low credible information standard, I know, is derived from the \nIran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, but that doesn't make it an \nadvisable standard, No. 1, and, No. 2, under that standard, any piece \nof information from a source deemed to be credible has to be reported \nwithout discretion, even if the information later proves to be false.\n  Now, Congress has yet to receive the first report that was required \nunder the INA, in part because the intelligence community has so far \ngenerated 8,000 pages of information that is deemed credible just on \nchemical and biological weapons and missile proliferation alone. \nAnalyzing that mountain of data to determine what should be included in \na report to Congress requires obviously countless man-hours. And as \nburdensome as the reporting requirement for INA is proving to be, \nbelieve me, that law, since it focuses only on one country with a far \nmore identifiable set of sources because of the limits of commerce, \ntrade, presents us with a gargantuan task. The Thompson amendment \napplies the same reporting requirement to possible proliferation from \nthree nations: Russia, a gigantic task; China, a gigantic task; and \nNorth Korea, a far more limited task but nevertheless real.\n  It will also require reporting on all dual-use exports by the United \nStates and key allies. The amendment's reporting requirement is tied to \na report by the Director of Central Intelligence on suppliers of dual \nuse and other technology. And because that report covers global exports \nof these technologies, the 1997 DCI report included information about \nlegal and legitimate exports by the United States, Italy, Germany, \nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n  According to the DCI, these nations were ``favorite targets of \nacquisition for foreign WMD programs.'' So the report required under \nsection 3 of the Thompson amendment will likely include information on \nWestern countries just so long as the information is credible. Firms in \nthese countries can probably avoid the mandatory sanctions because \nthose countries qualify for exemption for membership in multilateral \nnonproliferation regimes. It doesn't mean you won't report; it simply \nmeans you won't have the sanctions. But you still have to go through \nthe convoluted process of providing the reports themselves and \nanalyzing the information.\n  Finally, the Thompson amendment introduces U.S. capital markets for \nthe first time in history into proliferation policy. It will impose \nindirect sanctions against those entities included in the President's \nreport that are publicly traded on stock markets regulated by the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  Companies named in the President's report will have to so inform \ninvestors, according to the requirements of this legislation. \nSupporters of the amendment argue that those provisions are simply to \nprovide transparency for American investors in entities that are active \nin U.S. capital markets and involved in proliferation activities.\n  In fact, because the reporting standard is so low, it is likely that \nmany of the entities implicated in the report will, with further \ninvestigation, be proven innocent of engaging in proscribed \nproliferation activities. In short, the President must shoot first, and \nask questions later--after the financial damage has been done to firms \nthat are innocent.\n  I don't want to step over the line as to what was classified and what \nis not classified with respect to the briefings. I think it is fair to \nsay that the intelligence community will tell you that this is not a \nclear cut and dry process by which there is a clear understanding at \nevery level of government in China as to who is doing what. There are \nmany people in the intelligence community who have a sense that because \nof the orders given to the military a number of years ago with respect \nto their dependency on revenue in order to survive, that there are \ncertain military entities that weren't necessarily under direct orders \nto effect something.\n  There are certain companies that weren't under central control, and \nthe process of education with respect to America's concern and their \nown interests in adhering to these standards has been an ongoing \nprocess, which has brought a greater level of understanding and a \ngreater level of commitment.\n  Now, I would personally prefer that China formally adopt and embrace \nthe full measure of the Missile Technology Control Regime. That should \nbe the immediate and first priority of our diplomacy. That should be \nthe immediate and first effort of our country and of the multilateral \nefforts of our allies to guarantee that we are all on the same page, \nthat we are all operating from the same level of understanding.\n  But the intelligence community acknowledges that there is a \ndifference of opinion as to precisely what the understandings were or \nwhat was agreed to with respect to certain kinds of transfers, and that \nthere is clearly progress being made with respect to the development of \nthat understanding. And while it is difficult sometimes to take this \nposition in the Senate, I argue that we have a much greater opportunity \nof reaching a fuller understanding and of guaranteeing that we move \ndown a road of multilateral understanding and interest if we do not \npass the Thompson amendment at this particular point in time.\n  The truth is that the United States-China relationship is our most \ncomplex and difficult bilateral relationship. It is one of the most \nimportant that we have. It is yet to be fully defined. As I said \nearlier, China cannot be considered a friend; but China cannot yet--and \nshould not, we hope--ultimately be considered an enemy. There are many \nadversarial aspects of our relationship. There is much we wish would \nchange more rapidly in China. Thirty years of engagement with China has \ntaught us that you can't necessarily advance one issue at the expense \nof another.\n  While I am under no illusions that supporting PNTR is going to \nproduce overnight changes in other aspects of China's policy that we \ncare about, I am absolutely confident that singling China out with this \namendment will make it more difficult to draw China into an \ninternational nonproliferation regime, and it will undermine the \nlimited success that we have achieved in the arms control arena over \nthe last 10 years. I am absolutely convinced that in the near term it \nwill make progress more difficult without bringing us closer to the \ngoal that we may well be able to achieve in the near term through other \napproaches.\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\n  I believe Senator Thompson has done the Senate and the country a \nservice by raising this issue. It is important for us in the Senate to \ntalk about the degrees to which there are currently misunderstandings, \nor the degrees to which we believe there are just overt violations by \nChina of understandings. It is important for China to understand the \nfull measure of our concern and determination to hold them and other \ncountries accountable to the international norms with respect to \nproliferation issues.\n  But I believe that will best be done not by singling out three \ncountries, but rather by continuing in the Senate to push all nations \ntoward a stronger regime and a better understanding. I think this \namendment is flawed, therefore, in its current definition, for the \nreasons I have stated. It is not the right response. It is not the \nright forum for addressing this issue that does deserve thoughtful and \nfull consideration. I urge my colleagues, therefore, to oppose the \nThompson amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the president of the New \nYork Stock Exchange regarding the stock exchange components of this and \nthe opposition of the SEC to it be printed in the Record.\n  Thre being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: I am writing to express the \n     strong opposition of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE) \n     to the provisions of S. 2654, the China Nonproliferation Act, \n     pertaining to access to U.S. capital markets. The NYSE is the \n     world's largest equities marketplace and is home to more than \n     3,000 companies with more than $17 trillion in global market \n     capitalization. Non-U.S. issuers play an increasingly \n     important role on the NYSE. The NYSE list more than 380 non-\n     U.S. companies--more than triple the number listed five years \n     ago.\n       While the NYSE does not in any way condone the \n     proliferation activities that S. 2654 attempts to address, \n     the NYSE believes that one of the bill's sanctions--denial of \n     access to the U.S. capital markets--will hurt U.S. investors \n     while failing to deter these activities. Under S. 2654, the \n     NYSE could be prohibited from listing additional Chinese \n     companies or be required to delist Chinese companies trading \n     on the Exchange. The reach of these expansive provisions is \n     not limited to companies involved in proliferation activities \n     but could extend to any company owned or controlled by \n     nationals of the PRC, including those in Hong Kong.\n       If the NYSE is required to de-list a company as a result of \n     S. 2654, U.S. investors in the company will be harmed. \n     However, companies denied access to the U.S. capital markets \n     by S. 2654 sanctions would not be deprived of the ability to \n     raise capital. Non-U.S. exchanges actively compete with the \n     NYSE for non-U.S. listings. These exchange would be happy to \n     list the stock of any company denied access to the U.S. \n     capital markets by S. 2654. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \n     Greenspan stated in response to a question about S. 2654 at a \n     July 20 Senate Banking Committee hearing ``a most fundamental \n     concern about this particular amendment is it doesn't have \n     any capacity of which I'm aware to work. And by being put in \n     effect, the only thing that strikes me is a reasonable \n     expectation that it would harm us more than it would harm \n     others.''\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views on this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard A. Grasso,\n                                                  President, NYSE.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, national security must take precedence \nover trade. Granting permanent trade favors to China in the face of its \nopenly threatening actions of recent years is unconscionable.\n  We cannot allow the pursuit of dollars to blind us to certain \nrealities about the ruling communist regime in China, including: \nrepeated threats against the United States and Taiwan; massive military \nmodernization and buildup; its proliferation of dangerous weapons to \nrogue states; theft of U.S. nuclear secrets; demonstrated strategy to \nexploit commercial relationships to acquire advanced military \ntechnology; attempts to corrupt the U.S. political system; violation of \ninternational agreements; and brutal repression of dissidents.\n  To ignore these actions in the belief they can be separated from what \nwe do in our trading relationship is dangerously misguided. China's \ntrade surpluses are helping to finance the regime's military buildup \nand aggressive foreign policy, while strengthening its hold on economic \nand political power.\n  Similarly, to suggest that increased trade is by itself going to \nreverse China's negative behavior is belied by recent history. Trade \nwith China has been steadily increasing for the past decade while its \nbehavior in these security areas has grown substantially worse.\n  America should require from China some measure of permanent \nnormalized international behavior as a prerequisite to permanent \nnormalized trade relations. Otherwise, it is predictable that the \nfavors we grant to China will be exploited to enhance its military \nbuildup, while the market-opening favors and prosperity we expect from \nChina will be much less than many in our country anticipate.\n  I want to emphasize that I am not philosophically opposed to free \ntrade. I voted for the recent Africa-Caribbean trade bill and I am a \nstrong supporter of a measure to end the use of agricultural trade \nsanctions as a means to achieve policy goals.\n  I am very skeptical about the extent to which China will actually \nopen its markets to U.S. products. Despite tariff-lowering measures in \ntrade agreements, China has--in the past--sought to erect other \ncomplicated trade barriers to block imports. Especially with regard to \nagricultural products, China is unlikely to offer the wide-open market \nsome in the U.S. are anticipating. China will go to great lengths to \nprotect its own huge labor-intensive agricultural sector, because of \nthe difficulty of absorbing displaced agriculture workers in scarcer \ncity jobs.\n  Permanently opening the U.S. market to China now--in the face of its \nbullying at home and abroad--would be viewed by Chinese leaders less as \nan act of friendship than as an act of weakness. It would signal to \nthem that there is going to be no meaningful consequence to their bad \nbehavior and that America is content to put the pursuit of dollars \nahead of any obligation to protect its own values and security.\n  The following are examples of the major national security issues that \nmust be considered in the debate over PNTR for China:\n  Threats to the United States: In recent years, China has issued \ndirect military threats against the United States of a kind that even \nthe Soviet Union largely avoided in the darkest days of the Cold War. \nThese included a threat to destroy Los Angeles with nuclear weapons; \nother threats to launch missile strikes on the United States and \nneutron bomb strikes on U.S. aircraft carriers if we should intervene \nto defend Taiwan. In 1998, the CIA confirmed that at least 13 of \nChina's 18 land-based ICBMs were targeted on American cities. In Dec. \n1999, China's defense minister, reflecting well-documented military \nthinking in China, stated, ``War (with the U.S.) is inevitable. We \ncannot avoid it.''\n  Threats to Taiwan: China has openly threatened military action \nagainst democratic Taiwan. In 1996, China fired M-9 missiles off the \ncoasts of Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate voters during its \npresidential election. In Feb. 2000, it issued a ``white paper'' openly \nthreatening ``all drastic measures, including the use of force'' if \nTaiwan delayed reunification talks, a threat previously reserved only \nfor a Taiwanese declaration of independence. In 1995, China had 40 M-9 \nmissiles targeted on Taiwan. By 1999, it had deployed at least 200 such \nmissiles and the number is increasing at a rate of 50 per year. The \nPentagon estimates that by 2005, China could have 800 missiles targeted \non Taiwan.\n  Military buildup: China is engaged in a massive long-term military \nmodernization largely designed to counter U.S. power projection \ncapabilities. In March 2000, China announced a 13 percent increase in \nmilitary spending, which U.S. analysts believe is probably a lot less \nthan the true number. China's new JL-2 submarine-launched ICBM will be \nable to hit the United States from Chinese territorial waters. China's \nnew DF-31 truck-mounted mobile ICBM was test-fired in August 1999 and \ndescribed by U.S. Air Force analysts as ``a significant threat not only \nto U.S. forces . . . in the Pacific theater, but to the continental \nU.S. and many of our allies.'' In January 2000, China signed a \nmultibillion dollar deal to purchase weapons from Russia, adding to \nwhat it has already purchased, including: 4 heavy destroyers armed with \nSS-N-22 ``Sunburn'' nuclear-capable cruise missiles designed \nspecifically\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\nto attack U.S. aircraft carriers; 200 SU-27 jet fighters, which are \nmore capable than the U.S. F-15; 40 SU-30 jet fighters with precision \nguided weapons; 4 Kilo-class (quiet) attack submarines; 24 Mi-17 \nassault helicopters; and 50 T-72 tanks. China is also purchasing up to \n4 Airborne Warning and Control System--AWACS--aircraft. In addition, \nChina is employing all means--legal and illegal--to purchase \nimprovements in a whole range of advanced military technologies, \nincluding: computers; lasers; space launch and space control systems; \ncyber-warfare; stealth; and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.\n  Proliferation: China is doing more than any other country to spread \ndangerous weapons and military technology to rogue states around the \nworld. In recent years, China has transferred technology on such items \nas missiles, nuclear weapons, and chemical and biological weapons to \nNorth Korea, Iran, Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, and Syria, among others--\noften in direct violation of commitments to refrain from such behavior.\n  Thefts and compromises of nuclear secrets: In 1999, the Cox Report \nrevealed that China had stolen or otherwise acquired advanced U.S. \ntechnology on ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons, reentry vehicles, \nhigh performance computers, anti-submarine warfare techniques and much \nmore. It confirmed that China had acquired information on our most \nadvanced miniaturized nuclear warhead, the W-88, helping to give China \nMIRV capability--multiple warheads on a single rocket.\n\n  As I reported in a major speech on the Senate floor on June 23, 1999, \nwhat we learned is that 16 of the 17 most significant major technology \nbreaches to China revealed in the Cox Report were first discovered \nafter 1994--during the Clinton-Gore administration. And that at least 8 \nof these actually occurred during the Clinton-Gore administration.\n  I have compiled this important information in a chart that clearly \nillustrates what the Clinton-Gore administration has been trying to \ncover up for over 5 years.\n  It helps reveal the fact that Clinton and Gore have not protected \nnational security in our relations with China; that their appeasement \nof China has extended to selling, transferring, and overlooking the \ntheft of some of our most sensitive nuclear and missile-related \nsecrets. Coupled with their receipt--in the 1996 campaign--of hundreds \nof thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions from China, \nthis is a scandal of huge proportions.\n  The American people need to know the truth, but they are not going to \nget it by listening to the self-serving spin being spewed by this \nPresident and his equally culpable and subservient Vice President.\n  Exploitation of commercial arrangements to acquire technology: The \nCox Report also revealed the massive efforts China is making to acquire \nadvanced military technology through its dealings with U.S. companies \nin the commercial sphere. For example, it confirmed that through its \narrangements to launch satellites for U.S. companies such as Loral and \nHughes, China acquired technology which improved the accuracy and \nreliability of its long-range military rockets which are targeted at \nthe United States.\n  Attempts to corrupt U.S. political process: During the 1996 election \ncycle, people with close ties to the Chinese government funneled \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign contributions in \nan attempt to influence U.S. elections. The full extent of this scandal \nis not yet known. But we do know that the FBI director, Louis Freeh, \nand the hand-picked Justice Department investigator, Charles LaBella, \nbelieved it was serious enough to require the appointment of an \nindependent counsel to fully investigate. Serious questions remain \nabout the activities of John Huang, Charlie Trie, James Riady and a \nhost of others who were involved. One of the important critical \nquestions is whether national security was compromised in return for \ncampaign cash. Neither China not the Clinton Administration has \ncooperated in these investigations.\n  Violations of agreements: China has failed to abide by international \nagreements it has made in the past. For example, despite promises to \nabide by the norms of the multilateral Missile Technology Control \nRegime, China has repeatedly engaged in weapons proliferation \nactivities.\n  Human rights--repression of dissidents: The U.S. State Department \nconfirms that China's record on human rights has deteriorated in recent \nyears, that it has engaged in such activities as arrests and repression \nof political dissidents, persecution of religious expression, \nexploitation of slave labor, and forced abortions. China has never \nrepudiated its actions in brutally crushing China's democracy movement \nat Tiananmen Square in 1989 or its ethnic cleansing in Tibet.\n  These issues cannot be ignored or swept under the rug in an exclusive \npursuit of trade. Our first obligation is protecting national security. \nWe will not do it by evading the truth. Granting China permanent normal \ntrade status without any progress on these issues is appeasement. \nGranting it in the naive hope that it is going to bring about such \nprogress is a delusion.\n  Madam President, once again, I support the Thompson amendment. I \nthink most of the people who are supporting it also support PNTR. I am \ngoing to be opposing PNTR. However, I think he is addressing one of the \nmany areas where we have a problem with proliferation.\n  As I have said, I think national security must take precedence over \ntrade. Granting permanent normal trade status to China in the face of \nits openly threatened action in recent years is, I believe, \nunconscionable.\n  While Senator Thompson is correct when he talks about the problems \nwith proliferation, there are many other problems, too, which include \nChina's repeated threats against the United States and Taiwan; China's \nmassive military modernization buildup; China's proliferation of \ndangerous weapons to rogue states; China's theft of U.S. nuclear \nsecrets; China's demonstrated strategy to exploit commercial \nrelationships to acquire advanced military technology; China's attempts \nto corrupt the U.S. political system; China's violation of \ninternational agreements, and China's brutal repression of dissidents.\n  I think to ignore these actions in the belief that they can be \nseparated from what we do in our trade relationship is dangerously \nmisguided. China's trade surpluses are helping finance the regime's \nmilitary buildup, while strengthening its hold on economic and \npolitical power. Similarly, to suggest that increased trade by itself \nis going to reverse China's negative behavior is belied by recent \nhistory. Trade with China has been on the upswing. We are trading more \nwith them: Yet their behavior in security areas has grown substantially \nworse.\n  I believe America should require from China some measure of permanent \nnormalized international behavior as a prerequisite to permanent \nnormalized trade relations. Otherwise, it is predictable that the \nfavors we grant to China will be exploited to enhance its military \nbuildup, while the market-opening favors and prosperity we expect from \nChina will be much less than many in our country anticipate.\n  I emphasize that I am not philosophically opposed to free trade. I \ndid oppose NAFTA in 1994. In fact, I did it for two reasons. One was \nthat I knew what was going to happen to our infrastructure as a result \nof allowing trucks from Mexico to go through our corridors--being from \nOklahoma, we are pretty close to it, and the occupant of the Chair \nbeing from Texas, she understands this--without having to comply with \nour environmental standards, wage and hour standards, and safety \nstandards. The competition isn't open. It is not a level playing field. \nWe know that. The other reason is, it seemed to me it would damage our \ntrade deficit. If you will remember, in 1994, we had a trade surplus \nwith Mexico of $1.3 billion. It is now a $22 billion trade deficit.\n  On the other hand, I voted for the recent Africa-Caribbean trade \nbill. I am a strong supporter, along with Senator Ashcroft, of \nexempting agricultural products from the sanctions. I am very skeptical \nabout the extent to which China will actually open its markets to U.S. \nproducts. Despite tariff-lowering measures in trade agreements, China \nhas in the past sought to erect other complicated trade barriers to \nblock imports--especially with regard to agricultural products.\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\n  I think it is very unlikely that China is going to go to great \nlengths to protect its own huge labor-intensive agricultural sector \nbecause of the difficulty of absorbing displaced agricultural workers \nin scarcer city jobs. I had a chance to visit the other day with Wei \nJing Sheng. He was a dissident who was imprisoned for some period of \ntime in China. He is exiled now; he is here. He said it made perfectly \ngood sense. Why would we expect China to import wheat grown in Oklahoma \nor someplace in the United States, when all that would do would be to \ntake the very labor-intensive, antiquated technology that they use in \ntheir agricultural programs in China and then move those people to the \ncities where they can't absorb it? This individual was absolutely \nconvinced that would be the end result.\n  Permanently opening the U.S market to China now--in the face of its \nbullying at home and abroad--would be viewed by Chinese leaders less as \nan act of friendship than as an act of weakness. It would signal to \nthem that there is going to be no meaningful consequence to their bad \nbehavior and that America is content to put the pursuit of dollars \nahead of any obligation to protect its own values and security.\n  The following are some examples of the major national security issues \nthat I think should be considered in the debate over PNTR to China. Of \ncourse, this amendment only deals with one of them.\n  First of all, the threats to the United States.\n  In recent years, China has issued direct military threats against the \nUnited States of a kind that even the Soviet Union in the midst of the \ncold war would never have made. These include a threat to destroy Los \nAngeles with nuclear weapons. Another threat was to launch missile \nstrikes on the United States; neutron bomb strikes on U.S. aircraft \ncarriers if we should intervene to defend Taiwan.\n  In 1998, the CIA confirmed that at least 13 of China's 18 land-based \nICBMs were targeted on American cities. We knew it a long time before \nthat. But somehow there was a leak, and I believe the Washington Times \nwas able to disclose that.\n  In December of 1999, China's Defense Minister said war with America \nwas inevitable.\n  I hesitate to say this, but I remember so well when we were warned by \nSenator Bob Kerrey, a Democrat Senator from Nebraska. Some of you may \nnot know it. In 1992, before the election of Bill Clinton to the White \nHouse, he said Bill Clinton is an awfully good liar. He was very \nprophetic.\n  I think of all of the things this President has said that are untrue, \nprobably the one that inflicted the most damage on the United States is \nthe one he repeated 133 times. Keep in mind that at the time he said \nthis, he knew the Chinese were targeting American cities. He said: For \nthe first time in the history of the nuclear age, there is not one--I \nrepeat, not one--missile aimed at an American child tonight. Everybody \ncheered. Yet we knew at that time that missiles from China were aimed \nat American cities. They still are today. We know that. It is not even \nclassified.\n  China is engaged in a massive, long-term military modernization \nlargely designed to counter U.S. power projection capabilities. In \nMarch 2000, China announced it was going to have a 13-percent increase \nin military spending. Most of our U.S. analysts believe that is far \nfrom the true figure; it is really far greater than that. China's new \nJL-2 submarine-launched ICBM will be able to hit the United States from \nChinese territorial waters. China's new DF-31 truck-mounted mobile ICBM \nwas test-fired in August of 1999 and described by U.S. Air Force \nanalysts as ``a significant threat not only to U.S. . . . forces in the \nPacific theater, but to the continental United States and many of our \nallies.''\n  In January of 2000, China signed a multibillion-dollar deal to \npurchase weapons from Russia adding to what it already had purchased, \nincluding four heavy destroyers armed with SS-N-22 ``Sunburn'' nuclear-\ncapable cruise missiles designed specifically to attack U.S. aircraft \ncarriers; 200 SU-27 jet fighters--this is a jet fighter that we know \nnow is better than any air-to-air combat vehicle we have, including the \nF-15--40 SU-30 jet fighters with precision-guided missiles; 4 Kilo \nclass, quiet class, attack submarines; 24 MI-17 assault helicopters; \nand 50 T-72 tanks. China is also purchasing up to four airborne warning \nand control systems--AWACS systems--that they are purchasing from \nIsrael. In addition, China is employing all means legal and illegal to \npursue improvements in a whole range of advanced military technologies, \nincluding computers, lasers, space launch and space control systems; \ncyberwarfare; stealth, chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.\n\n  Let me repeat: On the SU-27 and SU-30, I was very proud of Gen. John \nJumper a few months ago when he had the courage to stand up and tell \nthe American people the truth.\n  There is this myth floating around, particularly among people who are \nanti-defense to start with, that there is no threat out there--that \nAmerica has the best of everything. We don't have the best of \neverything. Gen. John Jumper, the air commander at that time, made the \nstatement that Russia, in the position of manufacturing their SU-27s, \nSU-30s, and SU-35s and selling them on the open market to countries \nsuch as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and North Korea--this is something \nthey have. The proliferation is going on and on. They already have more \nmodern equipment and better equipment in some areas of combat than the \nUnited States has.\n  China is doing more than any other country to spread dangerous \nweapons and military technology to rogue states around the world. In \nrecent years, China has transferred technology and such items as \nmissiles, nuclear weapons, and chemical and biological weapons to all \nthe countries I just mentioned--North Korea, Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, \nIran, Syria, and other countries, which is a direct violation of \ncommitments to refrain from such behavior.\n  I guess what I am saying is China has been working. It is not a \nmatter of what they have and how you trust China. It is the same with \nRussia. They are trading technologies and trading systems with these \nother countries. That is compromising nuclear secrets.\n  The 1999 Cox report revealed that China had stolen or otherwise \nacquired advanced U.S. technology on ballistic missiles, nuclear \nweapons reentry vehicles, high-performance computers, anti-submarine-\nwarfare systems, and much more. It confirmed that China had acquired \ninformation on our most advanced miniaturized nuclear warhead, the W-\n88, helping to give China a MIRV capability--a multiple warhead on one \nsingle rocket.\n  In fairness to China, I have to say that they have had a lot of help. \nThe administration has been very helpful to China.\n  By the way, I have frequently said things about the President that \nother people do not say. I would suggest to you, Mr. President, that \nTeddy Roosevelt said ``patriotism means to stand by your country.'' It \ndoesn't mean to stand by the President or any other elected officials \nto the exact degree that he himself stands by his country. It is \nunpatriotic not to oppose a President to the same degree that he, by \ninefficiency or otherwise, fails to stand by his country. I believe \nPresident Clinton has failed to stand by his country.\n  As reported in a major speech on the Senate floor in March and again \non June 23rd, what we learned, as revealed in the Cox report, is that \nif you take away these other 17 compromises of our nuclear secrets--the \nfirst one, the W-70 warhead, you can forget about that. It happened in \nthe Carter administration. It is obsolete. So it doesn't matter. These \n16 do--at least 16, including the W-88 warhead I just referred to, \nwhich is our crown jewel. The first of these happened perhaps in a \nprevious administration. The second eight all happened during the \nClinton administration. These happened on Bill Clinton's watch. As far \nthe first ones are concerned, the W-88 warhead technology, W-87 \nwarhead, W-78 warhead, W-76 and W-62 warheads--all of these happened \nperhaps in a previous administration.\n  But we found out in the Cox report that there was a Chinese ``walk'' \ninto a CIA office where they said that in 1994 they informed the \nadministration the Chinese had all of these secrets. These are from \nperhaps other administrations. But the President knew about it.\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\nThe President covered it up. Berger and the rest of them covered it up \nuntil the Cox report, through their investigation in January of 1999, \ndiscovered that in fact these were discovered 5 years before. It was a \ncoverup until 1999.\n  I think it is an appropriate place to bring this up again just for \nthe purpose of discussing this because we have got to remind the \nAmerican people exactly what happened. All of this talk about what has \nhappened in our energy lab, all the talk about passing laws that \nsomething such as this cannot happen again--I can tell you right now, \nif you have a President of the United States such as President Clinton \nwho willfully goes out and stops the security at these laboratories--\none of his first acts after becoming President--of course there is \ngoing to be a problem. This is what this President did. In 1993, when \nhe first got into office, he removed the color-coded security badges \nthat had been used for years by the Department of Energy's weapons \nlabs. They were removed as being discriminatory. We don't want to hurt \nanyone's feelings, so we can't have color-coded badges.\n\n  Second, he stopped the FBI background checks. In 1993, the FBI \nbackground checks for workers and visitors of the weapons labs were put \non hold, dramatically increasing the number of people going into the \nlabs who had previously not had access.\n  Third, he overturned the DOE's security decision. In 1995, the \nDepartment of Energy personnel action revoking the security clearance \nof an employee found to have compromised classified information was \noverturned, giving him back his classification after it was proven he \ncompromised secrets.\n  No. 5, he rejected the FBI request for wiretaps. Since 1996, four \nrequests for wiretaps on the prime suspect in the investigation of the \nloss of information on the W-88 warhead technology were rejected. The \nsuspect was allowed to keep his job before being fired in the wake of \nnews reports in 1999, the Cox report.\n  No. 6, he leaked classified information to the media. In 1995, a \nclassified design drawing of the W-87 nuclear warhead was leaked to and \nrepresented in the U.S. News and World Report magazine. The leak \ninvestigation was stopped when it pointed directly to the Secretary of \nEnergy and this administration.\n  No. 7, President Clinton or the Clinton-Gore administration thwarted \nwhistleblowers. Career Government employees, such as the Energy \nDepartment's former Director of Intelligence, Notra Trulock, and its \nformer security and safeguards Chief, Ed McCollum, who tried to warn of \nsecurity concerns, were thwarted for years by political appointees. We \nhad hearings in the Intelligence Committee on this, and the Readiness \nSubcommittee, which I chair, of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  No. 8, the administration switched export license authority. They did \nthis in 1996, from the State Department to the Commerce Department. \nThis was over the objection of both the State and the Defense \nDepartments.\n  No. 9, he granted waivers allowing missile technology transfers. You \nmay remember the most notorious. President Clinton took a signed waiver \nto allow the Chinese to buy the guidance technology to put on their \nmissiles that was made by the Loral Corporation; their CEO was the \nsingle largest contributor to the Clinton-Gore campaigns.\n  No. 10, he ended COCOM. In 1994, the Coordinating Committee on \nMultinational Export Controls, called COCOM, the multinational \nagreement among U.S. allies to restrict technology sales to China, he \ndissolved that.\n  The list goes on and on. China had a lot of help in getting virtually \neverything that we had.\n  Exploitation of commerce, commercial arrangements to acquire \ntechnology. The Cox report revealed engagement of a massive effort by \nChina in acquiring advanced military technology through its dealings \nwith U.S. companies. We have talked about that.\n  China has it all. In the first chart, there were 16 compromises. We \ndon't know what they have done with this information. I don't think our \nintelligence knows. We now know that all 16 compromises took place and \nChina has the technology. What they have built with this technology, we \ndon't really know for sure.\n  In the attempt to corrupt the 1996 election cycle, people with close \nties to the Chinese Government funneled hundreds of thousands into \nillegal campaign contributions in an attempt to influence U.S. \nelections.\n\n  Remember the pictures of Al Gore at the temple? This full extent of \nthe scandal is not yet known, but Louis Freeh, the Director of the FBI, \nas well as the hand-picked Justice Department investigator, Charles \nLaBella, believed it was serious enough to require the appointment of \nan independent counsel to fully investigate the Clinton-Gore scandal. \nSerious questions remain about the activities of John Huang, Charlie \nTrie, James Riady, and the list goes on and on. Of course, Janet Reno \nhas refused to appoint counsel. I don't think we will hear more from \nthis administration.\n  China has failed to abide by international agreements it has made in \nthe past. For example, despite promises to abide by the norms of the \nmultinational missile technology control regime, China has engaged in \nweapons proliferation. The distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, \nwas talking about this a few minutes ago.\n  Lastly, the U.S. State Department confirms that China's record on \nhuman rights has deteriorated in recent years. It has deteriorated, not \ngotten better. Trade has increased but the relationships have \ndeteriorated. They have engaged in such activities as arrests, \nrepression of political dissidents, persecution of religious \nexpression, exploitation of slave labor, and forced abortions in China, \nand have never repudiated its actions in brutality curbing China's \ndemocracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989.\n  These issues cannot be ignored or swept under the rug exclusively, \npursuant of trade. Our first obligation is to protect our national \nsecurity. We will not try to do it by evading the truth. Granting China \npermanent normal trade status without any progress in these areas is \nappeasement. An appeaser is a guy who feeds his friends to the \nalligators hoping they will eat him last.\n  No man survives when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, \nand those who cry ``appease'' are hanged by those they try to appease.\n  In October of 1995, when we were preparing to intervene when they \nwere doing the missile tests to try to influence the elections in \nTaiwan, China's top official said: We are not concerned about the \nUnited States coming to the defense of Taiwan because they would rather \ndefend Los Angeles than defend Taipei.\n  That is, at the very least, an indirect threat at a missile coming to \nthe United States of America.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the Defense Minister of China said war with \nAmerica is inevitable.\n  When we are talking about giving a country such as this preferred \nstatus, we will not be doing it with my vote.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in March of 1999, I traveled, for the \nfirst time, to the People's Republic of China with a number of our \ncolleagues. At the end of a long flight from Detroit to Beijing, I \nlooked out the window as we were on the final approach to the airport. \nI was struck by the mass of humanity, from horizon to horizon, that lay \nbefore me. That scene underscored one of the greatest challenges in the \n21st century, and it will be that we and China together take all \nnecessary steps to work to assure and maintain peaceful relations \nbetween our peoples.\n  With almost one-quarter of the world's population within its borders, \nChina could represent the greatest threat to our Nation's national \nsecurity. However, if we maintain a sense of respect and strive for \npeace between the United States and China, and if that remains among \nthe highest priorities of U.S. diplomacy, we can continue to build the \npermanent institutional relationships that will give us the greatest \nassurance of peace in the years to come.\n  As we enter the new millennium, I can think of no better way to \ndemonstrate America's leadership than by advancing and expanding our \ntrade and investment policy with the world's most populous nation. \nBefore we discuss the details of this vote, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the enormous cooperative effort of the \nPresident, the leadership of the\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\nCongress, the agricultural communities of the United States, and many \nother citizens in support of this measure.\n  Today we are debating an amendment offered by Senator Thompson of \nTennessee. I wish to commend Senator Thompson for calling the attention \nof the Nation and of this body to the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their delivery systems. I agree that this is an issue \nthat is vital to our national security and merits the closest \nattention. This is an issue which I have personally followed through my \nwork on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment that is before us, an amendment which \nhas been entitled ``The China Nonproliferation Act,'' does not give the \nissue of proliferation the comprehensive and serious treatment which I \nbelieve it deserves. We need to do more than send a message to the \nChinese. We need to develop a comprehensive program that will \neffectively deal with the proliferation problem on a global basis. If \nour goal is to deter proliferation, it must be a global effort at \ndeterrence. Although I will oppose the Thompson amendment when we vote \non it tomorrow, I do hope we will be able to work together to develop \nlegislation that will effectively and comprehensively deal with \nproliferation.\n  As we commence this stage of the debate, it is important that each of \nus completely understand the specific issue which we are debating, the \ndetails of what the Senate is being asked to vote upon, and the likely \nconsequences of this vote.\n  Let me first describe in very simple terms the substance of the vote \nto grant permanent normal trade relations to China. In order to clarify \nthe fact that this status is not a unique or a special status, \nCongress, in 1998, passed legislation to redefine the designation, to \nredefine from the phrase ``most favored nation'' to the more \nappropriate phrase ``normal trade relations.''\n  China has had most favored nation and now normal trade relations \nstatus each year since 1979, when the United States first established \ndiplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. This status \nhas been subject to annual review and annual renewal. It is worth \nmentioning that not once in the past 21 years has China been denied \nnormal trade status.\n  Currently, the United States denies normal trade relations status to \nCuba and North Korea. That denial is required by the Jackson-Vanik \namendment to the Trade Act of 1974 because those nations deny, \nseriously restrict, or burden their citizens' right to emigrate.\n  The United States also denies normal trade relations status to \nAfghanistan, Laos, Serbia, and Montenegro, as directed by more recent \nlegislative or Presidential action.\n  It is important to note that, although economic sanctions have been \nlevied against Iran, Iraq, and Libya, these nations still legally \nretain their normal trade relations status with the United States.\n  By granting China permanent normal trade relations status, we will \nfulfill our commitments under the World Trade Organization and will \nthen be able to take advantage of the special concessions which were \nobtained from China in bilateral agreements negotiated by this \nadministration. However, if we fail to grant China permanent normal \ntrade relations status and China is granted membership in the World \nTrade Organization, every other WTO member country in the world will be \nable to take advantage of the range of benefits that we, the United \nStates, negotiated for ourselves, except the United States of America.\n  With that brief description in mind, it is important to clearly \noutline the issues that will not be affected by this vote.\n  First, we are not voting on whether or not we agree with, like, or \ntrust the Chinese Communist Government. We are simply voting on a \nchange and, in my view, an enhancement, in our 21-year economic \nrelations with China.\n  Second, we are not voting on whether or not to allow China to enter \nthe World Trade Organization. This will take place regardless of what \nactions the Senate takes on permanent NTR status.\n  Third, we are not voting on the bilateral WTO accession agreement \nbetween China and the United States. That agreement has been signed and \nwill not be changed or renegotiated.\n  Fourth, we are not voting on a trade agreement with multilateral \nconcessions like the North American Free Trade Agreement. The bilateral \nagreement this administration has already negotiated is a one-way \nagreement in which China agrees to eliminate or reduce tariffs and \nmakes other concessions to WTO members. All WTO members, including the \nUnited States, have made no concessions to China. Granting permanent \nnormal trade relations status to China does not require us to give the \nChinese any additional access to our markets. They have made all of the \nconcessions.\n  Fifth, we are not voting on any of the issues surrounding the \nrelationship between mainland China and Taiwan. In fact, the Taiwanese \nposition on this vote could not have been more clearly stated than by \nthe Taiwanese President, Chen Shui-bian, in a March 22, 2000, interview \nwith the Los Angeles Times. In that interview, the President stated:\n\n       We would welcome the normalization of U.S.-China trade \n     relations, just like we hope the cross strait relations \n     [between Taiwan and China] also can be normalized. We look \n     forward to both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan's \n     accession to the WTO.\n\n  If the United States continues to be concerned about protecting \nTaiwanese security and other interests, then should we not pay close \nattention to the strong support of the President of Taiwan for granting \nPNTR to China?\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the full text of this March 22, \n2000, Los Angeles Times interview in the Record immediately following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Finally, we will not prevent the continued importation of Chinese \nproducts to the United States by voting against this legislation. For \nexample, under the WTO agreement on textiles and clothing, U.S. import \nquotas on Asian textiles will be phased out in 2005. China is currently \nscheduled to benefit by that 2005 phaseout of Asian quotas. It is \nanticipated that this phaseout of Asian quotas will result in \nsignificant increases in imports of textiles and garments that have \nbeen manufactured and assembled generally from Asian raw materials and \ntextiles into the United States.\n\n  However, under the bilateral accession agreement, the United States \nnegotiated a special textile-specific import safeguard which will \nremain in place until the end of 2008. Therefore, by defeating this \nunderlying legislation to grant permanent normal trade relations to \nChina, we will actually be doing harm to the U.S. textile and apparel \nindustry.\n  We will not, by failure to pass this legislation, affirmatively \naddress any of the genuine concerns which have been expressed about our \nrelations with China. None of those concerns will be affirmatively \naddressed by voting against this bill. In fact, a ``no'' vote will \nresult in both tangible losses, such as the loss of the special textile \nsafeguard, as well as some important intangible losses. Killing this \nlegislation now may create the illusion that we are making a strong, \npositive statement about our relationship with China when, in fact, the \nfailure to engage China now may have much more serious negative effects \ninto the future.\n  What have we accomplished thus far? In considering this modification \nof our trade relationship with China, it is helpful to examine the \nsubstance and scope of our most recent bilateral trade negotiations.\n  First, in April of 1999, the United States and China signed a \nbilateral agricultural cooperation agreement which removed unfair trade \nbarriers to U.S. wheat, meat, citrus, and poultry products. The \nagreement signified a new era in our bilateral agricultural \nrelationship, an era based on sound science and the mutual benefits of \nopen markets.\n  When the agreement was signed, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman \nstated it was a fundamental breakthrough for American agriculture. He \nestimated that Chinese trade restrictions had cost America's \ncompetitive producers billions of dollars in sales. This agreement to \nlift longstanding and contentious barriers to our grain,\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\ncitrus, and meat would have significant benefits in terms of greatly \nexpanded exports of these products to the vast Chinese market.\n  Second, it is important to note the critical provisions of the \nbilateral WTO accession agreement signed by the United States and China \nin November of 1999. These provisions include:\n  First, on U.S. priority agricultural products, tariffs will drop from \nan average of 31 percent today to 14 percent by January of 2004, with \neven sharper declines for beef, poultry, pork, cheese, and other \ncommodities. China will significantly expand export opportunities for \nbulk commodities, such as wheat, corn, and rice, and it will eliminate \ntrade-distorting export subsidies. These are all goals that have been \nlong sought by the United States.\n  Second, the industrial tariffs on U.S. products will fall from \ntoday's average of 24.6 percent--that was the average in 1997--to an \naverage of 9.4 percent by 2005.\n  Third, China will participate in the information technology agreement \nand will eliminate tariffs on products such as computers, \nsemiconductors, and related products by 2005.\n  Fourth, under the agreement, China will phase in trading rights and \ndistribution services over 3 years and also will open up sectors \nrelated to distribution services, such as repair and maintenance, \nwarehousing, trucking, and air courier services.\n  Presently, China severely restricts trading rights and the ability to \nown and operate distribution networks, both of which are essential to \nmove goods and compete effectively in any market.\n  Fifth, the agreement opens China's market for services. For the first \ntime, China will open its telecommunications sector and significantly \nexpand investment and other activities for financial services firms.\n  It will greatly increase the opportunities open to professional \nservices, such as law firms, management consulting, accountants, and \nenvironmental services.\n  Finally, with regard to safeguards, no agreement on WTO accession has \never contained stronger measures to strengthen guarantees of free trade \nand to address practices that distort trade and investment. For \nexample, for the first 12 years of its WTO membership, China has agreed \nto a country-specific safeguard that is stronger and more targeted \nrelief than that provided under our own current section 201 law. This \nsafeguard applies to all industries, permits us to act based on a lower \nshowing of injury, and permits the United States to act specifically \nagainst imports from China.\n  The agreement includes a provision recognizing that the United States \nmay employ special methods designed for nonmarket economies to \ncounteract dumping for 15 years after China's accession to the World \nTrade Organization.\n  For the first time, Americans will have a means to combat such \nmeasures as forced technology transfer, mandated offsets, local content \nrequirements, and other practices intended to drain jobs and technology \naway from the United States.\n  However, if we fail to pass this legislation, all of these benefits--\nall of the benefits which I have just enumerated--will be lost.\n  So what is at stake? With the passage of this legislation, and \nChina's accession to the WTO, the United States stands to reap enormous \nbenefits.\n  My home State of Florida provides many excellent examples of this \npotential windfall.\n  In 1998, China was Florida's 11th largest export market. Under this \nnegotiated accession agreement, China will reduce tariffs on fresh \ncitrus by 70 percent, on vegetables by up to 60 percent, and on poultry \nby 50 percent.\n  In addition, China will substantially reduce tariffs on value-added \nwood products and will eliminate tariffs on a wide variety of \ninformation technology products and civil aircraft materials, all of \nwhich are important export industries for Florida.\n  We must accept the fact that China is going to be a member of the \nWorld Trade Organization. One obligation of the World Trade \nOrganization is to provide every other member with unconditional normal \ntrade relations status. In order for the United States to fulfill our \nWTO commitments, we must grant China permanent normal trade relations \nstatus.\n  By refusing to grant China permanent normal trade relations status, \nwe only deny benefits to ourselves. In fact, if we fail to give them \npermanent normal trade relations status, every other WTO member \ncountry--every other country in the world--will be able to take \nadvantage of the benefits that we negotiated except ourselves. Voting \nno on this measure does not deny anything to China, but it will put all \nU.S. industry and agriculture at a severe disadvantage in relation to \nour competitors around the world.\n  Furthermore, China will enjoy all the benefits of WTO membership, and \nit will still have the same access to the U.S. market that they have \nhad for 21 years.\n  As many Americans, I have been concerned about China's compliance \nwith trade agreements. In the past, it has taken intensive work to \nassure that the Chinese fully comply with the provisions of trade \nagreements that we have negotiated with them.\n\n  I am certain that compliance will continue to be an issue that will \nrequire close monitoring. It will require considerable and sustained \neffort. It is important to note that thus far, China has lived up to \nthe concessions the U.S. gained as a result of the April 1999 \nagricultural cooperation agreement.\n  For the first time in over two decades, the Chinese have opened their \nmarket to wheat from the Pacific Northwest. They have already purchased \n50,000 metric tons of wheat. In an important breakthrough for the \nFlorida citrus industry, the first shipment of fresh citrus from \nFlorida left for China during the last week of March of this year.\n  In his May 3, 2000, testimony before the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, former Commerce Secretary William Daley stated that the \nadministration intends to vigorously monitor and aggressively enforce \nthe terms of this agreement. To that end, the administration has \nrequested a $22 million budget increase to fund new compliance and \nenforcement resources for Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative's \nOffice, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the State Department.\n  He also outlined the administration's five-point plan for monitoring \nChina's compliance with its commitments and ensuring that we will get \nthe full benefits of the WTO from our bilateral agreement.\n  The plan includes: One, a rapid response compliance team, led by a \nnew Deputy Assistant Secretary for China within the Commerce \nDepartment; two, prompt redress of market access problems with tight \ndeadlines for investigating market access and commercial problems \ninside China; three, statistical monitoring of Chinese trade flows and \na special trade law enforcement program modeled on the import surge \nmonitoring program established for the steel industry; four, a \ncomparative law dialog and technical assistance to closely monitor \nChina as it amends its laws and regulations; and fifth and finally, a \nChina-specific WTO training and export promotion program to assure that \nour exporters take advantage of all the opportunities presented by \nChina's new commitments.\n  Those were the commitments made on behalf of the President and the \nadministration by the former Secretary of Commerce, William Daley. The \nnew Secretary of Commerce, Norman Mineta, restated the Department's \ncommitment to implementing such enhancements in a July 27, 2000, speech \nat the Washington International Trade Association.\n  I have asked myself this question: Is compliance better served by \ngranting or denying China permanent normal trade relations status?\n  By denying them permanent normal trade relations status, we will be \nprevented from using the dispute settlement tools that exist within the \nWTO system, tools such as the bilateral dispute mechanism, where the \nUnited States has won 23 of the 23 cases that we have pressed before \nthat panel.\n  It seems clear to me, then, that U.S. trade with China under the \nauspices of a multinational body such as the World Trade Organization \ncan be more easily monitored, with fewer political obstacles, than can \ntrade on a strictly bilateral basis.\n  In summary, the U.S. goal of an open Chinese market is more likely to \nbe\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nachieved through the WTO discipline than by unilateral actions. Denying \nChina permanent normal trade relations status gives us no additional \nleverage with the Chinese Government. In fact, it serves exactly the \nopposite purpose.\n\n  Denying China PNTR status does not in any way constrain China. They \nreceive all the benefits of any WTO member. Denying them PNTR status \nwill only hurt us, the United States of America, by preventing our \nworkers and our companies from taking advantage of the benefits that we \nhave for so long negotiated and now have achieved. This will actually \nhelp China keep our goods out of its market and make it easier for them \nto ignore compliance with the bilateral agreement. More importantly, we \nwill also deny ourselves the special surge protections that were \nnegotiated in the bilateral agreement. These surge protections are \nparticularly critical for industries such as steel.\n  Again, it seems clear we will be more likely to get compliance to the \nagreement from China by using these special surge protections and the \nWTO dispute settlement mechanism than we would without them.\n  To me, the implications of a denial of permanent normal trade \nrelations to China are clear, ominous, and negative.\n  The historical importance and gravity of this vote cannot be \noverstated. Given the current state of the world and the almost \nuniversal recognition of the United States as the lone remaining global \nsuperpower, economically, militarily, politically, culturally, the next \nPresident of the United States may well represent the most powerful \nconcentration of power in one human being in the history of this \nplanet. How he exercises such enormous power in foreign affairs will be \ncritical in shaping the future of this planet. Granting permanent \nnormal trade relations to China, working to strengthen ties between our \ntwo nations, further developing a relationship of mutual respect and \npeace are all critically important challenges which we, the world's \nsuperpower, must be ready to meet.\n  We stand on the threshold of a new and substantially improved \neconomic relationship with the People's Republic of China. By voting \nyes, we will reaffirm the leadership of the United States in matters of \ntrade and global economic expansion.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the Thompson amendment, reserving the \ncomplex issues of global proliferation to a more comprehensive measure, \navoiding the likely consequence that by the passage of the Thompson \namendment, we will kill permanent normal trade relations with China. \nRather, I urge our colleagues to vote in favor of permanent normal \ntrade relations with the People's Republic of China and, by so doing, \nvote in favor of a policy of constructive engagement, mutual respect, \nand peace among our peoples.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, March 22, 2000]\n\n            Taiwan's New President Backs Sino-American Trade\n\n                             (By Jim Mann)\n\n       Taipei, Taiwan.--In a gesture to Beijing and the Clinton \n     administration, Taiwanese President-elect Chen Shui-bian said \n     Tuesday that he hopes to see China enter the World Trade \n     Organization and have normal trade relations with the United \n     States.\n       ``We would welcome the normalization of U.S.-China trade \n     relations, just like we hope the cross-strait relations \n     [between Taiwan and China] can also be normalized,'' Chen \n     said. ``We look forward to both the People's Republic of \n     China's and Taiwan's accession to the WTO.''\n       Chen made these remarks during an hour-long exclusive \n     interview with the Times, the first he has granted since his \n     election Saturday as Taiwan's next president. He will be the \n     first leader from the Democratic Progressive Party, which has \n     in the past advocated independence for the island. Beijing \n     claims sovereignty over Taiwan.\n       Chen's support for Sino-American trade is certain to be \n     welcomed and distributed widely by supporters of the pending \n     legislation to grant China normal trade benefits in the \n     United States on a permanent basis. The bill--strongly \n     supported by the White House and the business community, but \n     opposed by organized labor--faces what could be a close vote \n     later this year in the House of Representatives.\n       Despite the friction between Taipei and Beijing on other \n     issues, Taiwan has a strong but little-recognized economic \n     interest in making sure that China has normal trade relations \n     with the United States. Many Taiwanese companies manufacture \n     on the Chinese mainland and export their products from China \n     to the U.S. market.\n       Nevertheless, over the past decade while Hong Kong leaders \n     repeatedly campaigned in Washington on behalf of unrestricted \n     U.S. trade with China, Taiwan stayed in the background. \n     Chen's praise for Sino-American trade thus represents a \n     departure from the approach of the outgoing Nationalist Party \n     government.\n       During the wide-ranging interview at his office, Chen \n     looking relaxed and speaking in Mandarin Chinese through a \n     translator, made these other points:\n       He doesn't believe that last week's bellicose attack on his \n     candidacy by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji had any impact on the \n     Taiwanese election. ``The effects were not significant,'' \n     Chen said, neither scaring voters away from him nor pushing \n     undecided Taiwanese to vote for him.\n       Despite some divisions within his own party, there is a \n     ``mainstream consensus'' in favor of Chen's own pragmatic \n     approach toward dealing with China. For example, Chen said, \n     the Democratic Progressive Party's mainstream agrees that \n     Taiwan should be willing to discuss with Beijing the idea \n     that Taiwan and the People's Republic are both part of ``one \n     China.''\n       Peace and coexistence across the Taiwan Strait will be his \n     ``top priority'' as president--more important that domestic \n     concerns such as the economy or fighting corruption. ``Only \n     with peace in the strait'' can his other goals be achieved, \n     Chen asserted.\n       Chen repeatedly came back to the theme that he is eager to \n     improve Taiwan's relations with China. He said he is trying \n     to be especially cautious as he prepares to take office.\n       ``Not only are people of Taiwan watching us,'' Chen said, \n     ``China is watching us. The whole world is watching us. And \n     history is also watching us.''\n       Yet while proclaiming his desire for peace, Chen also made \n     it plain that he doesn't think Taiwan should be intimidated \n     by China.\n       ``What we mean by peace is a very firm and free, autonomous \n     peace,'' he said. ``We don't want the peace that is weak or \n     peace that comes under pressure.''\n       Chen repeated an assurance made during this campaign that, \n     as president, he won't hold a popular referendum on whether \n     Taiwan should be independent or reunified with China. The \n     idea of such a referendum had often been proposed by leaders \n     of his party, but China vehemently opposes it.\n       Furthermore, Chen promised that, despite his party's past \n     support for independence, as president he will not declare \n     Taiwan to be independent ``unless Taiwan faces a military \n     attack or invasion from China.''\n       Asked whether he felt prepared to deal with any military \n     action or threats from China, the president-elect replied:\n       ``I believe that across the strait, leaders of both sides \n     want peace. . . . The Chinese leaders have said repeatedly \n     that `Chinese do not fight Chinese.' But if they use threats \n     or force against us, then wouldn't that phrase be \n     meaningless?''\n       Chen asserted that when leaders in Beijing threaten force \n     against Taiwan while at the same time proclaiming that \n     ``Chinese do not fight Chinese,'' their words could be \n     interpreted to mean that ``they don't see us [Taiwanese] as \n     Chinese.''\n       Although Chen said he would be willing to discuss with \n     Beijing the idea of ``one China,'' he rejected Chinese \n     President Jiang Zemin's assertion this week that Taiwan \n     should embrace ``one China'' as a precondition for talks.\n       If Taiwan accepted Jiang's idea, he said, ``it would be \n     very difficult actually to enter into discussions [with \n     China] on an equal basis.''\n       Instead, Chen suggested, perhaps the two governments could \n     reach agreement on other, smaller issues that do not define \n     Taiwan's relationship to China.\n       ``We feel that we can first put aside the differences and \n     discuss areas of agreement and cooperation,'' He said, ``And \n     maybe once these other areas of agreement are resolved or \n     improved, then we would in the process gradually overcome the \n     differences that we have and build more trust.''\n       Chen went out of his way to court the goodwill of the \n     Clinton administration. Chen praised President Clinton for \n     ``his very strong and firm rejection of [China's] threat to \n     use force'' against Taiwan.\n       He also quoted with approval Clinton's recent statement \n     that any settlement of Taiwan's future should have the \n     consent of the people of Taiwan.\n       Chen insisted that he has a sufficient mandate to govern in \n     Taiwan, even though he won the presidency with only 39% of \n     the vote. His closest rival, independent candidate James \n     Soong, won 37%, while Vice President Lien Chan of the \n     Nationalist Party, which has ruled Taiwan for 51 years, \n     garnered 23%.\n       ``In many countries, the presidents are elected with only \n     20% or 30% of the vote,'' Chen said. ``[Former President \n     Fidel] Ramos of the Philippines had 20-something percent. \n     Former South Korean President Roh Tae Woo only had 30-\n     something percent, and President Kim Dae Jung had roughly \n     40%. But this did not affect their ability to govern.\n       ``In the same way. President Kennedy defeated his opponent \n     by only 0.1% of the vote, and that was 110,000 votes, which \n     is a very small number compared to the population of the U.S. \n     But this did not affect his ability to govern effectively.''\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\n       Chen is clearly hoping to broaden his political appeal \n     beyond his party base.\n       ``Although I am a very proud member of the Democratic \n     Progressive Party, and I hope to continue to contribute to \n     this party and the democratic values it represents, as \n     president of Taiwan or as the national leader, I am the \n     leader not just of the DPP but of the entire nation,'' he \n     said.\n       ``And therefore, the national interest must come before \n     partisan interests or individual interests. When there is a \n     conflict of interest between the national interest and party \n     interests, I must consider first the national interest.''\n       At the end of the interview, Chen--the son of an \n     impoverished family in rural Taiwan who entered politics as a \n     lawyer for imprisoned Taiwanese dissidents--said he never \n     imagined he would become president.\n       ``I didn't even dream of it,'' he said. ``Growing up, when \n     I was small, I was so poor, and we were under such hardship, \n     that my first dream was to become an elementary school \n     teacher.''\n       Moreover, he continued, ``after I started taking part in \n     politics, I did not imagine that one day, the president of \n     Taiwan would be directly elected. [And] two years ago, when I \n     lost the reelection bid for Taipei mayor, I did not know if I \n     could stand up again.\n       ``The spirit of Taiwan is going from having nothing to \n     creating, and from the bottom to the top.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I compliment the occupant of the chair for being so \npatient at this late hour.\n  I rise to speak on behalf of permanent trade relations with China and \nin support of H.R. 4444, which is PNTR for China. I come to this body, \nafter some 20 years, no stranger to China, having traveled there on \nnumerous occasions, more recently a journey down the Yangtze River to \nobserve the controversial construction of the building of the Three \nGorges Dam. It has been a great concern by America's environmental \ncommunity as to the legitimacy of this project. It will be one of the \nlargest construction projects in the world.\n  But looking back at what we did in the United States in the 1930s \nwith the TVA project, the flood control, the power generation, what we \nhave done in the Columbia River system, it is very much in parallel to \nwhat China is attempting to do: flood control, power generation, and \ncleaning up their air.\n  It is interesting to reflect on the experience of U.S. participation \nin this project. The Eximbank believed that the project did not meet \nits environmental examination sufficiently so it exempted any U.S. \nfirms from participating in the sense of funding two Chinese \ncontractors to buy American equipment. As a result of the inability of \nthe Eximbank to get a clearance on the environmental consequences and \nadequacy, there was no U.S. construction material that went into this. \nAs a consequence, Caterpillar alone lost over $1 billion in sales.\n  I point this out to reflect on the merits of the current debate on \ncertain restrictions that we should or should not have in association \nwith PNTR for China. I know there is a great deal of interest in the \nbusiness community. Some see it as a great opportunity. I see it as \nincremental gains for American businesses in the near term. But unlike \nmany in the business lobby, my own feeling is that it is going to take \na period of time. In my own State of Alaska, we may see some gains in \nagricultural and seafood exports, but for the most part, it is going to \ntake a number of years to build up this trade. The question comes to \nmind: Are the gains worth the hew and cry this bill is bringing about \nand the extensive debate?\n  I have a little different view. Why, if I am not necessarily swayed \nby the arguments of the business community, do I rise in support of \nPNTR? As with most of my colleagues, I spent a good deal of time \nconsidering the merits of the debate. I have heard the arguments on \nboth sides. I continue to listen carefully to the amendments proposed \nand the considered opinions of my colleagues, which I respect. \nFurthermore, as a member of the Finance Committee, I have discussed the \nsubject. We have had debates as it played out over the course of the \npast weeks. I noticed throughout this time a reoccurring theme from \nboth opponents and supporters of the bill.\n  We have tended throughout the course of these many months and \nwhenever we have discussed China, either on the floor or in the \ncommittee, to refer to China as some sort of a monolith. We say China \nbrutalizes her people. We say China represses religious freedom. We say \nChina is the world's greatest proliferator of weapons of mass \ndestruction, or we say we should not reward China for her misconduct by \npassing PNTR.\n  Occasionally, we are guilty in this body of painting in broad brush \nstrokes. We have a tendency to generalize. We use verbal shortcuts. We \nsay ``China'' when we mean China's Government or even certain members \nof China's Government.\n  In this instance, however, our reference to a monolithic China is not \nonly misplaced, it goes to the heart of the fundamental \nmisunderstanding regarding this bill. PNTR does not reward the Chinese \nGovernment. PNTR does not help the Chinese Government maintain \nrepressive control. Passage of this bill, as has been pointed out, will \nnot mean that China gets into WTO. They will get into WTO whether we \nvote for PNTR or not.\n  We are voting instead on a basic question of U.S.-China policy, \nwhether trade with China is in America's national interest.\n  We talk a lot about the messages this vote will send to the Chinese \nGovernment. The message we should send is that we believe trade between \nAmerican and the Chinese people should be fostered and should be \nstrengthened. As I said at the outset, I do not believe American \nbusiness interests are our primary concern in this matter. American \nforeign policy interests trump business interests in this matter.\n  So what is our primary foreign policy interest in China? Our primary \nforeign policy interest in China is to see the democratization of \nChina. At the heart of this bill is nothing more than the formal \nrecognition of the profound economic effect and shift in China which \nhas occurred since 1979, when we first began the annual debate over our \ntrade relationship with China.\n  In 1979, China's economy was dominated by Government-owned, \nGovernment-managed companies. This is the point that justifies my \nposition on supporting PNTR, because we have seen a change since 1979, \nwhen the economy was dominated by Government-owned, Government-managed \ncompanies. Virtually 100 percent of China's gross national product at \nthat time was derived from the industrial and commercial activities of \nnot private enterprise but of Government. Private enterprise simply \ndidn't exist at that time. That is not the case anymore.\n\n  Twenty years after we began normal trade relations with China, \nprivate enterprise not only exists today in China but now it dominates \nthe Chinese economy. The private sector accounts for nearly 70 percent \nof China's economic output, compared with just 30 percent for the \nGovernment-owned sector.\n  Normal trade relations with China are not the same as they were in \n1979--again, that is my point--when all trade flowed through the \nChinese Government. At that time, if we had said ``PNTR for China,'' we \nwould have meant PNTR for the Chinese Government. Now the vast majority \nof trade with China is between private enterprise here and private \nenterprise there. PNTR means normal trade relations between American \nand Chinese peoples.\n  Now, an ever-increasing number of Chinese do not depend on the \nChinese Government for their livelihoods, as they did back in 1979. By \njoining the World Trade Organization, China's reformers are attempting \nto add to the ranks of the private sector and deal a final blow to the \nbloated, anticompetitive, and inefficient state-owned enterprises.\n  The overwhelming consensus of experts on China's political economy is \nthat China's attempt to join the WTO is a tactic to pressure the \nremaining state-owned enterprises to either privatize or fail. As such, \nthe Chinese Communist Party is, in effect, making the ultimate \nadmission that communism, for its practical purposes, is dead. Voting \nfor PNTR is, in effect, recognition that the China of the year 2000 is \na China of unprecedented economic self-determination--economic freedom \nfor individual Chinese people.\n  Well, some of the skeptics say, big deal; Chinese citizens may have \ngreater economic freedom, but they lack political freedom. That is \ntrue; I concede that. They say the Chinese lack religious freedom. True \nenough. They say the Chinese are unable to freely organize labor \nunions. True again. But to\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\nsay that PNTR will only strengthen the hand of China's Government I \ndon't think is a credible argument.\n  The Chinese Communist Party is betting China can have a modern, \nefficient, capitalist economy, one that generates significant tax \nrevenue, without giving up any political control. They are gambling \nthat Chinese citizens will be happy to earn a better living and will be \nhappy to pay taxes unquestioningly to their Government. That is the \ndifference. This is a profound shift in a country in which the \nGovernment was responsible to support its citizens, rather than the \ncitizens responsible to support the Government. That is a big change, \nMr. President.\n  For years, China's governmental revenues have come directly from \nstate-owned companies. That is where the revenue has come from. The \nprofits of these enterprises go directly to the Government to fund its \nactivities. But state-owned enterprises, as I have said, are inherently \ninefficient and are failing badly--more than 50 percent of them are de \nfacto insolvent; they are broke; they cannot now provide the Chinese \nGovernment with the funds it needs.\n  For this reason, China's reformers have been pushing for a market \neconomy led by a robust private sector--the private sector which will \nnot deliver its profits directly to the Government but will, through \nits companies and employees, pay taxes to that Government. These days, \nentrepreneurs are not paid by the Government; they pay to the \nGovernment. For the first time in the history of the People's Republic \nof China, the Government relies more on its citizens than its citizens \nrely on their Government.\n\n  Is taxation without representation a good bet for the Chinese \nGovernment? It seems to me we know a little about that here. We have \nhad a few lessons from our own history that would be instructive to the \nChinese Government. My own bet is that there is no better catalyst for \ndemocracy than a group of irate taxpayers.\n  Does supporting PNTR suggest that the Senate approves of the Chinese \nGovernment's actions to suppress freedom, organized labor, bully \ndemocratic Taiwan, or engage in missile proliferation? Not one bit. \nPNTR is nothing more than a recognition of the strides toward economic \nfreedom the Chinese people have made. PNTR supports the Chinese people \nin their quest to break free of the yoke of communism.\n  What happens if we don't grant PNTR? Will the Chinese people applaud \nus for standing up for their rights? Will the Chinese people recognize \nthat we believe our refusal to grant PNTR strikes a blow for political \nor religious freedoms?\n  No. The Chinese people will take it as a slight, a sense that we do \nnot somehow want them to develop the economic freedoms that we in the \nUnited States enjoy today, a sense that the United States is the enemy \nof China's development. The Chinese Government, which has no longer any \nideological claim to power, will employ this sense of U.S. antagonism \nto fuel the fires of Chinese nationalism. In our rush to help save the \nChinese people from their Government, we will ourselves be the \ninstrument of their further repression.\n  Let us not choose that course. Let us recognize that this bill \nencourages the growth of relations between Chinese and American \ncitizens and vote to support PNTR.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I understand my colleague from Minnesota \nshortly will be wanting to take the floor. When he is ready, I will \naccede to him. In the meantime, I thought I would make a couple of \nobservations.\n  As the Chair knows, I have introduced this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Torricelli and myself because of our concern of what is \nhappening in the world, especially with regard to China, at a time when \nwe are entering into a new trade relationship with them. Our strong \nbelief is that we cannot ignore the one thing they do that poses a \ndirect threat to this Nation, and that is a continued pattern of \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and selling those items \nto rogue nations which, in turn, pose a threat to us--the very reason \nwe say we need a missile defense system.\n  So we have put down the amendment, and there is strong opposition \nagainst it by some in the business community--frankly, some who really \ndon't have any dogs in this fight, but who have been told they do, or \nthink they do, and therefore they oppose it. There will be a handful of \npeople who would even theoretically be affected by this legislation. It \nis not a broad parade-dampening situation. It is WTO-compliant. The \nonly ones affected would be the ones selling armaments and munitions \nand dual-use items. Even then, the President has discretion to cut \nthose items off if he wants. That is the limited focus, despite what \nyou might hear all day. That is the limited focus of this legislation.\n  I have sat here and listened to my colleagues who have problems with \nthis legislation, and they say it will kill PNTR, which it will not. It \nis an insult to this body to say we have to adopt the House bill \nexactly the way the House did it--a House bill that addressed things \nsuch as labor concerns, Radio Free Asia, and others. They sent it over \nhere, and now we are told we can't address proliferation which, with \nall due respect, I think should have somewhat of a more elevated status \nthan the things the House addressed. I can't think of anything more \nimportant than the safety and welfare of this Nation.\n  I have been listening to the concerns expressed, and it is quite \nclear that the opponents have not gotten together and plotted any \nstrategy on this because some of them say our amendment is too broad \nand some say our amendment is not broad enough--if we focused in on \nthree countries. And we should be focusing in on more.\n\n  Some say that if we pass this unilateral legislation with unilateral \nsanctions there will be terrible ramifications; that it will have \nramifications with regard to our foreign policy and with regard to our \nallies; that we will set back the cause of freedom and set back the \ncause of peace.\n  Others point out that we already have numerous unilateral sanctions \nand laws on the books; that they work; and that they have been somewhat \nsuccessful depending on which ones you are talking about. Even Sandy \nBerger said that.\n  Some opponents have said that our legislation ties the President's \nhands. But other opponents say that the amendment is defective because \nyou can't force the President to do anything under this bill because he \nhas a Presidential waiver. Of course, they are correct.\n  Some say that it makes our allies angry while others say our allies \nwill be more than willing to be there to sell what we refuse to sell. \nSome say we have real proliferation problems, and yet they can see \nnothing that has worked so far. Others claim all we need to do is \nengage in diplomacy, and that will work. We have a myriad of \ncontradictions.\n  I think the bottom line is that there is opposition in search for a \nrationale because a lot of people do not want to do anything that they \nthink might irritate the leaders in the Chinese Government at this \nparticular point because they in some way, without being able to put \ntheir finger on it--even though it is very limited and even though it \ngives the President discretion, nothing can happen until he makes a \nfinding and even then he has a waiver. The rest of it is totally \ndiscretionary. Even under those circumstances, nothing happens until a \ncompany has been found to be a proliferator and a threat to our Nation, \nin effect. Even in light of all of that, there is a vague feeling that \nthis in some way may complicate the trade deal. That is why I said I \nhope we never get into the position in this country where our friends \nand allies and enemies perceive us to be more interested in trade than \nin our own national security.\n  There have been several inaccurate representations with regard to \nwhat to do with us. I mention the discretion the President has. Some \nsay we have to take people out of our capital markets\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nand close our capital markets down to them. It is one of a list of \nthings the President has the discretion to do. He probably has the \ndiscretion to do it now anyway.\n  The Deutch Commission of distinguished Americans--Democrats and \nRepublicans, former Members of this body, the House and others, \nincluding scientists--points out that we really ought to look at our \ncapital market situation and the fact that known proliferators are \nraising billions of dollars in our capital markets from Chinese \ncompanies; billions of dollars in our capital markets to, in some \ncases, go back and use those funds to enhance their own military. That \nis the Deutch Commission. So we said this should be, if it is not \nalready, something that the Chinese know about. Put it down in black \nand white. They should know that the President specifically has that \nauthority. If he determines a particular company, after it has been \nfound to have been selling weapons of mass destruction to our enemies \nand people who pose a threat to us--after that finding has been made, \nand after the decision has been made by the President not to exercise a \nwaiver, if then the President chooses to tell that company it can't \nraise money in our capital markets, he ought to have the discretion to \ndo that. Some will say: Well, they can go elsewhere. Maybe they will.\n\n  But if it was that easy you would not be seeing the kind of \nresistance and commotion now, even because of the potential threat that \nthe President might exercise that kind of waiver.\n  We saw the China petro offer not too long ago. It was a precursor. \nThey are looking. There are other major Chinese entities looking at our \ncapital markets and ready to come forth with offerings that will raise \nbillions of dollars. It is important to them. There are other markets, \nbut there are not other markets such as the ones we have. And American \ninvestors, American investors could go abroad. But it is important to \nthem.\n  That is the point. There is no inherent right of the People's \nRepublic of China or companies related to them or controlled by them to \nhave access to our capital markets.\n  One item, one potential, so as not to be trade related--it is not a \ntrade sanction bill the way some people have thought in times past--is \nthe low standard of evidence. Some of my colleagues, I don't think, \nhave read the bill quite as carefully as they might. I think the \nimplication has been that based upon credible evidence the President \ncould impose sanctions. That is not accurate. Based upon credible \nevidence, if a company is found to have been proliferating, they must \nreport. Then the President can look at that report and make his \ndetermination, and Congress will have access to that report, too.\n  They talk about mandatory sanctions. There is nothing mandatory about \nthem in the strict sense of the word. When it comes to countries and it \nis only strictly discretionary when it has to do with a company, the \nPresident has to make a determination. Then, as I say, he has a waiver \non the back end.\n  They are still talking about another misapprehension. As articulated \ntoday, they are still talking about agriculture and small business. \nThere are no agricultural concerns anymore in this legislation. We \nremoved any concern. However, my friend from Wyoming today said that \nsome of his people in the farm community were concerned that if we did \nanything to irritate the Chinese they might retaliate against us and \nthey might do it with regard to farm items.\n  I can't help my friend there. I don't think that is a farmer's \nconcern. The farmers I know would be primarily concerned about China \nand Russia and North Korea selling weapons of mass destruction to these \nrogue nations. If we did something to stop that, and that in some \nindirect way caused China to turn its back on the $69 billion a year \ntrade surplus advantage they have, which is highly unlikely, I don't \nthink they would think that was a bad thing.\n  I think my colleague from Minnesota is prepared now. If that be the \ncase, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nThompson-Torricelli amendment, both in principle and, as all amendments \nto PNTR, this one is a killer that will delay PNTR until another \nCongress. I appreciate what they are trying to accomplish but disagree \nwith the direction.\n  Despite what you have heard, this is a very controversial amendment \nthat carries more of a political message than is a legislative proposal \nthat would accomplish its purpose. This legislation has not gone \nthrough the committee process, nor has it been thoroughly analyzed by \nmany Members of this body. I urge my colleagues to read the latest \nversion carefully before we vote--there have been four versions of this \nlegislation, the last one presented this morning.\n  I agree we should work with China to reduce its proliferation, just \nas we should work with all countries which proliferate. And I believe \nthe President should exercise his authority under the 11 statutes we \nhave now to sanction when that is necessary. I am not ready to give up \non bilateral efforts and existing laws, especially as we are close to a \nnew administration. This legislation is simply not appropriate since we \ndon't know how the new administration will address nonproliferation.\n  Recently Alan Greenspan commented at a hearing I attended that he \nopposes this legislation. Chairman Greenspan noted ``. . . there is a \nvery serious question as to whether it will produce indeed what is \nsuggested it will produce.'' He went on, ``But most importantly, to the \nextent that we block foreigners from investing or raising funds in the \nUnited States, we probably undercut the viability of our own system. \nBut far more important is I'm not even sure how such a law would be \neffectively implemented because there is a huge amount of transfer of \nfunds around the world.'' He says, ``the only thing that strikes me as \na reasonable expectation is it can harm us more than it would harm \nothers.''\n  This again begs the question of an amendment that could actually be \ncounterproductive to our efforts to curb Chinese proliferation?\n  Before I discuss my concerns about this amendment more specifically, \nI want to address charges I have heard against those of us who oppose \nthis legislation. We are accused of being pawns of the business and \nagriculture communities. We are accused of not caring about nuclear \nproliferation. Some of us are accused of opposing the Thompson-\nTorricelli legislation because Senator Thompson has blocked some \nlegislation we strongly supported. We have been accused of \nmisrepresenting the amendment. The Senator has the right to question \nlegislation or oppose it; so do I and others who oppose the approach of \nthis amendment. I will state as firmly as I can--every position I take \nin the Senate is based on policy--not on politics, not on \ncontributions, not on retribution--not on anything but whether the \nlegislation is good policy and whether it can accomplish its purpose. \nThis fails on both counts.\n  At the same time, I respect my colleagues' belief that \nthis legislation can accomplish its purpose. They firmly believe it \ntakes a ``club 'em over the head'' approach to achieve any progress \nwith China. I respect their right to that analysis, but very strongly \ndisagree. And I strongly urge all of you to look at this legislation \nfrom a policy perspective, and nothing more. This is why we were sent \nhere--not to punish a country which has leaders we don't agree with; \nnot to vote for something that balances our PNTR vote; not to send a \nmessage to an outgoing administration.\n\n  I share some of the concerns you will hear today about this \nadministration's China policy. If there was evidence of proliferation \nthat violated international agreements, it should be pursued under \nexisting laws. But to pass new, tougher laws because one administration \nmay not have been tough enough--particularly at the end of the \nadministration--is surely ill-advised and inappropriate. We have no \nreason to believe that either Presidential candidate would not use \nexisting laws to their full intent. I am especially concerned about \nthis because of my own optimism that the Presidency will change \nparties, and I don't want the new administration's hands to be tied so \nseverely in this way. Some have termed the broad congressional \nauthority under this legislation as contrary\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nto the President's authority as Commander in Chief under the \nConstitution.\n  Many of you are aspiring Presidential candidates in the future. I ask \nyou, Would you want this severe limitation on your authority as \nPresident?\n  Mr. President, many of us sat down and tried to come up with a way to \nachieve a compromise with the sponsors when they tried to bring this \namendment up before. This is now the fourth draft of the original \nThompson-Torricelli legislation, and you have heard earlier today that \nit answers all of our concerns. There were some improvements, but many \nnew issues of concern have been added, and the core problems remain. \nClearly, proponents and opponents are still very far apart on this \nissue, and I do not believe it should be considered here today without \ncommittee hearings and action.\n  Let's take a look at where we are with China on proliferation. We \nhave a long way to go, but we shouldn't leave the impression that there \nhas been no progress. We have just started talks again on \nnonproliferation after the Chinese called off our dialogue due to their \nconcerns about the bombing of their embassy in Belgrade. Before that \ntime, we had made some progress with China on sales to Iran. China has \nalso followed up on various intelligence reports of proliferation. They \nhave worked with U.S. officials to develop an export control system, \nand have admitted they need help administering an effective system as a \ndeveloping nation with many people, many companies and many \nopportunities for proliferation that may or not be intended. We can \nhold their feet to the fire by providing support to help them improve--\nor by enforcing existing laws if necessary.\n  China has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, the Zangger Committee and has committed to adhere \nto the Missile Technology Control Regime guidelines. I believe it has \nthe will to improve. I also believe it has security concerns of its own \nthat must be factored in. It has an alliance with Pakistan and it has \nconcerns about how our missile defense system might affect their own \nsecurity interests. Whether we agree with those positions or not, we \ncannot expect other countries not to be concerned when we improve our \nown security--or when other nations do so. I still believe engagement \nbetween two countries that have differences works better when both \ncountries act out of respect for each other. When we work with others \nrather than dictating what the results should be and when. To threaten \na country's sovereignty rights by imposing sanctions for proliferation \nwe may not even be able to prove only promotes an adversarial \nrelationship that will achieve no progress.\n\n  Will an adversarial relationship continually worsened by an annual \nproliferation report which includes ``credible information'' of \nproliferation with an automatic expedited congressional review \noverturning a President's decisions not to sanction have any impact \nwhatsoever on China's will to improve? Especially after China thought \nPNTR would bring an end to the annual review? Thompson-Torricelli \ncontinues the annual review and will make it easier for the Congress to \nsanction.\n  Before the embassy bombing, we saw some good signs China did want to \nimprove. That can start again, but not if this legislation represents \nthe terms under which we will request improvement. This approach would \nthreaten any country's sovereignty--and China has just as many of those \nconcerns as we do. In fact, its long history probably makes them more \nconcerned about how to respond to world powers wielding huge clubs.\n  Further, U.S. leadership is jeopardized since no other country is \nlikely to follow our lead, and I believe the U.S. should be a leader on \nproliferation issues. Other countries will also strongly object to the \nextraterritorial reach in the Thompson amendment. The amendment covers \ncommercial items not controlled under existing multilateral \narrangements. Therefore, the U.S. alone will decide whether these \nagreements have been violated by both adversaries and allies.\n  My concerns about this legislation are many--and most of them would \ncontinue no matter how many concessions are made by the authors.\n  First--unilateral sanctions do not work. Each year the President \nwould submit a report to Congress detailing proliferation by companies \nand governments. His standard for identifying proliferation is \n``credible information.'' By no means can this be defined as proof of \nproliferation. The President then would either impose the mandatory \nsanctions on the persons, companies, or government entities or indicate \nwhy he has not done so. The report also includes sales to Chinese \ncompanies which ``contributed to the design, development, production'' \nof nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. That could draw in a lot of \ncompanies--contributed is a very broad term. A ``contribution'' could \nbe unknowing and it may not even be material to developing a weapon or \nmissile. Also in the report, the President would list noncompliance \nwith international agreements, with export control laws by covered \ncountries, which, if not sanctioned through a national security waiver, \ncould result in a congressional sanction of the entire country--whether \nor not that country was attempting to help improve its nonproliferation \nrecord, laws and enforcement of its laws. It would also include a \nreport on the Commerce Department's role in exporting licensing and \npost-shipment verifications--inferring Congress could also quickly \nreverse some of these decisions. To make matters worse, the report \nwould include technology transfers the CIA determines would have ``a \nsignificant potential to make a contribution to the development'' of \nnuclear, biological or chemical weapons.\n\n  Now the CIA is making policy under a fairly low evidentiary standard \nthat could result in congressional action overturning any Presidential \ndecision not to sanction, other than a national security waiver.\n  This report, what is included in it, what is sanctioned under what \nevidentiary standard and what is not, opens up a can of worms we should \nnot be considering here today in a floor amendment. To say trade \nsanctions are not included is simply inaccurate.\n  Second--if the President chooses not to sanction, determining the low \nevidentiary standard of ``credible information'' cannot prove a \nnational security risk in certain instances, there is an automatic \ncongressional review, if 20 Senators agree, which would provide \nexpedited congressional procedures that would allow Congress to quickly \noverturn any alleged proliferation in the report that is not \nsanctioned, thus putting Congress in the business of routinely \nsanctioning persons, companies or the government of China, Russia, or \nNorth Korea. This raises serious constitutional concerns and would \nallow Congress to politicize these decisions. This revised Thompson-\nTorricelli amendment exempts congressional review of alleged \nproliferation exempted from sanctions under the President's national \nsecurity waiver authority which is an improvement.\n  Congress cannot take the time to fully analyze these matters, no \nmatter how much we would like that to happen. And since most of our \npersonal staff doesn't have access to the highest clearance, we would \nrely on the advice of a very few staffers to make these very sensitive \nforeign policy decisions normally made by the President.\n  At a recent Foreign Relation Committee hearing, even Elliott Abrams, \nan opponent of PNTR, indicated it was bad policy to have this kind of \nlegislative review. He also opposed the insufficient waiver authority \nand thought the legislation should be broadened to more countries.\n  Next--this amendment started out focusing just on China--even though \nthere are other proliferators. Senator Thompson, after reviewing this \ncriticism, broadened it to include North Korea and Russia, but still \ntitles the bill the ``China Nonproliferation Act''. He claims after the \nthird draft that his bill covers all countries, but it only covers \n``key'' countries as determined by the CIA--once again we are letting \nthe CIA dictate policy. I recall some of the past mistakes when CIA had \ntoo great a role in policy decisions.\n  This legislation should include all countries, not just a couple, and \nnot just ``key'' countries. No country should be exempt if there are \nproliferation concerns.\n  It is only after I concluded this legislation would not accomplish \nits purpose of curbing proliferation that I object to the way \nunilateral sanctions\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nwould harm American workers and farmers. The actual sanctions under \nthis legislation harm our workers despite what the authors claim. China \nwould buy from other countries, not us, and the U.S.-China WTO \nagreement would be ignored. There are plenty of other countries willing \nto step in and take our share of this market from us. The claims that \nagriculture is exempted from the sanctions is meaningless, as \nagriculture exports from the U.S. would be the first point of \nretaliation by China if we impose sanctions.\n\n  The author claims there are no mandatory trade sanctions. However, I \nbelieve my constituents who produce dual-use items and sell under Ex-Im \nBank programs would strongly differ with that statement.\n  While the latest draft claims that sanctions against countries are \ndiscretionary, the ability of the Congress to impose sanctions on \ncountries listed in the reporting requirements as violators definitely \ncould result in countries being sanctioned, if not by the President, by \nthe Congress under the congressional review. Further, the definition of \n``persons'' subject to mandatory sanctions still includes government \nentities, so it seems clear to me that countries still are covered.\n  Mandatory sanctions would prohibit the sales of dual-use exports and \nU.S. assistance, including Ex-Im Bank programs. The discretionary \nsanctions against countries include scientific and academic exchanges \nas well as rule of law and human rights programs--programs that help us \nachieve progress with China in many areas of difference. Access to U.S. \nfinancial markets, all of which will seriously harm U.S. exporters, \nand, again serve no purpose since those sanctions will just force China \nto trade with other nations, risking the jobs of many American workers.\n  As noted earlier, the President would also include on his annual list \nthose who ``contribute to'' proliferation which could easily catch U.S. \ncompanies, as well as those in other countries, which export commercial \nitems that are not controlled under multilateral agreements yet many \nend up being used in the design or production of nuclear weapons \nwithout the exporter's knowledge. The standard used under existing \nnonproliferation laws for sanctions is there would be a ``knowing'' \ntransfer of technology that makes a ``direct and material \ncontribution'' to weapons of mass destruction development, production \nor use. This is a major weakening of our current standard that could \nsanction many companies in the U.S. by cutting off their exports of \ndual-use items, some of which may have been diverted to an illegal end \nuser without knowledge of the U.S. seller. Also, U.S. exports of nearly \nanything could be determined as ``contributing to the design, \ndevelopment, production,'' etc. of nuclear weapons. While the \nlegislation claims to only cut off our exports to companies in China \nengaging in proliferation, the ``contribution to'' standard is very \nbroad indeed, and at the very least could sanction companies engaging \nin joint ventures in China and Russia. And of course the Congress, in \nits expedited review, could well choose to cut off all exports of \ncertain items without much debate or consideration.\n  While the authors claim to only sanction under existing multilateral \nexport control arrangements, the ``contribute to'' standard could reach \nfar beyond these agreements, as discussed previously.\n  The revised version claims to only enforce China's international \nnonproliferation commitments, but it lists the Missile Technology \nControl Regime annex which China has not agreed to implement. There are \nbilateral discussions addressing this matter which I hope will result \nin China agreeing to abide by the MTCR annex but the claim made by the \nauthors is not accurate.\n\n  Again, the President has sanctions authority under the Arms Export \nControl Act, Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare \nElimination Act, IEEPA which currently covers our dual use export \ncontrol laws, Export-Import Bank Act, Arms Control and Disarmament Act, \nIran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act, Nuclear Proliferation Prevention \nAct, 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act, Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal 2000, and the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. China was \nsanctioned by President Bush in 1991 and by President Clinton in 1993 \nand 1997. I agree with Senator Thompson that these laws should be used \nto address proliferation by all countries.\n  This legislation, for the first time, draws the SEC into \nnonproliferation policy by requiring it to come up with guidelines and \nregulations regarding notification of investors of any company listed \nin the report which have securities that are either listed or \nauthorized for listing on one of our exchanges. Notice of listing would \nhave to be included in all filings or statements submitted to the SEC. \nThis would include companies the President has chosen not to sanction \nbecause progress is being made, or when he has exercised his national \nsecurity waiver. This, too, is an extremely controversial new \ngovernment mandate that brings the SEC into an area it knows nothing \nabout and is an expansion of its authority that would be opposed by \nmany of us.\n  The revised version would also tie the President's hands on Russian \nand North Korean foreign policy matters.\n  This legislation would involve the jurisdictions of four different \ncommittees, yet it also has many references to dual-use exports, which \nis the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. There is no reference to \nthe Banking Committee in this legislation, yet supporters of the bill \nclaim Banking Committee members are opposing this legislation due to \ndifferences with the authors of this bill. By refusing to involve \nSenators with committee jurisdiction in consideration of this \nlegislation, or by reference in this amendment, I believe it is clear \nthe problem is in the other direction.\n  There are, I believe, inconsistencies in the way this bill is \ndrafted. There are too many to justify considering this amendment \nwithout ample hearings and committee markup. The second, third and \nfourth drafts of the bill do not solve concerns raised in the original \nS. 2645. In fact, they have raised even more concerns and new issues.\n  Because of these concerns, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Again, I want to say I appreciate the Senator's intent, but I just \ndisagree with the direction of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Let me address a couple of points my colleague has \nmade. In terms of the numerous references to second, third, and fourth \ndrafts, these, of course, were attempts to address some of the concerns \nthat opponents of the amendment were raising; the implication being, if \nwe could and would be willing to address those concerns, that we might \nenjoy some support for the amendment.\n  Of course, as we addressed those concerns, the goalposts kept being \nmoved, and we soon realized that even after all these things that were \noriginally addressed when raised, it was impossible to satisfy the \ncritics of the amendment because basically they did not want to do \nanything to irritate the leadership of the People's Republic of China \nat this delicate moment when we are about to give them permanent normal \ntrade relations.\n  As to the hearings, there have been about 60 hours of hearings with \nregard to proliferation issues. There have been 30 hours in the \ncommittee I chair, the Governmental Affairs Committee. I point out the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee spoke on this legislation \ntoday and strongly endorses this legislation.\n  I thought at least we could agree on the nature of the problem \npersistently and consistently without apology presented by the \nleadership in the People's Republic of China, but now it seems that \nsome think the PRC leadership just needs help in order to be better \npeople; that we are impinging upon the PRC's authority; that we might \nbe doing something that might in some way be interpreted as being \nunfair to the leadership of the PRC; that we are requiring too much in \na report; that we might identify some Chinese company that might in \nsome way later on be determined, even though there is credible \nevidence, to be innocent, even though we broadened it at the request of \nthe detractors of the amendment to include other countries.\n  There is still concern that the word ``China'' appears in the title \nand that\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nthe leadership in the Chinese Government presumably are going to be \nupset because of that and, therefore, we should not do anything about \nit.\n  My colleague from Minnesota takes the Chinese position with regard to \nwhether or not they agreed to the annex to the Missile Technology \nControl Regime. My understanding is that our Government and the best \nevidence is that they agreed to the MTCR. They are coming back and \nsaying they did not agree to the annex. That is not a position I \nthought we were taking in this Nation.\n  There is concern there might be a requirement to report these \nproliferating companies to the SEC; the SEC does not know anything \nabout giving information to investors, which, of course, is not the \ncase.\n  I guess we have greater problems than even I thought because I \nthought that while certainly we can have disagreements on the best way \nto approach this, now I find that some of us apparently do not even \nhave any problems with the activities from the People's Republic of \nChina over these last few years.\n  I wonder where my colleagues were when the Rumsfeld Commission came \nout 2 years ago and talked about this threat. Where was everybody when \nthe Deutch Commission, the bipartisan group of former Members of this \nbody and former Members of the House, scientists, and experts in the \narea, talked about this threat and talked about the fact that, as late \nas 1996, China was leading the pack in the entire world in terms of \nproliferators?\n  Now they are just identified as one of the top three of nations that \nare doing things to serve as threats to this country, and the \ninformation in the intelligence reports we continue to see is that with \nregard to part of their activities anyway, it is increasing as we \nspeak; let's not do anything to upset the leadership of the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  I wish we were dealing with the people of China. We would not have \nthis problem. But the leadership over there, counting on having this \ntrade and keeping dictatorial control, too, is an entity whose \nattention we need to get. Diplomacy has not worked.\n  It is true; we have numerous laws on the books. I said earlier that \nsome of my colleagues were arguing that this would be catastrophic, on \nthe one hand, and yet we have similar laws already on the books, we do \nnot need them, on the other. I did not expect to hear that in the same \nargument, but I think I just heard it. We have numerous laws on the \nbooks that are unilateral sanctions with regard to countries that \nproliferate weapons of mass destruction. That is nothing new. We pass \nthose bills unanimously usually.\n\n  What is new about this legislation is the fact that a detailed report \nis required; the President has to give a reason for not exercising \nsanctions when a determination is made that companies are \nproliferating; and Congress has a voice. If 20 Members of Congress \ndecide to file a petition, then we can address it ourselves. The \nPresident, of course, still has to sign the bill. The President, of \ncourse, can still veto legislation, but it does give Congress some \nadditional voice, a voice that is needed.\n  If this had worked out all right, if we did not have this continuous \npattern of behavior and continuous pattern by this administration in \nnot requiring the Chinese to clean up their act, we would not be here \ntonight and we would not need this kind of legislation.\n  I make no apologies for this amendment. It is needed. It is something \nthat is not going to go away. The People's Republic of China has made \nit clear they do not intend to amend their activities. It is not as if \nwe are making progress. They told us and our delegations we sent over \nthere in June and July of this year, and with the President of the \nUnited States and the head of the Chinese Government as late as last \nFriday, they continue to tell us that as long as we try to get a \nmissile defense system through here and as long as we befriend Taiwan, \nthey are going to continue their activities and we can take it or leave \nit.\n  Obviously, many of my colleagues think we ought to take it because of \nthe enormous benefits we are going to get from this trade deal; surely \nwe can move forward and be optimistic and be hopeful in terms of what \ntrade might bring because free trade leads to free markets and free \nmarkets can lead to more open societies in the long run.\n  In the meantime, in addition to that, can we afford to blind \nourselves to the only activity engaged in by this country or any other \ncountry--I am talking about the Chinese Government--that poses a direct \nand mortal threat, as we are continually told by our own commissions \nand intelligence community to this country? I think not, and I look \nforward to a resuming of the debate tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8337-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to call attention to \nsome unfinished business from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. In this \nlandmark legislation, Congress directed the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to work with the National Academy of Sciences Institute \nof Medicine to study medical nutrition therapy as a potential benefit \nto the Medicare program.\n  In December of last year, the Institute of Medicine released their \nstudy. They found that nutrition therapy has been shown to be effective \nin the management and the treatment of many chronic conditions which \naffect Medicare beneficiaries, including high cholesterol, high blood \npressure, heart failure, diabetes, and kidney disease. They also found \nthat Medicare beneficiaries undergoing cancer treatment may benefit \nfrom nutrition therapy aimed at controlling side effects or improving \nfood intake. They recommended that medical nutrition therapy--with \nphysician referral--be covered as a benefit under the Medicare program.\n  I have been working with my friend and colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman, for the last several years on medical nutrition \ntherapy legislation. The bill we introduced establishes a new Medicare \noutpatient benefit that would allow our senior citizens to work with a \nregistered dietitian or nutrition professional to learn how to manage \nchronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney \ndisease.\n  This legislation, S. 660, has been cosponsored by 35 of our \ncolleagues. Its House companion, sponsored by Representative Nancy \nJohnson, has been supported by two-thirds of the House Members.\n  As Congress considers additional refinements to the Balanced Budget \nAct, we must be certain that we keep our focus on the beneficiary. In \naddition to providing health care providers with needed relief, we must \nseize the opportunity to give our Nation's seniors access to medical \nnutrition therapy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Bingaman and I to take care \nof this unfinished business before this Congress ends. We must make \ncertain that action on medical nutrition therapy coverage occurs this \nyear.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8337-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8337-S8339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECESS APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in 1985, when we had a conservative \nRepublican in the White House by the name of Ronald Reagan, we had a \nSenate that was dominated by the Democrats. At that time, the Senate \nmajority leader was a very distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Bob Byrd.\n  We found Ronald Reagan was violating the Constitution with recess \nappointments. Let me go back and give a little background of this. In \nthe history of this country, back when we were in session for a few \nweeks and then they got on their horse and buggy and went for several \ndays back to wherever they came from, if some opening occurred during \nthe course of a recess, such as the Secretary of State dying, the \nConstitution provides that a President can go ahead and make a recess \nappointment and not rely on the prerogative of the Senate to confirm, \nfor confirmation purposes. This is understandable at that time.\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\n  Since then, Republicans and Democrats in the White House have, when \nthey were philosophically opposed to the philosophy of the prevailing \nphilosophy in the Senate, made recess appointments.\n  Ronald Reagan was doing this. I loved him, but he was violating the \nConstitution.\n  Senator Byrd read and studied the Constitution. He sent a letter to \nthe White House that said: If you continue to do this, then I can \nassure you we will put holds on all of your nominations. It wasn't just \njudicial nominations but all of them. I read from Senator Byrd:\n\n       In the future, prior to any recess breaks, the White House \n     will inform the majority leader and (the minority leader) of \n     any recess appointments which might be contemplated in the \n     recess. They would do so in such advance time to sufficiently \n     allow the leadership on both sides to perhaps take action to \n     fill whatever vacancies might take place during such a break.\n\n  Those were for anticipated vacancies.\n  President Reagan agreed with this and sent a letter back to Senator \nByrd saying he would do it.\n  In June of 1999, the President made a recess appointment of someone \nwho had not even gone through the committee process, had not given all \ntheir information to the appropriate committee in order to become an \nambassador. He went in and appointed him anyway. I felt that was a \nviolation every bit as egregious as anything Ronald Reagan had done.\n  I took the same letter that Senator Byrd had sent to Ronald Reagan, \nand I sent it to President Clinton.\n  I got no response until finally he realized I was putting holds on \nall these nominations. On June 15, 1999, President Clinton wrote a \nletter saying:\n\n       I share your opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 \n     between President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your \n     letter remains a fair and constructive framework which my \n     administration will follow.\n\n  I wrote a letter back thanking him and was very complimentary to him \nfor taking this action.\n  A short while later--we were going into recess--along with 16 other \nSenators, I sent a letter to the President because we had heard rumors \nhe was going to make several appointments, recess appointments. In \nfact, that is exactly what happened.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record all this in \nmore detail.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Recess Appointments--Chronology\n\n       1985 Byrd-Reagan Agreement: ``In the future, prior to any \n     recess breaks, the White House would inform the majority \n     leader and (the minority leader) of any recess appointment \n     which might be contemplated during such recess. They would do \n     so in advance sufficiently to allow the leadership on both \n     sides to perhaps take action to fill whatever vacancies that \n     might be imperative during such a break.'' (Emphasis added)--\n     Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.V.), 10/18/85.\n       June 4, 1999 Recess Appointment: Without sufficient notice \n     in advance of the recess, President Clinton, on the last day \n     of the brief 5-day Memorial Day recess, granted a recess \n     appointment to controversial political and social activist \n     James Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg.\n       June 7, 1999 Inhofe Places Holds: Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) \n     announced ``holds'' on all non-military nominees, demanding \n     Clinton's promise to abide by the Byrd-Reagan agreement on \n     all future recess appointments.\n       June 15, 1999 Clinton Letter to Lott: ``I share your \n     opinion that the understanding reached in 1985 between \n     President Reagan and Senator Byrd cited in your letter \n     remains a fair and constructive framework, which my \n     administration will follow.''\n       June 16, 1999 Inhofe Lifts Holds: Inhofe lifted his holds \n     on nominees, praising the President for agreeing to abide by \n     the Byrd-Reagan agreement in the future.\n       Nov. 10, 1999 Senators' Letter to Clinton: ``If you do make \n     recess appointments during the upcoming recess which violate \n     the spirit of our agreement, then we will respond by placing \n     holds on all judicial nominees. The result would be a \n     complete breakdown in cooperation between our two branches of \n     government on this issue which could prevent the confirmation \n     of any such nominees next year. We do not want this to \n     happen. We urge you to cooperate in good faith with the \n     Majority Leader concerning all contemplated recess \n     appointments.''--Inhofe and 16 senators.\n       Nov. 17, 1999 Inhofe Floor Speech: ``I want to make sure \n     there is no misunderstanding and that we don't go into a \n     recess with the President not understanding that we are very \n     serious . . . It is not just me putting a hold on all \n     judicial nominees for the remaining year of his term, but 16 \n     other senators have agreed to do that . . . I want to make \n     sure it is abundantly clear without any doubt in anyone's \n     mind in the White House--I will refer back to this document I \n     am talking about right now--that in the event the President \n     makes recess appointments, we will put holds on all judicial \n     nominations for the remainder of his term. It is very fair \n     for me to sand here and eliminate any doubt in the \n     President's mind of what we will do.''\n       Nov. 19, 1999 Clinton Notifies Senate of Contemplated \n     Recess Appointments: In compliance with the Byrd-Reagan \n     agreement, Clinton provides a list--prior to the recess--of \n     13 possible recess appointments under consideration for the \n     Nov. 20-Jan. 24 intersession recess. Inhofe and others object \n     to five on the list who have holds or prospective holds on \n     their nominations. Eight are considered acceptable.\n       Nov. 19, 1999 Inhofe Floor Speech 10 Minutes Before \n     Adjournment: ``If anyone other than these eight individuals \n     is recess appointed, we will put a hold on every single \n     judicial nonimee of this President for the remainder of his \n     term in office . . . I reemphasize, if there is some other \n     interpretation as to the meaning of the (Nov. 10) letter, it \n     does not make any difference, we are still going to put holds \n     on them. I want to make sure there is a very clear \n     understanding: If these nominees come in, if he does violate \n     the intent (of the agreement) as we interpret it, then we \n     will have holds on these nominees.''\n       Nov. 23, 1999 Inhofe Letter to Clinton: In a spirit of \n     cooperation, Inhofe acknowledges one additional acceptable \n     appointment has been added to the list. ``I hope this makes \n     our position clear. Any recess appointment other than the \n     nine listed above would constitute a violation of the spirit \n     of our agreement and trigger multiple holds on judicial \n     nominees.''\n       Dec. 7, 1999 Inhofe Privately Urges White House Not to \n     Violate Agreement: Notified by the Majority Leader's office \n     that the President was contemplating at least two recess \n     appointments (Weisberg and Fox) which were not included on \n     the list submitted in advance of the recess, Inhofe \n     reiterated that making these appointments would trigger a \n     hold on all judicial nominees.\n       Dec. 9, 1999 Clinton Violates Agreement--Appoints Stuart \n     Weisberg to OSHA Review Commission: Name was not included on \n     list submitted in advance of the recess. Weisberg appointment \n     was strongly opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the \n     National Association of Manufacturers. Weisberg is a liberal \n     advocate of expanded regulatory authority who had compiled a \n     controversial record of decisions consistently unfavorable to \n     employers.\n       Dec. 17, 1999 Clinton Violates Agreement--Appoints Sarah \n     Fox to NLRB: Name was not included on list submitted in \n     advance of the recess. Fox is a stridently pro-labor former \n     Ted Kennedy staffer whose policy decisions were consistently \n     pro-union on such key issues as striker replacements, Davis-\n     Bacon wage laws and the Beck decision of compulsory union \n     dues.\n       Dec. 20, 1999 Inhofe Responds by Announcing Effort to Block \n     Judges: ``I am announcing today that I will do exactly what I \n     said I would do if the President deliberately violated our \n     agreement.''\n       Jan. 25, 2000 Inhofe Places Hold on All Judicial Nominees: \n     ``It is in anticipation of just such defiance that I and my \n     colleagues warned the President on at least five separate \n     occasions exactly what our response would be if he violated \n     the agreement. We would put on hold on all judicial nominees. \n     So today it will come as no surprise to the President that we \n     are putting a hold on all judicial nominees. We are simply \n     doing what we said we would do to uphold Constitutional \n     respect for the Senate's proper role in the confirmation \n     process.''\n       Feb. 10, 2000 Inhofe Hold is Overruled by Majority Leader \n     Trent Lott: Inhofe thanked the 19 Republican senators who, in \n     a key procedural vote, supported his effort to demand \n     presidential accountability. Those Senators were: Shelby \n     (Ala.), Murkowski (Alaska), Allard (Colo.), Craig (Idaho), \n     Crapo (Idaho), Grassley (Iowa), McConnell (Ky.), Bunning \n     (Ky), Grams (Minn.), Burns (Mont.), Smith (N.H.), Gregg, \n     (N.H.), Domenici (N.M.), Helms (N.C.), Ihofe (Okla.), \n     Thurmond (S.C.), Gramm (Texas), Thomas (Wy.), and Enzi (Wy.).\n       August 3-31, 2000 Clinton Grants 17 Recess Appointments in \n     Defiance of the Senate: Rejecting his commitment to cooperate \n     with the Senate, Clinton grants appointments to Bill Lann Lee \n     and other whom the Senate specifically said were unacceptable \n     as recess appointments. Clinton's action was a deliberate \n     affront to the Senate, a violation of the spirit of the Byrd-\n     Reagan agreement and an abuse of power undermining the \n     ``advice and consent'' clause of the Constitution.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to say we made it very clear to this \nPresident on two of the recesses since that time, that if he did not \nlive up to the standards as were put in the letter by Ronald Reagan and \nto which he agreed, that we would put holds on all these nominations.\n  Obviously, I had holds on these nominations. I have to admit it was \nnot the Democrats; Republicans were not a lot of help to me at that \ntime. They voted and overruled the hold that I had.\n  I would say the Senators who voted with me at that time to uphold the \nConstitution were Senators Shelby,\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\nMurkowski, Allard, Craig, Crapo, Grassley, McConnell, Bunning, Grams of \nMinnesota, Burns, Smith of New Hampshire, Gregg, Domenici, Helms--as I \nsaid, Inhofe--Thurmond, Gramm of Texas, Thomas, and Enzi.\n  In spite of the fact that that happened, they went ahead, the \nPresident went ahead and has continued to make recess appointments. The \nlast time he did was during our August recess between the 3rd and 31st. \nHe granted 17 recess appointments in just an arrogant defiance of the \nSenate's prerogative of advice and consent for confirmation purposes.\n  Even though it is kind of an empty threat now, I will do it --I am \nannouncing tonight I am going to put a hold on all judicial nominations \nfor the rest of his term, not that there are that many, because if we \nstopped right now, there would still be fewer vacancies than were there \nat the end of the Bush administration. But when we took office, we \nswore to uphold the Constitution and the Constitution is very specific. \nToday I am making this announcement that we are going to hold up all \njudicial nominations. I am doing exactly what Senator Byrd would do \nunder the same circumstances. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8339-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to talk today about the need \nto move through a number of important judicial nominations. This \nprocess has been dragging on for too long.\n  Pending before the Judiciary Committee are dozens of federal appeals \ncourt nominations, including that of my Iowa constituent, Bonnie J. \nCampbell for the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  There are 22 vacancies in our federal appeals courts. With the \ngrowing number of vacancies in the federal courts, these positions \nshould be filled with qualified individuals as soon as possible. And so \nI urge the Republican leadership to take the steps necessary to allow \nthe full Senate to vote up or down on these important nominations.\n  Ms. Campbell, who received a hearing by the Judiciary Committee in \nJune, would serve on the 8th Circuit with honor, fairness, and \ndistinction.\n  Bonnie Campbell has a long and distinguished history in the field of \nlaw. She began her career as a private practice lawyer in Des Moines in \n1984. She worked on cases involving medical malpractice, employment \ndiscrimination, personal injury, real estate, and family law.\n  She was elected as Iowa's Attorney General in 1990--the first woman \never to hold that office in Iowa. During her tenure, she received high \npraise from both ends of the political spectrum for her outstanding \nwork enforcing the law, reducing crime, and protecting consumers.\n  In 1995, she was appointed as the Director of the Violence Against \nWomen Office in the Department of Justice. In that position, she played \na critical role in implementing the Violence Against Women provisions \nof the 1994 Crime Act.\n  Again, she won the respect of individuals with a wide range of views \non this issue. She has been, and still remains, responsible for the \noverall coordination and agenda of the Department of Justice's efforts \nto combat violence against women.\n  Mr. President, I've known Bonnie Campbell for many years. She is a \nperson of unparalleled integrity, keen intellect, and outstanding \njudgment. She is fair, level-headed, and even-handed.\n  These qualities, and her significant experience, make her an ideal \ncandidate for this important position.\n  Her nomination has been strongly supported by many of her colleagues, \nincluding the current Iowa Attorney General and the President of the \nIowa State Police Association. Her nomination has also been approved by \nthe American Bar Association. And Bonnie Campbell has the solid support \nof both myself and my Iowa colleague, Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. President, I view the Senate's ``advise and consent'' \nresponsibility on judicial nominations in the Senate to be on par with \nour annual responsibility to move appropriations bills. And, as such, \nthe Senate's schedule between now and adjournment should be adjusted to \nassure adequate time for their consideration.\n  We have the time if we have the will.\n  Again, Mr. President, we have a backlog of judicial vacancies, and it \nis only fair to push them through as soon as possible. I urge the \nleadership and the Committee to move them, including Bonnie Campbell, \nwith all due speed. The American people and the people of Iowa's Eighth \nCircuit are ill-served by these vacancies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8339-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, from 1950-80, a large part of the \nEmpire, Michigan community revolved around its Air Force Base, and the \nmen and women who not only worked there, but also lived and raised \nfamilies together in the surrounding community. To commemorate the 50th \nAnniversary of the opening of the base, as well as the relationships \nthat developed between the families, several former Air Force Airmen \nhave coordinated a reunion for everyone who served during the 30 years \nthe facility was open. The event will occur in Traverse City from \nSeptember 20-23, and I rise today to recognize the Empire Air Force \nStation Reunion 2000.\n  Empire Air Force 752 Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron opened in \n1950, having become necessary as an outgrowth of the Cold War. The \nprimary mission of the base was to protect nearby metropolitan areas, \nincluding Detroit and Chicago, from enemy bombers, as well as to \nprovide assistance to commercial aviation.\n  When the station opened, it was a completely manual operation and \nthus had over 300 personnel assigned. The first personnel assigned to \nthe base were housed in the Village of Empire. Eventually, in 1956, \nnine family housing units were completed, and soon thereafter \nservicemen and their families moved into these units.\n  As the Air Force Base expanded in size, so too did the residential \narea. Between 1960-62, recreational facilities, including a two-lane \nbowling center, two recreation courts and a softball field, were \ncompleted. These did not serve just to provide the feel of a community, \nthey truly created a community, providing children with places to play \ntogether and families with places to congregate with one another.\n  In 1965, the Federal Aviation Administration assumed the maintenance \nof much of the radar equipment, and with the steady advancement of \ntechnology, the FAA ultimately took control of the Air Force Station in \n1980. During the many years that the FAA and the Air Force shared the \nstation, the relations between the two groups were congenial, which was \na tribute to both parties.\n  The reunion includes many outstanding events. There is a banquet \nFriday evening at the Park Place Hotel in Traverse City, as well as a \nhospitality suite at the hotel that will be open from noon on \nWednesday, September 20th until noon on Saturday, September 23rd.

Mr. President, I wish today to draw the Senate's \nattention to National Assisted Living Week. The National Center for \nAssisted Living is sponsoring National Assisted Living Week this week \nto highlight the significance and the hope that this type of service \ncan provide seniors.\n  Assisted living is a long term care alternative for seniors who need \nmore assistance than is available in retirement communities, but do not \nrequire the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing \nfacilities. Approximately one million of our nation's seniors have \nchosen the option of assisted living in this country. This demonstrates \na tremendous desire by seniors and their families to have the kind of \nassistance that they need in bathing, taking medications or other \nactivities of daily living in a setting that truly becomes their home.\n  This year's theme of National Assisted Living Week is ``The Art of \nLife'' and it is intended as recognition of the value of creative \nexpression. I think that it is appropriate because it shows that \nassisted living is a real option for seniors to continue experiencing \n``the art of life'' in living arrangements tailored to meet their needs \nfor socialization, independence and services.\n  Oregon has led our nation in the concept of assisted living. My state \nspends more state health dollars to provide assisted living services \nthan any other in our nation. Assisted living has taken different \ndirections in different states, and I believe offering these choices \nfor consumers is important to provide security, dignity and \nindependence for seniors.\n  Assisted living will become even more important as an option of \nseniors and their families as our nation experiences the demographic \ntsunami of aging baby boomers. It is important for us to continue to \nsupport options that allow seniors and their families a choice of \nsettings in order to assure that they get the level of care that they \nneed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8340-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO ROBERT F.

Smith Academic Technology Center at Bentley \nCollege in Massachusetts.\n  Bob and Miriam have a long history of philanthropy to the college. \nThey have established numerous scholarship programs, many for deserving \nstudents from disadvantaged communities. Bob and Miriam's financial \ndonation will give Bentley College the chance to enhance its business \neducation program. As the retired chief executive officer of American \nExpress Bank, Bob understands the value of a superior business \neducation.

Mr. President, a goodly number of Senators know \nAdam Clymer of The New York Times as a cheerful, even avuncular, \nreporter affably working the corridors here in the Capitol carefully \nchronicling our not always cheerful proceedings. He was prominent in \nthe pages of the Times, but was not much in evidence in the electronic \nmedia. Alas, all that changed in an instant last week. This paragon of \njournalistic self-effacement had celebrity thrust upon him by an open \nmicrophone. With characteristic detachment, he related this not \naltogether welcome experience in an article, ``My Media Moment,'' which \nappeared in this Sunday's Times. May an admirer and friend wish that it \nlast more than the allotted fifteen minutes.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\n           [From the New York Times, Sunday, Sept. 10, 2000]\n\n    A Bush-League Aside Vaults An Onlooker Into the Campaign's Glare\n\n                            (By Adam Clymer)\n\n       I have been writing newspaper articles for four decades. \n     Broadcasting has never tempted me, except for bit parts on \n     such sober outlets as C-SPAN and WQXR-FM. So what was I doing \n     with an invitation to appear on the ``Late Show With David \n     Letterman''? And seriously thinking about doing it, before \n     saying, no thanks?\n       I am used to being around big news. Checking out the \n     posters in Red Square when Nikita S. Khrushchev was ousted. \n     Sitting with Lyndon B. Johnson (and his dogs) when he \n     congratulated Mike Mansfield on the 1965 Voting Rights Act. \n     Standing on the White House lawn when Richard M. Nixon quit. \n     Elections, trials, Supreme Court confirmations.\n       But being the story is different from observing it. And \n     last week, I seemed to be the story.\n       On Monday, Gov. George W. Bush spotted me at a rally in \n     Naperville, Ill. Not realizing the microphones were working, \n     he told his running mate, Dick Cheney, that I was a ``major-\n     league [expletive].''\n       This was hardly the first time I have been attacked, though \n     it was the first time the attack accorded me ``major league'' \n     status.\n       It is true that I never made the Nixon enemies list; a \n     deputy press secretary to whom I complained said all that \n     proved was that he had nothing to do with compiling it.\n       But after Vietnamese and Chinese students beat me up in \n     Moscow to cap a demonstration against the United States \n     bombing of Vietnam, the Soviet government expelled me as a \n     ``hooligan.'' A deputy of Sheriff Jim Clark in Selma, Ala., \n     once slugged me (because of an embarrassing article Jack \n     Nelson of The Los Angeles Times had written; I hardly \n     resemble Mr. Nelson, but maybe all newspaper reporters look \n     alike to racists). The Washington Times has called me \n     unpatriotic, and some people at The Weekly Standard have \n     attacked me in print, too.\n       But those attacks all came from the ideological fringes, \n     and nobody took them seriously. Maybe Mr. Bush is entitled to \n     more credence. After all, I sometimes vote for his party's \n     candidates, as I sometimes vote for Democrats. He cares about \n     education and wants his party to attract African-Americans \n     and Hispanics. Sure, he is not as centrist as he tries to \n     portray himself, but then what politician is? (The pre-\n     nomination Joseph I. Lieberman, maybe.) In any case, Mr. Bush \n     is no right-wing nut, so shrugging his remark off as the \n     sound of an extremist was hardly the proper response.\n       Initially, there was only a moment to think of a response \n     when a pack of reporters descended. One smart-aleck answer \n     occurred to me. Since we were not too far from Wrigley Field, \n     I thought of saying something like, ``At least I didn't trade \n     Sammy Sosa,'' a riposte that would have dealt with Mr. Bush's \n     own major-league experience as boss of the Texas Rangers. But \n     I rejected that and said simply, ``I was disappointed with \n     the governor's language.''\n       When reporters asked what he had against me, I suggested \n     they ask him. He was not saying anything, except, ``I regret \n     that a private comment I made to the vice-presidential \n     candidate made it to the public airwaves.''\n       After that, I tried to fade into the background, which is \n     how newspaper reporters try to work, as much as you can \n     around a presidential campaign that has dozens of \n     photographers and television cameramen following every move. \n     I was in Illinois to cover Mr. Cheney, and when we walked to \n     an El entrance where he would be photographed taking a train, \n     the lenses were on me, not him.\n       Suddenly my voice mail at the office was full. It was Labor \n     Day, and I seemed to be the news flavor of the day. Radio \n     stations in Phoenix and Scotland, Seattle and Australia, the \n     BBC and a sports network said they needed me to fulfill their \n     commitments to informing their listeners and viewers. Among \n     those calling were ``Good Morning America,'' CBS's ``Early \n     Show'' and CNN's ``Larry King Live.''\n       I had plenty of time to listen to the messages because Mr. \n     Cheney, anxious to avoid the storm Mr. Bush had stirred up, \n     did not want to talk on the record to the reporters traveling \n     with him. So I could not ask the question I had traveled to \n     ask, about why he gave only 1 percent of his income to \n     charity.\n       Almost all the phone calls were either invitations to \n     speak, which I ducked, or encouraging, even envious, messages \n     from friends. ``Can I have your autograph?'' asked one New \n     York Times Colleague. ``We're so proud of you,'' said a \n     Democratic friend in Austin, Tex. Republican friends chimed \n     in, too, to insist that their party was no monolith on the \n     subject of Adam Clymer. But e-mail was a different matter. A \n     right-wing Web site posted my e-mail address and urged its \n     army to charge, so about 300 hostile messages flooded in and \n     choked the system.\n       The next day I went back out with Mr. Cheney, and he \n     discussed and defended his contributions. On a flight to \n     Allentown, PA., he said he should be given credit not just \n     for direct donations but also for corporate matching grants \n     and speaking without charge to nonprofit groups. Television \n     viewers might have expected glares, and at least some \n     reference to the events they were being shown over and over, \n     which includes his loyal agreement with Mr. Bush. Instead I \n     asked questions, some of which he seemed to dislike, and he \n     answered them as he chose. Not buddy-buddy, but strictly \n     professional.\n       The Cheney entourage caught up with Mr. Bush, so his vice-\n     presidential candidate could introduce him in Allentown, \n     Bethlehem and Scranton. Every time we stopped near a \n     television set, some cable channel was showing the clip of \n     Mr. Bush muttering about me to Mr. Cheney and then pondering \n     its impact on his campaign and the future of Western \n     civilization.\n       By Wednesday the e-mail flood was drying up, although I was \n     asked to endorse a T-shirt memorializing his comment, and \n     someone else sent a message saying that an Internet site for \n     my fans was being created.\n       I was back in the office, and colleagues asked if Mr. Bush \n     had apologized to me. I had not heard from him, or from his \n     aides, who were busy telling reporters I had been mean to him \n     when I reported in April that ``Texas has had one of the \n     nation's worst public health records for decades,'' and that \n     Mr. Bush had not made much of an effort to fix things.\n       I was actually proud of that article--which got immensely \n     renewed readership last week as people tried to figure out \n     what exactly was bugging the governor. But if Mr. Bush did \n     not like it, hey, it's free country. After all, if newspaper \n     reporters wanted to be loved by their customers, we could \n     drive Good Humor trucks.\n       Newspapers reporters aren't immune from talking into an \n     open mike either. About 18 months ago, I was editing an \n     article describing how hard Mr. Bush was working to study \n     national issues. With feeble gallows humor, I suggested that \n     perhaps he needed the tutorials more than others. But while \n     my comparable slurs of President Clinton, to cite one \n     prominent example, stayed private, a spectacular typesetting \n     blunder got my wise-crack printed. Through an Editors' Note, \n     the Times apologized, sort of.\n       Now maybe Vice President Al Gore, whose aides seem \n     delighted by this business, could do me a favor and make some \n     comparable stumble. Then I could get back to covering the \n     campaign instead of being part of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8341-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A TRIBUTE TO SPECIAL AGENT GEOFF YEOWELL\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize my Legislative Fellow, Geoff Yeowell, who will be leaving my \noffice at the end of the month to assume the duties of supervisory \nspecial agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service Office in \nRota, Spain.\n  Geoff has been on loan to my office from the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service where he has worked since 1987.\n  Over the past 11 months, Geoff has become an indispensable part of my \nlegislative shop. He has worked hard on a broad range of issues--each \ntime jumping in feet first, soaking up knowledge, and moving \nlegislation forward in this often complicated process. From his first \nassignment, he earned the respect of my staff, as well as mine.\n  Geoff's primary duty consisted of working as my legislative assistant \nfor Military Construction. He quickly realized the Milcon \nappropriations priorities for my home state of Pennsylvania and was \nhelpful in making sure these items were given the time and attention \nthey deserve.\n  Geoff also provided a tremendous service to the people of \nPennsylvania in working with those in need of assistance. He \ndemonstrated a remarkable amount of patience and courtesy with each \nconstituent requiring special assistance and worked countless hours to \nhelp them in the best way possible.\n  Finally, Geoff was instrumental in working on the Counterintelligence \nReform Act of 2000 (S. 2089) which I introduced on February 24, 2000. \nHis skills and judgement in this arena are exceptional. My staff and I \nwere constantly impressed with the wealth of knowledge he demonstrated.\n  His dedication to each project was remarkable, and the assistance he \nprovided to my office will not be easily matched. However, I am \ninformed that for Geoff this level of dedication is par for the course. \nIn 1999 he was selected as a Naval Investigative Criminal Service agent \nof the year and received the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award \nfor his work on a major espionage investigation. He also received the \n1999 Department of Defense Counterintelligence Award for \nInvestigations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me today in commending \nSpecial Agent Geoff Yeowell for his service as a Legislative Fellow and \nfor his dedication and leadership to our country.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8342-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n            MS. BOBBIE DAVIDSON NAMED ACHIEVER OF THE MONTH\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in October of 1993, the State of \nMichigan Family Independence Agency commemorated the first anniversary \nof its landmark welfare reform initiative, To Strengthen Michigan \nFamilies, by naming its first Achiever of the Month. In each month \nsince, the award has been given to an individual who participates in \nthe initiative and has shown outstanding progress toward self-\nsufficiency and self-improvement. I rise today to recognize Ms. Bobbie \nDavidson, the recipient of the award for the month of August, 2000.\n  Ms. Davidson is the single mother of two children, ages 8 and 11. She \nis dyslexic, and because of this feared she was unable to work. Having \nreceived ADC/FIP and Medicaid since 1993, in 1999 she applied for SSI. \nThough she was ultimately denied, while her application was pending Ms. \nDavidson was referred to Michigan Rehabilitation Services. That agency \nhelped her to enroll in West Shore Community College in order to \nimprove her math and reading skills.\n  With assistance from the Work First and the Project Zero \ncoordinators, Ms. Davidson obtained a job at Burger King in Ludington, \nMichigan, in March of this year. She continues to be employed there, \nwhich has resulted in the closure of her FIP case.\n  As a result of her determination to improve her life, not only for \nherself but also for her children, Ms. Davidson has become independent \nof the welfare system. Eventually, she would like to attend culinary \nschool and become a chef.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Ms. Bobbie Davidson on being named Achiever \nof the Month for August of 2000. It is an honor for which she has \nworked very hard and that she truly deserves. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I congratulate Ms. Davidson, and wish her \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8342-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, without amendment:\n        S. 2439: A bill to authorize the appropriation of funds \n     for the construction of the Southeastern Alaska Intertie \n     system, and for other purposes (Rept.

A bill to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect \nbreastfeeding by new mothers; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions\n\n\n            pregnancy discrimination act amendments of 2000\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pregnancy \nDiscrimination Act Amendments of 2000. This bill would clarify that the \nPregnancy Discrimination Act protects breastfeeding under civil rights \nlaw, requiring that a woman cannot be fired or discriminated against in \nthe workplace for expressing breast milk during her own lunch time or \nbreak time.\n  When Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, I \nwonder if any of my colleagues considered the definition of \n``pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions'' delineated in \nthis law would not include breastfeeding. But unfortunately, courts \nacross the country have not interpreted the Pregnancy Discrimination \nAct to include breastfeeding.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, women with infants and \ntoddlers are the fastest growing segment of today's labor force. At \nleast 50 percent of women who are employed when they become pregnant \nreturn to the labor force by the time their children are three months \nold. Although the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was enacted in 1978 and \nprohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, \nchildbirth, or related medical conditions, courts have not interpreted \nthe Act to include breastfeeding.\n  Some employers deny women the opportunity to express milk; some women \nhave been discharged for requesting to express milk during lunch and \nother regular breaks; some women have been harassed or discriminated \nagainst; some women have had their pay withheld or been taken off of \nshift work for saying that they wanted to pump milk.\n  On the other hand, many employers have seen positive results from \nfacilitating lactation programs in the workplace, including low \nabsenteeism, high productivity, improved company loyalty, high employee \nmorale, and lower health care costs. Parental absenteeism due to infant \nillness is three times greater among the parents of formula-fed \nchildren than those that are breastfed. Worksite programs that aim to \nimprove infant health may also bring about a reduction in parental \nabsenteeism and health insurance costs.\n  There is no doubt as to the health benefit breastfeeding brings to \nboth mothers and children. Breastmilk is easily digested and \nassimilated, and contains all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients \nthey require in their first five to six months of life. Furthermore, \nimportant antibodies, proteins, immune cells, and growth factors that \ncan only be found in breast milk. Breastmilk is the first line of \nimmunization defense and enhances the effectiveness of vaccines given \nto infants.\n  Research studies show that children who are not breastfed have higher \nrates of mortality, meningitis, some types of cancers, asthma and other \nrespiratory illnesses, bacterial and viral infections, diarrhoeal \ndiseases, ear infections, allergies, and obesity. Other research \nstudies have shown that breastmilk and breastfeeding have protective \neffects against the development of a number of chronic diseases, \nincluding juvenile diabetes, lymphomas, Crohn's disease, celiac \ndisease, some chronic liver diseases, and ulcerative colitis. A number \nof studies have shown that breastfed children have higher IQs at all \nages.\n  Mr. President, this is a simple bill--it simply inserts the word \n``breastfeeding'' in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. It will change \nthe law to read that employment discrimination ``because of or on the \nbasis of pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medication \nconditions'' is not permitted.\n  I believe that it is absolutely critical to support mothers across \nthe country--they are, of course, raising the very future of our \ncountry.

Chafee, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 3024. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of glaucoma detection services under part B of the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n              the medicare glaucoma detection act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nGlaucoma Detection Act of 2000. I'm pleased to be joined in its \nintroduction by my colleagues Senator Chafee and Senator Moynihan.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Glaucoma Detection Act follows suit in a \nseries of preventive health proposals I've cosponsored to help Medicare \nbeneficiaries take a more active role in their health care. Reforming \nMedicare by adding preventive benefits recognizes that it is much more \ncost effective to prevent illness than to treat it. Over the past \nseveral years, Congress has expanded Medicare's preventive benefits, \nadding screening and detection services like mammography, bone mass \nmeasurements and screening for prostate and colorectal cancer to help \nMedicare beneficiaries. It is now time to add another important \nprevention benefit to Medicare: screening for glaucoma.\n  The Medicare Glaucoma Detection Act of 2000 will give seniors access \nto the best defense against glaucoma--complete eye examinations on a \nregular basis. Glaucoma is a significant cause of legal blindness in \nthis country and is the single most common cause of irreversible \nblindness among African-Americans. In fact, the prevalence of glaucoma \nis an astounding four to six times higher in African-Americans that the \nrest of the population.\n  Glaucoma is often called ``the silent thief of sight'' because the \nafflicted person has no warning sign, no hint that anything is wrong. \nOver the years, the increased buildup of pressure causes damage to the \noptic nerve in the back of the eyes. Because the disease does not show \nany symptoms until considerable damage has been done, coverage of \nregularly scheduled exams is a critical step in controlling the \ndisease. If detected in the early stages, glaucoma can be effectively \ntreated to prevent loss of vision.\n  The bill I am introducing today will establish a Medicare glaucoma \ndetection benefit that follows the guidelines set forth by the American \nAcademy of Ophthalmology, which recommend that individuals 60 years of \nage or older with a family history of glaucoma receive a glaucoma \nscreening once every two years. Too many of America's seniors are in \ndanger of losing their vision--an estimated 120,000 persons are legally \nblind due to glaucoma. This bill is the first step toward reversing \nthat trend.\n  Mr. President, it's important to note that blindness is not simply a \nmedical problem--the costs of glaucoma are both the personal loss of \nsight and the economic costs to the individual and society associated \nwith blindness. Annual costs to the government associated with \nblindness are estimated at more than four billion dollars. Moreover, \neyesight is a gift that allows seniors to maintain their independence. \nBy helping preserve the ability of seniors to cook, to shop, to drive, \nto care for themselves and to recognize family and friends, the \nMedicare Glaucoma Detection Act of 2000 will allow seniors to stay \nindependent longer.\n  We do not yet have a cure for glaucoma, but blindness from glaucoma \ncan be prevented through early detection and treatment. I urge each of \nmy colleagues to support this bill's passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8343-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8343-S8344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 482\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Warner) was added as a cosponsor of S. 482, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the increase in the tax on the \nsocial security benefits.\n\n\n                                 S. 721\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Smith) was added as a cosponsor of S. 721, a bill to \nallow media coverage of court proceedings.\n\n\n                                 S. 779\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 779, a bill to provide that \nno Federal income tax shall be imposed on amounts received by Holocaust \nvictims or their heirs.\n\n\n                                S. 1020\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Daschle) and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. DeWine) were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1020, a bill to amend chapter 1 of title 9, United \nStates Code, to provide for greater fairness in the arbitration process \nrelating to motor vehicle franchise contracts.\n\n\n                                S. 1805\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Reed) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1805, a bill to \nrestore food stamp benefits for aliens, to provide States with \nflexibility in administering the food stamp vehicle allowance, to index \nthe excess shelter expense deduction to inflation, to authorize \nadditional appropriations to purchase and make available additional \ncommodities under the emergency food assistance program, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1810\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Murray, the name of the Senator from Ohio (Mr. \nVoinovich) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1810, a bill to amend title \n38, United States Code, to clarify and improve veterans' claims and \nappellate procedures.\n\n\n                                S. 1900\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n(Mr. Inouye) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1900, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a credit to holders of qualified \nbonds issued by Amtrak, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2299\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nthat I will soon send to the desk to proclaim September, 2000, as \n``National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month,'' and to \nrecognize the Administration, government agencies, and the many groups \nsupporting this effort highlighting the critical need to support our \nchildren and adolescents in addiction treatment and recovery. The Year \n2000 Recovery Month theme is ``Recovering Our Future: One Youth at a \nTime,'' with a clear message that we need to increase awareness about \nalcohol and drug addiction and to promote treatment and recovery for \nour youth.\n  Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a disease that many individuals \nface as a painful, private struggle, often without access to treatment \nor medical care. But this disease also has staggering public costs. A \n1998 report prepared by The Lewin Group for the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, \nestimated the total economic cost of alcohol and drug abuse to be \napproximately $264 billion for 1992. Of this cost, an estimated $98 \nbillion was due to addiction to illicit drugs and other drugs taken for \nnon-medical purposes. This estimate includes addiction treatment and \nprevention costs, as well as costs associated with related illnesses, \nreduced job productivity or lost earnings, and other costs to society \nsuch as crime and social welfare programs.\n  Adults and children who have the disease of addiction can be found \nthroughout our society. We know from the outstanding research done at \nthe National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of \nHealth that although there were improvements in 1999 in some areas of \ndrug use, the use of illicit drugs among our 13-18 year old children \nhas increased significantly, particularly in the use of alcohol, \nEcstasy, anabolic-androgenic\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\nsteroids, and heroin. More than half of our nation's 12th graders \nreported that they have tried an illicit drug, and more than one-\nquarter have tried a drug other than marijuana. And, although the \nconsumption of alcohol is illegal for those under 21 years of age, more \nthan 10 million current drinkers are age 12 to 20.\n  The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) \nhas recognized that the number one priority for the nation's National \nDrug Control Strategy is to educate and enable America's youth to \nreject illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco. And yet, 80% of \nadolescents needing treatment are unable to access services because of \nthe severe lack of coverage for addiction treatment or the \nunavailability of treatment programs or trained health care providers \nin their community. The 1998 Hay Group Report revealed that the overall \nvalue of substance abuse treatment benefits has decreased by 74.5% from \n1988 through 1998, leaving our youth without sufficient medical care \nfor this disease when they are most vulnerable.\n  We know that addiction to alcohol and other drugs contribute to other \nproblems as well. Addictive substances have the potential for \ndestroying the person who is addicted, as well as his or her family. We \nknow, for example, that fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading known \ncause of mental retardation. If a woman who was addicted to alcohol \ncould receive proper treatment, fetal alcohol syndrome for her baby \nwould be 100 percent preventable, and more than 12,000 infants born in \nthe U.S. each year would not suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome, with \nits irreversible physical and mental damage.\n  We know too of the devastation caused by addiction when violence \nbetween people is one of the consequences. A 1998 SAMHSA report \noutlined the links between domestic violence and substance abuse. We \nknow from clinical reports that 25-50% of men who commit acts of \ndomestic violence also have substance abuse problems. The report \nrecognized the link between the victim of abuse and use of alcohol and \ndrugs, and recommended that after the woman's safety has been \naddressed, the next step would be to help with providing treatment for \nher addiction as a step toward independence and health, and toward the \nprevention of the consequences for the children who suffer the same \nabuse either directly, or indirectly by witnessing spousal violence.\n  The physical, emotional, and social harm caused by this disease is \nboth preventable and treatable. We know from the outstanding research \nconducted at NIH, through the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the \nNational Institute on Alcoholism, that treatment for drug and alcohol \naddiction can be effective. The effectiveness of treatment is the major \nfinding from a NIDA-sponsored nationwide study of drug abuse treatment \noutcomes. The Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS) tracked 10,000 \npeople in nearly 100 treatment programs in 11 cities who entered \ntreatment for addiction between 1991 and 1993. Results showed that for \nall four treatment types studied, there were significant reductions in \ndrug use after treatment. Moreover, treatment resulted in other \npositive changes in behavior, such as fewer psychological symptoms and \nincreased work productivity.\n  Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a disease that affects the brain, \nthe body, and the spirit. We must provide adequate opportunities for \nthe treatment of addiction in order to help those who are suffering and \nto prevent the health and social problems that it causes, and we know \nthat the costs to do so are very low. A 1999 study by the Rand \nCorporation found that the cost to managed care health plans is now \nonly about $5 per person per year for unlimited substance abuse \ntreatment benefits to employees of big companies. A 1997 Milliman and \nRobertson study found that complete substance abuse treatment parity \nwould increase per capita health insurance premiums by only one half of \none percent, or less than $1 per member per month--without even \nconsidering any of the obvious savings that will result from treatment. \nSeveral studies have shown that for every $1 spent on treatment, more \nthan $7 is saved in other health care expenses. These savings are in \naddition to the financial and other benefits of increased productivity, \nas well as participation in family and community life. Providing \ntreatment for addiction also saves millions of dollars in the criminal \njustice system. But for treatment to be effective and helpful \nthroughout our society all systems of care--including private insurance \nplans--must share this responsibility.\n  The National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month in the year \n2000 celebrates the tremendous strides taken by individuals who have \nundergone successful treatment and recognizes those in the treatment \nfield who have dedicated their lives to helping our young people \nrecover from addiction. Many individuals, families, organizations, and \ncommunities give generously of their time and expertise to help those \nsuffering from addiction and to help them to achieve recovery and \nproductive, healthy lives. The Recovery Month events being planned \nthroughout our nation, including one in St. Paul, Minnesota, on \nSeptember 18, will recognize the countless numbers of those who have \nsuccessfully recovered from addiction and who are living proof that \npeople of all races, genders, and ages recover every day from the \ndisease of alcohol and drug addiction, and now make positive \ncontributions to their families, workplaces, communities, state, and \nnation.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this resolution designating the month of \nSeptember, 2000, as Recover Month, and to take part in the many local \nand national activities and events recognizing this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/11/senate-section/article/S8345-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTIONS 352--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF REPRESENTATIVE HERBERT \n                        H.

ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to alter or modify \n     the Arms Export Control Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         KYL AMENDMENT NO. 4133\n\n  Mr. KYL proposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. 4444, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 5, line 12, after ``China'', insert ``and Taiwan as \n     separate customs territories''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in recent days, there have been some \ndisturbing moves by China to block Taiwan's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO), despite China's previous assurances to the United \nStates that it would not do so. As recently as Thursday, September 7, \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said that China wanted its \nclaim to sovereignty over Taiwan written into the terms of the WTO's \nrules, stating ``The Chinese side has a consistent and clear position: \nTaiwan can join WTO as a separate customs territory of China.''\n  This statement by China's Foreign Ministry spokesman comes on the \nheels of earlier efforts by China to block Taiwan's WTO entry. As the \nWall Street Journal reported in July:\n\n       ``. . . as WTO staff members draw up the so-called protocol \n     agreements--the reams of paper that define exactly what \n     concessions China will make in order to gain entry into the \n     organization--China is insisting that its claim over Taiwan \n     be recognized in the legal language . . . chief Chinese \n     negotiator Long Yongtu said . . . such a stand ``is a matter \n     of principle for us'' . . . That would upset a consensus \n     within the WTO that Taiwan should be allowed to enter the \n     club as a separate economic area--that is, not an independent \n     country, but also not as an explicit part of China. Some WTO \n     members have argued that Taiwan has long since fulfilled its \n     requirements to join the club and its application has been \n     held up only to satisfy China's demand that Taiwan shouldn't \n     win entry to the organization first.\n\n  In order to help ensure that China lives up to its promises to the \nUnited States, and that Taiwan's entry to the WTO is not unnecessarily \nimpeded, today I am filing an amendment to H.R. 4444, the bill to \nprovide permanent normal trade status to China. The current text of \nH.R. 4444 states that the extension of permanent normal trade relations \nto China ``shall become effective no earlier than the effective date of \nthe accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade \nOrganization.'' My amendment would add one additional condition, \nstating that permanent normal trade relations with China ``shall become \neffective no earlier than the effective date of the accession of the \nPeople's Republic of China and Taiwan as separate customs territories \nto the World Trade Organization.''\n  My amendment reinforces the message the Clinton administration has \nsent to China on previous occasions, and it is my hope that this \namendment will remove any ambiguity about America's resolve to support \nTaiwan's WTO admission. Earlier this week, I received a letter from \nPresident Clinton that responded to a letter I sent him in July along \nwith 30 other Senators, that sought assurances that his administration \nremained committed to Taiwan's entry to the WTO. In the letter the \nPresident stated that, ``My administration remains firmly committed to \nthe goal of WTO General Council approval of the accession packages for \nChina and Taiwan at the same session.'' The President's letter went on \nto say that ``China has made clear on many occasions, and at high \nlevels, that it will not oppose Taiwan's accession to the \nWTO. Nevertheless, China did submit proposed language to their working \nparty stating that Taiwan is a separate customs territory of China. We \nhave advised the Chinese that such language is inappropriate and \nirrelevant to the work of the working party and that we will not accept \nit.''\n\n  As the President acknowledged in the letter, despite previous \nassurances by China and the administration that Taiwan will be admitted \nto the WTO without opposition, under the surface there is a problem. As \nit always does, China is using yet another diplomatic opportunity to \nassert its view that Taiwan is nothing more than a province of China.\n  It is important for the Congress and the administration to work \ntogether to support Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization \n(WTO). First because of the economic benefits that its entry would \nbring. Secondly, because of the need to meet our commitments to our \nclose and longstanding ally. And third, due to our desire to defend and \npromote democratic governments, with free markets, that respect the \nrule of law and the human rights of their people.\n  Based on its importance to the world economy, Taiwan should be \nadmitted to the WTO. It has the 19th largest economy and is the 14th \nlargest trading nation in the world. Taiwan's economy is also closely \nlinked to the U.S. It is America's 8th largest trading partner and \npurchases more American goods than many of our other major trading \npartners, like mainland China, Australia, and Italy. U.S. trade with \nTaiwan should continue to grow. Over two years ago, we signed a \nbilateral WTO agreement with Taiwan that included significant reduction \nin tariffs and other barriers for exports of a variety of U.S. goods \nand services, including agriculture goods, automotive products, and \npharmaceuticals. The admission of Taiwan to the WTO ensures that market \nbarriers to U.S. products will remain low and American companies will \nhave a means to solve disputes over intellectual property and other \nmatters.\n  Taiwan has been negotiating to become a member of the WTO since 1990 \nand has met the substantive conditions for membership. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, it has completed agreements with each \nof the 26 WTO members that requested bilateral negotiations, and has \nheld 10 meetings with the WTO Working Party in Geneva, resolving all \nsubstantive issues surrounding its admission.\n  China has insisted that Taiwan can get into the WTO only after it \ndoes,\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\nand has lobbied other countries to support this position. In the past, \nClinton administration officials have assured us that Taiwan's \naccession would closely follow China's. In February, U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Charlene Barshefsky testified to the House of \nRepresentatives that ``. . . the only issue with respect to Taiwan's \naccession . . . pertains to timing . . . there is a tacit understanding \n. . . among WTO members in general--but also, frankly, between China \nand Taiwan--that China would enter first and China would not block in \nany way Taiwan's accession thereafter, and that might be immediately \nthereafter or within days or hours or seconds or weeks. . . .'' Later \nthat same month, in response to a statement by Senator Roth that ``. . \n. there's a great deal of concern that Taiwan might be blocked [from \nentering the WTO] once China secures such membership,'' Ambassador \nBarshefsky testified that ``. . . the United States would do everything \nin our power to ensure that that does not happen in any respect because \nTaiwan's entry is also critical.''\n  The WTO plays an important role in promoting free and fair trade. \nUnder the WTO, member countries agree on a set of rules and principles \nfor trade, which in turn creates a stable and predictable trade \nenvironment. Secondly, the WTO provides a mechanism to enforce these \nrules, including a procedure for countries to resolve trade disputes. \nAnd finally, the WTO provides a forum for negotiations to reduce trade \nbarriers worldwide.\n  Since the founding of its predecessor GATT in 1984, membership in the \norganization has grown from 23 countries to 136 today. The general view \namong economist is that a more predictable trade environment, and a \nreduction of trade barriers, has contributed to the unprecedented \neconomic prosperity that most countries currently enjoy. Statistics \nsupport this view: In 1998, world exports were 18 times larger than in \n1950, and world GDP was 6 times greater in 1998 than 1950, according to \nthe Congressional Research Service.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the United States should support Taiwan's \nadmission to the WTO, not merely for economic reasons, but also to \nhonor our commitments to a close, long-standing ally, and to \ndemonstrate our intention to support democracies that respect the rule \nof law.\n  When our Nation switched diplomatic recognition to mainland China, we \nalso enacted the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to state our continued \ncommitment to the security of Taiwan. This law states, ``. . . the \nUnited States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the \nPeople's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future \nof Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means.'' It goes on to say the \nU.S. would ``. . . consider any effort to determine the future of \nTaiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or \nembargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific \narea and of grave concern to the United States.'' And finally, it says \nthe U.S. will sell ``. . . defense articles and defense services in \nsuch quantity as many be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a \nsufficient self-defense capability.''\n  China's leaders have steadfastly refused to renounce the use of force \nin retaking Taiwan, and have issued thinly veiled threats to use \nnuclear weapons should the U.S. intervene. For example, in March, the \nmain newspaper of China's military said, ``China is neither Iraq nor \nYugoslavia, but a very special country . . . it is a country that has \ncertain abilities of launching a strategic counterattack and the \ncapacity of launching a long-distance strike. Probably it is not a wise \nmove to be at war with a country like China, a point which U.S. \npolicymakers know fairly well.'' Another article in a Chinese military-\nowned newspaper went further, saying, ``The United States will not \nsacrifice 200 million Americans for 20 million Taiwanese. They will \nfinally acknowledge the difficulty and withdraw.''\n  In outlining what became known as the ``Truman Doctrine,'' President \nHarry Truman said:\n\n       At the present moment in world history nearly every nation \n     must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is \n     too often not a free one. One way of life is based upon the \n     will of the majority, and is distinguished by free \n     institutions, representative government, free elections, \n     guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and \n     religion, and freedom from political oppression. The second \n     way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly \n     imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and \n     oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, \n     and the suppression of personal freedoms. I believe that is \n     must be the policy of the United States to support free \n     peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed \n     minorities or outside pressures. I believe that we must \n     assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their \n     own way.\n\n  Harry Truman spoke these words in 1947, at a time when it was very \ndifficult to stand up to communism on the march from the Soviet Union. \nThe challenge we face today in dealing with China and Taiwan should not \nbe as great as the courageous struggle for the cold war.
