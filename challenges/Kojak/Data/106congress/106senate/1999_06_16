Mr. President, the Senate will begin now 10 minutes of \ndebate on S. 1205, the military appropriations construction bill, \nfollowed by 20 minutes of debate on S. 331, the work incentives \nlegislation. Votes on passage of those two bills will begin at \napproximately 10:45.

So we have two votes then, at approximately \n10:45 and another one at 12:30, and then we probably will have at least \none more, maybe two, with regard to the energy and water appropriations \nbill, and then we will go back to the oil and gas revolving fund.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7039-5", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1205 which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1205) making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form with an additional \n5 minutes for the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The distinguished Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will have to ask some of the staff but I \nthink Mr. McCain will not be present to make his statement this \nmorning. I will make mine, and then we will work that out later.\n  I am pleased to bring before the Senate the military construction \nappropriations bill and report for fiscal year 2000. The bill reflects \na bipartisan approach that the ranking member, Senator Murray of the \nState of Washington, and I have tried to maintain regarding military \nconstruction and this subcommittee.\n  This isn't the first year we have put this bill together. We are \ngetting to be old hands at it. But I want to say personally it is a \npleasure to work with the Senator and her staff. It seems as if we have \na lot of luck in working out some of the problems some people would run \ninto before we ever get the bill to the floor. So those problems are \ntaken care of. I appreciate the attitude and manner in which we have \nworked together on this bill.\n  This bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee on \nJune 10 by a unanimous vote of 28 to nothing. The bill recommended by \nthe full Committee on Appropriations is $8,273,820,000.\n  The administration submitted the fiscal year 2000 military \nconstruction budget with all of the military construction and family \nhousing projects incrementally funded over a 2-year period. We are \nfinding that some of that is working and some of it is not, and we will \nprobably be looking at this in a different light in another year.\n  To have proceeded in this manner would have demonstrated a poor \nfinancial stewardship on the part of the Senate and placed the \nDepartment's 2000 military construction program in great jeopardy. That \nis the reason we are taking a look at it. The subcommittee rejected \nthat recommendation and provided full funding for all of the \nconstruction projects.\n  Accordingly, the bill is $2.8 billion over the budget request, but \nthe bill is\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\nstill $176 million less than what was appropriated just a year ago. \nHowever, more important, the legislation reflects a reduction of $1.7 \nbillion from just 3 years ago.\n  We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to the Senate. We believe \nit addresses key military construction requirements for readiness, \nfamily housing, barracks, quality of life, and of course we do not want \nto forget our Guard and our Reserve components.\n  This bill honors the commitment we have to our Armed Forces. It helps \nensure that the housing and infrastructure needs of the military are \ngiven proper recognition.\n  Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within \nthe committee's 302(b) budget allocations for both budget authority and \noutlays.\n  This bill has some points I want to mention. We have added $485 \nmillion above the budget request to provide better and more modern \nfamily housing for our service personnel and their families.\n  Just less than a month ago, we opened a new housing unit at Malmstrom \nAir Force Base in Montana. I said at that time, and I still mean it, \nthere is no better way to send a strong message to our fighting men and \nwomen than to provide them with good housing in a good atmosphere and \nthe greatest way we can say we care.\n  On another quality of life measure, we added substantially to the \nbudget request for barracks construction projects, some $587 million \nfor 47 projects throughout the United States and overseas.\n  I say right now to the American people, we have American troops \ndeployed in over 70 countries around the world.\n  This funding will provide single service members a more favorable \nliving environment wherever they are stationed.\n  The committee also fully funds the budget request of $245 million for \nfunding 25 environmental compliance projects.\n  We also addressed the shortfalls that continue to plague our reserve \ncomponents.\n  I continue to be greatly alarmed that the Department of Defense takes \nno responsibility for ensuring that our reserve components have \nadequate facilities.\n  Their lack of disregard for the total force concept very much \nconcerns me and a number of our colleagues.\n  This comes at a time when our country is so heavily dependent on the \nGuard and Reserve to maintain our presence around the world.\n  For example, the President's budget requested funding of only $77 \nmillion for all of the Reserve components and the National Guard.\n  Recognizing this chronic shortfall, we have again lent support by \nadding $560 million to these accounts.\n  In each case, the funds will help satisfy essential mission, quality \nof life or readiness requirements.\n  We fully funded the budget request for the base realignment and \nclosure account by providing $706 million to continue the ongoing brac \nprocess.\n  All of the projects that we have recommended were thoroughly screened \nto ensure that they meet a series of defensible criteria and that they \nwere authorized in the defense authorization bill.\n  We will work very closely with the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nas we put together a conference package for military construction.\n  There are many other issues that I could speak about at this time. I \nurge the Members of the Senate to support this bill and move it forward \nexpeditiously.\n  I yield the floor for the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague, Chairman \nBurns, in recommending the fiscal year 2000 military construction bill \nto the Senate for approval.\n  I begin by thanking him and his staff for being so great to work \nwith. He is right, we are old hands but not that old; and it is great \nto work with him.\n  This bill, which was reported with the unanimous approval of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee last week, bears little resemblance to \nthe spending structure proposed by the administration last winter. The \nadministration, in what I consider to be a misguided effort to free up \nmore money for defense spending, proposed a buy-now, pay-later military \nconstruction bill. The subcommittee carefully analyzed the \nadministration's plan. We had numerous briefings as well as two \nsubcommittee hearings. Our conclusion was that split funding not only \nwould set a dangerous precedent but also would jeopardize the integrity \nof the entire military construction program.\n  At the recommendation of the Military Construction Subcommittee, the \nAppropriations Committee wisely rejected the administration's proposal \nfor incremental funding. With the help of our chairman and ranking \nmember, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, we were able to fully fund \nour Military Construction Program. Moreover, we were able to surmount \nthe woefully inadequate amounts of funding that the administration \nsought to spread over the full 2-year construction program. In the end, \nwe increased construction funding for active duty components by $278 \nmillion over the administration's total request, and for reserve \ncomponents by nearly $388 million over the request.\n  We achieved these increases by judicious reductions in other \naccounts, such as the base realignment and closure account, without \njeopardizing the pace of ongoing work. Senator Burns and his staff \ndeserve a great deal of credit for the thoughtful and careful approach \nthat they took in the drafting of this bill. As always, they have \nworked hard to produce a balanced, bipartisan product that takes into \naccount both the concerns of the Senate and the needs of the military.\n  In particular, they have done a superb job of continuing to shine the \nspotlight on the quality of life projects that are so important to our \nmen and women in uniform, and to their families. At a time when \nmilitary enlistment and retention are in free fall, and the services \ncannot hope to match the financial incentives of the private sector, \nquality of life issues are magnified in importance. They do not \ndiminish the importance of readiness projects, but they are a factor in \nrecruiting and retaining our military personnel.\n  Within the budget constraints that we are all forced to operate this \nyear, this bill attempts to meet the most urgent and most timely of the \nmilitary construction projects available. All of the major construction \nprojects that we have funded have been authorized. In addition, we have \nensured adequate funding for family housing and barracks construction, \nand we have suggested that the Department of Defense revisit the issue \nof housing privatization to determine if it is a workable solution to \nour military housing needs.\n  Even so, this bill is $176 million below the military construction \nbill enacted last year. This continues the recent, and troubling, \ndownward spiral in military construction investment. During a year in \nwhich the Congress has made great strides toward addressing the need to \nenhance defense readiness and military personnel spending, it is \ndisappointing--and in my opinion, shortsighted--to see defense \ninfrastructure needs struggling to keep pace.\n  This is an extremely important bill for our Nation and our military \nforces. I again commend Senator Burns and his staff for their excellent \nwork in producing the bill, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as United States military forces deploy \ninto war-torn Kosovo for another protracted, costly stay of \nindeterminate duration and of considerable potential risk, I am left \nwondering why, with all of the readiness and modernization problems \nthat are well-established matters of record, we felt compelled to add \nover $6 million in this bill for a new Visiting Officers Quarters at \nNiagara Falls. Is this really the message we want to send to our \nmilitary personnel and to the American taxpayer. I think not.\n  The propensity of members of Congress to devote enormous time and \nenergy to adding items to spending bills for primarily parochial \nconsiderations remains one of our most serious weaknesses. The \nimplications for national defense, however, are no laughing matter. \nThose of us who serve on the Armed Services Committee have heard a \ngreat deal of testimony from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as from\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\nregional and functional commanders in chief, of the impact \nextraordinarily high operational tempos are having on both near- and \nlong-term military readiness. And we hear it directly from troops in \nthe field. They are tired; repeated deployments and declining quality \nof life has taken a toll. A vicious cycle has emerged wherein the \nimpact of high deployment rates and shrinking force structure are \nexacerbated by the flight of skilled personnel out of the service as a \nresult of those trends.\n  So I have to wonder why, given the scale of the problems documented, \nwe are adding $12 million to the budget for new visitors quarters at \nDover Air Force Base, $12 million for a Regional Training Institute in \nHawaii, $3 million for a Marine Corps Reserve Center in Louisiana, $8.9 \nmillion for a C-130J simulator facility in Mississippi, $8 million for \nthe Red Butte Dam in Utah, and $15 million for an Armed Forces Reserve \nCenter in Oregon. None of these projects--none of them--were requested \nby the Department of Defense, and none of them are on the services' \nUnfunded Priority Lists. Unrequested projects totaling $985 million--\nalmost $1 billion--was added to this bill, on top of the $5 billion in \nmember-adds included in the defense appropriations bill passed last \nweek.\n  I have asked rhetorically on the floor of the Senate many times when \nwe are going to stop this destructive and irresponsible practice of \nadding projects to the defense budget primarily for parochial reasons. \nI have yet to receive an answer. Certainly, the practice has neither \nstopped nor slowed. The last minute insertion in the defense \nappropriations bill of $220 million for four F-15 fighters not \nrequested by the Air Force solely for the purpose of appeasing hometown \nconstituencies was one of the more disgraceful acts I've witnessed \nsince, well, since we went through the same exercise last year. The \ntotal in unrequested items between the defense and military \nconstruction appropriations bills is almost $6 billion. That is serious \nmoney.\n  As American pilots continue to patrol the skies over Iraq, maintain a \ntenuous peace in Bosnia, and proceed into uncharted terrain in Kosovo, \nwe would do well to consider the ramifications of our actions. I'm \nunder no illusions, however, that such contemplation will occur. It is \napparently, and sadly, not in our nature.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying list be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  MILCON appropriations adds for FY 00\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n                            ALABAMA\n \nMaxwell AFB: Off.

Mr. President, the pending Military Construction \nAppropriations bill provides $8.3 billion in new budget authority and \n$2.5 billion in new outlays for Military Construction and Family \nHousing programs and other purposes for the Department of Defense for \nfiscal year 2000.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the outlays for the 2000 program total \n$8.8 billion.\n  Compared to 1999 appropriations, this bill is $385 million lower in \nbudget authority, and it is $622 million lower in outlays.\n  This legislation provides for construction by the Department of \nDefense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it \nprovides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. \nmilitary services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and \nquality of life programs for our service men and women.\n  The bill is within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished \nsubcommittee Chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill \nto the floor within the subcommittee's allocation.\n  The bill provides an important and necessary increase in budget \nauthority above the President's request for 2000. Most of the $2.8 \nbillion increase fully funds projects that the President's request only \npartially funded. Because the bill supports appropriate full funding \nbudgeting practices and because it funds highly important quality of \nlife programs for our armed services, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nrelationship of the bill to the subcommittee's section 302(b) \nallocation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      S. 1205, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, 2000, SPENDING\n                    COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    General\n             Category               purpose   Crime   Mandatory   Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget authority...............    8,274   .......  .........   8,274\n  Outlays........................    8,789   .......  .........   8,789\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...............    8,274   .......  .........   8,274\n  Outlays........................    8,789   .......  .........   8,789\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority...............    8,659   .......  .........   8,659\n  Outlays........................    9,411   .......  .........   9,411\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...............    5,438   .......  .........   5,438\n  Outlays........................    8,921   .......  .........   8,921\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...............  ........  .......  .........  .......\n  Outlays........................  ........  .......  .........  .......\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \n Senate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...............  ........  .......  .........  .......\n  Outlays........................  ........  .......  .........  .......\n1999 level:\n  Budget authority...............

Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with scorekeeping conventions. Prepared by SBC Majority\n  Staff, 06/14/99.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the speedy passage of S. 1205, the fiscal year 2000 \nmilitary construction appropriations bill. I compliment both Chairman \nBurns and the ranking member, Senator Murray, for their excellent work \nin producing a bill that won the unanimous endorsement of the \nsubcommittee. I am sure the bill will receive a similar degree of \nsupport from the entire Senate. I must also commend Senators Burns and \nMurray for rejecting the President's premature and irresponsible \nattempt to incrementally fund these essential projects. The Congress \nmust continue to send this President the clear and consistent message \nthat his fiscal negligence toward our Armed Forces will not be \ntolerated.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight two of the four important \nmilitary construction projects for Arkansas included in this bill. The \nfirst is an $8.7 million project for Little Rock Air Force Base. This \nproject is comprised of three new facilities, and the renovation of a \nfourth, that will greatly enhance the mission capabilities of the 189th \nAirlift Wing, Arkansas National Guard. The new Communications, Vehicle \nMaintenance and Civil Engineering/Medical Services facilities along \nwith the renovated Aircraft Support building will stand as visible \nreminders of the Federal Government's commitment of Little Rock Air \nForce Base's bright future as an essential component of our nation's \nsecurity.\n  The other military construction project I would like to highlight is \none that the Subcommittee wisely added to the President's insufficient \nproposal. I am speaking about the inclusion of an $18 million Chemical \nDefense Quality Evaluation Facility to be constructed at the Pine Bluff \nArsenal.\n  Pine Bluff Arsenal presently serves as the Department of Defense's \nprimary maintenance and certification facility for chemical and \nbiological defense equipment such as gas masks for our soldiers and air \nfilters for M-1 tanks. The Department of Defense describes the present \nfacility as:\n\n     operating at maximum capacity, beyond levels consistent with \n     good laboratory practice, with no space for [expansion].\n\n  According to the Department of Defense:\n\n     if this project is not provided, inadequate . . . stockpile \n     surveillance testing will continue, with an undefined chance \n     that defective, deteriorated or damaged protective equipment \n     or components could be accepted or retained in stock for \n     issue. This risk directly endangers the worker in a toxic \n     chemical environment or the soldier facing toxic chemicals in \n     a combat situation. [DOD] cannot ensure reliability of \n     [chemical and biological] equipment without . . . a suitable \n     test facility.\n\n  The construction of this new Chemical Defense Quality Evaluation \nFacility will reaffirm that defense against Weapons of Mass Destruction \nremains a national priority, and that the Pine Bluff Arsenal remains at \nthe forefront of America's efforts in that endeavor.\n  I will finish by again complimenting the subcommittee for its efforts \nin producing this legislation, and urge my colleagues to vote for its \nquick adoption.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to state my concern about a \nprovision in the Military Construction Appropriations Bill for Fiscal \nYear 2000 that the Senate is considering today. I am very concerned \nabout the potential effects of Section 129 of the bill relating to the \nchemical weapons demilitarization program planned for the Bluegrass \nArmy Depot.\n  My concern, simply stated, is that Section 129 could delay the \nchemical demilitarization process beyond the deadline for destroying \nall our chemical weapons under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). \nThis provision, which would levy additional requirements before \ndemilitarization work can begin at the depot, could prevent the United \nStates from complying with its obligations under the CWC.\n  The Administration shares my concern and strongly opposes this \nprovision of S. 1205. In fact, their opposition is stated in the first \nitem listed in the\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\nStatement of Administration Policy regarding this bill. Here's what the \nAdministration has to say about this matter:\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes Section 129, which \n     would require the demonstration of six alternative \n     technologies to chemical weapons incineration before \n     construction of the Chemical Demilitarization facility at \n     Bluegrass, Kentucky could begin. Prompt construction of the \n     Bluegrass site is critical to ensuring U.S. compliance with \n     the deadline for chemical weapons destruction agreed to under \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Department of Defense \n     has demonstrated three alternative technologies, one more \n     than required by P.L. 104-208, the Omnibus Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act of 1997. This provision would delay \n     construction of the Bluegrass site by at least one year, \n     resulting in a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     deadline.\n\n  The President of the United States signed the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and the Senate provided its advice and consent to \nratification of that treaty. The treaty is now in force and the United \nStates is a party to it, so we are bound by its terms and requirements. \nI am very disturbed and dismayed that the United States is not in \ncompliance with this treaty, a situation that could worsen if \nlegislation such as contained in Section 129 is enacted into law.\n  I remind my fellow Senators that the United States has still not \ngathered and declared information regarding U.S. industrial chemical \nfacilities that is required by the treaty. In addition, the U.S. has \nnot complied with treaty provisions governing inspections of military \nfacilities authorizing the use of treaty-approved inspection equipment. \nFinally, the implementing legislation for the CWC contains provisions \nthat are antithetical to treaty provisions. Should the President \nexercise the option approved in the implementing legislation to refuse \na challenge inspection, such action would directly contravene both the \nintent and the letter of the treaty that entered into force. I urge my \nfellow Senators to be aware of these problems and to support efforts to \nresolve them so that the United States can become compliant with its \ninternational treaty obligations and assume the leadership needed in \norder to make this treaty effective.\n  One of the central requirements of the Chemical Weapons Convention is \nthat parties must destroy their chemical weapons stockpile within 10 \nyears of the date of entry into force of the treaty. That means that \nthe United States must destroy all its chemical weapons by April 29, \n2007. I am concerned that Section 129 of this bill would prevent the \nUnited States from meeting its legal obligation to destroy all its \nchemical weapons before this deadline. I believe it would be both \nunwise and unnecessary to enact legislation that would have the effect \nof preventing the United States from meeting one of its treaty \nobligations.\n  To be specific, Section 129 would prevent the obligation or \nexpenditure of any funds made available by the Military Construction \nAppropriations Act or any other Act for the purpose relating to \nconstruction of a facility at Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky for \ndemilitarization of chemical weapons until the Secretary of Defense \nreports to the Congress on the results of evaluating six alternative \ntechnologies to the current baseline incineration process for \ndestroying chemical weapons.\n  While this may sound quite reasonable, it poses a problem that I want \nto highlight. It would effectively delay the chemical demilitarization \nprocess at Bluegrass to the point that we would likely not be able to \nmeet the Chemical Weapons Convention. This is because it would add a \nnew requirement to demonstrate and evaluate three additional \nalternative destruction technologies, and for the Secretary of Defense \nto report to the Congress on those additional technologies before any \ndemilitarization construction funding could be used at the Bluegrass \nDepot.\n  There are currently three alternative technologies being considered \nby the Defense Department under the Assembled Chemical Weapons \nAssessment (ACWA) program. This program was established in law several \nyears ago, but the law required the Department to evaluate at least two \nalternative technologies---not six. Section 129 would add the \nrequirement to evaluate four additional technologies which will take \nadditional time and money. That will result in a one-year delay in \nstarting the chemical demilitarization process at Bluegrass which would \nprevent the U.S. from destroying all the chemical weapons there before \nthe CWC deadline.\n  I note that the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member, has \nno provision in the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2000 \nthat places any restriction on the chemical demilitarization program. \nIn fact, the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, on \nwhich I serve as the Ranking Member, included report language that \nemphasizes the importance of meeting our CWC Treaty obligation to \ndestroy all of our chemical weapons by the treaty deadline. Moreover, \nthe Defense Authorization bill which passed the Senate on May 27, 1999, \nfully funds the Defense Department's request for funds for the chemical \ndemilitarization program.\n  I do not believe that it is the intent of this provision or of its \nsponsors to prevent the United States from meeting its treaty \nobligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, or to force the U.S. \nto violate the treaty. Therefore, I urge my fellow Senators during the \nforthcoming conference on the Military Construction Appropriations bill \nto support modifications to Section 129 so that the bill will not have \nthis unintended effect. I'm certain that my colleagues agree that it is \nessential for the Senate to take all actions necessary to ensure that \nwe uphold our treaty obligations just as we would demand of other \nstates. Modification of Section 129 would constitute such an action.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1205, the \nMilitary Construction Appropriations bill. I congratulate Chairman \nBurns and the ranking member, Senator Murray, for crafting a spending \nbill which addresses the critical priorities of America's soldiers in a \nprudent and effective manner.\n  This year's Administration submission made the task of the Committee \nmore difficult than at any time since I have been a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee. By suggesting that Congress \nincrementally fund all military construction programs, the \nAdministration charted a course for failure and left Senators Burns and \nMurray to clean up the mess. They have done so admirably and I am proud \nto support their efforts.\n  While I strongly support the entire bill before the Senate today, I \nwould like to take just a moment of the Senate's time to explain a \nparticular section of the bill. Section 129 of this measure was \nincluded at my request and deals with the construction of chemical \ndemilitarization facilities at the Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky. \nSpecifically, this provision would prohibit such construction until the \nSecretary of Defense reports on the completed demonstration of 6 \nalternatives to baseline incineration as a means of destroying \nAmerica's chemical weapons stockpile.\n  I think it is important to state first what this amendment does not \ndo. This language will have no impact on any proposed funding in the \nFY00 military construction bill. The reason is that the prohibition on \nspending for construction at Bluegrass Army Depot applies only to \nfacilities which are technology specific. This means that construction \nfor buildings which will be necessary regardless of the method of \ndestruction employed at Bluegrass is permitted. This allows for \nprogress on necessary components for eventual demilitarization \nactivities such as administrative facilities, but prohibits \nconstruction of the actual treatment facility to be deployed in \nKentucky until the Secretary certifies that demonstration of the six \nalternatives is complete.\n  It is also not my intent to delay or avoid destruction of the \nstockpile in Kentucky. My sole purpose is to ensure that when the \nweapons stored in Kentucky are destroyed only the safest most effective \nmethod is utilized. Once the Secretary certifies that all six \nalternative technologies have been demonstrated--and this can occur in \nthe very near future--technology specific efforts at Bluegrass may \nbegin. I supported ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and \nbelieve that the United States should do everything it can to meet the \nApril 2007 deadline. The language contained in Section 129 should have \nno adverse impact on the\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\nU.S. being able to satisfy its Chemical Weapons Convention obligations.\n  Now that I have offered an explanation as to what this language will \nnot do, let me describe what I hope it will accomplish. Quite simply, \nthis is a continuation of my efforts to push the military to recognize \nthat public safety should be the top priority as America eliminates its \nchemical weapons in compliance with the CWC. The Army's selection of \nincineration as their preferred technology dates all the way back to \n1982--almost 20 years ago. It is unreasonable, and in fact \nirresponsible, to assume that there have been no technological \nadvancements since that time which could lead to improved methods of \ndisposal. Only ten years ago few would have predicted the dynamic \nnature of the Internet would provide Americans instant access to \ninformation around the globe. Given that example, why has the \ndepartment chosen to ignore potential strides in chemical weapons \ndestruction? Why then has the safety of those Americans who live near \nchemical weapons destruction sites taken a back seat to fiscal and \ncalendar concerns?\n  In an effort to force the Department to consider the possibility of \nalternatives to incineration, I offered and the Senate accepted an \namendment to the FY97 Defense Appropriations bill which established the \nAssembled Chemical Weapons Assessment program. As I previously stated, \nthis program identified a total of six technologies as suitable for \ndemonstration. Unfortunately the Department has chosen to fund only \nthree. As a result of the Department's decision to not fully test each \ntechnology, much of the good will established by the program has \neroded. Continued DOD intransigence will lead to well deserved \nskepticism regarding the eventual report issued by ACWA. The citizens \nwho are counting on the federal government's honest assessment of how \nto proceed deserve the security of knowing that all viable options were \nappropriately considered.\n  I have outlined the hypocrisy of the Department's argument in a floor \nstatement I made on June 8, 1999, and so I will not repeat myself at \nthis point. Regardless of the Department's contention that funding for \nfurther testing is limited, I believe the interests of public safety \nfar outweigh any limited fiscal concerns. This is not a case of one \nSenator screaming that the ``sky is falling.'' Rather, this is an \neffort to hold the Department of Defense accountable for what should \nhave always been its first priority--the safety of potentially impacted \ncitizens. I will continue to press for full testing and accountability.\n  I thank my colleagues and urge their support for the Military \nConstruction bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7044-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7044-S7061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Personal \n     assistance services (such as attendant services, personal \n     assistance with transportation to and from work, reader \n     services, job coaches, and related assistance) remove many of \n     the barriers between significant disability and work. \n     Coverage for such services, as well as for prescription \n     drugs, durable medical equipment, and basic health care are \n     powerful and proven tools for individuals with significant \n     disabilities to obtain and retain employment.\n       (4) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing \n     health care and related services is one of the greatest \n     barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their \n     employment, earning potential, and independence.\n       (5) Individuals with disabilities who are beneficiaries \n     under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     401 et seq., 1381 et seq.) risk losing medicare or medicaid \n     coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that \n     is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of \n     cash benefits associated with working.\n       (6) Currently, less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of social \n     security disability insurance and supplemental security \n     income beneficiaries cease to receive benefits as a result of \n     employment.\n       (7) Beneficiaries have cited the lack of adequate \n     employment training and placement services as an additional \n     barrier to employment.\n       (8) If an additional \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the current \n     social security disability insurance (DI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) recipients were to cease receiving \n     benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social \n     Security Trust Funds in cash assistance would total \n     $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of the individuals.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide health care and employment preparation and \n     placement services to individuals with disabilities that will \n     enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on cash \n     benefit programs.\n       (2) To encourage States to adopt the option of allowing \n     individuals with disabilities to purchase medicaid coverage \n     that is necessary to enable such individuals to maintain \n     employment.\n       (3) To provide individuals with disabilities the option of \n     maintaining medicare coverage while working.\n       (4) To establish a return to work ticket program that will \n     allow individuals with disabilities to seek the services \n     necessary to obtain and retain employment and reduce their \n     dependency on cash benefit programs.\n         TITLE I--EXPANDED AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

The clerk will report the Roth amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 671.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.''):\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 671) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 20 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I said yesterday, ``The time has come.'' \nAnd, now finally it has. I said yesterday, ``Our friends with \ndisabilities have waited patiently.'' I say today, They are more than \npatient. They are saints with tolerance for congressional schedules. \nEveryone here--everyone in the White House, everyone in the other body, \nand because of e-mail, everyone in the country--knows I am referring to \nour pending consideration of landmark legislation, S. 331, the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  When I came to Congress in January 1975, one of my legislative \npriorities was providing access to the American dream for people with \ndisabilities.\n  Well, today, after 3 long years, endless hours of discussion and \ndrafting, and redrafting, we are about to remove the biggest remaining \nbarrier to the American dream for individuals with disabilities--access \nto health care if they work. What we are about to do was long in \ncoming. It is so important.\n  During the process that got us to this point, I have learned a great \ndeal. I suspect the same holds true for the 77 other cosponsors of this \nbill. People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if given \naccess to health care. This bill does just that--it gives workers with \ndisabilities access to appropriate health care--health care that is not \nreadily available or affordable from the private sector.\n  People with disabilities want to work, and will work, if given access \nto job training and job placement assistance. This bill does just \nthat--it gives individuals with disabilities training and help securing \na job.\n  The work Incentives Improvement Act empowers people with disabilities \nto control the quality of their lives, to pay State and Federal taxes, \nto return the investment that society has made in them, and most of \nall, the bill empowers them so they can go to work.\n  I thank my bipartisan original cosponsors Senators Kennedy, Roth, and \nMoynihan who, with me, created a sound piece of legislation to address \nthis real problem for millions of Americans with disabilities. Their \ncommitment represents the best of what the Senate can accomplish when \nsound policy is placed above partisanship and beyond who gets credit.\n  I also thank the additional, original 35 cosponsors of this bill and \nthe subsequent 42 cosponsors who represent a total of over three \nquarters of this body, perhaps a Senate record on health care \nlegislation.\n  Over the last two weeks the majority leader has been the driving \nforce that urged us to work out policy differences that were delaying \nfloor consideration. We did so through good faith efforts that \nbroadened support for the bill and reduced its overall modest cost.\n  In particular, I want to recognize Senators Nickles, Bunning and \nGramm for their willingness to reach consensus with us on policy \nwithout compromising the integrity of the legislation, thus, allowing \nS. 331 to move forward.\n  I especially give a heartfelt thanks to people with disabilities who \nworked with us, trusted us to do the right thing. With their support, \nencouragement, and energy we have done the right thing.\n  Yesterday the President asked us to give him a bill by July 4th, or \nat least July 26th, the 9th anniversary of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act. We can. We should, with 100 votes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time does each side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 6 minutes 6 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Massachusetts has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, today, we will pass landmark legislation to open the \nworkplace doors for disabled people in communities across this country. \nAt long last, once this measure is enacted into law, large numbers of \npeople with disabilities will have the opportunity to fulfill their \nhopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives.\n  A decade ago, when we enacted the Americans With Disabilities Act, we \npromised our disabled fellow citizens a new and better life in which \ndisability would no longer end the American dream. Too often, for too \nmany Americans, that promise has been unfulfilled. The Work Incentives \nImprovement Act will dramatically strengthen the fulfillment of that \npromise.\n\n  We know that millions of disabled men and women in this country want \nto work and are able to work. But they are denied the opportunity to do \nso, and the nation is denied their talents and their contributions to \nour communities.\n  Current laws are an anachronism. Modern medicine and modern \ntechnology are making it easier than ever before for disabled persons \nto have productive lives and careers. Yet current laws are often a \ngreater obstacle to that goal than the disability itself. It's \nridiculous that we punish disabled persons who dare to take a job by \npenalizing them financially, by taking away their health insurance \nlifeline, and by placing these unfair obstacles in their path.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act removes these unfair barriers to \nwork that face so many Americans with disabilities:\n  It makes health insurance available and affordable when a disabled \nperson goes to work, or develops a significant disability while \nworking.\n  It gives people with disabilities greater access to the services they \nneed to become successfully employed.\n  It phases out the loss of cash benefits as income rises, instead of \nthe unfair sudden cut-off that workers with disabilities face today.\n  It places work incentive planners in communities, rather than in \nbureaucracies, to help workers with disabilities learn how to obtain \nthe employment services and support they need.\n  Eliminating these barriers to work will help large numbers of \ndisabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency. We are a better and \nstronger and fairer country when we open the golden door of opportunity \nto all Americans, and enable them to be equal partners in the American \ndream. For millions of Americans with disabilities, this bill is a \ndeclaration of independence that can make the American dream come true.\n  We must banish the patronizing mind-set that disabled people are \nunable. In fact, they have enormous talent, and America cannot afford \nto waste an ounce of it.\n  Today's action is dedicated to the 54 million disabled American men \nand women who want to work and are able to work, but who face unfair \npenalties under current law if they take jobs and go to work. It is \ndedicated to the 12 million children and their families who will now \nhave the chance to dream of a future of work and prosperity, and not \ngovernment handouts.\n\n  Our goal is to remove the unconscionable barriers they face, and free \nup the enterprise, creativity, and contribution of these Americans. \nNow, when we say ``equal opportunity for all,'' it will be clear that \nwe mean all.\n  No one in America should lose their medical coverage, which can mean \nthe difference between life and death--if they go to work. No one in \nthis country should have to choose between buying a decent meal and \nbuying the medication they need.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act will remove these unfair barriers\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\nand continue to make health insurance available and affordable to \npeople with disabilities.\n  Many leaders in communities throughout the country have worked long \nand hard and well to help us reach this milestone. They are consumers, \nfamily members, citizens, and advocates. They see every day that our \ncurrent job programs are failing people with disabilities; and forcing \nthem and their families into poverty.\n  We have worked together for many months to develop effective ways to \nright these wrongs. To all of those who have done so much, I say thank \nyou for helping us to reach this long-awaited day. This bill truly \nrepresents legislation of the people, by the people and for the people.\n  Nearly a year ago, President Clinton signed an executive order to \nincrease employment and health care coverage for people with \ndisabilities. Today, with strong bipartisan support, the Senate is \ndemonstrating its commitment to our fellow disabled citizens.\n  I especially commend Senator Jeffords, Senator Roth, and Senator \nMoynihan for their indispensable leadership on this landmark \nlegislation. I also commend the many Senate staff members whose skilled \nassistance contributed so much to this achievement--Jennifer Baxendale \nand Alec Vachon of Senator Roth's staff, Kristin Testa and John Resnick \nof Senator Moynihan's staff, Chris Crowley, Jim Downing, and Pat \nMorrissey of Senator Jeffords' staff, and Michael Myers and Connie \nGarner of my own staff.\n  For far too long, disabled Americans have been left out and left \nbehind. Today, we are taking long overdue action to correct the \ninjustice they have unfairly suffered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I see Senator Roth is on the floor. I \ncontrol the time. I yield to him 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is an important day for millions of \nAmericans with disabilities--a day that presents the Senate with an \nopportunity to build on the legacy of the Americans With Disabilities \nAct. Today, we have a chance to help disabled Americans move toward \nindependence.\n  Despite the success of the Americans With Disabilities Act, there are \nstill serious obstacles facing too many people with disabilities--\nobstacles that stand in the way of employment.\n  Senators Jeffords, Moynihan, Kennedy, and I want to change that. \nAccordingly, in January we introduced S. 331, the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act of 1999.\n  This legislation has a simple objective--to help people with \ndisabilities go to work if they want to go to work, without fear of \nlosing their health insurance lifeline.\n  S. 331 has been one of my top priorities this year, and support for \nthe bill has been widespread. Mr. President, a total of 78 Senators now \nsponsor S. 331. Let me say that again--78 Senators have signed on to S. \n331. That would be a remarkable total for any bill, let alone a health \ncare proposal.\n  S. 331 is necessary because the unemployment rate among working-age \nadults with severe disabilities is nearly 75 percent. Many of these \nindividuals want to work. S. 331 will allow disabled individuals to \nwork without losing access to health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer afford to deny millions of talented \nAmericans the opportunity to contribute in the work force.\n  More than 300 national groups agree that it is time to act, including \norganizations representing veterans, people with disabilities, health \ncare providers, and insurers.\n  This bill is about helping disabled Americans work--if that is what \nthey want to do. It's about helping people reach their potential. It is \nnot about big government--it's about getting government out of the way \nof individual commitment and creativity.\n  And this bill isn't about a distinct and separate group of disabled \nindividuals. It is about all of us. Realistically, we are all just one \ntragedy away from confronting disability in our own families.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot prevent all disabilities. But we can prevent \nmaking disabled individuals choose between health care and employment. \nToday, we can take a step toward making that goal a reality.\n  Before we vote, I would be remiss if I did not thank Senator Jeffords \nand Senator Kennedy for their longstanding commitment to this important \nlegislation. In addition, my particular thanks go to Senator Moynihan \nfor all of his assistance in moving the bill through the Finance \nCommittee.\n  As I close, I would like to ask all my colleagues to join with me in \nvoting for S. 331. By passing the Work Incentives Improvement Act \ntoday, we can help unleash the creativity and enthusiasm of millions of \nAmericans with disabilities ready and eager to work.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on S. 331.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, will the Senator add me as a cosponsor?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, our revered chairman of the Finance \nCommittee has been characteristically generous in thanking the \nassociates who have joined him in this matter.\n  I will take just a moment--I know he would wish me to do so--to call \nattention to the fact that it is our former colleague, our beloved \nformer colleague, Bob Dole, who first proposed this matter. It was \n1986. He introduced the Employment Opportunities for Disabled Americans \nAct to allow supplementary security income beneficiaries to continue to \nreceive Medicaid when they return to work.\n  As the chairman of our committee said, this has enabled people to go \nto work who are disabled but not unwilling.\n  In a hearing before our committee on this bill, Senator Dole said:\n\n       This is about people going to work. It is about dignity and \n     opportunity and all the things we talk about when we talk \n     about being an American.\n\n  I think this accounts, sir, for the overwhelming support in this \nbody.\n  With that thought, and again my thanks to the chairman, I yield the \nfloor.\n  I have a snippet of time that Senator Kennedy may wish to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 43 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues for the \nprogram and for their support.\n  Yesterday when the President was here, he indicated he would like to \nhave this legislation on his desk by the Fourth of July. This really is \na declaration of independence for the disabled. He mentioned if we were \nnot able to meet that time limit, we ought to do it the 26th of July \nwhich will be the ninth anniversary for the Americans With Disabilities \nAct.\n  I think either date will be entirely appropriate for the celebration \nin this country of the Fourth of July. I can't think of a better Fourth \nof July for millions of our fellow Americans than the successful \nsigning into law of this legislation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nbringing up the role that former Senator Bob Dole played in this whole \nprocess. It was his leadership and his constant reminder to me of the \nneed to continue to go forward that I took on that role and now feel so \ngood that tomorrow we are at the point of succeeding.\n  I thank the disability community. I have never seen such an effort as \nthat provided by those in the disability community of this country to \nmake sure we did not forget our role and our goal.\n  I also thank Pat Morrisey of my staff who has been an incredible \nworkhorse on this matter. She has done a tremendous job in keeping me \non the right track.\n  This is the final great step in assuring that the disabled community \nof our country has reached the goal from which they have been precluded \nby the mobility to get health care--to be fully reentered into life.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee substitute, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. ROTH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes to \nspeak on the bill that is pending, given the role that I played in \nreaching this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think some explanation is due of how we \ncame to be where we are and the circumstances under which this bill is \nbeing considered.\n  When the bill was reported from the Finance Committee, it was funded \nby changing the Tax Code in a way that would have produced additional \nrevenues--by conventional definition, that would be a tax increase.\n  I felt at a time where we find it virtually impossible to control \ndiscretionary spending, at a time where in the same day--as was the \ncase yesterday--we vote to secure in a lockbox the surplus that is \ncoming from Social Security and then an hour later we vote to break the \nlockbox open and spend $270 million of Social Security money to \nsubsidize loans to the steel industry, it was a very bad precedent to \nset at this point in this legislative session where we are coming \ncloser and closer to blowing the top out of discretionary spending in \nthe Federal Government to create a brand new entitlement, no matter how \nmeritorious, and do it by raising taxes.\n  As a result, we had a series of objections to efforts to bring this \nbill to a vote. Many of those efforts were in the waning hours of \nvarious periods of the session before we adjourned for recesses. I have \ninsisted on one fundamental thing which is now embodied in the \nunanimous-consent request that we have used to bring this bill to the \nfloor; that is, that it be paid for, and that it be paid for by cutting \nanother entitlement program; that it not be paid for by raising taxes.\n  Now, I have no objection to the bill itself. In fact, I congratulate \nSenator Jeffords. I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth. I congratulate the ranking member, \nSenator Moynihan, not only for putting together a good bill but being \nwilling to go back and refine that bill to deal with legitimate \nconcerns that were raised, and produce a situation where I assume this \nbill will pass unanimously.\n  My objection has never been to the bill itself because the policy \nembodied in the legislation itself is meritorious. The problem is, \nthere are many meritorious proposals that can be made. At a time when \nwe cannot seem to control discretionary spending, if we start in our \nfirst new entitlement program of this session to fund it by raising \ntaxes, I think we create a precedent that could be very harmful to the \neconomy and could ultimately drive up interest rates and threaten the \nrecovery.\n  So, what we have done is ensure that there is no tax increase or any \nrevenue measure in this bill. We have a unanimous-consent agreement \nthat this bill cannot come back to the Senate in this or any other bill \nunless it is paid for by cutting another entitlement program. So the \none thing we can be guaranteed is, in meeting the goals of this \nmeritorious bill, what we are going to be required to do is do what \nfamilies would have to do if they came up with a good thing to spend \nmoney on, and that is we have to go back and find another entitlement \nthat is less meritorious, and we are going to have to find money from \none of those other entitlements to fund this bill. I think that is the \nright way to do it.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience. I know the bill is \nsupported by a lot of people, and they should, because these are people \nwith disabilities who are trying to work.\n  It has not been easy to stand in the way of this bill. I thought the \ncause was an important one. I am very happy with the final product. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for the bill. I assume it will get 100 \nvotes, and I think we are doing it the right way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend Senators Jeffords, Roth, Kennedy, \nand Moynihan for going the extra mile to work out the provisions of \nthis legislation. I am sure it was not easy; dealing with Medicaid and \nSSDI never is.\n  As a veteran of many negotiations and collaborations with on \ndisability issues, I see this legislation as a fine example of \nprogressive policy that does not also beget more bureaucracy and \nirresponsible spending. I do not believe that improving life for those \nwith disabilities and maintaining fiscal responsibility have to be \nmutually exclusive goals if we take the time to do it right.\n  That is why I appreciated the modifications made in this bill prior \nto its reintroduction early this spring. I know my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee and my former colleagues on the Health and Education \nCommittee worked very hard to accomplish this goal, and I think that, \nby and large, they have succeeded. They can be proud to have produced a \nbill with such solid bipartisan support. I might mention that Pat \nMorrissey of Senator Jeffords' staff was particularly responsive to my \nearlier questions and concerns.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the helpful input I received from my \nown Utah Advisory Committee on Disability Policy. While this measure \nwas particularly important to a number of the committee's individual \nmembers, I want to note for the record that the entire committee \nendorsed it and urged my support for the bill. I am pleased to be able \nto demonstrate that support today with an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nsponsored by Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Roth and Moynihan. I commend \nmy colleagues for their dedication to improving the way federal \nprograms serve persons with disabilities. Continuing my support for \nthis effort from last Congress, I became an original co-sponsor this \nyear of S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999.\n  This bill addresses one of the great tragedies of our disability \nsystem. The tragedy is forcing many people with disabilities to choose \nbetween working and maintaining access to health care. The intent of \nour system was never to demoralize Americans who are ready, willing and \nable to work. It is critical that we overturn today's policies of \ndisincentives toward work and replace them with thoughtful, targeted \nincentives that will enable many individuals with disabilities to \nreturn to work.\n  By removing barriers to necessary health care, the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act gives the disabled population the green light to join \nthe work force. It is smart public policy that will help alleviate the \ntight labor market, increase the tax base for the Social Security trust \nfund and address employer concerns. Many employers are wary of adding a \nhigh-cost employee to their company's insurance pool.\n  Most of all, this bill is the right thing to do. By providing \ndisabled workers a better opportunity to earn a living, this bill \nreinforces our nation's strong work ethic. Earning one's own way in the \nworld helps foster personal responsibility and self-esteem.\n  Over the years I have heard from Iowans who have been forced to leave \nthe work force because of a disability. More than 40,000 Iowans receive \nfederal disability benefits, but fewer than 20 percent of these Iowans \nhold a job. Most are discouraged form seeking employment because of the \nfear of losing critical health benefits covered by Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  For example, Tim Clancy of Iowa City has his Bachelor of Arts from \nthe University of Iowa. He is an active individual and participates in \na number of city and county government activities. Tim lives with \ncerebral palsy and relies on personal assistants for morning and \nevening help. Recently, he became employed by Target in Coralville, \nIowa, but does not have health insurance through his employer. After he \ncompletes his trial work period and extended period of eligibility, he \nwill lose his health insurance. The Work Incentives Act would allow \nTim--and many others--to continue receiving the same health coverage as \nhe has now.\n  I look forward to the passage of this legislation. It will unlock the \ndoors to\n\n[[Page S7060]]\n\nemployment for thousands of invaluable citizens.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has agreed \nto pass S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation.\n  This bill helps maintain the autonomy and self-worth of some of our \nmost vulnerable citizens, the disabled, by removing barriers that \nprevent them from returning to work. Disabled citizens in Delaware and \nelsewhere almost uniformly state that their most important goal is to \nreturn to work, not only for the income but for the need to be \nproductive. However, because our laws currently put many obstacles in \nthe way of disabled individuals who want to return to work, they often \ndiscover that they are better off financially and medically if they \nremain unemployed.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act helps tear down some of these \nperverse provisions of law that block the disabled from achieving their \ngoal of becoming productive, taxpaying citizens. First, and probably \nmost important to the disabled, this bill helps them maintain \nappropriate health insurance through extensions and expansions of the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs. Most employer-sponsored insurance does \nnot provide the specific types of coverage that the disabled need to \nenable them to return to work.\n  Second, the Work Incentives Improvement Act helps the disabled obtain \nappropriate employment and vocational rehabilitation services through \nthe Ticket To Work and Self-Sufficiency program, which extends access \nto such services provided by the private sector.\n  Finally, this bill continues the demonstration project that allows \nthe disabled who return to work to keep a portion of their cash \npayments as their work income increases; currently, the abrupt loss of \nthese payments when income reaches a specific threshhold has been a \nsevere disincentive for the disabled to return to work.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to be a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation that helps restore the disabled citizens of Delaware and \nthroughout the United States to their rightful places as equal \nparticipants in our society, and I applaud its passage by the Senate.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999. This bill was introduced by Senator \nJeffords and co-sponsored by 77 members. The primary purpose of this \nlegislation is to expand the availability of health care coverage under \nthe Social Security Act for working individuals with disabilities. This \nbill establishes a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program in the \nSocial Security Administration to make available meaningful work \nopportunities for the disabled.\n  Some months ago, in Florida, I met a woman who does not have the use \nof her arms. This woman is an accomplished artist who uses her feet to \ncreate beautiful works of art. She spoke with me about the difficulty \nshe has had over the years obtaining health insurance for routine \nmedical care and asked me to support this bill. It is with her in mind \nand the many other talented, hard-working disabled Americans that I \nsupport this act which will make it possible for them to obtain health \ncoverage and lead productive working lives.\n  This bill allows states to offer Medicaid coverage to workers with \ndisabilities beyond what is currently available to them under the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. It creates two new optional eligibility \ncategories and allows states to offer buy-ins for the working disabled \nso that they can maintain health care coverage, work, and have as much \nindependence as their disability allows. One option permits states to \noffer a Medicaid buy-in to people with disabilities who work and have \nan earned income above 250% of poverty with specified levels for \nassets, resources and unearned income set by the state in which they \nreside. This is important to many of the disabled who have income or \nassets that exceed the current level and have an earned income that has \nexceeded $500 per month during the past year. The state can and should \nimpose a sliding scale of cost-sharing of the premium, up to 100% of \nthe premium, based on the income of the individual. This will allow \nmany of the disabled who simply cannot get health insurance because \nthey have income or assets above a certain level, to obtain health \ncoverage. With the passage of this legislation, a person with \ndisabilities who may be an artist, computer programmer or run a \ntelephone answering service can now be successful at work and have no \nfear of being unable to obtain health coverage.\n  The second option allows states that elect to participate in the \nfirst option to also cover people who have a severe impairment but can \nlose eligibility for Supplemental Security Income or Social Security \nDisability Insurance because of medical improvement. In certain cases, \nthe only reason a person improves is because they receive medical \ntreatment. This bill prevents a person from losing their health care \ncoverage when their health improves due to medical treatment. The state \ncan allow this type of person to buy into the state Medicaid program at \na premium set by the state. This is a blessing to persons with \ndisabling conditions which are amenable to treatment such as rheumatoid \narthritis, Crohn's disease, depression, or sickle cell anemia. It \nallows people who can work to work and receive treatment for what may \nbe a chronic disease and have no fear of losing their health coverage.\n  An additional benefit of this bill provides for the continuation of \nMedicare coverage for working individuals with disabilities. An \nextended period of eligibility will allow people who receive Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance (SSDI) to continue to receive Part A \nMedicare coverage without payment for up to six years after returning \nto work. At present, disabled people may receive Medicare coverage for \nnine months followed by 36 months of extended eligibility but after \nthat, they have to pay the Part A premium in full. Often, people \nreturning to work following a period of coverage by SSDI, work part \ntime so they are ineligible for health insurance or they cannot obtain \ninsurance through their employer or from the private market. This bill \nwould permit them to receive Part A coverage and have coverage they \ncould not otherwise obtain.\n  I join with my colleagues in support of this legislation to help the \ndisabled help themselves.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr President, I rise today to lend my strong support to \nimportant legislation that will enable millions of individuals with \ndisabilities to achieve greater independence and financial security. \nThe Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 offers Americans with \ndisabilities the opportunity to achieve greater independence and \nfinancial security without the threat of losing the important \nprotections provided by health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. President, currently more than 75 percent of all individuals with \ndisabilities are unemployed. Further, less than one-half of one percent \nof the 7.5 million persons receiving federal disability payments go to \nwork each year. Yet a 1999 Harris Survey determined that 74 percent of \nAmericans with disabilities want to work. However, many individuals \nwith disabilities who work face the significant loss of their health \ninsurance coverage as they surpass certain earning limits. This loss of \nhealth coverage often presents an understandable deterrent to \nemployment for many individuals with disabilities. While the great \nmajority of Americans with disabilities would like to work, few can \nafford to lose the protection provided by their health insurance \ncoverage. Forcing individuals with disabilities to choose between work \nand health insurance coverage presents a difficult choice no one should \nbe forced to make.\n  S. 331 would provide incentives for persons with disabilities to \nreturn to work without losing their access to health insurance. This \nlegislation removes barriers for disabled individuals seeking to find \nmeaningful employment by allowing this vulnerable segment of our \npopulation to retain health insurance coverage. By removing the \ndisincentive to work that the loss of health insurance presents to \nindividuals with disabilities, S. 331 opens the door to greater freedom \nand increased earning for millions of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely heartened by the strong support the \nWork Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 has received. In support of \nthis important legislation are the Consortium for Citizens with \nDisabilities, the ARC, Easter Seals, the National Alliance for the\n\n[[Page S7061]]\n\nMentally Ill, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the United Cerebral \nPalsy Association, and the National Education Association. \nAdditionally, more than three-fourths of the Members of the United \nStates Senate presently cosponsor S. 331.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to commend Senators Jeffords, \nKennedy, Roth, and Moynihan for the important role they each played in \ndeveloping the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. Through their \ntireless efforts, S. 331 will greatly expand the opportunities afforded \nindividuals with disabilities as they enter the workforce and I look \nforward to its enactment.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President today I rise as a co-sponsor of the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that removes the \ndisincentives currently hindering those people with disabilities who \nwish to enter the workforce. We all owe our thanks to Senators \nMoynihan, Roth, and Kennedy for their leadership on this bill.\n  When people want to work the federal government should not stand in \ntheir way. When people want to be productive members of our society, \ntaxpaying citizens, the federal government should not stand in their \nway. Currently, 72% of Americans with disabilities want to work. \nHowever, nearly 75% of persons with disabilities are unemployed. We are \nsending the wrong message right now. The current set of rules make it \nmore economically beneficial for someone with a disability to stay at \nhome than to enter the workforce. There needs to be a transition period \nput in place to assist those with disabilities before we expect them to \nbecome financially independant. We do this with other programs and it \nis about time we apply such logic to this sector of our community. By \npassing this bill, if only 1% of the currently disabled Americans \nbecome fully employed, the federal savings in disability benefits would \ntotal $3.5 billion over the lifetime of the beneficiaries. Once again, \ninvesting in people creates a great rate of return.\n  In Indiana there are 348,000 people between the ages of 16 and 64 who \nhave a disability. I have heard numerous stories from Hoosiers with \ndisabilities who want to work and are able to work. They have told me \nhow work will mean more than a paycheck for them. It is an opportunity \nfor them to be a productive and contributing member of the community, \nwork towards self-sufficiency, and most importantly, to have a sense of \npride in being needed.\n  Let me tell you about Bob Neal, an employee of the Indianapolis \nPolice Department. He is 42 years old and doesn't want to give up his \njob even though it would be much easier for him financially if he did. \nBob has muscular dystrophy. When asked why he is still working he said \n``I just figure if I stay home I'll get fatter than I am and get lazy \nand die earlier. I look forward to working. You gotta have a little \npride somewhere. That is why I stay here, because of these people, I \ncould go back to Illinois and never work again, but these people, they \nknow me here.'' Bob's story displays the problem with the current \npredicament in which most people with disabilities find themselves. \nThis bill will address situations similar to that of Bob Neal. It will \nprovide access to health coverage and provide employment assistance \nwhile creating incentives to work. It is important to allow Medicare \ncoverage for people with disabilities while they are working so their \nhealth can continue to improve. It is no surprise this bill has such \noverwhelming support from both sides of the aisle.\n  Today, I will vote in support of this bill with pride for those who \ntake advantage of this newly created opportunity. I urge my colleagues \nto vote in support of this bill and send the message that people with \ndisabilities will no longer need to chose between working and remaining \nhealthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7061-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7061-S7064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care is important to all Americans.\n       (2) Health care is particularly important to individuals \n     with disabilities and special health care needs who often \n     cannot afford the insurance available to them through the \n     private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the \n     private sector, and are at great risk of incurring very high \n     and economically devastating health care costs.\n       (3) Americans with significant disabilities often are \n     unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage \n     of the services and supports that enable them to live \n     independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Personal \n     assistance services (such as attendant services, personal \n     assistance with transportation to and from work, reader \n     services, job coaches, and related assistance) remove many of \n     the barriers between significant disability and work. \n     Coverage for such services, as well as for prescription \n     drugs, durable medical equipment, and basic health care are \n     powerful and proven tools for individuals with significant \n     disabilities to obtain and retain employment.\n       (4) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing \n     health care and related services is one of the greatest \n     barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their \n     employment, earning potential, and independence.\n       (5) Individuals with disabilities who are beneficiaries \n     under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     401 et seq., 1381 et seq.) risk losing medicare or medicaid \n     coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that \n     is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of \n     cash benefits associated with working.\n       (6) Currently, less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of social \n     security disability insurance and supplemental security \n     income beneficiaries cease to receive benefits as a result of \n     employment.\n       (7) Beneficiaries have cited the lack of adequate \n     employment training and placement services as an additional \n     barrier to employment.\n       (8) If an additional \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the current \n     social security disability insurance (DI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) recipients were to cease receiving \n     benefits as\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\n     a result of employment, the savings to the Social Security \n     Trust Funds in cash assistance would total $3,500,000,000 \n     over the worklife of the individuals.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide health care and employment preparation and \n     placement services to individuals with disabilities that will \n     enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on cash \n     benefit programs.\n       (2) To encourage States to adopt the option of allowing \n     individuals with disabilities to purchase medicaid coverage \n     that is necessary to enable such individuals to maintain \n     employment.\n       (3) To provide individuals with disabilities the option of \n     maintaining medicare coverage while working.\n       (4) To establish a return to work ticket program that will \n     allow individuals with disabilities to seek the services \n     necessary to obtain and retain employment and reduce their \n     dependency on cash benefit programs.\n         TITLE I--EXPANDED AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101. EXPANDING STATE OPTIONS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM \n                   FOR WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) State option to eliminate income, assets, and resource \n     limitations for workers with disabilities buying into \n     medicaid.--Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)) is amended--\n       (A) in subclause (XIII), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (B) in subclause (XIV), by adding ``or'' at the end; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n\n       ``(XV) who, but for earnings in excess of the limit \n     established under section 1905(q)(2)(B), would be considered \n     to be receiving supplemental security income, who is at least \n     16, but less than 65, years of age, and whose assets, \n     resources, and earned or unearned income (or both) do not \n     exceed such limitations (if any) as the State may \n     establish;''.\n\n       (2) State option to provide opportunity for employed \n     individuals with a medically improved disability to buy into \n     medicaid.--\n       (A) Eligibility.--Section 1902(a)(10) (A)(ii) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)), as amended by \n     paragraph (1), is amended--\n       (i) in subclause (XIV), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (ii) in subclause (XV), by adding ``or'' at the end; and\n       (iii) by adding at the end the following:\n\n       ``(XVI) who are employed individuals with a medically \n     improved disability described in section 1905(v)(1) and whose \n     assets, resources, and earned or unearned income (or both) do \n     not exceed such limitations (if any) as the State may \n     establish, but only if the State provides medical assistance \n     to individuals described in subclause (XV);''.\n\n       (B) Definition of employed individuals with a medically \n     improved disability.--Section 1905 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396d) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(v)(1) The term `employed individual with a medically \n     improved disability' means an individual who--\n       ``(A) is at least 16, but less than 65, years of age;\n       ``(B) is employed (as defined in paragraph (2));\n       ``(C) ceases to be eligible for medical assistance under \n     section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XV) because the individual, by \n     reason of medical improvement, is determined at the time of a \n     regularly scheduled continuing disability review to no longer \n     be eligible for benefits under section 223(d) or 1614(a)(3); \n     and\n       ``(D) continues to have a severe medically determinable \n     impairment, as determined under regulations of the Secretary.\n       ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), an individual is \n     considered to be `employed' if the individual--\n       ``(A) is earning at least the applicable minimum wage \n     requirement under section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 206) and working at least 40 hours per month;

and\n       (iii) by inserting after clause (xi), the following:\n       ``(xii) employed individuals with a medically improved \n     disability (as defined in subsection (v)),''.\n       (3) State authority to impose income-related premiums and \n     cost-sharing.--Section 1916 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396o) is \n     amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a), by striking ``The State plan'' and \n     inserting ``Subject to subsection (g), the State plan''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) With respect to individuals provided medical \n     assistance only under subclause (XV) or (XVI) of section \n     1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)--\n       ``(1) a State may (in a uniform manner for individuals \n     described in either such subclause)--\n       ``(A) require such individuals to pay premiums or other \n     cost-sharing charges set on a sliding scale based on income \n     that the State may determine;

Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour of debate equally divided prior to the vote on the cloture motion \non H.R. 1259.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, let me begin debate on this cloture \nmotion today and take up to 10 minutes. I hope I won't need to use all \nof that, as there are other speakers on our side.\n  We are here now after having, on three occasions, failed to obtain \ncloture on a Senate bill to try to lock away the Social Security trust \nfund moneys and prevent them from being spent on other Federal \nGovernment expenditures. The Democrats have filibustered the lockbox \nfor 58 days. This is significant, because an additional $304 million of \nnew Social Security surplus funds are added to the trust fund virtually \nevery day.\n  In my judgment, we should be husbanding these surpluses carefully to \nprovide for future Social Security benefits and to make necessary \nreforms as easily and seamlessly as possible. But because of this \nfilibuster, $17.6 billion of these future Social Security benefits have \nbeen placed at risk of being spent on other non-Social Security \nprograms. This is the equivalent of taking away the annual Social \nSecurity benefits for 1.6 million American seniors.\n  Mr. President, today we are attempting a new approach having thrice \nfailed to be able to obtain cloture on a Senate amendment to a budget \nreform act bill. We are today voting on a different version of the \nlockbox, one that passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly, \nand, in my judgment, would therefore seem to be a piece of legislation \nthat we could have overwhelming bipartisan consensus on in the Senate. \nThe question is, Will we do so?\n  All I can say to my colleagues is that in Michigan, seniors surely \nhope that we will do so--that we will vote cloture, that we will pass \nthe lockbox, and that we will protect their Social Security benefits.\n  Let me introduce you to Gus and Doris Bionchini of Warren, MI. They \nhave been kind enough to come out to Washington this week to help \nensure that Social Security lockbox is passed. They have been receiving \nSocial Security for over 10 years and tell me that Social Security is \nvery important to them, as it is to so many Americans, and that they \npay most of their bills, especially food and utilities, with their \nbenefits.\n  Gus and Doris tell me that they can't understand why anyone would \nwant to spend their future Social Security benefits on new Government \nspending, and that they think it is time and imperative Congress pass a \nlaw which stipulates that we should not spend a dime of their Social \nSecurity dollars on anything other than Social Security. They believe \nseniors should have a voice.\n  Let me introduce you to someone else, Mr. Joe Wagner, a 70-year-old \nfrom Kentwood, MI, a new Social Security recipient, but someone who \nalready finds himself nearly entirely dependent upon his benefits to \npay his bills to meet his everyday needs. He said that he strongly \nsupports the original lockbox bill that I introduced with Senators \nAshcroft and Domenici and others. He also knows that the President has \nproposed spending over $30 billion of the Social Security surplus every \nyear. He thinks that is wrong, and I agree with him.\n  Then we have another person for you to meet, Eleanor Happle. Eleanor \nis a 74-year-old widow who is very active for her age and who enjoys \nspending time with friends and volunteering at the hospital. She \nsupplements her Social Security benefits by working in an assisted-\nliving facility. I know that she agrees with us that the Social \nSecurity surplus should be protected.\n  Finally, here is Vic and Joanne Machuta in front of their home in \nEast Grand Rapids, MI, where they have lived for 20 years. They have \nbeen married for 54 years. They have three children. Vic is 73 years \nold and worked as a police officer for over 35 years. Joanne is also 73 \nand worked for a bank as well as for Central Michigan University. They \nhave been receiving Social Security for 10 years and believe that the \nsurplus should be used for Social Security as opposed to other \nGovernment spending. They also believe that legislation which would \nmake it more difficult for Government to spend their Social Security is \na good idea.\n  Now we find ourselves with a new version of the lockbox. It is a \nlooser version, I admit. But we still find the same old foot dragging \nwhich we have been suffering through for 58 days.\n  H.R. 1259, the House lockbox legislation, passed the House on May 26 \nby a vote of 416 to 12--416 for this lockbox proposal in the House, and \nonly 12 against it. But still we are here, of course, to vote on \ncloture to end broad, uncontrolled debate on this subject. I don't \nunderstand that.\n\n  It seems to me that when the House votes this overwhelmingly clearly \nthis is a version which is a bipartisan consensus, and we should get \ndown to the business of protecting Social Security dollars.\n  That is what at least this Senator thinks. That is what my \nconstituents such as Gus, Doris, Joe, and Eleanor think.\n  I hope today that we will finally have 60 votes for us to consider in \na carefully crafted fashion a lockbox proposal that would enjoy \nbipartisan support. This one certainly does. It did in the House. I \nbelieve it will in the Senate. I hope that today we can finally obtain \ncloture, move forward, and pass this legislation quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I listened carefully to my friend and colleague from \nMichigan. I am inclined to agree with him on a couple of things; that \nis, that people really want their Social Security protected. That is \nwhat they are thinking about. That is what they are looking at.\n  I rise now to oppose the motion to invoke cloture on the House-passed \nSocial Security bill lockbox legislation, because it doesn't protect \nSocial Security as it is commonly believed.\n  I want the public to know that this isn't an internal debate about \nsome arcane process. We are talking about whether or not Social \nSecurity is going to be stronger as a result of this tactical approach \nto preparing perhaps for a nice tax cut in the future.\n  When we talk about the filibuster, sometimes the public doesn't quite \nunderstand. A filibuster can be an appropriate delay. If I think \nsomething is wrong, if someone on the other side of the aisle thinks \nsomething is wrong, they have a right to defend their point of view \nstanding on this floor for as long as they have the energy and the time \nis available. So cloture isn't a simple thing. It is designed to cut \noff other people's opinion. It is designed to give the majority a \nchance to roll over the minority and perhaps what the public really \nwants.\n  I want to say right from the beginning that I strongly support \nenactment of a Social Security lockbox. In fact, we want to pass a \nlockbox that not only protects Social Security, but for many people, \nwhile they worry about Social Security, Medicare, which is high on \ntheir list of concerns because Social Security will be there but \nMedicare, conceivably if it is not protected and made more solvent, may \nnot be there.\n\n  Ask anybody what their primary concerns are once they get past their \nMedicare family needs, and they will tell you that it is health care. \nThere is a crying need for reliability in health care systems across \nthis country. People are worried that they will lose out in one place \nand not be able to get it in another place. They are worried about \nhaving a condition where that is ruled out for them--a long-term \ndisease.\n  Medicare has to be protected as well. We want a lockbox that has an \nimpenetrable lock, not one that includes all kinds of loopholes that \nwill leave these\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\nprograms largely unprotected. That is the thing we have to keep in \nmind; that is, what is the ultimate outcome?\n  The bill before us now is an improvement over the version that we \nconsidered yesterday. But unlike that legislation, the one that was \nconsidered yesterday, the House-passed bill, does not pose a risk of \nGovernment default. So there is a slight measure of more security \nthere. Therefore, it doesn't pose the same kind of threat to Social \nSecurity benefits. However, the House-passed bill still desperately \nneeds improvement. Most importantly, the bill's lack of protection for \nMedicare is a primary part.\n  In addition, the bill lacks an adequate enforcement mechanism. It \nrelies solely on 60-vote points of order.\n  Again, I don't like to get into process discussions when the public \nhas a chance to evaluate. Why should there be 60 votes necessary to \nchange it? In almost every other situation we rely on the majority to \ntake care of it with 51 votes. It doesn't back up these 60-vote points \nof order, across-the-board spending cuts should Congress raid these \nsurpluses in the future.\n  In addition, the legislation before us includes a troubling loophole \nthat would allow Congress to raid surpluses by simply designating \nlegislation as ``Social Security reform'' or ``Medicare reform.'' But \nit is not what you really get when you look at the title of these \nprograms, because under Social Security reform it is conceivable that \nsome could favor a major tax cut for wealthy people, and say: Listen. \nThey are going to be paying more into the fund as a result of earning \nmore as a result of a more buoyant economy. They could say that is \nSocial Security reform. But, aha, really what we want to do is give a \ngood fat tax cut to people who do not need it.\n  There is no definition of what constitutes Social Security or \nMedicare reform. We want to do that. But this obscure definition \npermits hanky-panky all over the place.\n  This could allow Congress to raid surpluses for new privatization \nschemes, no matter how risky, or even tax cuts--big tax cuts.\n  Democrats want to strengthen this bill to make it better. But we are \nbeing denied an opportunity in the process by the majority. They are \nsaying that 45 Democrats representing any number of States, any number \nof people--if we just take the States of California and New York, we \nhave a significant part of the population in this country.\n\n  However, the majority is saying: We will not let you offer any \namendments; we have decided we have the majority, and we are locking \nyou out. That is the real lockbox.\n  It is not right. That is not the proper way to operate. It is not the \nway the Senate is supposed to function--not permit the offering of \namendments? What are they afraid of? Let the public hear the debate. \nLet the public look at the amendments. Maybe we will help them pass a \nbill we also can agree to. Right now, they are afraid to let the public \nin. The public doesn't have a right to know, as far as they are \nconcerned.\n  For too long now, the majority has engaged in a concerted effort to \ndeny rights to Democratic Senators. They have repeatedly tried to \neliminate our rights. The once rare tactic of filling up the amendment \ntree--again, another arcane term that blocks out any other amendments--\nhas now become standard operating procedure.\n  The majority thinks they have a right to dictate how many and which \namendments. They are asking to see our amendments before we can offer \nthem. That is unheard of in the process as structured in the Senate.\n  Compounding matters, cloture is no longer being used as a tool to end \ndebate. It is being used as a tool to prevent debate. The majority \nleader, in his technical right, has filed a cloture motion on this bill \nbefore either side even has an opportunity to make an opening \nstatement. That, too, is unheard of. We used to have debate, and one \nside or the other would finally say: Listen, they are delaying; they \nare filibustering, and we want to shut off debate.\n  Now what happens, as soon as the bill is filed, a cloture motion is \nfiled that says the minority or those who are in opposition will not \neven have a right to speak.\n  The majority is even going further in limiting the period known as \nmorning business, when we can talk about things that are on our agenda. \nEliminate that right?\n  I hope the American public will understand what this mission is; that \nis, not to give the public what they want but to give them what the \nRepublicans want.\n  This effort to restrict minority rights is not appropriate. It is not \nthe way the Senate is supposed to operate. We Democrats are not going \nto put up with it much longer. There is no reason this Senate cannot \napprove a Social Security and Medicare lockbox and do it very soon. We \nare willing to work toward a unanimous consent agreement to limit \namendments. Debate on these amendments should not take very long.\n  However, we cannot accept being entirely locked out of the \nlegislative process. We will not tolerate being denied an opportunity \nto make this Social Security lockbox truly a lockbox, a safe deposit \nbox, one that can't be opened casually, that protects both Social \nSecurity and Medicare in a meaningful way.\n  The majority understands, if they continue to function this way, we \nwill not get a Social Security and Medicare lockbox enacted into law. \nIt is as simple as that. Perhaps they don't want to live under this \nlockbox but would like to talk about it, hoping they do not have to \npass the test of reality. Maybe they just want an issue to talk about. \nThat is why they are following procedures guaranteed to produce \ngridlock and not results. I hope that is not true.\n\n  I look at actions. I see them speaking louder than words. There is \nevery indication the Republican leadership is not trying seriously to \nproduce a bill that can win bipartisan support.\n  I call on my colleagues to oppose cloture, to oppose cutting off \ndebate. I urge my colleagues in the majority to change their mind, \nrethink it, talk to this side about it, allow this bill to be \nconsidered privately or openly, with a full opportunity for debate and \nfor amendments.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota up to 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the fourth time the Senate is being \nasked to vote on a so-called lockbox without being given the \nopportunity to consider amendments.\n  What is the majority afraid of? Why aren't they willing to vote on \namendments? That is the way we do business in the Senate. Somebody \nmakes a legislative offering, and then Members have a chance to amend \nand a chance to vote to decide what is the best policy for this \ncountry.\n  I have believed for a very long time and I have fought repeatedly in \nthe Budget Committee, in the Finance Committee, and on the floor of the \nSenate to stop the raid on Social Security surpluses. I see our friends \non the other side all of a sudden become defenders of Social Security.\n  Some Members have not forgotten. Sometimes our friends on the other \nside of the aisle think we have amnesia, but we remember the repeated \nattempts on the other side to amend the Constitution of the United \nStates with a so-called balanced budget amendment that would have \nlooted and raided Social Security to achieve balance. We remember very \nwell.\n  It was done in 1994; it was done in 1995; it was done in 1996; it was \ndone in 1997; and here is the language. This language makes clear that \nthe definition of a balanced budget was all the receipts of the Federal \nGovernment and all the expenditures of the Federal Government, \nincluding Social Security. Then they were going to call that a balanced \nbudget. That is what they were doing in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997--an \nabsolute raid on the Social Security trust funds and trying to put that \nin the Constitution of the United States.\n  All of a sudden, they are defenders of Social Security. I welcome the \ntransformation. I welcome them coming over to our side and agreeing now \nthat we ought to protect Social Security. But why won't they allow \namendments? What are they afraid of? Are they afraid to vote? I think \nthey are. I think they are afraid to vote. I think they are afraid to \nvote because we have\n\n[[Page S7080]]\n\nan amendment that provides a lockbox for Social Security, one that is \ndefended against what can happen out here on the floor--unlike the \namendment being offered now. It is defended by sequestration. Their \namendment has no such defense.\n\n  I think they are afraid to vote on an alternative because we not only \nprotect Social Security but Medicare.\n  Looking at the Republican ``broken safe,'' we try to look inside and \nfind out what is there. What we find is that there is not one single \nadditional penny for Medicare in the Republican lockbox. No, Medicare \nis left out of the equation.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I believe Medicare ought to be protected with \nSocial Security. We ought to have a lockbox to protect both. We ought \nto have procedures that defend them, not create enormous loopholes that \ncan be used to again loot Social Security and not protect Medicare.\n  The fact is, the amendment we want to offer that they will not let \nthis side consider is an amendment that provides $698 billion for \nMedicare over the next 15 years; the Republican plan provides nothing, \nzero, not one penny. That is why they don't want to vote. They don't \nwant to vote because they don't want to protect Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  It is fascinating what a difference a year makes. Just 1 year ago we \nhad a debate in the Budget Committee of the Senate. Here is what the \nRepublicans were saying then. This is Senator Pete Domenici, the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee:\n\n       Mr. President, this is a very simple proposition . . . We \n     suggested, as Republicans, that Social Security and Medicare \n     are the two most important American programs to save, reform, \n     and make available into the next century . . . I believe the \n     issue is very simple--very simple: Do you want a budget that \n     begins to help with Medicare, or do you want a budget that \n     says not one nickel for Medicare; let's take care of that \n     later with money from somewhere else.\n\n  Senator Domenici was right then. They don't want to consider the \namendment that would do exactly what he is talking about--protect \nSocial Security and Medicare. They want to forget the position they \nwere taking just a year ago.\n  Here is another member, a senior Republican member of the Budget \nCommittee. He said 1 year ago:\n\n       But the fundamental strength of it is, whether they are \n     democrats or republicans who have got together in these dark \n     corners of very bright rooms and said, what would we do if we \n     had a half a trillion dollars to spend?\n       . . . the obvious answer that cries out is Medicare . . . I \n     think it is logical. People understood the President on save \n     Social Security first and I think they will understand save \n     Medicare first . . .\n       Medicare is in crisis. We want to save Medicare first.\n\n  It is 1 year later now. All of a sudden those brave words are \nforgotten and our friends on the other side want to prevent us from \neven considering an amendment that would do what they were advocating a \nyear ago, save Social Security first and save Medicare first. Now they \nwant to forget Medicare. Now they do not want to provide an additional \ndime for Medicare, even though it is endangered in a more immediate way \nthan is Social Security.\n  One more quote from the chairman of the Budget Committee:\n\n       Let me tell you for every argument made around this table \n     today about saving Social Security, you can now put it in the \n     bank that the problems associated with fixing Medicare are \n     bigger than the problems fixing Social Security, bigger in \n     dollars, more difficult in terms of the kind of reform \n     necessary, and frankly, I am for saving Social Security. But \n     it is most interesting that there are some who want to \n     abandon Medicare . . . when it is the most precarious program \n     we have got.\n\n  The reason I believe our colleagues on the other side do not want any \namendments is because they do not want to vote on an amendment that \nSenator Lautenberg and I are prepared to offer that would save Social \nSecurity first, every penny, and save Medicare as well. They do not \nwant to vote.\n  That is not the way the Senate ought to operate. That is not what we \nshould do here.\n  Let me conclude by saying the amendment we have would save $3.3 \nbillion in debt reduction; the Republican plan, $2.6 billion. Our plan \nis superior. We ought to have a chance to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will just make one brief statement and \nthen I will yield to the Senator from Wyoming. I do want to remind my \ncolleagues that in the last efforts to secure cloture before the \nSenate, it was cloture on my amendment to another bill. We just wanted \na vote on our Social Security lockbox. If we had gotten that vote, and \nit had passed, the amendments that are being discussed today would have \nbeen in order to be brought.\n  So the notion we had previously denied anybody the opportunity to \nhave any amendments is not accurate. That opportunity would have been \npresented. All we wanted was a chance to have a vote on this lockbox. \nThat was in the previous effort, on the Senate version.\n  Now we are dealing with a House bill, and it is different in this \ncontext, but the impression created that somehow before there would \nhave been no opportunity to present alternatives would not have been \nthe case had we had a chance to vote on our amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am going to yield on my time to the Senator from \nWyoming, who has been waiting. I will be happy to if we have an \nopportunity, but I do want to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nbringing this subject, his amendment, to the floor. We are talking \nabout lockbox legislation. We are talking about Social Security, which \nis the bottom line. Lockbox is simply the first step to accomplish \nthat. We have had in our agenda this year: Social Security, tax reform, \neducation, and security for this country. These are the things we have \nbeen talking about and will, indeed, continue to talk about.\n  The two Senators from the other side of the aisle have spoken about \nexcuses for not going forward with this bill. I can hardly understand \nit. They talk about amendments. They have 22 or 25 amendments designed \nto keep us from voting on the bill. That is why we are not doing \namendments. We decided to move forward with something designed to \nensure that Social Security surplus funds will be reserved for Social \nSecurity alone. There are lots of things involved, of course, in \naddition to Social Security. That is, if you like smaller government, \nif you like tax relief, if you would like to limit the amount of \nspending, then this is the way to do that and hold the spending to \nthose funds that do not come from Social Security. So this helps us \nretain our commitment to smaller and more efficient government.\n  One only has to look at last year's omnibus appropriations to see \nthis legislation is necessary, where $20 billion in nonemergency \nspending was taken from Social Security last year. The same thing will \nhappen again unless we make a move to do something about it. \nUnfortunately, the Democrats have decided to filibuster this bill and \nnot let it happen. Apparently they support these ideas of raiding \nSocial Security for their big government agenda. I understand that. The \nPresident's budget raids the Social Security funds to the tune of $158 \nbillion. That is where we are, absent this kind of movement.\n  We are, of course, dealing with everything from lockbox to \nfundamental Social Security reforms. Everybody knows the system is not \nsound; by 2014, Social Security begins to run a deficit. Obviously, \nthere are a number of demographics that bring that about--the declining \nnumber of workers, their increased longevity, and the impending \nretirement of the baby boomers. There are three solutions to the \nproblem: One is to raise taxes on Social Security, one is to reduce \nbenefits of Social Security--neither of which is acceptable to most of \nus--and the third is to provide an increased rate of return on the \ninvestments we have.\n  I am not for raising taxes. There are better ways to do that. I \ncertainly want, however, to do something with Social Security which \nwill allow a certain part of those funds to be put in private accounts \nto be invested in the private sector to increase the returns so we \nstrengthen Social Security. We cannot do that unless we set aside these \nfunds.\n\n[[Page S7081]]\n\n  I am amazed at the opposition to this. The President has been talking \nfor 2 years and all he said was: Save Social Security; no plan, no \neffort, no movement.\n  Now we have a chance to take the first steps to do something. We have \na plan that works to move us to save Social Security, and what do we \nhave? Opposition by filibuster. It is amazing to me. I guess it is \nsimply a defense of spending more for large government. I do not want \nto do that. Americans work hard for their money. They ought to have a \nsay in how it is spent. Therefore, I urge we move forward with \nthe first step in doing something about Social Security.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No. We have used our time. I return it back to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No questions, no speeches.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We can on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will take 1 minute, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I say, I wonder whether our friends on the other side \nknow they filled up the amendment tree as soon as they laid down \nyesterday's bill. What are they talking about when they say you can \noffer amendments, when they closed it? They know very well. This \nchicanery should not get past the public, I will tell you that.\n  Why should we not spend a little time? Filibuster? We have a half-\nhour available. I want the American public to know they think that is \nenough time to discuss Social Security and Medicare. That is what the \npublic has to know. Not cut off the filibuster--what kind of filibuster \nis this? That is not even an pinkie-size filibuster.\n  That, I think, is important for the Record to reflect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator from New \nJersey. The Senator from New Jersey knows if we get cloture on this \nbill, germane amendments would be allowed. So if what he is concerned \nabout is Social Security and debating Social Security, germane Social \nSecurity amendments will be available. What will not be available are \nspurious amendments to make political points that have nothing to do \nwith Social Security, such as what is being discussed by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota who wants to take non-Social Security money, non-\nMedicare money, and create a lockbox of general fund revenues for \nMedicare.\n  As the Senator from New Jersey knows, that has nothing to do with \nSocial Security. It has nothing to do with lockboxing Social Security. \nIt has nothing to do with lockboxing the Medicare trust fund. It is a \ntangential amendment aimed at making political points, having nothing \nto do with Social Security, as are the bulk, from my understanding, of \nthe other amendments.\n  So in sincerity, I say to the Senator from New Jersey, if he really \nis concerned about Social Security and having an honest debate about \nSocial Security and the amendments thereto, vote for cloture because he \nwill have ample opportunity to have a plethora of amendments that deal \nwith the issue of Social Security and the lockbox thereon.\n  So the demagoguery we have heard that somehow we are precluding \ndebate on the most vital issue of the day is false. We are, in fact, \nproviding a forum for a limited and narrow and focused discussion, \nabsent political demagoguery, to talk just about Social Security.\n  So, if the Senator is truly concerned with the issue of Social \nSecurity and the preeminence of it as a policy issue, then he has the \nopportunity before him right now to vote for cloture so we can focus \nthe agenda and the discussion on that very issue.\n  Second, I want to respond to the Senator from North Dakota who I \nthink has offered a very reasonable concept, although I am not sure his \ncharts follow through with that concept. The Senator from North Dakota \nsuggested that we need to lockbox Medicare and suggested there were \n$650-some-odd billion to be lockboxed for Medicare. I do not know where \nhe comes up with $650-odd billion that is in the Medicare fund surplus \nin the future. In fact, between the years 2000 and 2009, the net \nsurplus in the Medicare trust fund is $14 billion. In the next 5 years \nthe surplus will be $53 billion, but then it goes negative, from 2006 \nto 2009 $39 billion.\n  I am willing right now to coauthor a bill with the Senator from North \nDakota to put a lockbox on the Medicare trust fund similar to the \nSocial Security trust fund. But that is not what the Senator from North \nDakota is saying. He would lead you to believe that is what he is \nsaying, that we need a similar lockbox for Medicare as we have for \nSocial Security.\n  Remember, the Social Security lockbox said Social Security money must \nbe used for Social Security. A similar Medicare lockbox would be very \nsimple: Medicare taxes must be used for Medicare.\n  Is that what the Senator from North Dakota has asked for? No, he has \nnot. What the Senator from North Dakota said is all of the surplus in \nthe future--the non-Medicare surplus, the non-Social Security surplus, \nthe general fund surplus--has to be used for Medicare. That is what the \nSenator from North Dakota did. That is not what he told us, but that is \nwhat he did.\n  Why does he want to do that? Because he wants to take the general \nfund surplus--which many believe, if we have more money in the general \nfund than we need, we should provide tax relief to those who overpaid--\nand use it for Medicare.\n  I believe in the integrity of the Medicare program and the integrity \nof the Social Security program. They are funded specifically by taxes \nand spent within that trust fund. That is how we should fix Medicare, \nand that is how we should fix Social Security. We should not be \nborrowing from other areas any more than on the general Government side \nwe should not be borrowing from Social Security and Medicare. It is \nhonesty in budgeting. What happened a few minutes ago on the floor was \nnot exactly the most forthright explanation of budgeting in this area.\n  What we are proposing is very simple. We have a surplus in Social \nSecurity, and if we do not lock it up and create hurdles for spending \nthat money, there will be those, incredibly enough, who will use that \nmoney for other things such as, oh, wonderful things, including tax \ncuts. There may be some who want--I do not want to do tax cuts with \nSocial Security money; I will not do tax cuts with Social Security \nmoney. You will not find any tax cut I will not vote for. I will vote \nfor all of them, but I will not use Social Security money.\n  It puts constraints on us on this side of the aisle who would love to \nsee tax cuts but will not use Social Security, contrary to what the \nSenator from New Jersey just said. You cannot use it for tax cuts and \nspending increases. That is all we say.\n  Let's make a downpayment on Social Security reform by not spending \nthe money. It is as simple as that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time do we have on our side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of S. 605, as amended.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 605\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n        TITLE II--SOCIAL SECURITY FISCAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n     SECTION 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Social Security Fiscal \n     Protection Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 202.

This \n     section shall not be construed to require the Secretary of \n     the Treasury to maintain an amount equal to the total social \n     security trust fund balance as of October 1, 1999.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of the Republican Policy Committee talking points \non S. 605 dated June 15.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  RPC Talking Points on S. 605--Hollings Amendment to Social Security \n                                Lockbox\n\n       S. 605, a bill by Senator Hollings, which may be offered as \n     an amendment to the Social Security lockbox bill, states in \n     part: ``. . . The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain, \n     in a secure repository or repositories, cash in a total \n     amount equal to the total redemption value of all obligations \n     issued to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust \n     Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund pursuant \n     to section 201(d) of the Social Security Act that are \n     outstanding on the first day of such month.''\n       The Mechanics: In short, the Hollings Amendment would \n     require the federal government to come up with cash equal to \n     the amount of the Social Security trust fund balance--an \n     amount which at the end of this fiscal year (FY 1999) is \n     estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be $857 \n     billion.\n       The amendment would require an $857 billion payment on \n     October 1, 1999. This money presumably would have to be \n     borrowed--thus driving up interest rates to incredible \n     levels--since that amount could not be raised through \n     taxation in the next three months.\n       In addition, over the next 10 years (2000-2009), CBO \n     estimates Social Security will run a surplus of $1.78 \n     trillion. And so, the costs of this proposal are enormous.\n       The Costs: The desire to stockpile hard currency is more \n     than just problematic--it is costly in both direct and \n     indirect economic costs.\n       If this money were not used to pay down the public debt, \n     the federal government would incur a cost of $467.8 billion \n     over 10 years in lost debt service savings.\n       This stockpiling concept would also have implications for \n     monetary policy. Without the Federal Reserve re-liquidating \n     (i.e., issuing an equivalent quantity of money), the American \n     economy (and thereby the world's) would come under severe \n     deflationary financial pressure--slower economic growth. Of \n     course, when the Social Security funds reentered circulation, \n     the effect would be just the opposite--inflationary pressure \n     from an over-supply of money.\n       In short, the Hollings amendment would not only have \n     enormous costs for the federal budget, but for the American \n     and world economy as well.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this blasphemy--and it is blasphemy--has \nto stop. The Republican Party fought Social Security. They cut all the \nbenefits back in 1986, but still they do not learn. That is how they \nlost the Senate at that time. Now they have been trying to privatize \nand get rid of Social Security.\n  This is just another charade. The Senator from New Jersey is correct, \nwe cannot offer an amendment, for the simple reason that when they laid \ntheir bill down, they filled up the tree, and, under that premise, you \ncannot offer an amendment.\n  My amendment, S. 605, would be relevant to this piece of legislation. \nIt has been referred to the Budget Committee. You cannot make it more \nrelevant than having it referred to that committee. S. 605 creates a \ntrue lockbox. We worked it out with Ken Apfel and the Social Security \nAdministration where we pay an equal amount of those securities back \ninto the Social Security trust fund.\n  What does the Republican policy committee say? They take the entire \ndebt. Mr. President, I had no idea that the Republicans would admit to \nthe fact that there is nothing in the lockbox. Actually, at the end of \nthis fiscal year, by the end of September--this is June--we will owe \nSocial Security $857 billion. Read the policy committee statement. They \nsay:\n\n       . . . the end of this fiscal year . . . is estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office to be $857 billion.\n\n  They finally admit there is nothing in the lockbox. The intent of \nHollings in S. 605, and others who have cosponsored it, is to put some \nmoney in the lockbox; namely, the annual surpluses. I have juxtaposed \nthe language in my legislation but I can tell you, you can see their \nintent by this Republican policy committee statement.\n  The 1994 Pension Reform Act says you cannot pay off your debt with \npension funds. But they have been doing that, and their particular bill \ncontinues to pay down the debt with the pension funds. They have tried \nto do that under the ruse that it would be terrible by calling it, \nwhat? They call it stockpiling hard currency, and it is going to wreck \nthe world economy.\n  I wish everybody would read the talking points of the Republican \nPolicy Committee and this nonsense they have afoot. There is not any \nquestion that they intend to spend the money. They have one sentence in \nhere:\n\n       In addition, over the next 10 years . . . CBO estimates \n     Social Security will run a surplus of $1.78 trillion. And so, \n     the costs of this proposal are enormous.\n\n  Substitute the word ``savings'' for the word ``costs.'' The savings \nto Social Security will be enormous if we pass S. 605. But their intent \nis that there be nothing in the lockbox.\n  The Senator from Michigan sits down there with his senior citizen \npicture. I am a senior citizen. I am not worried. Strom is not worried. \nWe are going to get our money. It is the young baby boomer generation \nthat the Greenspan Commission said set aside for--actually section 21 \nof the Greenspan Commission report--that should be worried. The law, \nsection 13301 of the Budget Act, says to do exactly that. But they \ncontinue to put this shabby act on the other side of the aisle like \nthey have a lockbox and they are trying to save Social Security Trust \nFund monies, when they know full well there is nothing in the lockbox. \nThe Republican Policy Committee said they are guaranteeing that nothing \nis ever going to be in that lockbox.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe Herger Social Security safe deposit box. This legislation will \ncreate a much-needed mechanism to protect Social Security surpluses \nfrom being spent on non-Social Security items.\n  We need this legislation because, despite his promises to save Social \nSecurity and to protect Social Security, the President keeps forwarding \nbudgets which would take a massive bite out of Social Security.\n  We need this legislation. For example, under President Clinton's \nproposed budget, $158 billion from the fiscal year 2000 to 2004 budget \nwill be diverted from debt reduction--which is getting the obligations \nof the country down so we can honor the responsibilities we have to \nSocial Security--it will be diverted by the President, $158 billion, \ntoward more spending. According to the Senate Budget Committee, that \nwould represent 21 percent of the Social Security surplus over that \nperiod.\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\n In fiscal year 2000 itself, that represents $40 billion, or 30 percent \nof the surplus.\n\n  While President Clinton has been proposing that we spend the Social \nSecurity surplus, this Congress has been working to protect Social \nSecurity.\n  In March, I introduced S. 502, the Protect Social Security Benefits \nAct. This legislation, which the Herger legislation before us follows--\nvery similar--called for the establishment of a point of order that \nwould prevent the House and Senate from passing or even debating bills \nthat would spend money from the Social Security trust fund for anything \nother than Social Security benefits or reducing our debt so that we \nhave a better capacity to pay for Social Security.\n  In April, we passed a budget resolution that does not spend a dime \nout of the Social Security surplus. In addition to protecting the \nSocial Security surplus, the budget resolution sticks to the spending \ncaps from the 1997 balanced budget agreement. It cuts taxes and it \nincreases spending on education and defense within those limits. That \nis the way we ought to operate in terms of protecting Social Security \nand setting priorities.\n  Folks may not understand the entirety of what it means to have a \npoint of order. It simply means when a person proposes spending that \nwould require us to invade the surplus of Social Security in order to \ncover the spending, a point of order can be raised and that proposal \nwill be ruled out of order. In other words, when someone proposes \ninvading Social Security, the Chair can say that is out of order, and \nwe cannot debate it, let alone discuss it. We cannot vote on it unless \nwe change the rules of the engagement, unless we set aside the rules. I \ndo not think Members of this body are going to say we want something so \nbad that we are going to invade the retirement of Americans in order to \nget it. Not only is the point of order established, but it is a 60-vote \npoint of order, meaning you have to have an overwhelming majority of \nthe Congress in order to make sure that is done.\n  I believe this is the kind of durable, workable protection for the \nSocial Security surplus that will make sure we do not continue what we \nhave done for the last 20 years; and that is, to pretend that that \nmoney is available for spending on social programs, the normal \noperation of Government. We, as a result of that, boosted Government \nspending monumentally by acting as if the Social Security surplus was \nmerely available for ordinary spending. It should not be. It should be \nprotected. The Social Security surplus, therefore, should be the \nsubject of the point of order called for in this measure upon which we \nwill vote shortly.\n  This vote is all about protecting Social Security surpluses. It is a \nvote about making sure that the surpluses are not used to pay for new \nbudget deficits or operations in the rest of Government.\n  The vote supporting the Herger plan should be bipartisan and \nunanimous. Think about what the vote was in the House of \nRepresentatives. In the House of Representatives, this vote was 416 to \n12--416 to 12. That is an overwhelming endorsement. During the debate \non the budget resolution, the Senate voted 99 to 0 in support of \nlegislation to protect Social Security.\n  We are calling on every Senator to vote with us to pass the \nlegislation implementing this unanimous resolution.\n  As I said, in addition, the House recently passed the Herger bill, \n416-12. There is no reason that the Senators on the other side of the \naisle should not join with us on this vote to protect Social Security.\n  I want to commend Congressman Herger for his hard work in bringing \nthe bill to the floor and obtaining such an overwhelming vote in favor \nof protecting Social Security. I hope that we can do the same on the \nSenate side and put this bill on the President's desk immediately.\n  We need to pass this bill because we need to implement procedures to \nprotect Social Security now.\n  Social Security is scheduled to go bankrupt in 2034. Starting in \n2014, Social Security will begin spending more than it collects in \ntaxes.\n  Despite this impending crisis, over the next 5 years, President \nClinton's budget proposes spending $158 billion of the Social Security \nsurpluses on non-Social Security programs. We need to stop this kind of \nraid on Social Security.\n  We need to protect Social Security now for the 1 million Missourians \nwho receive Social Security benefits, for their children, and for their \ngrandchildren.\n  This provision will help do that, by making sure that Social Security \nfunds do not go for anything other than Social Security.\n  Under this provision, Congress will no longer routinely pass budgets \nthat use Social Security funds to balance the budget. A congressional \nbudget that uses Social Security funds to balance the budget will be \nsubject to a point of order, and cannot be passed, or even considered, \nunless 60 Senators vote to override the point of order.\n  One of the most important lessons a parent teaches a child is to be \nresponsible--responsible for his or her conduct and responsible for his \nor her money. America needs to be responsible with the people's money.\n  The Herger bill, like the original Ashcroft point of order, will show \nthe American people that we are being responsible, by protecting the \nSocial Security system from irresponsible Government spending.\n  Americans, including the 1 million Missourians who receive Social \nSecurity benefits, want Social Security protected. This bill does what \nAmerica wants, and what every Senator has said they want to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the Senator from Massachusetts want 3 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Three minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is another case where the seniors \nand the young people of this country ought to look beyond the words to \nthe real meaning of the program. We will have an opportunity to debate \na Patients' Bill of Rights in the next few days, I hope. But we will \nhave what is effectively a ``Patients' Bill of Wrongs.'' It will be \nintroduced by our good friends on the other side of the aisle as a \n``Patients' Bill of Rights'', but it does not provide the protection.\n  And here we have another example of this, where we have an illusion \nthat we are protecting Social Security. They say it, but they do not \nmean it, because the legislation effectively denies it. In reality, \nthis Republican ``lockbox'' does nothing to extend the life of the \nSocial Security Trust Fund for future beneficiaries. In fact, it would \ndo just the reverse. The sponsors of the legislation deliberately \ndesigned their ``lockbox'' with a ``trapdoor.'' Their plan would allow \nSocial Security payroll taxes to be used instead to finance unspecified \n``reform'' plans. This loophole opens the door to risky tax cut schemes \nthat would finance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social \nSecurity's guaranteed benefits. Such a privatization plan could \nactually make Social Security's financial picture far worse than it is \ntoday, necessitating deep benefit cuts in the future.\n  As has been pointed out by my good friends from New Jersey, South \nCarolina, and others here, this loophole undermines the protection of \nthese resources that should be allocated to protect our senior \ncitizens.\n  No matter how many times those on the other side say that this really \ndoes give them the insurance and that it really does provide the \nprotection, as has been pointed out by speaker after speaker after \nspeaker, it fails to meet the fundamental and basic test. Because of \nthe ``trapdoor,'' the Republican ``lockbox'' fails to provide \nprotections for our senior citizens. It does not deserve the support of \nthe Members of this body.\n  This Republican ``lockbox'' is an illusion. It gives only the \nappearance of protecting Social Security. In reality, it does nothing \nto extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund for future \nbeneficiaries. It would, in fact, do just the reverse. The sponsors of \nthe legislation deliberately designed their ``lockbox'' with a \n``trapdoor''. It would allow payroll tax dollars that belong to Social \nSecurity to be spent instead of risky privatization schemes.\n  It is time to look behind the rhetoric of the proponents of the \n``lockbox.'' Their statements convey the impression that they have \ntaken a major step\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\ntoward protecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to \nstrengthen Social Security. Their proposal would not provide even one \nadditional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees. Nor would it \nextend the solvency of the Trust Fund by even one more day. It merely \nrecommits to Social Security those dollars which already belong to the \nTrust Fund under current law. At best, that is all their so-called \n``lockbox'' would do.\n  By contrast, the administration's proposed budget would contribute \n2.8 trillion new dollars of the surplus to Social Security over the \nnext fifteen years. By doing so, the President's budget would extend \nthe life of the Trust Fund by more than a generation, to beyond 2050.\n  There is a fundamental difference between the parties over what to do \nwith the savings which will result from using the surplus for debt \nreduction. The Federal Government will realize enormous savings from \npaying down the debt. As a result, billions of dollars that would have \nbeen required to pay interest on the national debt will become \navailable each year for other purposes. President Clinton believes \nthose debt service savings should be used to strengthen Social \nSecurity. I wholeheartedly agree. But the Republicans refuse to commit \nthese savings to the Social Security Trust Fund. They are short-\nchanging Social Security, while pretending to save it.\n  Currently, the Federal Government spends more than 11 cents of every \nbudget dollar to pay the cost of interest on the national debt. By \nusing the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt over the next \nfifteen years, we can reduce the debt service cost to just 2 cents of \nevery budget dollar by 2014; and to zero by 2018. Sensible fiscal \nmanagement now will produce enormous savings to the government in \nfuture years. Since it was payroll tax revenues which make the debt \nreduction possible, those savings should in turn be used to strengthen \nSocial Security.\n  That is what President Clinton rightly proposed in his budget. His \nplan would provide an additional $2.8 trillion to Social Security, most \nof it debt service savings, between 2030 and 2055. As a result, the \ncurrent level of Social Security benefits would be fully financed for \nall future recipients for more than half a century. It is an eminently \nreasonable plan. But Republican Member of Congress oppose it.\n  Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide any new resources \nto fund Social Security benefits for future retirees, it does not even \neffectively guarantee that existing payroll tax revenues will be used \nto pay Social Security benefits. They have deliberately built a \ntrapdoor in their ``lockdoor.'' Their plan would allow Social Security \npayroll taxes to be used instead to finance unspecified ``reform'' \nplans. This loophole opens the door to risky tax cut schemes that would \nfinance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's \nguaranteed benefits. If these dollars are expended on private accounts, \nthere will be nothing left for debt reduction, and no new resources to \nfund future Social Security benefits. Such a privatization plan could \nactually make Social Security's financial picture far worse then it is \ntoday, necessitating deep benefit cuts in the future.\n  A genuine lockbox would prevent any such diversion of funds. A \ngenuine lockbox would guarantee that those payroll tax dollars would be \nin the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future recipients. The \nRepublican ``lockbox'' does just the opposite. It actually invites a \nraid on the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  Repubican retirement security ``reform'' could be nothing more than \ntax cuts to subsidize private accounts disproportionately benefitting \ntheir wealthy friends. Pacing Social Security on a firm financial \nfooting should be our highest budget priority, not further enriching \nthe already wealthy. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon \nSocial Security retirement benefits for more than fifty percent of \ntheir annual income. without it, half the nation's elderly would fall \nbelow the poverty line.\n  To our Republican colleagues, I say: ``If you are unwilling to \nstrengthen Social Security, at last do not weaken it. Do not divert \ndollars which belong to the Social Security Trust Fund for other \npurposes. Every dollar in that Trust Fund is needed to pay future \nSocial Security benefits.''\n  While this ``lockbox'' provides no genuine protection for Social \nSecurity, it provides no protection at all for Medicare.\n  The Republicans are so indifferent to senior citizens' health care \nthat they have refused to reserve any of the surplus exclusively for \nMedicare. They call this legislation the ``Social Security and Medicare \nSafe Deposit Box Act,'' but in fact they do nothing to financially \nstrengthen Medicare. Rather than providing a dedicated stream of \navailable on-budget revenue to Medicare, their proposal pits Medicare \nagainst Social Security in a competition for funds that belong to the \nSocial Security Trust Fund. We all know that the dollars in the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund are not even sufficient to meet Social Security's \nobligations after 2034. There clearly are no extra funds available in \nSocial Security to help Medicare. Their plan will do nothing to ease \nthe financial crisis confronting Medicare. The Republican proposal for \nMedicare is a sham--and they know it.\n  By contrast, Democrats have proposed to devote 40 percent of the on-\nbudget surplus to Medicare. Those new dollars would come entirely from \nthe on-budget portion of the surplus. The Republicans have adamantly \nrefused to provide any additional funds for Medicare. Instead, they \npropose to spend the entire on-budget surplus on tax cuts \ndisproportionately benefitting the wealthiest Americans.\n\n  According to the most recent projections of the Medicare Trustees, if \nwe do not provide additional resources, keeping Medicare solvent for \nthe next 25 years will require benefit cuts of almost 11 percent--\nmassive cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars. Keeping it solvent for \n50 years will require cuts of 25 percent.\n  The conference agreement passed by House and Senate Republicans \nearmarks the money that should be used for Medicare for tax cuts. \nEight-hundred billion dollars are earmarked for tax cuts--and not a \npenny for Medicare. The top priority for the American people is to \nprotect both Social Security and Medicare. But this misguided budget \nputs Medicare and Social Security last, not first.\n  Democrats oppose this ``lockbox'' because we want real protection for \nSocial Security and Medicare. Our proposal says: save Social Security \nand Medicare first, before the surpluses earned by American workers are \nsquandered on new tax breaks or new spending. It says: extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, by assuring that some of the \nbounty of our booming economy is used to preserve, protect, and improve \nMedicare.\n  Our proposal does not say no to tax cuts. Substantial amounts would \nstill be available for targeted tax relief. It does not say no to new \nspending on important national priorities. But it does say that \nprotecting Medicare should be as high a national priority for the \nCongress as it is for the American people.\n  Every senior citizen knows--and their children and grandchildren \nknow, too--that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are \nalready stretched to the limit--and often beyond the limit--to purchase \nthe health care they need. Because of gaps in Medicare and rising \nhealth costs, Medicare now covers only about 50 percent of the health \nbills of senior citizens. On average, senior citizens spend 19 percent \nof their limited incomes to purchase the health care they need--almost \nas large a proportion as they had to pay before Medicare was enacted a \ngeneration ago. By 2025, if we do nothing, that proportion will have \nrisen to 29 percent. Too often, even with today's Medicare benefits, \nsenior citizens have to choose between putting food on the table, \npaying the rent, or purchasing the health care they need. This problem \ndemands our attention.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle have tried to conceal their own \nindifference to Medicare behind a cloud of obfuscation. They say their \nplan does not cut Medicare. That may be true in a narrow, legalistic \nsense--but it is fundamentally false and misleading. Between now and \n2025, Medicare has a shortfall of almost $1 trillion. If we do nothing \nto address that shortfall, we are imposing almost $1 trillion in \nMedicare cuts, just as surely as if we directly legislated those cuts. \nNo\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\namount of rhetoric can conceal this fundamental fact. The authors of \nthe Republican budget resolution had a choice to make between tax \nbreaks for the wealthy and saving Medicare--and they chose to slash \nMedicare.\n  I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to establish \ngenuine lockboxes for both Social Security and Medicare. H.R. 1259 \ncreates only the illusion of protecting these two landmark programs. It \nprovides inadequate protection for Social Security and no protection at \nall for Medicare. We can do better than this.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey and yield back my remaining time \nto him.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will speak for a moment on this issue which has been of great \nconcern to me. As many of you know, I come from a banking background. \nBankers manage trust funds. I come from a business background where \nbusinesses, as you know, manage their employees' pension funds.\n  Congress has passed laws that make it illegal for any business man or \nwoman in the private sector to reach into an employee's pension fund, \ntake the money out, and spend it on some other program.\n  A few years back Congress passed laws making it illegal for State and \nlocal governments to plunder the pension funds of their employees. But \nduring all this time, where Congress has put these laws on the books \nand made it illegal in the private sector and at the State and local \ngovernment level to plunder pension funds, we have gone on and on in \nWashington taking all the money that goes into the Social Security \ntrust fund, taking every dime of it out, and spending it on some other \nprogram.\n  As a result, as I speak now on the Senate floor, there is no money in \nthe Social Security trust fund. All of it has been taken out and spent \non other programs. They have put meaningless, nonmarketable, \nnonnegotiable securities in the Social Security trust fund, securities \nthat have no economic value because they cannot be sold to raise cash.\n  Right now our Government is building up, theoretically, surpluses in \nthe Social Security trust fund, but they are taking all that money out \nand spending it. So when we actually need it to pay benefits, beginning \nin the year 2014, there will be no money there. No matter what the \nbalance of those bogus IOUs is in the Social Security trust fund, in \nthe year 2014--whether that balance is $1 trillion or $5 trillion--they \nare of no assistance in paying benefits to those who depend on Social \nSecurity. The country will either have to raise taxes or cut benefits \nto make up for the shortfall that is anticipated after the year 2014.\n  This legislation is basic, decent common sense. We should not allow \nCongress to continue frittering away the Social Security trust fund. I \nurge all my colleagues to support it and end this outrageous practice \nof plundering the Social Security trust fund, to the detriment of our \nNation's seniors and those who will be desiring to live on Social \nSecurity benefits in the next century.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Lautenberg for his leadership. What he \ndid in the gun debate is expose that the other side had a sham bill \nwhich they said would promote sensible gun laws. He exposed that. He \nput forward the Lautenberg amendment, which eventually passed, that did \nsomething about the safety of our children.\n  He is doing it again today. He is ready to offer a real amendment to \nhelp our seniors, and he is not able to do it.\n  Let's face it--the Republicans admit it--Medicare is not included in \ntheir lockbox. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, accuses us \nof political demagoguery for pointing this out. To me, that is \nextraordinary. Because we want to offer an amendment to include \nMedicare in the lockbox, we are practicing political demagoguery.\n  Let's ask the average senior citizen if they need their Medicare. \nThere is a beautiful picture of a beautiful couple next to our friend \nfrom Michigan. If they were sitting on this floor, I think he would \nlean over to her and say: Honey, I didn't know they were leaving out \nMedicare.\n  Let me tell you why. Because if you leave out Medicare, even if you \ndo save Social Security--and that is not a fact in evidence in this \nlockbox; there are so many loopholes in it--and all of a sudden seniors \nhave to pay $300 a month more for their Medicare, maybe even more, that \nwill eat up their Social Security.\n  Medicare and Social Security are the twin pillars of the safety net \nfor our retired people. Before Medicare, 50 percent of our seniors had \nno health insurance.\n  Put Medicare into the lockbox. Give us a chance. Vote down cloture. \nLet's have a debate that is worthy of this body.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Will the Chair tell us how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 6 minutes 5 \nseconds, and the Senator from New Jersey has 2 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak briefly.\n  I have to admit to a certain amount of confusion over the arguments \nabout this debate from the other side. When we had what we termed to be \na tough lockbox--and we believe it was, the Senate bill--we were told \nit was too tough. The Secretary of the Treasury sent a letter saying it \nshould be vetoed; it is too tough, puts too many constraints on the \nGovernment.\n  Now we are using the House bill, which virtually every Member of both \nparties in the House voted for, and it is accused of being too easy, \ntoo loose, too many loopholes. I have a hard time figuring out what it \nwill take to be a satisfactory lockbox.\n  If you look at the money that comes to the Federal Government and \ndivide it into two categories, you have one category which is the money \nthat goes into Social Security, on which we run a surplus, and all the \nrest of the money that comes to Washington. It seems to me there is a \nconsensus on all sides that the money that goes into Social Security \nought to not be spent on anything except Social Security. It seems to \nme we could pass that bill, and we could provide the seniors, who I \nhave introduced to us today, with the security that all their Social \nSecurity money will be used for Social Security.\n  There is no consensus as to what to do with all the rest of the money \nthat comes to Washington. That is why we have appropriations \ncommittees. That is why we have reconciliation bills. That is why we \nhave annual budget debates.\n  It does seem to me a little bit odd, if everybody is in agreement \nthat we ought to keep the Social Security revenues for Social Security, \nthat we can't pass that bill but instead we have to have countless \nother debates going on about a variety of other spending priorities. \nCan't we at least agree that the Social Security money that comes for \nSocial Security ought to be spent on Social Security?\n  To me, Mr. President, that is self-evident. All this other discussion \nincreasingly must be an effort to thwart a debate on what to do with \nthe Social Security surplus. To me, that debate ought to be simple. It \nought to be used for Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. If you have any other speakers, we \nwanted to have the----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The last word?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. If you have somebody else who wants to speak, then we \nwill go.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 2 minutes 14 \nseconds. The Senator from Michigan has 3 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are in the final minutes of this \ndebate. I wonder whether could we get unanimous consent to extend this \ndebate by 10 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It has been suggested that we not extend it.\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I strongly support measures that will \ncreate a financially solvent Social Security system for current and \nfuture beneficiaries.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is debating this issue, since the \nTrustees predict that in 2034 the current Social Security system will \nno longer be solvent.\n  However, the proposed lockbox in this legislation is not the way to \nmake Social Security financially solvent for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  The proposed lockbox reminds one of the 1980s--real efforts at fiscal \ndiscipline were ignored in favor for catchy slogans and irrelevant \nprocedural changes.\n  As Congress fiddled, our budget burned. During the 1980s and early \n1990s, the national debt quadrupled and the annual deficit reached \nalmost $300 billion in 1992.\n  If we are going to create a lockbox, the Senate needs to develop one \nwithout any holes.\n  Unfortunately, the lockbox in the current proposal has several large \nholes.\n  It allows Social Security Surplus to be used for Social Security and \nMedicare Reform.\n  For instance, Social Security reform can mean different things.\n  Some of them do not mean achieving solvency of the Social Security \nsystem.\n  Social Security reform could mean creating individual retirement \naccounts.\n  Let's not allow the surplus out of the lockbox until we have \n``reform'' that ensures solvency.\n  If I had been allowed, I would have offered an amendment that would \nuse the Social Security surpluses to pay off the debt held by the \npublic.\n  Only this action will truly ensure that the Social Security surplus \nis used to create a stronger economy.\n  Paying down the debt would lower long term interest rates.\n  Lower interest rates make it less expensive for the American public \nto borrow money.\n  The low cost of borrowing would encourage the American public to get \nloans that they could invest in new business ventures and in education.\n  The new economic activity and increased labor productivity derived \nfrom these activities will lead to increased economic growth.\n  More economic growth leads to increased FICA tax revenue which gives \nthe Social Security Trust Fund more income and extends solvency.\n  This lockbox proposal that we are considering has numerous other \nholes.\n  The proposal focuses on securing the bank that will hold the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  However, it does not secure the train that takes the money to the \nbank.\n  Jesse James, the famous American outlaw, used to rob banks and \ntrains.\n  Like any good outlaw, he would steal money where it was easiest to do \nso.\n  If the bank was too secure to rob, he would rob the train that \nbrought the money to the bank.\n  Congress' abuses of its emergency spending powers are similar to \nrobbing the train that brings the Social Security surplus to bank.\n  The 1990 budget agreement specifically outlined a binding, multi-year \ndeficit-reduction plan, along with a web of procedural controls to \nrestrain federal spending.\n  That included rules on instances when Congress could escape those \nspending restraints to pay for emergency needs.\n  Unfortunately, this emergency safety valve is increasingly used to \nevade fiscal discipline.\n  What Washington believes to be a true ``emergency'' is decidedly \ndifferent than what the average person probably thinks.\n  In the waning hours of last fall's budget negotiations, we passed a \n$532 billion omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Included in that bill was $21.4 billion in so-called ``emergency'' \nspending.\n  Without the emergency designation, Congress would have been required \nto offset each expenditure under the ``pay-as-you-go'' rule that is \ncritical to maintaining fiscal discipline and balance.\n  Let's consider the numbers.\n  In 1998, the Social Security surplus was $99 billion.\n  $27 billion of that surplus was used to cover a deficit in the \nFederal operating budget.\n  An additional $3 billion was used to pay for emergency outlays.\n  All of a sudden, the $99 billion Social Security surplus was reduced \nto $69 billion.\n  In 1999, we are projecting a $127 billion Social Security surplus.\n  But we have spent another $12.6 billion for emergencies, reducing \nthat surplus to $98 billion.\n  And even though we have not yet reached the 2000 fiscal year, we \nalready know that emergency spending expenditures will reduce that \nyear's Social Security surplus by $10 billion.\n  Our repetitive misuse of the emergency process continues to erode the \nSocial Security Trust Fund.\n  Senator Snowe of Maine and I have introduced legislation that would \nestablish permanent safeguards to protect the surplus from questionable \n``emergency'' uses.\n  Specifically, our legislation would do the following:\n  1. Create a 60-vote point of order that prevents non-emergency items \nfrom being included in emergency spending bills.\n  This will ensure that non-emergency items are subject to careful \nscrutiny.\n  2. Create a 60-vote point of order that will allow members to \nchallenge the validity of items that are redesignated as \n``emergencies.''\n  3. Require a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate for the passage of \nany bill that contains emergency spending.\n  This will serve as a ``safety value'' to ensure that there is strong \nsupport for a bill containing emergency spending even if neither of the \nproceeding points of order were exercised for any reason.\n  Mr. President, as we adjust to the welcome reality of budget \nsurpluses--after decades of annual deficits and burgeoning additions to \nthe national debt--we must never forget how easily this valuable asset \ncan be squandered.\n  For too long, the Federal Government treated the budget like a credit \ncard with an unlimited spending limit.\n  If our hard-won surpluses are going to be preserved, we have to \nprevent the abuse of emergency spending from taking over the budgetary \nprocess.\n  Too many instances of misuse will enlarge the hard task of \nidentifying true emergencies and injure the credibility and original \npurpose of ``emergency'' spending.\n  Just as private citizens are warned against falsely dialing 911, \nCongress should be restrained from misusing its emergency spending \npowers. The next door wide open to raids on the surplus will be the one \nthat passes on more debt--and a less secure Social Security system--to \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, a ``lockbox'' is a good idea. But we can make this one \nstronger. We can control ``emergency spending'' so there will be money \nto put in the lockbox for future generations.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the lockbox legislation \nbeing considered by the Senate. The Senate has tried to bring this \nimportant issue to a vote and begin changing the way people think about \nbudget surpluses. Our House colleagues have passed their lockbox \nlegislation and now it is up to the Senate to finish the job.\n  The source of the surplus is a rising inflow of Social Security \npayroll taxes. Under the current budget rules, this revenue is treated \nlike revenue from any other source--it is put into the general fund and \nthen spent. The lockbox would capture the difference between the \ninflows to the Social Security trust fund and the payment of benefits \nto current retirees--reserving it for the Social Security program only.\n  This debate is not only about preserving Social Security, but the \nentire concept of a balanced budget. In 1997, Congress passed the first \nbalanced budget since 1969. We now have a surplus of $134 billion for \nfiscal year 1999 and forecasts show a combined surplus totaling $1.8 \ntrillion over the next ten years. That gives Congress the opportunity \nto work on long term solutions to the fast approaching insolvency of \nthe Social Security and Medicare programs. There are only 28 years \nremaining before Social Security is forecast to go broke. Medicare will \nbe bankrupt in less than half that time. We must ensure that we capture \nas much of the surplus as possible to give Congress the ability to \ndevelop a new Social Security program that is actuarially sound for \nBaby Boomers.\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\n  Without the balanced budget, there would be no surplus to save. That \ngoes for the spending caps, too. Without spending caps, there would \nhave been no enforcement mechanism to prevent Congress from increasing \nthe deficit. The spending caps were the tool that Congress used to \nensure a surplus. The lockbox is another tool for fiscal discipline--\nlike the spending caps--that will help ensure that the Social Security \nsurplus is used for its stated purpose.\n  The Social Security surplus is not ``found money.'' It is money that \nwill provide income for retired Americans. The Administration that said \nit wanted to preserve every penny of the surplus for Social Security \nhas decided that saving the program means spending $1.8 trillion on \nunrelated programs. Congress rejected the President's attempt to spend \nthe surplus and double the national debt in the process. We must not \nspend money that is already earmarked for future Social Security \nbeneficiaries. As an accountant, I have a hard time reconciling the \nPresident's plan to what I know about accounting. He wants to spend the \nsame money he is claiming to save. You can't have it both ways--either \nyou spend it or you save it. The lockbox saves it. Otherwise, the \nPresident forces us to spend it.\n  The lockbox legislation prohibits spending the surplus on anything \nbut Social Security by requiring a 60 vote point of order against any \nlegislation that spends the surplus. The legislation would also combine \nthe lock with a second provision--the requirement that debt held by the \npublic also decline by the same amount the Social Security surplus \nincreases. That would save the Federal government about $230 billion a \nyear in interest over the next 30 years. That is $230 billion that is \navailable for national defense or even education. If we do nothing, the \ngovernment will pay over $10 trillion dollars in interest over the next \nthirty years. The lockbox would help cut the national debt and ensure \nthat future generations are not liable for the fiscal irresponsibility \nof past generations. It is the national debt that could become a \nsignificant roadblock to the economic security of the Baby Boomers. \nWhat will the children of baby boomers do when they have to spend all \nthe U.S. tax revenues on Social Security and know that they will never \nsee a penny of it. Would they revolt? Would they end Social Security? \nThis is a reactionary generation coming up, what will their reaction \nbe? The debt reduction provision of the lockbox legislation is the type \nof farsighted leadership that has been missing in years past. It is \nalso this provision that has earned a veto threat from the President \nfor that reason. It would prevent the President from increasing the \nnational debt as well as the size and scope of government.\n\n  The Social Security lockbox will protect the Social Security surplus \nfrom wasteful spending and ensure that the money will be there to \nfulfill future obligations. Just as corporations are prohibited from \nspending their pension funds on regular business expenses, Congress \nshould have the same restrictions on the Social Security surplus. If \ncompany executives handled pension funds like the current use of Social \nSecurity the executives would be in jail! The temptation to go back to \nthe old tax and spending ways is too great if Congress has access to a \ngrowing pot of money. Congress must not go back to the old spending \nrules. Just because we have a surplus does not mean that the battle has \nbeen won. It means that we must continue to be watchful and ensure that \nthe surplus continues to grow.\n  Last night, both Houses of Congress took up legislation that would \nspend the surplus on programs other than Social Security. The House of \nRepresentatives passed legislation that would spend $14.3 billion more \nthan budgeted for airports. The Senate had a procedural vote to allow \nthe consideration of legislation to give loans to the steel industry \nand small oil and gas producers. That money comes right out of the \nsurplus. It is this type of action that the lockbox is designed to \nprevent.\n  The lockbox's time has come. Congress must not continue to pay lip \nservice to the concept of preserving the Social Security surplus. We \nmust take the bold steps necessary to ensure that the program is around \nfor the long term. We must not use long term funds to satisfy short \nterm wishes. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this \ncommitment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In the final minutes of the debate, I hope we can \nclear the air so that everybody understands what we are talking about.\n  There are these kinds of random accusations about demagoguing this \nissue, et cetera. We are not demagoguing the issue. It is very simple. \nWe ought to be able to discuss it on the floor of the Senate without \nhaving the amendment tree filled up so you can't offer amendments, \nwithout having cloture offered the minute the bill is introduced, so \nthat there is a lame suggestion there is a filibuster going on when \nthere is no time, 1 hour equally divided--that is a filibuster? That is \nnot a man-size filibuster at all. We have had filibusters that have \ntaken 20 hours. So that is not a filibuster. It is all an excuse to \nlock out other opinion, controverting what is being presented to us.\n  Yesterday our good friend from Michigan said that we refused to let \nthat bill go forward, that the Secretary of the Treasury said that we \ncould go into default. That is what he said. We hear these descriptions \nthat are ignored on the other side. We heard our friend from Illinois \nsay that Social Security has these meaningless instruments to protect \nthe trust fund. Meaningless? All they have is the full faith and credit \nof the United States. If any of you have any money, it says on there \n``full faith and credit,'' consider it meaningless, even if you have a \nlot of it.\n  This is a nonsense kind of discussion. What they are saying is there \nis nothing to increase Social Security's solvency being offered. \nWhatever surplus there is in Social Security stays with Social \nSecurity. We agree with that.\n  We want to take the non-Social Security surplus and use 40 percent of \nthat to preserve Medicare. That is what we want to do. Our friends do \nnot want to let us do that. They do not want to have the debate, and \nthey do not want the American public to have their Medicare protected.\n  That is not where they are; they are at protecting it for tax cuts or \nother uses they find appropriate, not for what the American people \nwant.\n  I assume that we are out of time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first of all, I commend Senator Kennedy, \nbecause he offered an amendment. It is pending. I join him in that \namendment. That amendment is germane, and it takes care of the entire \nargument about there being a loophole, because it takes the loophole \nout.\n  We didn't put the loophole in. The House did. The loophole is that \nthe Social Security trust fund should be used only for Social Security. \nThe House said it should also be used for Medicare.\n  Now, the good Senator from New Jersey is saying there are no \namendments possible. This amendment could be called up after cloture, \nand it would take that part of it out and would leave it just for \nSocial Security.\n  Now, senior citizens are hearing an argument that says we ought to \nprotect both Medicare and Social Security in a proposal that is trying \nto take the Social Security fund and keep it for the future for senior \ncitizens. One at a time, let's get it done. What is wrong with the \nother side of the aisle coming forth and debating keeping the Social \nSecurity trust fund for Social Security, not divert over and talk about \nMedicare, which is in committee being debated as to getting a \nbipartisan bill out of committee? We ought to wait for that to occur \nbefore we start talking about Medicare with Social Security.\n  Finally, the idea that this won't work and the notion that Senator \nDomenici in the past has said: Let's first pay off Medicare's \nresponsibility, let me clear that up.\n  We were talking then about a huge cigarette tax. That is not before \nus. The cigarette tax was going to be spent by the President and by \nmany on both sides of the aisle, to which I said: Before we do that, we \nought to set it aside to see if Medicare needs it. That was a brand new \ntax.\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\n  Plain and simple, if the Democrats will cooperate, which they are not \ngoing to, we will bring before the Senate and have a debate: Do you \nwant to put 100 percent of the Social Security trust fund aside and use \nit only for Social Security, or do you want to save 62 percent, as the \nPresident says, for Social Security? Incidentally, to the credit of \nDemocrats in our committee, not a single one of them voted for the \nPresident's budget, not a single one. They voted for little pieces. \nEven they didn't think the President's ideas were correct. Frankly, \nfrom our standpoint, we stand ready, and we say to the American senior \ncitizens: Put the blame where it belongs.\n\n  They didn't let us vote on a tough lockbox because it was too tough. \nWe fixed it up to accommodate the Secretary; still too tough. The other \nside says: You can't get it done. Now we have one that is not as good, \nbut significant, and now they say they want to take care of Medicare \nalso.\n  We ought to get our priorities straight. We are debating a trust fund \nin the Senate for Social Security money. If they want to offer \namendments to change that in some way, even after cloture, they can \nvote on those amendments. I repeat, Senator Kennedy has handled it \nright. He put in an amendment already. That amendment says Social \nSecurity trust funds should only be used for Social Security. It takes \nMedicare out of the House bill. That is a good way to approach this \nlegislation--not to stand up and say Republicans aren't doing anything. \nAs a matter of fact, we came up with the toughest lockbox you could \nimagine. But we heard that it is too tough, too hard on future \nAmericans, to hard on our debt, so we changed it some. Then the excuse \nwas: We are not ready to vote on that; we need more amendments.\n  I think the American senior citizens know what we are trying to do. I \nhope they know what the Democrats are trying to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask that Sean McClusky, Curtis Rubinas, \nDennis Tamargo, and Zachary Bennett of my staff be afforded floor \nprivileges for the consideration of this legislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, once again, the Senate has the \nopportunity to do something meaningful for the American people; that \nis, to protect and strengthen both Social Security and Medicare for \ngenerations to come. I fear we may lose that opportunity in just a few \nmoments.\n  Repeatedly, we have seen lost opportunities as we have debated this \nlockbox issue now for several months. Rather than allowing Senators to \nexercise their rights and offer amendments to improve a given piece of \nlegislation, many of our Republican colleagues have opted for a take-\nit-or-leave-it approach. The losers in each instance are the American \npeople. They know this behavior produces gridlock and partisanship and \nfails to address the problems and concerns faced by American families \naround the country. Yet, this is precisely the course the majority has \nchosen to follow on yesterday's so-called lockbox bill and again on \ntoday's version.\n  In both instances, our Republican colleagues have resorted to \nprocedural tactics to deny Senators the right to offer even a single \namendment.\n  The right to amend is a fundamental part of the legislative process \nand is particularly important given the nature of the bills before us \nyesterday and today. Both of these bills have flaws that, if addressed, \ncould quickly lead to final passage of both. Neither the Abraham bill \nwe considered yesterday, nor the House-passed bill we will soon be \nvoting on, sets aside a single dollar for Medicare--not a dollar, not a \ndime. Nothing.\n  Democrats believe we should protect and strengthen both Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Republicans--at least some of them--can't seem \nto bring themselves to do anything to address the Medicare issue. Given \na choice between Medicare and tax cuts, or just tax cuts, our \nRepublican colleagues are choosing just tax cuts every time.\n  This position is particularly troubling given the state of Medicare's \nfinances and the size of the projected on-budget, non-Social Security \nsurpluses. According to OMB, we will have an on-budget surplus of $1.7 \ntrillion over the next 15 years.\n  According to Medicare's actuaries, the Medicare trust fund is likely \nto go bankrupt in 2015--at the very time when large numbers of the baby \nboomer generation reach retirement age.\n  Large non-Social Security surpluses are within our reach while large \nproblems are looming in Medicare. It seems only natural that we would \ntry to set aside a portion of the $1.7 trillion in on-budget surpluses \nto help protect and reform Medicare. This is precisely the approach \ntaken by Democrats in our alternative: pay down the debt and set aside \nresources for Social Security and Medicare as well.\n  If you look at the comments made by Republicans last year, you would \nthink that they would join us now in our pursuit to protect both of \nthese important programs. Just last year on this floor, Republican \nafter Republican took the opportunity to tell us about the importance \nof saving Medicare.\n  Quoting one Republican Senator:\n\n       What would we do if we had half a trillion dollars to \n     spend? The obvious answer that cries out is Medicare. I think \n     it is logical. People understand the President on ``save \n     Social Security first,'' and I think they will understand \n     ``save Medicare first.'' Medicare is in crisis. We want to \n     save Medicare first.\n\n  So says a Republican colleague just last year.\n  These words, in various forms, were spoken by a number of our \nRepublican colleagues. The only thing that has changed since then is \nthe size of the non-Social Security surplus; it has grown considerably \nin the intervening period. Despite their words from last year and \nforecasts this year showing even larger surpluses--$1.7 trillion over \nthe next 15 years--Republicans now resist setting aside a single dollar \nfor Medicare.\n  Equally disturbing about the so-called Social Security lockbox is \nthat it does not even truly protect Social Security.\n  Rather than lock away Social Security trust funds for Social Security \nbenefits, the Republican bill allows Social Security funds to be tapped \nfor anything they decide to call ``Social Security or Medicare \nreform.'' Be careful of that word ``reform'' because under their \nproposal Social Security trust funds could be spent to privatize the \nprogram or, believe it or not, even to fund tax cuts. Not surprisingly, \ngiven this gaping loophole, the Washington Post described the latest \nRepublican lockbox proposal as follows:\n\n       This is phony legislation . . . . its purpose is to protect \n     the politicians, not the program; and most of it is merely a \n     showy restatement of the status quo. This is legislation \n     whose main intent is to deceive and whose main effects could \n     well be harmful.\n\n  So states the Washington Post.\n  Given the Republicans' so-called Social Security lockbox doesn't \nreally lock anything away, one could easily conclude that the Post's \ncharacterization of the lockbox as ``phony'' is, if anything, too \ngenerous.\n  The lockbox proposal proposed by our colleagues on the Republican \nside is a collapsible box that could ultimately end the Social Security \nsystem as we know it today.\n  Very clearly, Democrats have long supported the idea of protecting \nSocial Security, and we stand ready to work with our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle today as well. But both the Senate and House \nbills need improvement. The Republicans have set up procedures to deny \nus the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\nmake improvements. We are prepared to work with the majority when they \ndecide to proceed in a bipartisan fashion and put good policy ahead of \nwhat they evidently perceive to be better politics.\n  That time has not come today, and I ask my colleagues, for that \nreason, to oppose the cloture motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself time under leader time to \nconclude the debate. I realize we had notified Members we would be \nhaving a vote around 12:30, so I will not use the full 10 minutes. I \nwill just use a portion of it.\n  I want to begin by commending and thanking Senator Abraham and \nSenator Domenici for their leadership in this area. As always, Senator \nDomenici pays very close attention to how we proceed on the budget and \nwhat happens with the people's money. He is a very good custodian of \nthe people's money, and he has provided real leadership in this area; \nand Senator Abraham has been persistent.\n  What we are trying to do is very simple. It doesn't need a lot of \nexplanation. We have the good fortune after many years of having not \nonly a balanced budget but having a surplus. But an important factor is \nthat the surplus is caused or provided by the FICA tax. It is Social \nSecurity revenue that comes in that gives us this surplus. The question \nis, What are we going to do with it?\n  There are a lot of really innovative, thoughtful Members in this and \nthe other body who will surely come up with a variety of ways and say, \nwell, this is an emergency, or that is an emergency, or we need to add \nmore money here, or we need a tax cut somewhere else. Social Security \ntaxes should go for Social Security, and only for Social Security--not \nfor any other brilliant idea we may have. We need some way to lock that \nin.\n  I have talked to young people about this. I talked to my mother. \nBless her heart. She is 86 years of age and is living in an assisted \ncare facility, and is very dependent on Social Security. I have talked \nto people from Montana to Pennsylvania, and Missouri. It is \noverwhelming. People say: You mean, it doesn't already exist this way? \nYou mean that money has been being used or could be used for somebody \nelse? The answer is, it can be, unless we have some procedure, some way \nto put it in a lockbox.\n  Senator Domenici and Senator Abraham had a tighter lockbox, one that \nwould really be hard to get out of, and it would include the President \nin the lockbox. We ought to do it that way. But the Senate has \nindicated three times it does not want to do that. The House has passed \noverwhelmingly--I think with 415 votes, bipartisan votes--this \nprocedure, this procedure that would allow or require a super vote of \n60 votes in the Senate to use these funds for anything else.\n  That is all we are trying to do--just say that Social Security tax \nmoney should go for Social Security; that people support this \noverwhelmingly, probably at least in the 80 percentile.\n\n  As far as amendments, I would be glad to try to work to consider \nother amendments. I have asked for, and I presume we will be receiving, \na copy of one amendment, at least, that Senator Daschle has discussed.\n  But the problem is, this is really simple. It is not complicated. We \nshouldn't be getting off into all kinds of other areas, which are very \nimportant. But Medicare should be dealt with as Medicare. We should \nhave broad Medicare reform--not starting to piecemeal it or trying to \nattach it to Social Security.\n  That is why we want a clear vote. We want a straight vote. It is a \nsimple procedure. Everybody can understand it. And we can move on and \ndeal with other issues.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. Let's get this done. Let's \nmove on. We will have other opportunities to deal with other issues. It \nis something that is long overdue, and it is only the first step. The \nnext step should be a tighter lockbox, and the next step beyond that \nshould be not just more spending for Medicare but genuine, broad \nMedicare reform.\n  But, for now, let's protect Social Security. Let's vote for cloture, \nand let's pass this procedure.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in solidarity with the \nworkers at Avondale Shipyard in Louisiana, who exactly 6 years ago \nexercised their democratic right to form a union and bargain \ncollectively.\n  They voted for a union because that was the only way they knew to \nimprove their working conditions, conditions that include more worker \nfatalities than any other shipyard in the country, massive safety and \nhealth violations, and the lowest pay in the shipbuilding industry.\n  Unfortunately, Avondale and its CEO, Albert Bossier, have refused to \nrecognize the union Avondale workers voted for back in 1993. For 6 \nyears the shipyard and its CEO have refused to even enter into \nnegotiations. According to a federal administrative law judge, Avondale \nmanagement has orchestrated an ``outrageous and pervasive'' union-\nbusting campaign in flagrant violation of this country's labor laws, \nillegally firing and harassing employees who support the union.\n  I met with some of the Avondale workers several weeks ago when they \nwere here in Washington. What they told me was deeply disturbing. They \ntold me about unsafe working conditions that make them fear for their \nlives every day they are on the job. They told me that job safety was \nthe number one reason why they voted to join a union back in 1993. And \nthey told me that Avondale continues to harass and intimidate workers \nsuspected of supporting the union.\n  In fact, it appears that one of those workers, Tom Gainey, was \nharassed when he got back to Louisiana. Avondale gave him a three-day \nsuspension for the high crime of improperly disposing of crawfish \nremains from his lunch.\n  The Avondale workers also told me that they are starting to lose all \nfaith in our labor laws. For 6 years Avondale has gotten away with \nthumbing its nose at the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB. The \nAvondale workers said they are starting to think there is no point in \nexpecting justice from the Board or the courts. And given what they \nhave been through, I think it is hard to disagree.\n\n       In February 1998, a Federal administrative law judge found \n     Avondale guilty of ``egregious misconduct,'' of illegally \n     punishing dozens of employees simply because they supported \n     the Avondale union. The judge, David Evans, found that \n     Avondale CEO Albert Bossier had ``orchestrated'' an anti-\n     union campaign that was notable for the ``outrageous and \n     pervasive number and nature of unfair labor practices.''\n\n  In fact, Judge Evans found Avondale guilty of over 100 unfair labor \npractices. Specifically, Avondale had illegally fired 28 pro-union \nworkers, suspended 5 others, issued 18 warning notices, denied benefits \nto 8 employees, and assigned ``onerous'' work to 8 others.\n  Judge Evans also found that, during public hearings in the Avondale \ncase, Avondale's Electrical Department Superintendent, a general \nforeman, and two foremen had all committed perjury. He further found \nthat perjury by one of the foremen appears to have been suborned, and \nhe implied that Avondale and its counsel were responsible.\n  Avondale's intimidation of its employees was so outrageous, so \npervasive, and so systematic that Judge Evans came down with a highly \nunusual ruling. He ordered CEO Albert Bossier to call a meeting with \nAvondale workers and personally read a statement listing all of the \ncompany's violations of the law and pledging to stop such illegal \npractices. Judge Evans further ordered Mr. Bossier to mail a similar \nconfession to workers at their homes.\n  Finally, Judge Evans fined Avondale $3 million and ordered the \nshipyard to reinstate 28 workers who had been illegally fired for union \nactivities. Pretty remarkable.\n  What is even more remarkable is that Avondale still hasn't paid its \nfine, still hasn't rehired those 28 workers, and still hasn't made any \napology. Why not? Because instead of complying with Judge Evans' order, \nAvondale chose to challenge the NLRB in court.\n  Judge Evans' ruling concerned Avondale's unfair labor practices \nduring and after the 1993 election campaign. A second trial was held \nthis past winter on charges of unfair labor practices during the mid-\n1990s. Now the NLRB has filed charges against Avondale for unfair labor \npractices since 1998, and a third trial on those charges is scheduled \nto begin later this year.\n  This has been one of the longest and most heavily litigated \nunionization disputes in the history of the NLRB. After workers voted \nfor the union in June 1993, Avondale immediately filed objections with \nthe Board. But in 1995 an NLRB hearing officer upheld the election, and \nin April 1997 the Board certified the Metal Trades Council as the union \nfor Avondale workers, once and for all rejecting Avondale's claims of \nballot fraud.\n  At this point, you might think Avondale had no choice but to begin \nnegotiations with the union. But they didn't. Avondale still refused to \nrecognize the union or conduct any negotiations. So in October 1997 the \nNLRB ordered Avondale to begin bargaining immediately. Instead, \nAvondale decided to challenge the NLRB's decision in the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and has succeeded in delaying the process for another \ntwo years, at least.\n\n  Safety problems at Avondale were the central issue in the 1993 \nelection campaign. ``We all know of people who have been hurt or killed \nat the yard,'' says Tom Gainey, the Avondale worker who was harassed \nafter visiting Congressional offices several weeks ago. ``That's one of \nthe main reasons we came together in a union in the first place.''\n  Avondale has the highest death rate of any major shipyard. According \nto federal records, 12 Avondale workers died in accidents from 1982 to \n1994. Between 1974 and 1995, Avondale reported 27 worker deaths. The \nNew Orleans Metal Trades Council counts 35 work-related deaths during \nthat period. One Avondale worker has died every year, on average, for \nthe past thirty years.\n  It doesn't have to be that way. Avondale's fatality rate is twice as \nhigh as the next most dangerous shipyards. And it's more than twice as \nhigh as its larger competitors, Ingalls Shipyard and Newport News.\n  Avondale workers have died in various ways, many from falling or from \nbeing crushed by huge pieces of metal. Avondale workers have fallen \nfrom scaffolds, been struck by falling ship parts, been crushed by \nweights dropped by cranes, and have fallen through uncovered manholes.\n  Avondale's safety problems are so bad that it recently got slapped \nwith the second largest OSHA fine ever issued against a U.S. \nshipbuilder. OSHA fined Avondale $537,000 for 473 unsafe hazards in the \nworkplace. OSHA found that 266 of these violations--more than half--\nwere ``willful'' violations. In other words, they were hazards Avondale \nknew about and had refused to fix.\n  Most of these violations were for precisely the kind of hazards that \naccount for Avondale's unusually high fatality rate. These 266 \n``willful'' violations involved hazards that can lead to fatal falls, \nand three of the seven workers who died at Avondale between 1990 and \n1995 died from falls. Didn't Avondale learn anything from these \ntragedies?\n  OSHA found 107 ``willful'' violations for failure to provide adequate \nrailings on scaffolding. 51 willful violations for unsafe rope rails. \n30 willful violations for improperly anchored fall protection devices. \n25 willful violations for inadequate guard rails on high platforms. And \n27 willful violations for inadequate training in the use of fall \nprotection.\n  OSHA also found 206 ``serious'' violations for many of the same kind \nof hazards. ``Serious'' violations are ones Avondale knew about--or \nshould of known about--that pose a substantial danger of death or \nserious injury.\n  This is what Labor Secretary Alexis Herman had to say about \nAvondale's safety problems: ``I am deeply concerned about the \nconditions OSHA found at Avondale. Falls are a leading cause of on-the-\njob fatalities, and Avondale has put its workers at risk of falls up to \n90 feet. The stiff penalties are warranted. Workers should not have to \nrisk their lives for their livelihood.''\n  OSHA Assistant Secretary Charles Jeffress said, ``Three Avondale \nworkers have fallen to their deaths, one each in 1984, 1993, and 1994. \nThis inspection revealed that conditions related to these fatalities \ncontinued to exist at the\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\nshipyard. This continued disregard for their employees' safety is \nunacceptable.''\n  And what was Avondale's response? True to form, Avondale appealed the \nOSHA fines. Avondale claimed that many of the violations were the \nresult of employee sabotage. Avondale also tried to argue that the OSHA \ninspector was biased. In response, the head of OSHA observed that \n``it's very unusual for a company to accuse its own employees of \nsabotage, and it's very unusual for a company to attack the objectivity \nof OSHA inspectors.''\n  OSHA had found many of the same problems back in 1994, the last time \nit conducted a comprehensive inspection of Avondale. In 1994 OSHA cited \nAvondale 61 times for 81 violations, with a fine of $80,000 that was \nlater settled for $16,000.\n  There may be more fines to come. The OSHA inspection team will soon \nfinish its review of Avondale's safety and medical records. This review \nwas delayed last October when Avondale launched yet another legal \nbattle to prevent OSHA from obtaining complete access to its records.\n  One of the Avondale workers who visited my office several weeks ago \nwas there during the OSHA inspection, and told me how it happened. OSHA \ntried to inspect Avondale's Occupational Injuries and Illness logs. But \nAvondale refused complete access and, according to OSHA, ``attempted to \nplace unnecessary controls over the movements of the investigative team \nand their contact with employees.''\n  When OSHA issued a subpoena for the logs, Avondale stopped all \ncooperation with OSHA and told the inspectors to leave the premises. \nOSHA had to go to New Orleans district court to get an order enforcing \nthe subpoena.\n\n  The other main issue in the 1993 election campaign was pay and \ncompensation. Avondale workers have long been the worst paid in the \nshipbuilding industry. They have the lowest average wage of any of the \nfive major private shipyards. According to a survey conducted by the \nAFL-CIO, Avondale workers make 29 percent less than workers at other \nprivate contractors for the Navy, and 48 percent less than workers at \nthe nation's federal shipyards. One Avondale mechanic, Mike Boudreaux, \nsays, ``It's a sweatshop with such low wages.''\n  By way of comparison, look at Ingalls Shipyard, down the river in \nPascagoula, Mississippi. The average pay at Ingalls is higher than the \ntop pay at Avondale. Or look at wages in nearby New Orleans for \nplumbers, pipe fitters, and steam fitters. Their average wage is higher \nthan the top pay at Avondale.\n  Avondale is also known for its inadequate pension plan. There are \nAvondale retirees with 30 years' experience who retire with $300 per \nmonth. And workers complain that they can't afford Avondale's family \nhealth insurance, which costs $2,000 per year. Avondale workers pay \nmore for health care every week than Ingalls workers pay every month.\n  Unlike other shipyards, Avondale has had a hard time attracting \nworkers, and inferior working conditions certainly have a lot to do \nwith it. Avondale has responded to this labor shortage by using prison \nlabor and importing workers from other countries. It imported a group \nof Scottish and English workers who were so appalled at the working \nconditions and low pay that they quit after three days. Nearby Ingalls \nshipyard, by contrast, has never had to import foreign workers on \nvisas.\n  So why does Avondale pay so little? Because times are tough? Hardly. \nAvondale CEO Alfred Bossier has been doing quite well, thank you. In \n1998, Mr. Bossier's base salary and bonuses totaled $1,012,410, up more \nthan 20 percent from the previous year. His benefits increased to \n$17,884, up 73 percent from the previous year. And he got 45,000 shares \nof stock options, worth up to $1,927,791. The grand total comes to \nabout $3 million.\n  Meanwhile, the average hourly production worker at Avondale earns \nless than $10 an hour--or around $20,000 per year. So Al Bossier brings \nhome about 150 times the salary of the average hourly worker.\n  The obvious question is how can Avondale get away with such appalling \nbehavior? How can it be so brazen? The answer is depressing. Avondale \ngets away with it because our labor laws are filled with loopholes. \nAvondale gets away with it because the decks are stacked against \nworkers who want to improve their working conditions by bargaining \ncollectively.\n  Avondale gets away with it because they have enough money to tie up \nthe courts, knowing full well that organizing drives can fizzle out in \nthe five or six or seven years that highly-paid company lawyers can \ndrag out the process. When asked how Avondale gets away with it, one \nworker laughed and said, ``This is America. It's money that talks.''\n  There's one other reason why Avondale gets away with it, and this is \nsomething I find especially troubling. They get away with it because \nAmerican taxpayers are footing the bill. The Navy and the Coast Guard \nare effectively subsidizing Avondale's illegal union-busting campaign. \nAvondale gets about 80 percent of its contracts from the Navy for \nbuilding and repairing ships. If it weren't for the United States Navy, \nAvondale probably wouldn't exist. This poster child for bad corporate \ncitizenship is brought to you courtesy of the American taxpayer.\n  This is a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right \nhand is doing. On the one hand, the NLRB and OSHA find Avondale in \nflagrant violation of the law. On the other hand, the Navy keeps \nrewarding Avondale with more contracts. Avondale has gotten $3.2 \nbillion in contracts from the Navy since 1993, when the shipyard first \nrefused to bargain collectively with its workers.\n  To add insult to injury, Avondale is billing the Navy for its illegal \nunion-busting. The Navy agreed to pick up the tab for anti-union \nmeetings held on company time in 1993. Nearly every day for three \nmonths leading up to the union election, Avondale management called \nworkers into anti-union meetings. Then they billed the Navy for at \nleast 15,216 hours spent by workers at those meetings.\n  Some of these meetings were the same ones where Avondale illegally \nharassed and intimidated workers, according to Judge Evans. Yet the \nDefense Contractor Auditing Agency, DCAA, approved Avondale's billing \nas indirect spending for shipbuilding. And Avondale billed the Navy \n$5.4 million between 1993 and 1998 for legal fees incurred in its NLRB \nlitigation.\n  When the Navy looks the other way as one of its main contractors \nengages in flagrant lawbreaking, it sends a message. When the Navy \nkeeps awarding contracts to Avondale, when it pays Avondale for time \nspent in anti-union meetings where workers are harassed and \nintimidated, when it pays for the legal costs of fighting Avondale's \nworkers, it sends a message. It sends the message that this kind of \nbehavior by Avondale is okay.\n\n  When Avondale continues to beat out other shipyards for huge defense \ncontracts, that sends a message too. It sends a message that this is \nthe way you compete in America today. You compete by violating your \nworkers' rights to free speech and free assembly. You compete by \nillegally firing and harassing your workers. You compete by keeping \nyour employees from bettering their working conditions through \ncollective bargaining.\n  And that message is not lost on other companies. They see what \nAvondale is getting away with, and they draw the obvious conclusions. \nThe AFL-CIO's state director pointed to another Louisiana company that \ninitially refused to recognize the union its workers had elected. \n``Part of it is they're following Bossier's lead,'' she said. ``After \nall, the guy's been at it for five years [now six] and he still gets \nall the contracts he wants.''\n  Under federal regulations, the Navy is required to exercise oversight \nover the $3.2 billion in contracts it has awarded to Avondale. And the \nNavy can only award contracts to ``responsible contractors.'' The \ncontracting officer has to make an affirmative finding that a \ncontractor is responsible. Part of the definition of a ``responsible \ncontractor'' is having a ``satisfactory record of integrity and \nbusiness ethics.'' So the Navy has to affirmatively determine that \nAvondale has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.\n  Well, what exactly would qualify as an unsatisfactory record? Judge \nEvans ruled that Avondale management had\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\norchestrated an ``outrageous and pervasive'' union-busting campaign \nconsisting of over 100 violations of labor law and the illegal firing \nof 28 employees. OSHA has found 473 safety violations--266 of them \nwillful--and fined Avondale $537,000, the second largest fine in U.S. \nshipbuilding history.\n  The AFL-CIO has asked the Navy to investigate Avondale's business \npractices, as a first step to determining what steps should be taken. \nThat doesn't sound so unreasonable to me. In fact, it seems to me that \nthe Navy ought to be concerned when its contracts come in late, as they \nhave at Avondale. It ought to be concerned when a contractor's working \nconditions are so bad that it suffers from labor shortages.\n  And it seems to me the Navy ought to investigate whether a company \nfound to have orchestrated an ``outrageous and pervasive'' campaign to \nviolate labor laws is a responsible contractor. Or whether a shipyard \nfound to have willfully violated health and safety laws 266 times is a \nresponsible contractor.\n  The Navy says it cannot take sides in a labor dispute. But nobody is \nasking them to do that. The problem is that they already appear to have \ntaken sides. When the Navy finances Avondale's union-busting campaign, \nwhen it pays legal fees for Avondale's court challenges, when it \ncertifies Avondale as a responsible contractor with a satisfactory \nrecord of integrity and business ethics, and when it rewards Avondale \nwith Navy contracts, the Navy appears to be taking sides.\n  What has happened at Avondale should give us all pause. The NLRB's \ngeneral counsel acknowledges that the Avondale case exposes the many \nproblems with the system, caused in part by budget cuts and procedural \ndelays. ``It's hard to take issue with the notion that it's frustrating \nthat an election that took place five years ago [now six] still hasn't \ncome to a conclusion. It's something we're looking at as an example of \nthe process not being what it should be.''\n  Indeed, the Avondale case exposes glaring loopholes in our labor laws \nthat make it next to impossible for workers to form a union and bargain \ncollectively. In fact, this case provides us with a roadmap for putting \na stop to rampant abuses of our labor laws.\n  First of all, we need to restore cuts in the NLRB's budget so that \ndefendants with deep pockets can't delay the process for years and \nyears. But beyond that, we need to improve our labor laws so we can put \na stop to abuses of the kind we've seen in the Avondale case.\n  We need to install unions quickly after they win an election, the \nsame way we allow elected officials to take office pending challenges \nto their election. Why should workers be treated any differently than \npoliticians?\n  In addition, we need to strengthen penalties against unfair labor \npractices such as the illegal firing of union organizers and \nsympathizers. And we need to ensure that organizers have equal access \nto workers during election campaigns, so that companies like Avondale \nare not able to intimidate their employees and monopolize the election \ndebate.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have introduced legislation that would do \nexactly that. Our bill--S. 654, the Right to Organize Act of 1999--\nwould provide for mandatory mediation and binding arbitration, if \nnecessary, after a union is certified. It would provide for treble \ndamages and a private right of action when the NLRB finds that an \nemployers has illegally fired its workers for union activity. And it \nwould give organizers equal access to employees during a union election \ncampaign.\n  The Avondale case sends a message to other companies and to workers \neverywhere, and it's the exact opposite of the message we should be \nsending. We should be sending a message that corporations are citizens \nof their community and need to obey the law and respect the rights of \ntheir fellow citizens.

Mr. President, in 1906, Wisconsin sent a new Senator to \nWashington, and this body and this Government have never been the same \nsince.\n  From the moment he arrived, delivering powerful orations on the floor \nof this Chamber and taking on the most powerful interests in this \ncountry and all around the world, he became the stuff of legend. Of \ncourse, I am talking here about Robert M. La Follette, Sr., who was \ndestined to become one of the greatest Senators in the history of this \ndistinguished body. It is fitting that his portrait now hangs in the \nSenate reception room outside of this Chamber, along with just four \nother legendary Senators: Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, \nand Robert Taft.\n  When he came to this body, La Follette was already known as an \ninsurgent, and his arrival made more than a few of his colleagues \nnervous, including, of course, the Senate's leadership. At the time, \nbecause this was prior to the ratification of the 17th amendment in \n1913, Senators were still appointed by State legislatures, and La \nFollette himself had been appointed to fill the office after he served \nas Governor of Wisconsin for 5 years.\n  By and large, however, the Senate of the early 1900s was dominated by \nthe powerful economic interests of the day: the railroads, the steel \ncompanies, and the oil companies, and others.\n  Senator La Follette did not disappoint those in his State and across \nthe country who looked to him to champion the interests of consumers, \ntaxpayers, and citizens against those entrenched economic forces. The \nSenate in those days, if you can imagine this, had an unwritten rule \nthat freshman Senators were not supposed to make floor speeches.\n  La Follette broke that rule in April of 1906. He gave a speech that \nlasted several days and covered 148 pages of the Congressional Record. \nSpeaking on the most important legislation of the year, the Hepburn Act \nregulating railroads, La Follette discussed the power of the railroad \nmonopolies and declared:\n\n       At no time in the history of any nation has it been so \n     difficult to withstand those forces as it is right here in \n     America today. Their power is acknowledged in every community \n     and manifest in every lawmaking body.\n\n  So La Follette offered amendments to try to make railroad regulation \nmore responsive to consumer interests. His amendments lost, of course, \nbut that was part of the plan. That summer he went on a speaking tour \nacross the country. He described his efforts to change the Hepburn Act. \nAnd then he did something extraordinary and unprecedented: He read the \nrollcall on his amendments name by name. This ``calling of the roll'' \nbecame a trademark of La Follette's speeches. Its effect on audiences \nwas powerful. You see, at the time Senators' actual votes on \nlegislation were not as well known publicly as they are today. And then \nwhen Americans found out that their Senators were voting against their \ninterests, they were shocked and they were angry.\n  The New York Times reported the following:\n\n       The devastation created by La Follette last summer and in \n     the early fall was much greater than had been supposed. He \n     carried senatorial discourtesy so far that he has actually \n     imperiled the reelection of some of the gentlemen who hazed \n     him last winter.\n\n  La Follette's calling of the roll was part of an effort to expose \ncorporate and political corruption. His view was that powerful economic \ninterests controlled the Senate, preventing it from acting in the \npublic interest. Then, in 1907, just a year after La Follette had come \nto the Senate, the Congress finally acted on legislation that had been \nunder consideration since an investigation a few years earlier of \ninsurance industry contributions to the political parties. That \nlegislation, the Tillman Act, banned corporations from making political \ncontributions in connection with Federal elections.\n  Today, over 90 years later, obviously much has changed in the Senate \nand in the country. For one thing, the votes of Senators are available \nalmost instantly on the Internet and published\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\nregularly in the newspapers. Come election time, political ads remind \nvoters regularly about our voting records. La Follette's idea that the \npublic should know how its representatives have voted and it should \nhold those representatives accountable for their votes is well accepted \nin our modern political life.\n  The power of corporate and other interests in the Senate is still too \nstrong. The nearly century-old prohibition on corporate political \ncontributions is now a mere fig leaf made meaningless by the growth of \nsoft money. Today, corporations, unions and wealthy individuals give \nunlimited--I repeat, unlimited--contributions of soft money to the \npolitical parties. While, technically, corporations still do not \ncontribute directly to individual campaigns, they might as well be. \nIndividual Members of Congress get on the phone and raise soft money \nfor their parties, and that money is in turn targeted at congressional \nraces. Some Members have set up so-called leadership PACs to accept \nsoft money for use in their own political endeavors. Soft money has, \nonce again, given corporations the kind of influence over this Congress \nthat La Follette railed against on this very floor.\n  Since I have come to the Senate, I have noticed that we talk about \nthe money that funds our campaigns and the influence on policy only a \nfew times a year. That is when we are debating actual campaign finance \nlegislation. It is almost as if the influence of campaign money on our \nbusiness here is an abstract proposition, relevant only when we debate \nchanging the way campaigns are financed. But we all know that the power \nof money in this body is much more pervasive and, I would say, \ninsidious than that.\n  We know, if we are honest with ourselves, that campaign contributions \nare involved in virtually everything that this body does. Campaign \nmoney is the 800-pound gorilla in this Chamber every day that nobody \ntalks about but that cannot be ignored. All around us and all across \nthe country, people notice the gorilla. Studies come out on a weekly \nbasis from a variety of research organizations and groups that lobby \nfor campaign finance reform that show what we all know: The agenda of \nthe Congress seems to be influenced by campaign money. But in our \ndebates here, we are silent about that influence, and how it corrodes \nour system of government.\n\n  Mr. President, we can allow that silence no longer. In the tradition \nof my illustrious predecessor Senator La Follette, I am inaugurating a \nmodern version of the Calling of the Roll. I will call it the ``Calling \nof the Bankroll.''\n  I don't expect to be listing votes or specific contributions to \nspecific Senators, but I will be providing vital information, both to \nmy colleagues and the public, as to how much money special interests \nare donating overall to candidates and political parties. I'll be \nproviding a context for evaluating our debates on legislation, and I'll \nbe doing it right here on this floor, and in the Congressional Record, \nfor the convenience of the public and my colleagues.\n  I plan to Call the Bankroll from time to time here on the floor of \nthis Senate as we debate significant legislation and at least until \nthis body passes a campaign finance reform bill. This body can no \nlonger ignore the 800 pound gorilla. I'm going to point him out \nsometimes when I speak on a bill, because I think we in the Senate need \nto face this issue head on. We cannot just pull our head out of the \nsand to discuss the influence of money on the legislative process once \na year when we take up a campaign finance bill.\n  I am sure my colleagues are familiar with the old adage that is \nattributed to Otto von Bismark: ``If you like laws and sausages, you \nshould never watch either one being made.'' Well, we might not like to \nadmit that campaign contributions are an ingredient of our legislation, \nbut we know that they are. And the public knows too, although they \nmight not know the details.\n  But it's those details which help the public see the big--and \ndisturbing--picture of the influence of wealthy interests on our \nlegislation.\n  It's time to illustrate clearly how our flawed campaign finance \nsystem, which corrupts our democracy, also affects our daily lives. The \npublic has a right to this information--it has a right to know how the \nspecial interests have worked to influence legislation, and how that \ninfluence has had an impact on everything from defense spending to the \nY2K problem, and just about everything in between.\n  I think this information should be part of our public debate on \nimportant legislation, and that's why I will Call the Bankroll from \nthis floor. In fact I've already started to do this over the past few \nweeks on several occasions. For example, when we considered the \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, which included a rider to \ndelay the implementation of new mining regulations, I called attention \nto the more than $29 million the mining industry contributed to \ncongressional campaigns during the last three election cycles, and the \n$10.6 million the industry made in soft money contributions during the \nsame period. During our debate over the Juvenile Justice bill, I noted \nthe $1.6 million the NRA gave in PAC money in the last election cycle, \nand the $146,000 in PAC money Handgun Control gave during the same \nperiod. Just last month, when I argued for my amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill concerning the Super Hornet, I \nincluded information about the more than $10 million in PAC and soft \nmoney contributions the defense industry made in the last cycle. I also \npointed out during the debate on Y2K legislation that the computer and \nelectronics industry gave close to $6 million in PAC and soft money in \n1997 and 1998, while the Association of Trial Lawyers of America gave \n$2.8 million.\n\n  We have many difficult and important bills to work on this year, Mr. \nPresident: bankruptcy reform, financial modernization when it comes \nback from conference, a patients' bill of rights, and all of our \nspending bills. It won't be difficult, indeed it will be easy, to find \nexamples in each of those areas of huge campaign contributions coming \nfrom industries and groups that are affected by our work. The \nbankruptcy reform bill itself is a prime example: The members of the \nNational Consumer Bankruptcy Coalition--an industry lobbying group made \nup of the major credit card companies, and associations representing \nthe nation's big banks and retailers--gave nearly $4.5 million in \ncontributions to parties and candidates in the last election cycle.\n  The public deserves to know about this, Mr. President. It deserves to \nknow about the campaign contributions these interests are giving us and \nour political parties at fundraisers--fundraisers that sometimes take \nplace the night before or the night after we vote on bills that affect \nthem.\n  Now Mr. President, I do not have any pride of authorship here, nor do \nI plan to lay out the whole picture of campaign contributions that \nmight be relevant to our discussion of a bill. To the contrary, I \nencourage my colleagues to join this debate. And in particular I want \nto recognize the effort of my friend the Senator from South Carolina, \nwho on Tuesday came to this floor during the closing debate on the Y2K \nbill, calling his own roll of the high tech companies that have made \ncampaign contributions to this Congress.\n  If any of my colleagues feel that the contributions of a different \nindustry or interest group should be highlighted, I encourage them to \nadd that information to their remarks in this chamber. I will also \nwelcome any corrections or additions that my colleagues might wish to \nprovide. Nor do I believe that organizations that may have supported me \nshould be exempt from the Calling of the Bankroll. Providing \ninformation about the contributions of any group or interest is \nwelcome, and, more than that, it is critical to the purpose of this \neffort.\n  This information should be in the Record, and all Senators should be \naware that these facts are in the Record as they decide how to cast \ntheir votes. It is time that the 800-pound gorilla of campaign money be \nmade a part of our debate on legislation.\n\n  I look forward to the day when the Calling of the Bankroll will no \nlonger be necessary; when this body has adopted bipartisan campaign \nfinance reform legislation to ban soft money and to restore the \nvitality of the law banning corporate contributions to federal \nelections that was enacted in 1907, the year after Robert La Follette \nof Wisconsin came to the Senate.\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\n  Let me close with another quote from Senator La Follette's inaugural \nspeech on the floor of the Senate. He was responding to the argument \nthat public sentiment had been whipped into an unreasonable hysteria \nover the question of whether the railroads controlled the Congress. His \nwords seem quite apt to me as a response to those who argue on this \nfloor that we really have no campaign finance problem in this country--\nand that the media and the groups that support reform exaggerate the \nimpact of money on the legislative process. He said:\n\n       [I]t does not lie in the power of any or all of the \n     magazines of the country or of the press, great as it is, to \n     destroy, without justification, the confidence of the people \n     in the American Congress. . . . It rests solely with the \n     United States Senate to fix and maintain its own reputation \n     for fidelity to public trust. It will be judged by the \n     record. It can not repose in security upon its exalted \n     position and the glorious heritage of its traditions. It is \n     worse than folly to feel, or to profess to feel, indifferent \n     with respect to public judgment. If public confidence is \n     wanting in Congress, it is not of hasty growth, it is not the \n     product of `jaundiced journalism.' It is the result of years \n     of disappointment and defeat.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate must respect the public judgment and fix \nits reputation for fidelity to the public trust. It must let the solid \nbipartisan majority of this body that supports reform, work its will \nand pass a campaign finance reform bill this year. Until it does, Mr. \nPresident, I plan to Call the Bankroll. I'm going to acknowledge the \n800 pound gorilla in this chamber, and I'm going to ask my colleagues \nto do the same. And then I'm going to see if we can't agree that it's \ntime to show him the door.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes, \nactually, to speak on our time. I want to make a connection between \nwhat my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, was saying about \nthe mix of money and politics and all the ways in which big money \nundercuts representative democracy. I want to make a connection to a \npiece of legislation that we are trying to get out here on the floor, \nwhich is the Patient Protection Act. I say to my colleague from \nWisconsin, who is calling the payroll, one of the things I want to do \nis maybe just come to the floor and present some data about \ncontributions that come from parties on all sides of this question. But \nfrom my point of view, you have a health insurance industry that sort \nof really basically has made the effort to keep universal health care \ncoverage and, for that matter, basic protection of patients, consumer \nprotection, off of the agenda. I think it is our responsibility to put \nit back on the agenda.\n  I think we have reached a point in our country where the pendulum has \nswung too far in the direction of increasingly ``corporatized'' \nmedicine, and it has become corporatized, bureaucratized. You have \nbasically a few large insurance companies that own and control the \nmajority of the managed care plans and, as a result of that, the \nconsumers and the patients wonder where we fit in.\n  There are a series of Senators on the Democratic side--I certainly \nhope there will be an equal number on the Republican side--that are \ncommitted to bringing patient protection legislation to the floor. Some \nof my colleagues, such as Senators Durbin, Kennedy, I think Boxer, and \ncertainly Senator Daschle have introduced a bill, and we were all \nspeaking about this last night. We want to talk about ways in which \nthere can be sensible consumer protection.\n\n  That is really what the issue is: Making sure our caregivers--our \ndoctors and our nurses--are able to make decisions about the care we \nneed as opposed to having the insurance industry decide; making sure \nyou have a medicine that is not a monopoly medicine with the bottom \nline as the only line; making sure people don't find themselves, as \nemployers shift from one plan to another, no longer able to take their \nchild to a trusted family doctor; making sure families with children \nwith illnesses are able to have access to the kind of specialty care \nthat is the best care for their children; making sure there is an \nombudsman program available so that advocates who are there, to whom \npeople can go, do know what their rights are; making sure that when we \nhave an external review process of the kind of decisions that are made, \npeople have a place to make an appeal and they know the decision will \nbe a fair decision--making sure, in other words, that we are able to \nobtain the best care for our families.\n  As I travel around Minnesota--and around the country, for that \nmatter--I find it astounding the number of people, the number of \nfamilies, that fall between the cracks. The number of people--even if \nyou are old enough for Medicare, it is not comprehensive. Seniors from \nMinnesota can't afford the prescription drug costs. It does nothing \nabout catastrophic expenses at the end of your life. If you are ill and \nyou have to be in a nursing home, almost everything you make is \nbasically going to be taken away; there will be nothing left.\n  That is one of the things that strikes terror in the hearts of \nelderly people--or people aren't poor enough for medical assistance, \nwhich is by no means comprehensive enough; or people aren't lucky \nenough to be working for an employer that can provide them with good \ncoverage.\n  To boot, what happens right now is that people who have the coverage \nfind that with this medicine that we have, it is just going so far in \nthe direction of becoming a bottom-line medicine that consumers are \nbasically left in the dust.\n  We want to have some sensible protection for consumers. We want to \nbring it to the floor of the Senate. And we want to have a debate on \nthis legislation.\n  The majority party--the Republican Party--leadership has taken to the \nsituation that they want to be able to sign off on amendments we \nintroduce. But that is not the way it works. It not a question of some \nSenators telling other Senators what amendments are the right \namendments to introduce. We should have the full-scale debate. We \nshould be able to come out here with amendments. We should be able to \ncome out here with amendments that provide consumers with more rights \nto make sure that people have access to the care they need; to make \nsure the decisions are made by qualified providers; to make sure the \nbottom line is not the only line; to make sure this is not an \ninsensitive medical system; to make sure that people do not go without \nthe kind of care they need. We want to do that.\n  We are committed to making this fight, and, if necessary, I think \nwhat you are going to see happen over the next week and beyond is that \nwe are going to, one way or another, have a debate about this \ncritically important issue.\n  As long as I am talking about health care, I would like to say also \nthat I think the other central issue is the way in which the insurance \nindustry is taking universal health care coverage off the table. We \nneed to put it back on the table. I can't think of an issue that is \nmore important to families in our country.\n\n  Mr. President, might I ask how much time we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has exceeded his time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience. I ask\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\nunanimous consent, without anybody on the floor, that I be allowed an \nadditional 10 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this is a real pleasure, because one of the problems \nwe have had out here on the floor of the Senate is not enough time to \nbe able to focus on issues that are terribly important, that we really \nbelieve ought to be part of this debate and part of the discussion.\n  As long as I see the Chair, the Senator from Ohio, presiding, I would \nlike to thank him for what I think is really his focus, or at least \npart of his work, which is the importance of what we do in making sure \nthat, even before kindergarten, we do well by our children.\n  I would really like to say before the Senate that I hope we will get \nback soon to a focus on the family issue. I don't think it is all, I \nsay to the Presiding Officer, Government policy. But I do think it is a \ncombination of public sector and private sector and community volunteer \nwork. It should be a marriage made in Heaven, where we really bring \npeople together and we as a nation achieve the following goal. To me, \nthis is the most important goal. I think this should be the central \ngoal of the public policy of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. I think this is where the Federal Government can \nmatter, where we can be a real player: It is pre-K.\n  We ought to make it our goal that every child prekindergarten--she \nknows the alphabet, he knows colors and shapes and sizes; she knows how \nto spell her name; he knows his telephone number; and each and every \none of them has been read to live; and each and every one of the \nchildren in our country comes to kindergarten and has that readiness to \nlearn--they have, I say to the Presiding Officer, that spark of \nlearning that he saw as Governor when he visited elementary school; \nthey have that.\n  There are just too many children who, by kindergarten, are way \nbehind, and they fall further behind, and then they run into \ndifficulty.\n  I just want to say I really am disappointed that, in spite of all the \nstudies, in spite of all the reports, in spite of a White House \nconference, in spite of all of the media coverage--and to a certain \nextent there is a part of me with some anger that says maybe in spite \nof the hype--that we have not centered our attention on what it is we \ncould do here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives to \nenrich the lives of children in our country, to make sure that somehow \nwe can renew our national vow of equal opportunity for every child. \nFrom my point of view, I think there is probably no more important \nfocus.\n  If I were to think about the kind of issues we talk about all the \ntime--solvency for Social Security; where are we going to be as a \nnation in 1050? Are we going to have a productive, high-moral, skilled \nworkforce? What about Medicare expenses? How do we reduce violence in \nour communities, violence in homes, violence in schools, violence out \nin the neighborhood?--each and every time, I make the argument, the \nmost important thing we could do would be to make an investment in the \nhealth and skills and intellect and character of our children. To me, \nthat would start with pre-K.\n\n  The tragedy of it all--it is a tragedy because we are talking about \npeople's lives--is we have not focused on that agenda at all. We don't \neven have but about 50 percent of the kids who qualify for Head Start \nreceiving assistance; and, if it is early Head Start, pre-3-year-olds. \nI think it is naive. It is just a couple of percentage points. I don't \nthink it is even 10 percent. If you move beyond low-income and you look \nat working families, we are lucky if 20 percent of the families that \ncould use some assistance, some investment that would help them find \ngood child care for their children, get any assistance at all. And \nthen, if you move beyond that and you talk about the wages of child \ncare workers, who do the most important work, it is deplorable the kind \nof wages we pay.\n  On the floor of the Senate, I argue that this ought to be our \npriority. I argue that it doesn't--it cannot make us comfortable that \nat the same time the economy is humming along, we have about one out of \nevery four children under the age of three growing up poor, and about \none out of every two children of color under the age of three growing \nup poor in our country. We ought to make that a big part of our \nagenda--children's education, health care coverage, patient protection \nrights, universal health care coverage.\n  Finally, I will finish by going back to what Senator Feingold said.\n  I will make sure he is not lonely and out here alone. I will help him \ncall that bankroll, because we ought to put reform right at the top of \nour agenda.\n  We ought to talk about the mix of money and politics. We ought to \ntalk about the ways in which big money dominates politics. We ought to \nunderstand the fact that the reason people have become disillusioned \nwith politics is not because they don't care about the issues that are \nimportant to their lives. People care deeply and desperately about \nbeing able to earn a decent living, giving their children the care they \ndeserve and need, about livable communities, and about being able to do \nwell by their kids. People care about all those issues and more. They \ncare deeply and desperately.\n  However, they also believe that their concerns are of little concern \nin the Nation's Capitol, where politics is so dominated by the big \nmoney, by the investors, by the givers, by the heavy hitters. They \nbelieve if you pay, you play; and if you don't pay, you don't play.\n  We ought to make reform and the way money has turned elections into \nauctions and severely undercutting representative democracy, where each \nand every man and woman should count as one and no more than one--that \nis not the case--we ought to make that the central issue.\n  I heard Senators Feingold, Durbin, Boxer, Kennedy and Senator Daschle \nspeaking. We intend to bring these issues to the floor, along with one \nother issue that is near and dear to my heart: That is what has now \nbecome an economic tragedy--family farmers are being driven off the \nland. When will they get a fair price? When will they have a fair and \nopen market? When do we take action against the conglomerates that \nbasically dominate the market? When do we take antitrust action?\n\n  I heard my colleague talking about Senator LaFollette. When do we \ntake on the economic interests? When will we be there on the side of \nchildren, on the side of education, on the side of decent health care, \non the side of reform, on the side of working people, on the side of \nproducers?\n  We ought to be there. All these issues are interrelated. These are \nthe issues that we will insist be part of the agenda of this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Mr. President, over the past several weeks, much of the \ndiscussion and debate in the Senate has focused on high technology and \nits impact on our everyday lives, particularly with regard to its \npivotal role in our economy. We heard about the potential problems \nrelated to Y2K computer failures and the need to guard against \nunreasonable liability in the event that Main Street small businesses, \nthrough no fault of their own, become the targets of frivolous \nlawsuits. In short, we have been preoccupied with the dawn of the 21st \ncentury and what we can do to help sustain the robust economic growth \nthat has been fueled by as many remarkable breakthroughs in computer \ntechnologies and computer-related services as we could possibly \nimagine.\n  Last Thursday, a new reality dawned when I saw a copy of a study on \nelectronic commerce, or e-commerce as business conducted over the \nInternet is known. Many Members got a jolt from the story entitled \n``Net's Economic Impact Zooms.'' A study shows $301 billion was \ngenerated in revenue in 1998, and it produced 1.2 million jobs. The \nfindings were reported in the USA Today and were drawn from a study \nconducted by the Center for Research and Electronic Commerce at the \nUniversity of Texas and Cisco Systems.\n  Frankly, I, too, was shocked but in good company because the figures \nexceeded the wildest expectations of the experts. To add a little more \nperspective from that study, consider that\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\nfrom 1995 to 1998 the new Internet economy grew 174 percent, compared \nto the 3.8 percent growth in the world economy as a whole. The Internet \neconomy alone ranked among the top 20 economies worldwide. More \nimportantly, this awe-inspiring growth, packed into just a few short \nyears, stands almost toe to toe with the economic horsepower generated \nby the Industrial Revolution.\n  The onslaught of e-commerce and the Internet puts us in the same \nposition as the snail who was run over by a turtle. When interviewed \nabout it, he said: It all happened so fast I never saw it coming.\n  We are working hard to see if we can work with small businesses to \nhelp them see it coming. E-commerce is leading a new business \nrevolution, from Wall Street to Main Street. In my view, there simply \nis no more potent force at work in the economy with the equal potential \nto propel nearly every business into the 21st century.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, it is my \npleasure to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take \ncare of and to be concerned about whether small, independent, family-\nowned, and home-based businesses are adequately prepared to be full \npartners in the remarkable growth potential that the Internet economy \nholds.\n  Some folks may assume that the rapid development of new technologies \nhas given Main Street America the tools to compete more effectively, \nbut the unanswered question is whether the technologies readily \navailable to small businesses are truly up to the challenge.\n  Yesterday, in the Senate Committee on Small Business, we held a forum \nentitled ``e-commerce: Barriers and Opportunities for Small Business.'' \nWe had a blue-chip panel of experts in high-tech computer and software \ncompanies and business leaders representing over 20 trade groups to \nidentify and target barriers keeping Main Street businesses from \nexpanding into e-commerce.\n\n  We were joined by several of the companies that are leading the \ncharge in pushing back the rise of the Internet economy, including an \nInternet service provider from my home State of Missouri, Primary \nNetwork of St. Louis.\n  It was an exciting and informative session considering the potential \ngrowth e-commerce will undoubtedly spark for many years to come. One of \nthe participating companies, CyberCash, unveiled new research \nspecifically for yesterday's forum projecting e-commerce business will \ngenerate another million jobs over the next 2 years. Those are \nconservative estimates.\n  Another study from the firm, Cyber Dialogue, shows that many small \nbusinesses are already taking advantage of e-commerce-based markets. \nThat study says over 427,000 small businesses added web sites and sold \n$19 billion worth of products and services over the Internet in the \nlast 12 months, a 67-percent increase since early 1998.\n  Unfortunately, not all the news was good. According to the American \nCity Business Journals and the Network of City Business Journals, only \n10 percent of small businesses have a web site today and only 32 \npercent have access to the Internet. That suggests both a disconnect \nand, at the same time, an incredible opportunity for Main Street \nAmerica and for the suppliers of the equipment and services.\n  What is more, we were reminded that for many small businesses you \nhave to be prepared to deal with a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week \nbusiness. Some small businesses have difficulty raising the capital and \nacquiring the knowledge to survive in such a dynamic business area. \nResearch has shown that even major companies have been slow to realize \nthe potential, and many are now working hard to regain market shares \nthey lost.\n  Today, thanks to the cutting-edge expertise and the information \nprovided at yesterday's forum, we are a little wiser about the Internet \neconomy. We know that e-commerce can be economic TNT. I think Congress \nhas a duty to make sure that as many independent, family-owned and \nhome-based businesses as possible are not at risk of being left behind \nin this worldwide business revolution.\n  I am deeply grateful to the occupant of the Chair. His subcommittee \nof the Senate Committee on Appropriations has approved a $1 million \nearmark we asked for to allow the Small Business Administration's \nOffice of Advocacy to begin a study of the potential of e-commerce for \nsmall business. We are going to ask the Office of Advocacy to develop a \nweb site to help small businesses who want to do business with the \nFederal Government.\n  Make no mistake, the Internet economy is a train that has already \nleft the station and it is picking up speed by the minute. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues, both in the committee and in \nthis broader body, to help Main Street America climb on board.\n  I look forward to pursuing this effort. We are outlining just a few \nsteps we will take on the Senate Committee on Small Business. We \nwelcome ideas, participation and suggestions from other colleagues. We \ninvite all Members of the Senate to join in making sure that the \nsmallest businesses in the United States have access to this tremendous \nengine of economic growth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7096-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ELECTRONIC COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Missouri \nfor his excellent work on the Small Business Committee in a very \nimportant area--the dramatic growth in electronic commerce and the \nability of small businesses to participate in that. We hear so much \nabout the family farm and the small business community being in \njeopardy. As we transition in this economy, to have a chairman of the \nSmall Business Committee who is on top of that and working to integrate \nthe advances in electronic commerce with our small business community, \nand to make those advances available to them is very important. I \ncongratulate him on that, and Senator Mack and Senator Bennett of the \nJoint Economic Committee for a series of hearings this week in the area \nof technology and its impact and continued potential impact on our \ncountry and on our economy and the world economy.\n  These are the things, frankly, we do not do enough of around here, \nlooking at the future to see how we can adjust our public policy to \nalleviate not just what the problems are or what the problems were that \nhave been with us but how, through innovation, we can form the future \nto alleviate those problems.\n  So I am very pleased we are focusing in on the future as opposed to \njust dealing with the current important problems; not looking through \nthe rear-view mirror instead of looking in front at the opportunities \nahead us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7096-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7096-S7097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  MR. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to thank the chairman of the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee on Appropriations, Senator Domenici, for \nagreeing to an amendment I offered to restore $25 million of money for \nthe Lackawanna River levee raising project in Lackawanna County, near \nScranton, PA. That is a critical project to the people in Greenridge \nand the Albright Avenue sections of Scranton, who have suffered \nimmeasurable loss in prior floods, which is a chronic problem in the \nLackawanna River area. All of Lackawanna and the counties in \nnortheastern Pennsylvania have had terrible problems with flooding. \nThis is a critical project and one I have to commend Congressman Joseph \nMcDade for his work, before he left here, in getting that money.\n  I just cannot tell you how much I appreciate Senator Domenici's \nwillingness to restore that money into this bill so we can tell the \npeople up in Scranton that money will be there, that money is there to \nraise the levee, to prevent the damage that could be caused by future \nhigh waters on the Lackawanna River.\n  I know it was a very difficult thing for Senator Domenici to do. I \nagain want to tell him how much I appreciate his willingness to do \nthat. I know Senator Specter was on the floor here a couple of days ago \nexpressing a similar concern, so I think I can speak for Senator \nSpecter. We are both very grateful the Senator has agreed to restore \nthat money so we can tell the people\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\nup in Scranton that money will be there, the levee will be built, and \nthere will be money in the pipeline and it will be available whenever \nthat money is needed to raise that levee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7097-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7097-S7098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE SOCIAL SECURITY LOCKBOX\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, finally I want to comment on the vote we \njust had on the lockbox. I have to say I am puzzled and disappointed at \nthe unanimous opposition by Senate Democrats to a proposal that passed \nwith 416 votes in the House. Obviously, almost every House Democrat--\nall but 12--voted in favor of this measure, a measure which obviously \nhas broad bipartisan support and, as many have stated in the House and \nthe Senate, one that is a first step toward dealing with the long-term \nproblems of Social Security.\n  The first step is very simple. We have a surplus. Do not spend it on \nthings other than Social Security; save it for Social Security. We are \neventually going to have to do Social Security reform. We are going to \nhave to strengthen it and save it for future generations. It runs out \nof money in the next 15 years, so we are going to have to do something. \nWe have surpluses building up which are now just being borrowed by the \nGovernment and spent on other things. We have had that happen for the \npast 20 years.\n  We are now in a unique position. We are close to an on-budget \nsurplus. We are not quite there, but we are very close to an on-budget \nsurplus, non-Social Security surplus. So we have the Social Security \nmoney which will go to save Social Security by reducing the Federal \ndebt unless we spend it. In a sense, all this lockbox does is say: \nDon't spend the money. Don't come up with new ideas and new ways to \nspend Social Security.\n  We are not asking anybody to cut anything. That is one of the most \nremarkable things about it. We are not asking the other side to cut \nmoney to make sure the money is there for Social Security. All we are \nsaying is don't spend more. That is why it received bipartisan support \nin the House.\n  We hear so much talk on both sides of the aisle about how we have to \nsave Social Security first, how Social Security is the highest \npriority, how we have to make sure money is there for future \ngenerations. In fact, in the budget vote just a couple of months ago, \nwe had a 100-to-nothing or 99-to-nothing vote that we need to save \nSocial Security; we are not going to spend that money in the trust \nfund. That was just a sense of the Senate. In other words, the first \nhad no binding effect in law.\n  Now the mechanism comes along that says if we are going to pass a \nbill that is going to spend Social Security surpluses, we have to have \na separate vote where we have to stand up before the clerk and say: \nYes, I will spend the Social Security surplus on this.\n  There is no such vote that has to be cast right now. This will set up \na point of order where every Member of the Senate has to say to the \npeople back home: I want to spend Social Security money on this, \nbecause I think it is more important than Social Security. That is all \nthis point of order does.\n  There are points of order out there on spending, but there is nothing \nclear. There are points of order whereby you can challenge something if \nit breaks the budget point of order or this and that, and people run \nout and say it is really not Social Security. You can dance around it. \nYou can spin it back home. There are lots of folks very good at \nspinning. The wonderful thing about this provision is you cannot spin \nit. It is what it is. It is a vote that says we will spend the Social \nSecurity surplus on this. That will have, I believe, the greatest \nimpact--in this body and the other body, and in particular the other \nend of Pennsylvania Avenue, the President--on controlling our \nwillingness to raid the Social Security trust fund for the demands of \nspending today. Or, for that matter, the demands of tax cuts today. I \nwant to add, it is not just a governor on those, principally on the \nother side, who want to spend more. It is also a governor on those on \nthis side who want to cut more taxes.\n\n  As I said before, there is no tax cut I will not vote for, just \nabout. But I am not going to do it out of the Social Security surplus. \nWe will do it out of the general fund where the taxes are paid in. If \npeople are paying in too much in the general fund, give them a tax cut, \nif we can. I will vote for it. If we can cut spending in the general \nfund to pay for a tax cut, I will vote for it. But I will not fund a \ntax cut out of Social Security funds, and that is what this says.\n  While on the first vote on cloture many Democrats will vote no as a \nmatter of principle, I am hopeful they will understand this is a bill \nthat has consensus, that can be signed, that can put real restraints on \nour ability and the President's ability to spend the Social Security \nsurplus and, hopefully, we will reach a point where we can have \nbipartisan consensus on this, because Social Security is simply too \nimportant to continue to play political games.\n  I think what we have seen here is all the rhetoric says: Yes, we \nagree; yes, we agree. But when it comes down to casting the vote, what \nwe have is this spurious argument, ``You are not letting us amend it,'' \nwhich I find is quite remarkable because, if you look at the \namendments, they have virtually nothing to do with Social Security.\n  In fact, I have not seen all the amendments, but those I have been \nmade aware of have absolutely nothing to do with Social Security. They \nall have to do with what we do with the general fund surplus, and that \nis the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus.\n  We have on a bill, which is focused on Social Security, on how we \nsave Social Security, an attempt to bring in a whole lot of other \nissues to clog up this issue, to bog it down, and, in my mind, to try \nto destroy any chance of this ever becoming law.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from \nPennsylvania as I was coming through the Chamber. I want to propound a \nquestion.\n  I do not think there is much disagreement in this Chamber as to \nwhether anybody ought to put their mitts on the Social Security funds. \nThose are dedicated taxes that go into a trust fund and should only be \nused for Social Security. I must say, several years ago, we had an \nincredible debate in this Chamber on amending the Constitution. It was \nthe case that those who wanted to amend the Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget were saying, put in the Constitution a provision that \nputs the Social Security funds, along with all other operating revenues \nof the Federal Government, into the same pot. Many of us were very \nupset about that and stood on the floor day after day saying that was \nthe wrong thing to do; you ought not put them in the same pot.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will respond to that. It is a far different thing to \nput a Government program--and I do not know of any Government program \nthat exists, with maybe the exception of defense, but defense has \nchanged over time--in the Constitution of the United States and say we \nare going to set up this Federal program that must be, in a sense, left \nalone when future Congresses, as I certainly hope will occur, will be \nmaking adjustments to that program.\n\n  In fact, 200 years from now, who knows what this country is going to \nlook like. It may, in fact, want to do something completely different \nthan what we have in mind today. I think that was the concern of a lot \nof us. If we were going to start enshrining Government programs in the \nConstitution, that is a fairly dangerous precedent, and I think a lot \nof us had real concerns about that.\n  At the same time, there was broad sympathy that we do need during \nthis time of surplus, because it is not going to be forever that the \nSocial Security surpluses will be there, as the Senator knows because, \nagain, things change--for this time period, we can lock this away and \ndo it by legislation, in this case a point of order.\n  As the Senator knows, 15 years from now, that provision in the \nConstitution would work almost in some respects against Social Security \nbecause they would be running a deficit. As the economics of Social \nSecurity change, enshrining that in the Constitution I do not think is \nin the best interest of Social Security. Here we can react to\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\nwhat is a surplus situation and make sure that it is protected from \nraids.\n  What will happen in the future is that it will be a deficit \nsituation, and there may be a different dynamic that goes on with \nrespect to that, which I do not think the Constitution would provide \nfor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the time \nSenator Jeffords comes to the Chamber, I be recognized on that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, while we wait for Senator Jeffords, who \nhas a very important matter to bring before the Senate, let me thank \nthe many Senators who have cooperated in an effort to get this bill \npassed. We still have the issue that Senator Jeffords will raise before \nthe Senate, but I suggest, in a bill that is about $600 million less \nthan the President requested with reference to the nondefense part of \nthis bill, we have done a pretty good job of covering most of the \nprojects in this country that are needed, that the Corps of Engineers \nand the Bureau of Reclamation talk about and a number of projects in \nthe sovereign States that our Senators, from both sides of the aisle, \nrepresent.\n  We have done our best. We were not able to fund everything, nor were \nwe able to fund at full dollar, and we had to reduce funding for the \nongoing projects substantially in the flood line of money and projects \nthat the Corps of Engineers has going for it.\n  We understand that the allocations for this subcommittee, which is \nmade up with a significant amount of defense money and a lesser amount \nof nondefense money, have been allocated in the House in a manner that \nis about $1.6 billion less than this bill. We do not know how that can \never be worked out in conference, so we are very hopeful that before \nthe House is finished, they will do some of the things that have been \ndone in the Senate to alleviate the pressure on committees such as the \nenergy and water subcommittee and others.\n  We have no assurance of that, but obviously everything is in place so \nthat when this is passed today, if it is passed, we will be on a path \nto be ready for the House bill when they send it over and immediately \ngo to conference. We will be ready to do that at the beck and call of \nthe House to try to get this bill done at the earliest possible time.\n\n  I will await the arrival of the distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico, that I appreciate his hard work on this measure. This has \nbeen very difficult. As he has pointed out, we do not have the money we \nhad last year. To meet all the demands on this very important \nsubcommittee has been very difficult.\n  We have harbors that need to be dredged. We have water projects that \nare ongoing which are important to prevent flooding and to allow people \nto develop commerce in various parts of the country. We have been \nunable to do all that was required to be done under this bill, but we \nhave done our best.\n  I extend my appreciation to those Members on this side with whom we \nhave had to work on these amendments. It has been very difficult. There \nhas been some give-and-take on both sides.\n  Senator Domenici and I have worked together now on three different \nbills, and each year it seems that it gets more difficult.\n  But for our relationship, this bill would even be more difficult.\n  I also say what the Senator has said but perhaps in a different way. \nFrom this side of the aisle they must hear the message in the other \nbody that we need at least this much money to do a bill. For the other \nbody to come in and say that we are going to cut even more than is cut \nhere means we are not going to get a bill. This has been cut to the \nbear bones. We cannot go any deeper.\n  Senator Schumer from New York has done an outstanding job in \nadvocating things he thinks the State of New York deserves in this \nlegislation. We have been able to meet many of the things he has \nsuggested and advocated--in fact, most everything. I had a longtime \nrelationship with his predecessor, who was an extremely strong advocate \nfor\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\nthe State of New York. Senator Schumer certainly stepped into those \nshoes and has been as strong an advocate as Senator Moynihan.\n  The one thing we were unable to do for the State of New York dealt \nwith the Community Assistance and Worker Transition Program, and that \nwas at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Interestingly, yesterday, \nthe one meeting I was able to have off the floor was with Assistant \nSecretary Dan Reicher. The reason I say ``interestingly'' is because \nthis is the program he works with in the Department of Energy, the \nWorker Transition Program.\n  In this bill, there is money for that program. We are ratcheting this \ndown every year. In our bill, we have $30 million for that program. \nSenator Schumer thought there should be an earmark for Brookhaven \nNational Laboratory. We thought that was inappropriate. It had not been \ndone in the past; we could not do it on this bill.\n  I have indicated to the Senator from New York that we will work in \nconference to see if there can be something done. But more important, \nthe Senator from New York must know that Assistant Secretary Reicher \nsaid Brookhaven was a prime candidate for that.\n  In short, I believe this can be done administratively and will not \nrequire legislation. So if, in fact, the people of Brookhaven are laid \noff permanently--and it has not been determined yet whether they are \ngoing to be laid off permanently--Secretary Reicher indicated there was \na real strong possibility they would fit right into the Community \nAssistance and Worker Transition Program that has been able in the past \nto cover people at Savannah River in South Carolina, Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory in Tennessee, the Pinellas Nuclear Facility in Florida, and \nthe Nevada Test Site in Nevada.\n  So Brookhaven National Laboratory has many of those same conditions \nand problems. We are going to work very hard to make sure we do what we \ncan to protect those workers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n  If the reactor at Brookhaven is decommissioned, and the workers have \nleft because of a loss of confidence, or other reasons, the lab \ncertainly will lose its efficiency in its mission. If the reactor is \nrestarted, the decontamination team will need transition assistance.\n  The simple expedient of providing some assistance now, I believe, \nwill avoid the waste and needless suffering. In short, we are going to \ndo what we can, both from a legislative standpoint, but more \nimportantly from an administrative standpoint, to take care of those \nproblems. So I appreciate, I say to the manager of this bill, the \ncooperation of the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I state here for the Record my sincere \nappreciation and thanks to Senator Reid, the ranking minority member, \nand his staff--all of them. This is a complicated bill involving \neverything from the deepest military needs in terms of research, in \nterms of development, maintenance, safekeeping of all of our nuclear \nweapons at our nuclear laboratories around the country, the maintenance \nof all the other laboratories that DOE runs, to water, inland waterways \nand barges and seaports and flood prevention. Many Members have an \nactive interest. We have had to work very hard to do what we think is a \nreasonably good job under the circumstances.\n  I also say to the distinguished junior Senator from New York, with \nreference to Brookhaven, I am totally familiar with the situation at \nBrookhaven. I worked on it for 2 years in a row when they had some \nproblems up there. We worked with the administration and the \nDepartment. Clearly, if they qualify for the Worker Transition Program, \nwe ought to be able to handle it administratively. The Department ought \nto be able to do that.\n  I say to Senator Reid, I will be there helping wherever I can. I am \nvery grateful we did not have to have a vote on this issue, because I \nthink we would have had to object to it. I think it is much better that \nit be handled administratively. If they are entitled to it, they will \nget it because the program is already there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We have been told the Senator from Vermont will be here in \na matter of a couple minutes. While we are waiting for the Senator to \ncome, I want to just build upon some of the things the senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico talked about.\n  This bill, I am confident, is one of the most complicated bills in \nthe entire 13 Appropriations subcommittees. It deals with the Corps of \nEngineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy, atomic \nenergy, defense activities, the Power Marketing Administrations, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority. I think I have covered most all of \nthem.\n  But this bill deals with a myriad of very difficult problems. We find \neach year the requests--which are valid requests--from Members trying \nto protect interests in their State get bigger because the problems \nbecome more complex. It has made it most difficult, because the numbers \nwe are allowed to work with are going down all the time.\n  Not only do we deal with problems in the continental United States, \nbut, of course, our two newest States, Alaska and Hawaii. We also deal \nwith problems in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands. This is very difficult as it relates to the Corps of \nEngineers.\n  The construction account for the Corps of Engineers deals with \nproblems that are all over this part of the world. We even deal with \nproblems that some say have gone on too long. The fact of the matter is \nthat sometimes when we are not able to give the full amount of the \nmoney in a given year, then the projects take more money. We may start \nout with a program that costs $100, and if you spread that out over, \ninstead of 1 year, 3 years, it winds up costing more than $100. Those \nare some of the problems we have faced in this bill.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation was first authorized in 1902. The Bureau of \nReclamation manages, develops, and protects water reclamation projects \nin arid and semiarid areas in 17 of the Western States. The first ever \nBureau of Reclamation project in the history of the United States was \nin arid Nevada. It was called the Newlands project, named after a \nCongressman from Nevada named Francis Newlands, who later became a \nSenator. It was going to make the desert blossom like a rose; and it \ndid. It diverted water from the Truckee River. It created some very \ndifficult problems. In this bill we are working on it. Even though it \nwas 96 years ago that the first act took place, we are still trying to \ncorrect some of the problems that were created. The Bureau of \nReclamation provides in this bill over $600 million to handle water and \nrelated resources accounts. It is something that has been made more \ninteresting as a result of something I talked about when the bill came \nup on Monday, and that is the CALFED project.\n\n  This is a huge project. It is a program that the private sector has \ninvested in, the State of California has invested in, and local \ngovernment in California has invested in, along with the Federal \nGovernment. This project, the Bay Delta in California, CALFED project, \ndeals with two-thirds of the water, the potable water, the water they \ndrink in the State of California--a difficult project. It is something \nthat is extremely important to a State that has 35 million people in \nit. Yet we have projects from the Bureau of Reclamation to some of our \nsmallest States and populations, but we have to work with this \nmultitude of problems with less money. And we keep going down, as I \nsaid.\n  The Department of Energy, a large part of this bill: We deal there \nwith energy programs, nondefense environmental management, uranium \nenrichment and decontamination, decommissioning funds; we deal with \nscience programs, atomic energy, defense activities, which take up a \nlarge amount of money in this bill; and we have to do this to support \nthe safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. This program is \nbecoming even more important with the emphasis that has been focused on \nour nuclear programs as a result of the China problem dealing with the \nsupposed theft, the alleged\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\ntheft, the spying that has taken place in one of our laboratories, and \nmaybe more than one of our laboratories.\n  Power marketing administrations: We have had to work money there to \nsee what we can do to maintain that very important program.\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is part of our \nresponsibilities.\n  We have also had for many years the responsibility of a program \nestablished in 1965 called the Appalachian Regional Commission. This is \na regional economic development agency. This program, which has been \ngoing on for some 44 years, receives over $70 million in this bill, \nwhich is important for a large part of the United States. The amount of \nmoney we have been asked to increase for this program has been very \ndifficult to come by. There have been the increased construction costs \nof the Richie County Dam, and the cost has gone up because of delays \ndue to a legal challenge over some problems in the Fourth Circuit. This \ncaused our bill to be required to spend more money.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission: This bill provides $465.4 million. \nThere are some offsetting revenues that we reduced the amount we need \nto put in this bill.\n  For each of these entities, everything we do is vitally important. \nEach dollar we do not put in is something less that they can do that \ncertainly is required.\n  Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board: This is a board which reviews \nwhat happens with this very important issue of nuclear waste. Just this \nmorning, the full committee, authorizing committee, chaired by the \njunior Senator from Alaska, reported out a very important nuclear waste \nbill. Part of what happens with nuclear waste has to be reviewed by the \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board. We fund that program.\n  One of the programs that has been ongoing for many, many years, back \nin the days of the Depression, is the Tennessee Valley Authority. Under \nthis bill, they receive some $7 million.\n  We have a lot to do in this bill. It seems it becomes more \ncomplicated each year because of the cut in moneys that we receive. We \nhave worked very hard, as the Senator from New Mexico has indicated, \ntrying to resolve most of these amendments. We have been able to do it \nwith the cooperation of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 648\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funding for energy supply, research, and \n development activities relating to renewable energy sources, with an \n                                offset)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a point of order that amendment No. \n648, offered by Senator Jeffords, violates section 302(f) of the Budget \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not pending. The Senator \nwould have to call for the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I believe that was already done with a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as far as I know, my amendment has not \nbeen called up.\n  Mr. REID. That is what the Chair just said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that amendment No. 648 be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:.\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself, Mr. \n     Allard, Mr. Roth, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n     Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 648.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the reading of the \namendment.\n  The amendment shall be read to completion until consent is granted to \ndispense with the reading.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 20. strike lines 21 through 24 and insert \n     ``$791,233,000, of which $821,000 shall be derived by \n     transfer from the Geothermal Resources Development Fund and \n     $5,000,000 shall be derived by transfer from the United \n     States Enrichment Corporation Fund, and of which $70,000,000 \n     shall be derived from accounts for which this Act makes funds \n     available for unnecessary Department of Energy contractor \n     travel expenses (of which not less than $4,450,000 shall be \n     available for solar building technology research, not less \n     than $82,135,000 shall be available for photovoltaic energy \n     systems, not less than $17,600,000 shall be available for \n     concentrating solar systems, not less than $37,700,000 shall \n     be available for power systems in biomass/biofuels energy \n     systems, not less than $48,000,000 shall be available for \n     transportation in biomass/biofuels energy systems (of which \n     not less than $1,500,000 shall be available for the \n     Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research), not less than \n     $42,265,000 shall be available for wind energy systems, not \n     less than $4,000,000 shall be available for the renewable \n     energy production incentive program, not less than $7,600,000 \n     shall be available for support of solar programs, not less \n     than $5,100,000 shall be available for the international \n     solar energy program, not less than $5,000,000 shall be \n     available for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, not \n     less than $27,850,000 shall be available for geothermal \n     technology development, not less than $27,700,000 shall be \n     available for hydrogen research, not less than $6,400,000 \n     shall be available for hydropower research, not less than \n     $32,000,000 shall be available for high temperature \n     superconducting research and development, not less than \n     $3,000,000 shall be available for energy storage systems, and \n     not less than $18,500,000 shall be available for direction of \n     programs).''.\n\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a point of order that amendment No. \n648 offered by Senator Jeffords violates section 302(f) of the Budget \nAct which prohibits consideration of legislation that exceeds the \ncommittee's allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in the long tradition of the Senate, I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to amend the amendment by \ndeleting the word ``unnecessary'' as it first appears in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, because we were in a quorum call, I wanted \nto point out to my colleagues that a group of us, just moments ago, \nheld a press conference discussing the issue----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rules require unanimous consent for the \nSenator to proceed at this point because a point of order has been made \nagainst the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, under the rules of the Senate, does the \nSenator object to having to identify himself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would ask, object to what?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator who objects to the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a matter of order in the Senate not to \nproceed when there is a pending point of order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection to what?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from North Dakota state his \nrequest.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I asked consent to be recognized. My understanding is we \nwere in a quorum call. I asked consent to be recognized for the purpose \nof discussing a press conference we just held on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. Because we were in a quorum call and not conducting other \nSenate business, I wanted to have a few minutes to discuss\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\nthat subject. So I ask unanimous consent to be able to do so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, at this time, I would like to take the \nfloor to discuss the amendment that I have just withdrawn. I do so with \nsome reluctance, but denying a Senator the right to amend his own \namendment is such a rare situation--if not unprecedented--that I think \nit is only fair and appropriate for those of us who have worked long \nand hard on this amendment and know they have sufficient votes to pass \nit, as modified, to have the opportunity to at least discuss and to let \nthis body know what they are being prevented from doing by virtue of \nthis rare use of the rules.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I want to state to the Senator that as one of the managers \nof this bill, I think the content of his amendment is very good. I \nthink he has had a record of looking out for programs like solar and \nrenewable energy. I have a personal commitment to work with the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the senior Senator from New Mexico as this matter goes \nto conference to see how well we can do in regard to the matters he has \nput before the Senate.\n  In short, my statement is in the form of a reverse question. I want \nthe Senator to understand that certainly there was nothing personal in \nregard to exercising my rights under the rule. In fact, it is one of \nthe more difficult things I have done in my time here. The Senator from \nVermont offered something that I think needs to be spoken about. He has \ndone it before very eloquently, and we will do the best we can from the \ntime that this bill leaves this body until it gets to conference, \nkeeping this amendment in mind.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Without losing your right to the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection to the Senator from Vermont \ndebating and discussing the issue, as he sees it. I would just like to \nask, in the interest of moving things along--there are no other \namendments. Everything is finished on the bill--I wonder how long the \nSenator from Vermont would like to discuss it. Is it possible that he \nmight tell us?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I cannot give the Senator anything but a guesstimate \nbecause I have many supporters of this amendment who may or may not \ndesire to speak. But I have no intention of trying to filibuster this \nbill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I didn't say that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I understand. I just wanted to make it clear. But what \nI do want to have everyone understand is that this modification of the \namendment is by taking one word out in order to meet a requirement of \nthe budget. The budget requirement may or may not be valid, but once \nyou get it, there is not much you can do about it. The whole \ndisagreement here is with respect to the one word ``unnecessary,'' \nwhich we want to delete, because by using that word we inadvertently \ncreated a budget point of order. Because as far as the Budget Committee \nis concerned, there is never any unnecessary use of the airplane, or \ntravel by the Department of Energy, even though they spent some $250 \nmillion traveling where and why and who I do not know, which was more \nthan enough, with a reasonable cut in the use of their airplanes, to \nfund a very important amendment dealing with more emphasis on renewable \nresources.\n  I would like to, certainly for a question, yield to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just propound a question. But \nbefore I do, let me state to the Senator from Vermont that I am a \ncosponsor of what he is trying to do. I think what he is trying to do \nis very important.\n  I regret that we found this parliamentary situation that created a \npoint of order. I don't quite know how one gets out of this at this \npoint. I regret that the Senator felt that he had to withdraw the \namendment, but I think what he and I and others are trying to do makes \na lot of sense in terms of investment for this country and investment \nin the future with alternative energy resources. It is very important, \nespecially because some of the programs show such great promise for our \ncountry's future.\n  I regret that we are not able to proceed with his amendment. I think \nthe offset is appropriate. I think the amendment would advance this \ncountry's energy interests. I know because of the press of time that \nfolks want to move forward. I will not say more except to say that I \nappreciate the leadership of the Senator from Vermont on this. I hope \nthis is not the end of it. I hope that perhaps by this process by \ncommittees in the Senate and in the House we can find a way to do what \nthe Senator and I and so many others want to do.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Delaware without giving up my right to the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my colleague for the \nleadership that he has provided in this renewable energy program.\n  I strongly believe that renewable energy technology represents our \nbest hope for reducing air pollution, creating jobs, and decreasing our \nreliance on imported oil and finite supplies of fossil fuel. These \nprograms promise to supply economically competitive and commercially \nviable exports. I believe that the nation should be looking toward \nclean, alternative forms of energy, not taking a step backward by \ncutting funding for these important programs.\n\n  Indeed this is a sentiment shared by a majority of the American \npeople. Public support for renewable energy programs is strong. For the \nfifth year in a row, a national poll has revealed that Americans \nbelieve renewable energy along with energy efficiency should be the \nhighest energy research and development priority.\n  My own State of Delaware has a long tradition in solar energy. In \n1972, the University of Delaware established one of the first \nphotovoltaic laboratories in the nation, the Institute for Energy \nConversion, which has been instrumental in developing photovoltaic \ntechnology. Delaware's major solar energy manufacturer, Astro Power, \nhas become the largest U.S.-owned photovoltaic company and has doubled \nits work force since 1997.\n  While the solar energy industry might have evolved in some form on \nits own, federal investment has accelerated the transition from the \nlaboratory bench to commercial markets by leveraging private sector \nefforts. This collaboration has already accrued valuable economic \nbenefits to the nation. Solar energy companies--like Astro Power--have \nalready created thousands of jobs and helped to reduce our trade \ndeficit through exports. My state has demonstrated that solar energy \ntechnology can be an economically competitive and commercially viable \nenergy alternative.\n  International markets for solar energy systems are virtually \nexploding, due to several key market trends. Most notably, solar energy \nis already one of the lowest cost options available to developing \ncountries that cannot afford to build large, expensive centralized \npower generation facilities with elaborate distribution systems.\n  The governments of Japan, Germany, and Australia are investing \nheavily in aggressive technology and market development in partnership \nwith their own solar energy industries. Until recently, Japan and \nGermany held the lead in world market share for photovoltaics; the \nUnited States has only recently recaptured international market \ndominance.\n  Cutting funding for these technologies would have a chilling effect \non the U.S. industry's ability to compete on an international scale in \nthese billion-dollar markets of today and tomorrow. The employment \npotential of renewables represents a minimum of\n\n[[Page S7103]]\n\n15,000 new jobs this decade with nearly 120,000 the next decade.\n  It is imperative that this Senate support renewable energy \ntechnologies and be a partner to an energy future that addresses our \neconomic needs in an environmentally acceptable manner. My state has \ndone and will continue to do its part. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate will look to the future and do their part in securing a safe and \nreliable energy future by supporting this amendment.\n  Again, I want to congratulate my distinguished colleague for his \nleadership on this most important matter.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I certainly thank my good friend from \nDelaware who has been out front on this issue for many years. I \nappreciate his efforts in this area.\n  The amendment that Senator Roth and I desire to offer today is about \npriorities. I think we all agree that increased domestic energy \nproduction should be a priority. We agree that a lower balance of \npayments should be a priority. We agree that helping farmers, ranchers \nand rural communities is a priority. We agree that standing up for U.S. \ncompanies selling U.S. manufacturing energy technologies in overseas \nmarkets is a priority. We cheer the increased job markets in every \nState in this Nation. We support the small companies across the Nation \nthat are working to capture the booming global energy market, and we \nwould make it a priority to promote clean air. The bill does not do \nthat in its present form.\n  The bill before us further whittles away our Nation's efforts to wean \nitself from foreign oil. It erodes our efforts to develop technology \nthat increases domestic energy production. It ends commitments made to \nsmall energy companies that depend on Federal assistance to enter the \ngiant global energy market. It reduces our efforts to make major \nadvancements in energy development. It reduces our commitment to energy \nthat is affordable, that is clean, and, most importantly, that is made \nin America.\n  The administration requested a 16-percent increase in renewable \nfunding--from $384 million to $446 million. More than half of the \nSenate--54 Senators--signed a letter in support of this $62 million \nincrease. The committee did not request an increase in the renewable \nbudget. It did not even hold at a renewable budget level. The committee \ncut the budget by $13 million. There is a $92 million shortfall between \nthe committee mark and the amount requested by more than one-half of \nthe Senate.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote for five things, if we are \nallowed to present it.\n  It is a vote for national security.\n  It is a vote for small businesses across the United States that \nproduce clean, renewable energy.\n  It is a vote for farmers and ranchers in rural communities across \nAmerica.\n  It is a vote to help American business grab onto a chunk of that \nrapidly growing export market for renewable products.\n  And a vote for this amendment is a vote for cleaner air for our \nchildren.\n  I am going to address each of these reasons why my colleagues should \nsupport this bill in turn.\n  First of all, we have charts that allow you to understand better what \nwe are discussing.\n  This is a vote about national security. It is about making our \nNation's future secure by securing our energy future.\n  The U.S. trade deficit has scored as its No. 1 contributor imported \nforeign oil, which has reached record levels.\n  Foreign oil imports constituted 55 percent of consumption early this \nyear and is expected to reach more than 70 percent by the year 2020. At \nthat time, most of the world's oil--over 64 percent--is expected to \ncome from potentially unstable Persian Gulf nations. These imports \naccount for over $60 billion, or 36 percent of the U.S. trade deficit. \nThese are U.S. dollars being shipped overseas to the Middle East which \ncould be put to better use at home.\n\n  The defense leaders of our Nation agree that increasing dependence on \nforeign oil has serious implications for our national and energy \nsecurity. They agree that investing in renewable energy is an \ninvaluable insurance policy to enhance our national and energy \nsecurity.\n  Lee Butler agrees. He is the former commander of the Strategic Air \nCommand and strategic air planner for Operation Desert Storm. Robert \nMcFarlane agrees. Robert McFarlane was National Security Adviser under \nformer President Ronald Reagan. Thomas Moorer agrees. Thomas Moorer is \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. James Woolsey agrees. \nJames Woolsey is a former Director of the CIA. In a recent letter to \nMembers of Congress, these national security leaders support the \nadministration's budget request for renewable energy.\n  Reading from my first chart, the national security leader said:\n\n       Current conflicts in the Middle East and the Balkans and \n     our stressed defense capability only reinforce our earlier \n     concerns that our increasing dependence on imported oil has \n     serious implications for national and energy security. Wars \n     and terrorism strongly highlight the benefits of obtaining \n     domestic, dispersed renewable energy systems and efficiency. \n     . . .\n       Now is clearly the time to increase our coverage under this \n     valuable insurance policy for our security--the availability \n     of renewable resources and improvements in energy efficiency. \n     Such a commitment will not only enhance national and energy \n     security, but also bring with it global leadership, \n     environmental and economic benefits, new industry and high \n     quality jobs.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent David Hunter of my staff be granted privilege \nof the floor during the pendency of the energy and water \nappropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, no crisis can stop the sun from shining, \nthe wind from blowing, or the Earth from producing geothermal heat.\n  Let's review some alternatives we have and how they can be utilized. \nGeysers Geothermal Power Plant in California is an example of the sort \nof energy savings we can gain through ``made in America'' geothermal \nenergy.\n  American soil holds a natural resource available throughout much of \nthis country: Geysers produce the energy equivalent of over 250 million \nbarrels of oil and currently provide electricity for over 1 million \npeople. Geysers Geothermal Power Plant in California is an example.\n  The next chart shows renewable generation by each State, indicating \nhow much renewable energy is produced in every State in the United \nStates. I think all Senators ought to take that into consideration. We \nare hurting small businesses located in every State in the United \nStates. Every Senator in the United States is a stakeholder in this \ndebate. These States have a substantial energy generation capacity. \nMuch is not utilized, and much more is available. It is very extensive, \naccording to the chart.\n  The next chart shows the top 20 States for wind energy. There is a \nlot of wind around this place especially, but also around the rest of \nthe country. This chart shows the top 20 States for wind energy \npotential. Although most of the wind potential generated today has \noccurred in California, many States have much greater wind potential. \nThe top 20 States for wind energy potential are: North Dakota, Texas, \nKansas, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Minnesota, \nIowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Michigan, New York, Illinois, \nCalifornia, Wisconsin, Maine, and Missouri. The American Midwest is the \nSaudi Arabia of wind energy. North Dakota alone can produce 36 percent \nof all U.S. electric power needs. New Mexico could produce 10 percent \nof U.S. electric power needs. The oil wells in Saudi Arabia will \neventually run dry. The wind in North Dakota will supply indefinitely a \nsteady source of power.\n  Next is a map of localities with geothermal energy. Like the sun \nshining on American soil and the wind blowing over it, geothermal \nenergy is a great American resource. It is good for the environment, \ngood for the country, and good for business. This chart shows bountiful \ngeothermal energy supplies, especially on the west coast.\n  I have a series of pictures of renewable energy projects across the \ncountry. They demonstrate that a vote for renewable energy is a vote \nfor ranchers, farmers, and small communities all across America.\n  This chart shows the North State Power Wind Farm in Minnesota. The\n\n[[Page S7104]]\n\nwind facility has pumped over $125 million into the local economy and \nprovides an extra source of income for local farmers in Lake Benton, \nMN.\n  Farmers make money through royalty payments for the wind turbines on \ntheir lands. They continue to farm their lands and make additional \nmoney for the wind that blows above it. This shows municipal utility \nwind turbines in Traverse City, MI. Note the corn growing. This wind \nturbine provides clean, renewable, locally produced wind energy for the \npeople of Traverse City, MI.\n  The next chart shows Culberson Wind Plant in Texas. This wind \nfacility is the largest energy producer in Culberson County. It \nprovides $400,000 annually in tax revenues to Culberson County \nhospitals and schools. That is 10 percent of the county's property tax \nbase. It also provides $100,000 to the Texas public school fund.\n  It is not just wind energy that is helpful in small communities. \nPhotovoltaic helps ranchers and farmers. This is a cattle rancher with \na photovoltaic-powered well in Idaho. This Idaho rancher powers his \nhome and pumps well water for his cattle under a photovoltaic program \noffered by Idaho Power Company.\n  This chart shows Kotzebue Electric Association Village Power Project \nin Kotzebue, AK. The projects will reduce emissions from diesel plants \nand reduce fuel transport and costs to the villagers.\n  Next is Ontario Hydro Village Power Project. There is a large market \nfor export of U.S. wind turbines to northern communities in Alaska, \nCanada, and Russia. This turbine was built in Vermont and exported to \nOntario, Canada. In the last 10 years, photovoltaic sales have more \nthan quadrupled. In developing countries, demand has increased because \nit is attractive to isolated communities that are distant from the \npower plant and because they have small electric requirements.\n  Although America is still a leader in developing renewable energy \ntechnologies, this lead may slip if we lower our renewable research and \ndevelopment funding. Europe and Japan continue to subsidize their \nrenewable industry, putting U.S.-based companies at a severe \ndisadvantage.\n  For example, Japan, Germany, and Denmark use tied aid, offer \nfinancing, and provide export promotion for their domestic industries, \nand our industries have to compete with that. It is very difficult to \ndo. But because of its success and the fact that we have advantages, \nthey have been able to survive, with great difficulty, without having \nthat assistance from loans. This is not the time to lose our lead or to \ncut funding out of this important industry.\n  There is one final reason why my colleagues should overwhelmingly \nsupport this amendment. A vote on this amendment is also a vote for the \nenvironment.\n  Consider this chart showing children playing in front of a windmill \nin Iowa's Spirit Lake district. The wind turbine generates power for \nthe school. It is emission free, completely natural. Few us of us want \nto have our children play under smokestacks or near oil fields or \nuranium enrichment plants. Few of us want our children to fight wars in \nthe Middle East over oil. But we are all happy to have our children \nplaying in the wind and the sun.\n  Next is a geothermal powerplant in Dixie Valley, NV. This plant, \nwhich produces electricity for 100,000 people, produces no emissions \nand 1 to 5 percent as much SOX and CO2 as a coal-\nfired plant of the same size.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  It is a beautiful place, isn't it? It is very close to the Fallon \nNaval Air Training Center, which is the premier fighter training center \nfor the Navy pilots. That is where they train to land on carriers. Some \nof their training can be watched from this powerplant.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We should have more of them. I wish the Senator would \nsupport my amendment, and we could really help the State.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to my friend, a number of the programs he has \ntalked about are at places I have been, for example, the wind energy \nplant in California. These are places I have been. I watched these \nwindmills. It is very exciting.\n  I finalize my question to the Senator. The Senator is aware that last \nyear's bill we reported out of this subcommittee was less than what we \nreported out this year. Is the Senator aware of that? The bill we \nreported out of this subcommittee last year was less than what we \nreported out this year. I can assure the Senator that is accurate. It \nwas only with the supplemental that this number came up larger than the \nnumber that we gave this year. The number, including the supplemental, \nwas $12 million more than what we recommended this year, but about $50 \nmillion less than what the subcommittee approved last year.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I point out that it was because of my amendment, which \nwas adopted last year. I appreciate the Senator being aware of that. I \nwish we would take the same approach this year and adopt this \namendment, and then we will make sure we have a much better prospect \nfor the future.\n  Mr. REID. As I said to the Senator when he first began, he has done \nexcellent work here, and we appreciate it very much.\n  I will ask the Senator another question. We have had a number of \nSenators come to the floor. There are one or two Senators who want to \nspeak on this. Would the Senator have any objection to having a final \nvote on this, and when it is over people can talk on this issue for as \nlong as they desire?\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. A vote on my amendment? I have no problem with that.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry; I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Have a final vote on my amendment, yes, I would like \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. Of course, the only thing in order is final passage, so the \nanswer to my question is no.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If you are saying without my amendment being voted on? \nYou are saying we will vote your amendment and then we can go to final \nvote? That would be fine with me.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am fully aware of the genuine interest the Senator \nhas in this and his enthusiasm and his hard work. But I wonder if he \nmight permit me to speak for 2 minutes and yield right back to him.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to share with my fellow Senators the \nreality of what has happened to solar energy in this bill. First of \nall, in the Senate bill, for everything in this bill that is \nnondefense, there is a reduction of 7 percent. That means that for all \nof the things we do in water, in the Corps of Engineers, and all the \nother things, there is a 7 percent reduction. If we were to adopt this \namendment, we would be taking this piece of the budget and increasing \nit 7 percent, thus giving it a 14 percent preferential treatment over \nthe rest of the nondefense items in this bill.\n  All we are doing in this bill is reducing from $365.9 million, \nreducing it by $12 million, which is less than a 3 percent reduction, \nwhich means this is already favored by way of prioritizing by about 5 \npercent better than the other nondefense accounts here. So we can talk \nall afternoon and into the night about how great renewables are; we can \nall agree; but that is not the issue. The issue is, should we add $70 \nmillion when we have had to reduce everything else that is nondefense \nby the huge amounts I have just described? I do not think we need to.\n  Most of the things the Senator is discussing we will continue to do, \nand some that are in the pipeline ready to get done will get done \nbecause we are going to fund this at $353.9 million. That is not \npeanuts. Most of the solar things we want to do as a nation will get \ndone.\n  As long as everybody knows, we are not trying to be arbitrary. We \nthought we were very fair in the treatment of renewables in this bill. \nIt was not enough. We had to add $70 million more with an amendment \nthat was out of order because it added to the amount we had to spend in \nour allocation, which means it breaks the budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield for the purposes of debate, control of the \nfloor, to my great friend from Colorado.\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding to me. I am \nnot going to take a lot of time.\n  I want to recognize the leadership and fine work he has done in \nfighting to get this to the floor of the Senate. I am obviously \ndisappointed, as he is, in the fact we are not going to have a vote on \nthis. But I do have some charts and, like my colleague, will talk about \nthe importance of renewable energy, particularly in the context of wind \nenergy, geothermal, and solar energy.\n  The Senator's State, like the State of Colorado, has done a \nconsiderable amount in this area. It is important to the State of \nColorado. In fact, we have a research laboratory in Colorado just to \naddress things we are talking about on the floor.\n  I just wanted to recognize in a public way the Senator's contribution \nand effort in trying to move forward with renewable energy. It has been \na pleasure to be associated with my colleague on this amendment.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Vermont, for once again \nstanding firm in his commitment to renewable energy. I concur with the \nSenator from Vermont and would like to share my thoughts on the \nimportance of funding the Department of Energy's renewables budget.\n  While the record clearly shows that I am a dedicated fiscal \nconservative, I also see the importance of spending a little now, to \nsave a lot more later. By investing in the research and development of \nthese energy sources today, we are saving taxpayers billions of dollars \ntomorrow in costs associated with much more than energy. Mr. President, \nit is not an exaggeration to say that our future as a nation and a \ncommunity depends in part on the decisions we make today when it comes \nto energy matters. In this modern day of technological boom, energy \nliterally runs the world in which we live. From the cars we drive to \nthe homes we live in, without affordable, accessible sources of energy, \nwe open ourselves up to dangers that we simply cannot allow to happen.\n  In their paper titled The New Petroleum from the January/February \n1999 issue of the publication Foreign Affairs, my colleague from \nIndiana, Senator Lugar, and former CIA Director James Woolsey argue the \nimportance of increasing our use of alternative energy sources, in this \ncase, biofuels. They appropriately note that, ``New demand for oil will \nbe filled largely by the Middle East, meaning a transfer of more than \n$1 trillion over the next 15 years to the unstable states of the \nPersian Gulf alone--on top of the $90 billion they received in 1996.'' \nAs a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I hear first-hand about foreign nations that \nare working to use energy sources to neutralize. I would hope that the \nrest of my colleagues share my concerns about sending $1 trillion over \nthe next 15 years to rogue nations in the Middle East who are \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction as we speak, with an intent to \nharm American interests. We must be firm in our decision to develop \naccessible, affordable and dependable sources of energy here at home--\nour security may depend on it.\n  The environmental benefits of renewable energy are also well noted \nand do not need too much repeating. Not only are renewable sources of \nenergy beneficial to our national security, but they reduce, and in \nfact help to eliminate harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Wind, solar, \ngeothermal, biomass, photovoltaic and other renewable energies have few \nif any harmful by-products. It is simply good policy to do all we can \nto effectively harness and utilize the natural, clean, re-usable \nsources of energy that are abundantly all around us.\n  I would like to illustrate a few Colorado-specific points if I may.\n  The Solar Energy Research Facility at the Department of Energy's \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado houses \nover 200 scientists and engineers. This building was designed to use \nenergy efficient and renewable energy technologies--like the \nphotovoltaic panels seen here--and reduce costs by 30% from the federal \nstandard. Much of the Department's funding that was cut by the \nCommittee goes to this vital facility in my state.\n  NREL is on the cutting edge in bringing renewable energy technologies \nout of the laboratory and into the mainstream of American business and \nsociety. Recognizing that America has rivals in many Asian and European \nnations in investing in the development of these technologies, NREL \ndeserves credit for many wonderful accomplishments.\n  Wind power use in Colorado is becoming increasingly popular. If \nyou've ever spent any time along the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, \nyou know that the wind can whip down from the mountains quite fast. \nThat wind can be easily harnessed for energy. Public Service Company of \nColorado operates several wind powering facilities, one of which is in \nNorthern Colorado on the Wyoming border in Ponnequin. Expansions of \nmany wind facilities in Colorado are taking place as we speak. In many \nNorthern Colorado communities, demand for wind energy has risen so \ndramatically that the Platte River Power Authority of Ft. Collins is \nplanning to more than triple the installed capacity of its wind farm \njust across the border in Medicine Bow, Wyoming. Residents in this area \ncan look forward to making a positive contribution to the environment.\n  The current levelized cost of wind energy is between 4 and 6 cents \nper kilowatt-hour, with a goal approaching 2.5 cents by 2010. According \nto NREL, the cost of this technology has already decreased by more than \n80% since the early 1980's due to continued cost-shared R \npartnerships between industry and DOE.\n  The developable, windy land in just 5 western states could produce \nelectricity equivalent to the annual demand of the contiguous 48 \nstates. Total worldwide wind energy generating capacity now exceeding \nthe 10,000 megawatt point with expectations of 100,000 megawatts by \n2020. Thanks to continued research and development, the industry has \ngrown from being California-based to having wind sites in 18 states.\n  Photovoltaic water pumping systems are being used on hundreds of \nranches and farms across the U.S. to bring power to remote locations--\nlike in some parts of Colorado--that would otherwise cost tens of \nthousands of dollars in extending existing power lines. In locations \nwhere solar resources are not bountiful, other renewable technologies, \nlike wind energy, can be used in a similar fashion.\n  This is an application of renewable energy that interests me greatly. \nFor those farmers who live in remote areas, renwable energy systems \nalso offer distinct advantages in agricultural applications where power \nlines are subject to failure due to flooding, icing or other seasonal \nchanges. These energy technologies also make sense where electrical \nneeds are relatively small or are seasonal.\n  In conclusion, I want to reiterate my belief that investing in \nresearch and development of renewable energies is a win-win solution in \nevery sense. Jobs are created, taxpayer money is saved, our national \nsecurity is enhanced and the environment is protected. The future of \nour security and prosperity depends on the commitments we make today.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, renewable energy is a win-win. Renewable \ntechnologies such as wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass are domestic \nand clean. Many renewable applications are especially suited to remote \nrural locations where construction of electric transmission facilities \nare prohibitively expensive. The federal government has had a very \nsuccessful program installing 122 photovoltaic systems in place of \ndiesel generators at remote locations of the National Park Service, \nForest Service and BLM. (Chart) These systems produce electric power \nwithout any noise or emissions. Photovoltaics are also well-suited for \nuse on remote areas of Indian Reservations.\n  Collaboration between the National Labs and U.S. industry has made \nhuge strides in photovoltaic efficiency and cost-competitiveness. The \ncost of photovoltaic systems have declined 10 fold since 1980. Ongoing \nwork in system reliability and long-term performance is crucial to \ncontinued development of U.S. leadership in this area. The Department \nof Energy's proposed budget is barely 40% of what Japan and half of \nwhat Germany spend on photovoltaic research.\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\n  Another important technology is concentrating solar power, where the \nsun's energy is first converted to heat then used to generate \nelectricity in a conventional generator. The federal research program, \ncentered at Sandia, has been a true success. Further work in advanced \ntrough technology and dish based systems, which can be dispatched into \nthe electricity grid, promise to dramatically lower costs. Based on \nWorld Bank estimates of capacity installation for these technologies, \nup to $12 billion in sales of U.S.-manufactured products and up to \n13,000 new jobs could be created by U.S. industry by 2010.\n  Since the 1980's the cost of wind power has declined 80% (from 25 \ncents to 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour.) With the necessary support, the \ncost of wind will be down to 3 cents per kilowatt hour or lower within \nfive years. This amendment will fund U.S.-based turbine certification, \ninternational consensus standards, wind mapping to assist in targeting \nkey areas, and support to industry on solving near term problems. The \nexport opportunities for U.S. industry are large, but the U.S. must \ncompete against the highly subsidized European manufacturers.\n  The opportunities for economic development of geothermal power in the \nU.S. west are vast. The Department of Energy has an initiative underway \nto cut the cost of drilling for geothermal resources by 25% within the \nnext two years. Geothermal, especially using non-drinking water sources \nand treated wastewater, can become an important energy source for arid \nstates. This research with commercial development could result in \ndevelopment of 30,000 jobs in the U.S. and open up significant \ninternational marketing opportunities for U.S. manufacturers.\n  The research programs funded by this amendment are making important \ncontributions to the ongoing restructuring of the electric utility \nindustry. For example, many experts believe the future of electric \npower generation will be in the form of small, so-called \n``distributed'' generation technologies. Smaller power plants offer \nadvantages in terms of improved efficiency and reliability as well as \nreduced environmental impacts. Solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and \nother generating technologies such as fuel cells and micro-turbines are \nall likely approaches to distributed generation. The Energy Committee \nwill hold an oversight hearing on distributed generation next week. \nFinally, research in this bill is also helping assure the continued \nsecurity and reliability of the nation's high-tension transmission \ngrid. Sandia Labs in New Mexico is a key partner in DOE's transmission \nresearch program.\n  I think it is critical to maintain our momentum in renewable energy \nresearch. The proposed budget cuts in the bill are unfortunate and \nunnecessary. I am pleased to support the amendment and I thank Senator \nJeffords for his efforts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have the pleasure of joining Senator \nJeffords to rise in support of the renewable energy programs within the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations bill. First, let me thank Senators \nDomenici and Reid for their hard work to put together a balanced \nappropriations bill under very difficult budget constraints. I know \nboth of these Senators support the renewable energy programs at \nDepartment of Energy and would have liked to come closer to the \nPresident's requested funding level. However, as with all the \nappropriations bills, this year has forced all of us to make difficult \nchoices.\n  I am supporting the Jeffords amendment because I firmly believe that \ndeveloping new solar and renewable energy sources is absolutely \ncritical to reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and \naddressing climate change. Anyone who had the pleasure of spending some \nof this spring in the Northeast will tell you that although we all \nappreciated the glorious 85 degree days, it was unusual. After about a \nweek, Vermonters really began to wonder about the strange weather. This \nis only a harbinger of things to come if we do not aggressively address \nthe greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\n  The solar and renewable energy programs will help our nation find \nalternative energy sources and help our states and industry start using \nthem. We need to invest more funding to develop renewable energy \ntechnology and to bring this technology into the mainstream. Coming \nfrom Vermont, I have already seen how this technology can be used. \nDuring the nuclear freeze movement of the 1980s, Vermonters adopted a \nsaying: ``As Vermont goes, so goes the nation.'' I hope that our state \ncan provide similar leadership to set the nation on a path in the new \nmillennium to promote the development and use of renewable energy.\n  From the Green Mountain Power wind farm in Searsburg to the McNeil \nbiomass gasifier in Burlington, Vermont is developing and using \nrenewable energy sources. These large projects are being looked at as \nmodels for how public-private partnerships can spur growth in our \nrenewable energy sectors. Vermont is also leading the nation in \ndeveloped small, community-based renewable energy projects. Many \nVermont communities have shifted away from fossil energy sources to \nbiomass, building small wood-fired systems. Biomass is now being used \nin Vermont schools, low-income housing projects, state office buildings \nand mills.\n  Vermont is also taking this technology overseas. I am proud to say \nthat several Vermont renewable energy businesses have created niche \nmarkets for their technology all around the world. Just a few weeks \nago, Prime Minister Tony Blair turned on the lights at a school that \nhad just installed a small wind turbine built by a Vermont company. \nAnother Vermont company has developed solar panels that are being used \nby individual homes in many developing countries where there is no \ncentral energy source.\n  When Vermont and the nation consider what the next millennium will \nlook like the most important question to be asked is what do we want to \npass on to the next generation?\n  I want my grandson to be able to hike through the Green Mountains and \nsee the same majestic forests and mountain peaks as I did. I want him \nto be able to fish in Lake Champlain without having to worry about what \nheavy metals are in it. If my grandchildren are going to enjoy these \nexperiences, our nation has to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and \nincrease our use of renewable energy. The Jeffords amendment will \nensure that the successes of the solar and renewable energy programs at \nDepartment of Energy are replicated to help our nation meet this goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me first ask unanimous consent to \nadd 13 additional original cosponsors to my amendment. These are: Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Grassley, Ms. \nCollins, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Roth, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bryan, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Wellstone.\n  I yield, reserving my right to the floor, to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the names will be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the unanimous consent \nrequest applies to the amendment that has been withdrawn; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Vermont desire to \nwithdraw the amendment?\n  Mr. REID. It has already been withdrawn. The unanimous consent \nrequest to add cosponsors applies to the amendment that has been \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It applies to the amendment I had pending on the list. \nI guess that is the best way to describe it.\n  Mr. REID. The amendment has been withdrawn; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, the amendment has been \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection to the cosponsors being added to the \namendment that has been withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the cosponsors will be \nadded, and, without objection, the Senator may yield the floor to the \nSenator from Minnesota, as he reserves his right to the floor.\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, rather than having to put it in the \nform of a question, I appreciate the way my colleague made the UC \nrequest.\n  I come to the floor in complete support of what Senator Jeffords is \ntrying to do. One can look at it in a couple of different ways. One can \nlook at it in terms of the numbers in the here and now, but, frankly, \nas I look at this picture over a period of time, I do not think we have \ndone near what we should by way of investment in renewable energy. That \nis what my colleague from Vermont is saying.\n  I come from a cold weather State at the other end of the pipeline, \nand when we import barrels of oil and Mcfs of natural gas, we export \ndollars and yet we are rich in resources--wind, solar, safe energy.\n  My colleague is right on the mark. I thank him for his leadership. We \nshould be making much more of an investment in this area. It is on \nsound ground from the point of view of the environment. It leads us \ndown the path of smaller business economic development, technologies \nthat are more compatible with communities, more homegrown economies, \nmore capital investment locally. I thank my colleague for his work and \ntell him what he has been trying to do is important. He is right on the \nmark, and I add my support to his effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will continue with my presentation of \nthe merits of this amendment. I have no intention of holding up this \nbody any longer than necessary; necessary meaning this preemptive \nstrike is designed to make us accomplish our goals.\n  The next chart is the Westinghouse power connection's biomass \ngasification facility in Hawaii. This demonstrates the potential to \nconvert agricultural waste--sugarcane in this case --into electricity.\n  I have another chart to demonstrate the power of all of these \ngenerating plants. This one is at BC International Corporation, biomass \nethanol plant in Jennings, LA. This plant will be retrofitted to \nproduce ethanol from sugarcane bagasse and rice waste.\n  That completes my charts. I hope my colleagues have been impressed \nwith what we could have done if we were not prohibited.\n  Let me conclude by reminding everyone we are proposing to add $70 \nmillion through our amendment to the Department of Energy's solar, \nwind, and renewable budget. Federal support for renewable energy \nresearch and development has been a major success story in the United \nStates. Costs have declined, reliability has improved, and a growing \ndomestic industry has been born. More work still needs to be done in \napplied research and development to bring down the cost of the \nproduction even further.\n  This is a tremendous opportunity for this Nation which will help us \nreduce our trade deficits. The need for renewable R is not a partisan \nissue:\n\n       We must encourage environmentally responsible development \n     of all U.S. energy resources, including renewable energy. \n     Renewable energy does reduce demand upon our other finite \n     natural resources. It enhances our energy security, and \n     clearly, it protects the environment.\n\n  This was President Bush, September 1991.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  Mr. President, I move to recommit the bill to the Appropriations \nCommittee, and further, that the committee report the bill forthwith, \nwith the following amendment. Mr. President, I send the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] moves to recommit \n     the bill S. 1186 to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions to report back forthwith, with an amendment \n     numbered 682.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, strike lines 21 through 24 and insert \n     ``$791,233,000, of which $821,000 shall be derived by \n     transfer from the Geothermal Resources Development Fund and \n     $5,000,000 shall be derived by transfer from the United \n     States Enrichment Corporation Fund, and of which $75,000,000 \n     shall be derived from accounts for which this Act makes funds \n     available for Department of Energy contractor travel expenses \n     (of which not less than $4,450,000 shall be available for \n     solar building technology research, not less than $82,135,000 \n     shall be available for photovoltaic energy systems, not less \n     than $17,600,000 shall be available for concentrating solar \n     systems, not less than $37,700,000 shall be available for \n     power systems in biomass/biofuels energy systems, not less \n     than $48,000,000 shall be available for transportation in \n     biomased biofuels energy systems (of which not less than \n     $1,500,000 shall be available for the Consortium for Plant \n     Biotechnology Research), not less than $42,265,000 shall be \n     available for wind energy systems, not less than $4,000,000 \n     shall be available for the renewable energy production \n     incentive program, not less than $7,600,000 shall be \n     available for support of solar programs, not less than \n     $5,100,000 shall be available for the international solar \n     energy program, not less than $5,000,000 shall be available \n     for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, not less than \n     $27,850,000 shall be available for geothermal technology \n     development, not less than $27,700,000 shall be available for \n     hydrogen research, not less than $6,400,000 shall be \n     available for hydropower research, not less than $32,000,000 \n     shall be available for high temperature superconducting \n     research and development, not less than $3,000,000 shall be \n     available for energy storage systems, and not less than \n     $18,500,000 shall be available for direction of programs).''.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada objects.\n  Mr. REID. I object and call for the regular----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has objected. Under \nthe unanimous consent agreement, the only amendments in order are those \nthat have been filed.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I do not believe that the order includes \na motion to recommit with an amendment. I ask for clarification in that \nrespect.\n  Mr. REID. I submit to the Chair that it includes all amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is advised that the \ninstructions that all amendments must be filed applies even to \namendments that would be included within a motion with instructions to \nrecommit.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The appeal is debatable. Is there debate on \nthe appeal?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I hope Members understand that this \namendment would be perfectly appropriate to make this bill a more \nuseful document. I understand the strong desires of some not to have \nthis amendment apply, but it is an amendment which has over 50 \ncosponsors. It is only appropriate that this body have the right to \nexercise their will on a vote which will let them modify this bill in a \nmanner which they think will make it more appropriate.\n\n  I urge all Members, especially the 50 cosponsors, to join with me on \nappealing the ruling of the Chair to allow this amendment to be placed \nupon the bill. It is only appropriate considering that the only problem \nwe had was the one word ``unnecessary'' which made it subject to a \npoint of order because the CBO ruled that the word ``unnecessary'' \nwould prevent the funding and, therefore, would not be appropriate.\n  I believe very strongly we ought to have an opportunity for the \nmajority of this Senate to express their will on this bill. Therefore, \nI am appealing the ruling of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I reiterate what the chairman \nof the subcommittee has said, the manager of this bill. It is not as if \nwe have not done everything we can to make sure that solar renewables \nare taken care of. There has been a 3-percent cut in solar and \nrenewables. Others had a 9-percent cut. We have treated this, in \neffect, more fairly than anything else.\n  I also say to my friends, when this bill left this body last year, it \nhad less money in it than the bill has this year. It was only because \nof what took place in the so-called summit after the committees \ncompleted all their work, the negotiation with the President, that the \nbill was plused up to $365 million. This is not chicken feed. This is \n$354 million for solar renewables.\n  Also, we in Nevada understand solar energy. At the Nevada Test Site, \nwhich we hear so much about in this Chamber, there could be enough \nenergy produced by Sun at the Nevada Test Site to take care of all the \nenergy needs of this country. The fact is, it is very difficult to get \nfrom here to there.\n\n  We are spending huge amounts of money--not enough; and I recognize \nthat. Everybody wants to come and\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\nspend more money. I would like to spend more money. My friend from \nVermont voted for the budget. I did not vote for the budget. I wish we \nhad more money here. I think the budget we are being asked to work \nunder is ridiculous. We cannot do what needs to be done for this \ncountry. My friend from Vermont voted for the budget. I did not.\n  So I say that we have to understand that if this goes back to the \ncommittee, we are going to have significant difficulties getting to the \npoint where we are today. If we are going to move these bills along, it \nwould seem to me the majority should help us move them along. This is \none of the easier bills, some say. Based on this, I am not too sure.\n  I am a supporter of alternate energy sources. We have a solar energy \nprogram in the State of Nevada that we are very proud of. It is one of \nthe best in the country. I have been to the one at Barstow. It produces \n200 megawatts of electricity. It is by far the largest plant in the \nworld. It is 100 times larger than the second largest plant, which is a \nsmall plant. Technology is allowing us to move forward but not very \nrapidly.\n  In this bill for solar building technology research there is $2 \nmillion; for photovoltaic energy systems there is $64 million; for \nbiomass/biofuels transportation there is $38 million. For wind energy \nsystems there is $34 million in this bill.\n  In the bill there is money for solar program support, the renewable \nenergy production incentive, international solar programs, national \nrenewable energy laboratory construction, and geothermal funding.\n  The State of Nevada has more geothermal potential than any State in \nthis Union. It would be very beneficial for us to have more money. It \nwould help the State of Nevada. We cut solar renewables 3 percent. We \ncut other nondefense programs almost 10 percent. We have been more fair \nto this entity than any of the others.\n  So I move to table the appeal and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. I withhold.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I did not hear the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator requested to speak for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  Fellow Senators, I suggest to you, the Chair has ruled that what the \nSenator seeks to do is out of order. We did establish right after we \nstarted this bill that amendments had to be filed at the desk so \neverybody could look at them. As you look at that sequence of things, a \nmotion to send this back to committee with instructions was out of \norder; so those who want the Senator to win could not have won anyway. \nNow he wants to just send it back to committee. The Chair has once \nagain ruled that is out of order.\n\n  How far do we have to go? As a matter of fact, we have already taken \ncare of renewables better than almost any other nondomestic piece of \nthis budget. We have reduced, by 24 percent, items such as cleanup, \nnondefense cleanup, in this country because we do not have enough money \nthis year. We are $600 million short. We have only reduced this \nfunction by 2.8 percent. We reduce the Corps of Engineers by 8 percent, \nthe Bureau of Reclamation by 3 percent. The total nondefense has been \nreduced by 7 percent.\n  We have prioritized well. As a matter of fact, if this amendment \npasses, we will be giving renewables a 14-percent priority over the \nrest of the nondefense programs of this country which, on average, have \nbeen cut 7 percent, because this would ask to increase it by 7. I \nbelieve it should be tabled. I hope we will do that expeditiously. I \nthank Senator Reid for his attentiveness and his stick-to-itiveness on \nthis. I believe we have treated renewables fairly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's motion to table has been \nwithheld to this point.\n  Mr. REID.

The decision of the Chair stands.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I regret that I cannot support S. 1186, \nthe FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. I cannot support this \nbill because its funding for renewable energy falls far short of what \nwe need in this country as we head into the 21st Century. The funding \nlevel provided in this bill, $353.9 million, doesn't come close to \nmeeting the Administration's budget request. S. 1186 has $92 million \nless for renewables than the Administration requested. This represents \na cut from last year's final appropriated level of about $12 million.\n  This is a very difficult vote for me because S. 1186 includes funding \nfor some very important projects and programs. There are two projects \nthat I believe are particularly important, the Marshall Flood Control \nProject and the Stillwater Levee. The Marshall Flood Control Project \nhas been under consideration since the early 1970s and was authorized \nunder the 1986 and 1988 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The FY \n1999 Energy and Water Appropriations bill included $1.5 million for \nthis project, and the Army Corps was able to reprogram an additional \n$700,000. FY 2000 funding will make it possible for a significant \nportion of the Stage Two work to be completed during this year's \nconstruction season.\n  The Stillwater Levee is another worthy project funded in this bill. \nAlthough the levee survived last year's high waters, it is in urgent \nneed of repairs. The levee will protect downtown Stillwater, which \nincludes over 60 sites on the National Register of Historic Sites.\n  It is especially unfortunate that we failed to take advantage of the \nopportunity we had to improve this bill. Senator Jeffords proposed an \namendment that would have increased funding for solar and geothermal \nenergy by $70 million, and we did not even get an up-or-down vote on \nhis amendment. I think it was an important amendment, and I was proud \nto be an original cosponsor. I very much appreciate the\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\nleadership of my friend from Vermont on this issue.\n  As we near the millenium, I believe we need a far stronger commitment \nto a renewable energy future, not the $12 million cut for renewable \nenergy in this bill. For too long, we have allowed our economy to \nremain hostage to oil, much of it imported. We should all recognize \nthat our addiction to fossil fuels is not sustainable. We fight wars in \npart over oil, which we then use to pollute our skies, while providing \ntax breaks to large oil companies. Petroleum has helped us to achieve a \nvery high standard of living in the western world, and oil will \ncontinue to be a major part of our economy. Indeed, oil is the central \nnervous system of the western world's economy. But we have been in need \nof surgery for years now.\n  In the past, we have risen to the challenge when faced with a visible \ncrisis and rising prices. Can we do it again without long gas lines and \nwith stable prices? I say we can. Indeed, while many see only a future \nof constraints, I see a future with opportunities.\n  After all, what will it take to stop overloading Mother Nature? \nHigher efficiency and more reliance on cleaner fuels. And what will \nthat lead to? Manufacturing enterprises with the lowest operating costs \nin the world. Households that generate electricity from rooftop solar \narrays. Farmers who harvest an additional ``crop''--the winds that blow \nover their fields. City streets inhabited by quiet and pollution-free \nelectric vehicles.\n  That is a future the American people surely can rally behind. Now is \nthe time to rally all Americans behind that vision of the future. But \nunfortunately, this bill fails to do that. In fact, I believe it is a \nstep in the wrong direction, and for that reason I am voting against \nit.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, included in the manager's package is an \namendment designed to insert the United States Congress into the \nBonneville Power Administration's rate setting process. I believe it is \nunnecessary and potentially counterproductive. Thus, I do not support \nit and will work to see it stricken in conference.\n  The BPA next month hopes to initiate the rate case to establish the \ncost of BPA power and set parameters for funding salmon recovery on the \nColumbia and Snake Rivers. As currently formulated, the rates \nestablished will fund projected fish and wildlife costs through \ncustomer rates. The process is working and this amendment could \npotentially jeopardize it.\n  I, along with other Democratic members of the Northwest delegation, \nrecently sent a letter to Vice President Gore to reiterate our support \nfor the so-called ``fish funding principles'' agreed to by the \nAdministration and BPA. We sent this letter in response to a staff memo \ninitiated by the National Marine FIsheries Service and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, recommending BPA charge its customers \nhigher rates so it could establish a ``slush fund'' to pay the enormous \ncost of removing or breeching the four lower Snake River dams. As my \ncolleagues know, there has been no decision that these dams should be \nremoved and therefore there is no need to begin saving for such a \ncontroversial plan. Our letter firmly opposed collecting money from \nratepayers for costs that may or may not be incurred in the future. \nSpecifically, we opposed ``prepayment of speculative future costs, \nparticularly if those costs are contingent upon congressional action.''\n  There is no movement afoot by the Administration or BPA to establish \nsuch a slush fund. So, there is not a problem to solve regarding slush \nfunds for dam removal.\n  However, we do have a problem to solve: saving our wild salmon. We \nare committed as a region and as a nation to doing so. These skirmishes \nover staff memos and rumors simply divide us and divert our attention \nfrom the real problems we must solve; the real creative solutions we \nmust fund; the real consensus we must forge. I fear an unintended \nconsequence of this amendment may be to reduce our region's ability to \nsolve this problem on its own.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment is not helpful. That said, I know I \ndo not have the votes to prevent its inclusion in this bill and thus \nhave worked with Senator Gorton to modify it to make it more \nacceptable. The amendment now will apply only to this fiscal year, \ninstead of continuing in perpetuity. In addition, the BPA \nAdministration now must set rates with the ``fish funding principles'' \nagreed to by the Administration and BPA in mind.\n  Let me conclude by reiterating that we have a process working to set \nrates for BPA customers, which I firmly believe will achieve the vital \ngoal of helping us save fish, and will allow full public and \nstakeholder involvement. This amendment is unnecessary and \ndiversionary. I look forward to working with Senator Gorton and the \nAdministration to get this language dropped from the bill in conference \ncommittee.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, no large group of citizens should be \nrequired to pay in advance for a project that they oppose, that will \nhave an adverse impact on their lives and livelihoods, and that will \nalmost certainly never be authorized. But that is exactly what has \nrecently been proposed by certain officials of the Clinton \nAdministration.\n  A discussion paper was recently published by these officials \nsuggesting that the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) add \nsignificantly to its power charges to its customers in its impending \nrate case. The purpose of these added charges is to provide a slush \nfund for the removal of four Federal dams from the Snake River, if that \nremoval is ever authorized or ordered. It is only fair to add that the \nClinton Administration has stated that the paper does not now reflect \nAdministration policy, but it has nevertheless raised fears that the \nAdministration might some day try to order such a removal without \nasking Congress either for the authority or the money to do so.\n  This amendment will prevent such an end run. It does not prevent BPA \nfrom including fish recovery costs in its rate structure for the next \nfive years, even in greater amounts than the $435 million per year \ncurrent limit. It will, however, prevent an additional surcharge for \npossible dam removal. That project, if it should be proposed, should \nrequire Congressional authorization, and a debate over funding sources, \nonly as and when this or any later Administration makes such a \nrecommendation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President I would like to engage the Chairman in a \ncolloquy. First, let me thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \ndiligence in balancing funding for the wide variety of programs within \nthe Energy and Water Appropriations bill under very difficult budget \nconstraints. Under these constraints, you were able to fund the biomass \nprograms at $72 million. However, one very important program to the \nNortheast has not been funded. The Northeast Regional Biomass Program \nhas helped my State make significant steps to develop and market the \nuse of wood as an energy source. It is now being used in Vermont \nschools, low-income housing projects, State office buildings and mills. \nWithout support from the Northeast Regional Biomass Program, Vermont \nwill not be able to build on these successes. Although funding is not \nincluded in the Senate bill for this program, the Department of Energy \nshould be given the flexibility to continue support for some of these \nprojects.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As you mentioned, this appropriations bill was \nallocated $439 million less than the Fiscal Year 1999 enacted level. \nAlthough there are many programs I would have liked to continue, this \nfunding level cannot accommodate all of them. However, I recognize the \ngood projects being undertaken by the regional biomass programs and \nwould encourage the Department of Energy its support for those programs \nwithin the overall biomass budget.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman and look forward to working with him \nand the Department of Energy to support state efforts to expand the use \nof small biomass projects that promote the use of wood energy as a \nrenewable resource.\n  Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. As \nmore and more states deregulate their own energy industries, \nenvironmentally preferable electric power is one of the markets \ndeveloping first. One sector that has garnered specific questions about \nits impact on the environment is hydropower. Consumers need a credible \nmeans to determine which hydropower facilities are environmentally \npreferable. Mr. Chairman, you have partially addressed this situation \nalready\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\nby including funding within the Department of Energy's hydropower \naccount to develop ``fish friendly'' turbines. I believe facilities \nthat use this and other new technology should receive recognition for \ntheir efforts. Hydropower facilities that are operated to avoid and \nreduce their environmental impact should also receive recognition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator and encourage the Department \nof Energy to support a voluntary certification program that will \ndistinguish low impact hydropower from other hydropower. Such a \ncertification program would also help develop new markets for ``green \npower.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman and look forward to working with him \nand the Department of Energy to support this type of certification \nprogram.\n\n\n         hemispheric center for environmental technology (HCET)\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to engage the distinguished Senator \nfrom new Mexico and the distinguished Senator from Nevada, managers of \nthe pending bill, in a colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida, Senator Mack.\n  Mr. REID. I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Domenici, \nand will be happy to respond to the distinguished Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator.\n  Florida International University in my State of Florida has done a \ntruly remarkable job of working with the Department of Energy in \ncarrying out critically important environmental research and \ndevelopment of deactivation and decommissioning environmental \ntechnologies. More specifically, FIU's Hemispheric Center for \nEnvironmental Technology (HCET) has a proud history of partnering with \nDOE through its Environmental Management program to form a true `center \nof excellence' in these areas and the President's fiscal year 2000 \nbudget request for the EM program assumes full funding for continuation \nof this impressive partnership.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the senator yield?\n  Mr. MACK. I yield to my colleague from Florida.\n  Senator GRAHAM. I echo the comments of the Senator from Florida about \nthe FIU Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology and reinforce \nthe importance of the FIU Center in assisting the Department of Energy \nin deactivation and decommissioning of some of the most strategically \nimportant DOE sites in the Nation, including Fernald, Chicago, \nAlbuquerque, Richland, and Oak Ridge facilities. I am proud of the role \nthat HCET plays in these efforts.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague from Florida. It is my understanding \nthat the President's budget contains sufficient funding ($5,000,000) to \nfully fund the current working agreement between Florida International \nUniversity and the Department of Energy. Is that the Chairman's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman. I specifically request that, as the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New Mexico and the chairman of the \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee continues to shepherd this \nlegislation through the Senate and conference with the House, he would \nmake every possible effort to provide the full budget request for the \nDOE's Environmental Management program and protect the full funding \ncontained therein for the DOE-Florida International University \npartnership.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I strongly endorse the recommendation of my colleague \nfrom Florida and hope that the distinguished Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Subcommittee, Senator Reid, will approve the full budget \nrequest in the final bill that is sent to the White House for approval. \nThis is a program that is important to us and to our State.\n  Mr. REID. I thank both Senators from Florida, and you have my \ncommitment that I will do whatever I can to include sufficient funding \nfor the Environmental Management program at DOE to allow for the full \n$5,000,000 for the Florida International University-DOE initiative.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I offer my commitment as well that I will work with \nSenator Reid and the other members of the Subcommittee to do whatever I \ncan to include sufficient funding for the Environmental Management \nprogram at DOE to allow for the full $5,000,000 for the Florida \nInternational University-DOE initiative.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the distinguished Senators from New Mexico and \nNevada for their commitment and leadership on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I, too, thank the distinguished Senators from New Mexico \nand Nevada for their support in this most important matter.\n\n\n                 international radioecology laboratory\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the \nchairman, other members of the Appropriations Committee, and the \nSenate--the International Radioecology Laboratory, commonly referred to \nas IRL, in Slavutych, Ukraine--which was dedicated last month by the \nU.S. Department of Energy. The IRL was established in July, 1998 by an \nagreement between the governments of the United States and the Ukraine \nto facilitate the critical research being conducted near the Chernobyl \nnuclear site on the long-term health and environmental effects of the \nworld's worst nuclear accident. Construction of the IRL will be \ncompleted by fall, 1999. The IRL is managed by the Savannah River \nEcology Laboratory, also known as SREL, of the University of Georgia \nand funded through cooperative agreements by the Department of Energy.\n  Led by Dr. Ron Chesser of SREL, highly integrated research scientists \nfrom the University of Georgia, Texas Tech, Texas A & M, the Illinois \nState Museum, Purdue University, Colorado State University, Ukraine and \nRussia have been involved in cooperative research in the Chernobyl \nregion since 1992. These efforts have significant importance regarding \nthe long-term risks in the Chernobyl area itself, but also for \npredicting the environmental consequences of future radioactive \nreleases.\n  The new IRL will serve as the primary facility from which \nradioecology research activities are directed and will be the central \npoint for collaboration among scientists worldwide concerned with the \neffects of environmental radiation.\n  The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory has proposed a new 5-year \nresearch initiative at the IRL to be administered through the Office of \nInternational Nuclear Safety Cooperation Program at the Department of \nEnergy. This ambitious research project would carry out the goals of \nthe United States-Ukraine 1998 agreement to: (1) understand the effects \nof the pollution from the Chernobyl disaster on forms of life; (2) \nprovide data needed to make wise decisions concerning environmental and \nhuman health risks and the effectiveness of clean-up activities; and \n(3) develop strategic plans for the potential of future radiation \nreleases. I am disappointed that this new initiative was not \nspecifically funded in the FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations bill \napproved by the Committee and I would urge the Chairman to do all he \ncan to find the necessary funds for this important project when the FY \n2000 Energy and Water Appropriations bill goes to conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the concern of the Senior Senator from \nGeorgia. I share his point of view regarding the importance of this new \njoint United States-Ukraine facility and the vital research being \nconducted on the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. While you know \nhow tight our budget is, I assure you that when this bill goes to \nconference we will make every effort to locate additional funds within \nDOE to allocate for programs like this and will attempt to find \nadditional funding for DOE programs.\n\n\n               name change for termination costs program\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from New Mexico, the bill manager, regarding the need to \nchange the name of one of the programs in the Department of Energy's \nappropriations. Within the Energy Supply account, there is an account \ncalled ``Nuclear Energy.'' Within the nuclear energy account, there is \na program called ``Termination Costs.''\n  For some time, the name ``Termination Costs'' has caused considerable \nconfusion. In fact, in the past the Department of Energy has submitted \nits budget request for this program using a different name. They called \nit the ``Facilities'' program and the Senate last year even \nappropriated funding using\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\nthe name ``Facilities'' but the name change was dropped in conference.\n  The name ``Termination Costs'' is not an accurate depiction of the \nactivities occurring under this program. I will quote from the \nDepartment of Energy's fiscal year 2000 budget request. The following \nitems are listed as the program mission for the Termination Costs \nProgram. (1) Ensuring the cost-effective, environmentally-compliant \noperation of Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology sites and \nfacilities; (2) Maintaining the physical and technical infrastructure \nnecessary to support research and technology development by U.S. and \noverseas researchers; (3) Demonstrating the acceptability of \nelectrometallurgical technology for preparing DOE spent nuclear fuel \nfor ultimate disposal; and (4) Placing unneeded facilities in \nindustrially safe and environmentally compliant conditions for low-\ncost, long-term surveillance.\n  With the possible exception of the last item, No. 4, these important \nmission priorities do not fit the heading of ``termination.''\n  Again, quoting from the Department of Energy's budget submittal, the \nstated program goal for the Termination Costs Program is, ``To \ncontribute to the nation's nuclear science and technology \ninfrastructure through the development of innovative technologies for \nspent fuel storage and disposal and the effective management of active \nand surplus nuclear research facilities.'' I think this is an enduring \nmission for DOE and therefore the moniker ``Termination Costs'' is \nmisleading.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will my colleague from Idaho yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, listening to the statements of the \nSenator from Idaho, I share his conviction that the name ``Termination \nCosts'' appears to be inadequate to describe the activities carried out \nunder this program. This is consistent with the position the Senate \ntook last year. I commit to work with my colleague to see that the name \nis changed to ``Facilities'' as requested by both my colleague and by \nDOE in the past.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from New Mexico for his assistance in \nthis matter.\n\n\n                        doe clean-up at fernald\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the Fernald site in Cincinnati, OH, has \ndone a truly remarkable job of working with the Department of Energy in \ncarrying out critically important environmental clean-up and \nrestoration missions. More specifically, the clean-up at Fernald has \ngarnered broad-based stakeholder support and is moving along ahead of \nschedule. More important, the Fernald site has pioneered the \naccelerated 10 year clean-up plan, which will save taxpayers several \nbillion dollars. All of this has been accomplished while managing the \nsite at or below the Department's appropriated budget for the project. \nI see the distinguished Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee \non the floor and wanted to be sure he is aware of the efforts underway \nat Fernald.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his comments. I am \naware and certainly do appreciate the efficiency and budget-wise \nefforts of the clean-up achievements at the Fernald site.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee. Does the \nChairman agree that to further the proceedings, the Department of \nEnergy should support the accelerated clean-up plan in place?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator from Ohio. The subcommittee \nrecognizes the support of the Cincinnati community and regulators. The \nDepartment of Energy should take all steps necessary to keep the \naccelerated cleanup at Fernald on schedule, and the Subcommittee will \ncontinue to work with the senior Senator from Ohio to monitor this \neffort.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my friend and distinguished colleague from New \nMexico for his leadership on this important issue to the citizens of \nCincinnati.\n\n\n               bureau of reclamation dam safety research\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, Utah has at least 30 dams that currently \ndo not meet current safety standards. Most of these dams were built \nmore than 30 years ago by either the Bureau of Reclamation, the Soil \nConservation Service or the state for a variety of purposes such as \nflood control, irrigation or municipal purposes or for wildlife \nenhancement. As these dams have aged, safety concerns have increased. \nWe now find ourselves facing tremendous and expensive safety issues.\n  Earlier this year, I requested additional funding for research \nrelated to monitoring and manipulating subsurface flows which affect \nBureau dams. It is my hope that this research could be utilized to help \naddress dam safety across the West. Unfortunately, given the committee \nallocation, it was not possible to provide increased funding this year.\n  I know that the Bureau is seeking to conduct more extensive research \nto determine the possibility of manipulating subsurface flows and the \neffects on dam safety. Utah State University's Water Research Lab has \nbeen identified as a leader in this effort. I also requested funding to \nbe directed toward the Dam Breach Modeling program which would research \nadditional modeling of dam failure scenarios. This research would \ninclude water tracking technologies to monitor internal movement of \nwater through dams, and allow the Bureau to explore applying this \ntechnology to specific Western dams.\n  The technology would provide the Dam Safety program with additional \ntools to gather information on internal conditions and analyze dam \nintegrity and make predictions on possible impacts from floods, \nearthquakes and similar events. It is anticipated that after a testing \nperiod, assistance could be made available to federal and state dam \nsafety officials in assessment programs.\n  Utah, New Mexico, Idaho and almost all western states have \npotentially serious dam safety problems. New technologies could provide \ninformation to identify high risk areas and define the critical flows \nand leaks that threaten a structure.\n  As a member of the subcommittee, I certainly understand the pressures \non the chairman because of the budget limitations and personally know \nthat he has done everything he can to meet the enormous and competing \ndemands. I hope that should additional funds become available down the \nroad, the Committee would consider these requests at some funding \nlevel.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I concur with the Senator on the importance of \ndeveloping and testing dam safety technologies. However, since funding \nlevels for the Bureau are $95 million below the budget request, there \nare numerous projects of merit which must go unfunded this year. I wish \nthis were not the case, but I would be happy to work with the Senator \nshould additional resources become available and conference conditions \nallow the Committee to consider this matter.\n\n\n                     MAINTENANCE DREDGING PROJECTS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to clarify points regarding the Army \nCorps of Engineers maintenance dredging projects in the State of New \nHampshire.\n  Maintenance dredging of Little Harbor, in Portsmouth, remains a top \npriority for the State of New Hampshire and is important to regional \nand recreational commercial boating users who continue to operate with \nnavigational safety hazards. Environmental mitigation matters \nassociated with the federal project have been addressed by an \ninteragency task force. Proposed dredging, dredged material disposal, \nand mitigation arrangements are currently being addressed by the Army \nCorps of Engineers in an Environmental Assessment.\n  Piscataqua River shoaling remains a top priority for the State of New \nHampshire. Shoaling has occurred in the major shipping lane at \nPortsmouth Harbor. Last year 6 million tons of cargo, mostly petroleum \nproducts, passed through the Piscataqua River. It is imperative for \nnavigational and environmental safety that the shipping lane be cleared \nat the earliest possible opportunity. The Army Corps of Engineers is \ncurrently developing an Environmental Impact Study.\n  Sagamore Creek is also a priority for the State of New Hampshire. \nMaintenance dredging of Sagamore Creek is important to the New \nHampshire Commercial Fishing Industry as it functions as a transit \nchannel and is the back channel to Little Harbor. Appropriated funds \nwould allow the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct required \nhydrographic and material testing to\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\ninitiative project. Sagamore Creek is being abandoned by the New \nHampshire Commercial Fishing Fleet due to lack of clearance and \nnavigational safety concerns.\n  I respectfully ask the distinguished chairman to consider the \nimportance of these projects as this bill develops and to help the \nCorps in addressing these pressing priorities which are so important in \nmy state.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire bringing \nthese important projects to my attention. I understand, from recent \ncommunications with the Army Corps of Engineers, that work may being on \nthese projects as soon as possible, consistent with necessary approvals \nand funding. I look forward to working together to identify ways in \nconference by which we might be able to advance these projects.\n\n\n                     Brookhaven National Laboratory\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, with the threat of a permanent shutdown \nof the High Flux Beam Reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the \nemployees who operate the reactor have asked to be reinstated under The \nDepartment of Energy Worker and Community Transition Program. This \noffice provides funding for separation benefits, outplacement \nassistance, and training. Brookhaven and Argonne National Labs in Idaho \nwere removed from the program in 1997, making their employees \nineligible for those benefits.\n  I thank Senator Reid for committing to pursue adding this provision \nduring the conference committee negotiations on Energy and Water \nAppropriations for Fiscal Year 2000. This program is crucial to ensure \nfuture employment of the workforce at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n  Mr. REID. I am pleased to help the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                   georgia energy and water projects\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the chairman knows, several projects \nfrom the great state of Georgia found funding in the Committee's \nappropriations report now before us. I applaud the attention and \nsupport provided by the Subcommittee to fund these important \nactivities. In particular, I speak of the funding for Brunswick and \nSavannah Harbor maintenance and the Army Corps of Engineers' \ninvestigations of Brunswick Harbor and the Savannah Harbor Expansion. \nThe Brunswick and Savannah Harbor expansion projects found earlier \nauthorization in the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 (WRDA) \nwhich recently passed the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The subcommittee understands the importance of harbor \nmaintenance and deepening to Savannah and Brunswick. I also appreciate \nthe work of the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In addition, the subcommittee's continued funding of \nother worthy projects in Georgia, the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam, \nis appreciated. I look forward to working with you and the Subcommittee \non other Georgia priorities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The subcommittee agrees that these projects after \nundergoing the intense scrutiny of the Congressional process for a \nnumber of years continue to prove their worth. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work on behalf of these and other priorities for Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to engage in \nthis colloquy and for your support of these very worthwhile projects.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit for the Record the official \nBudget Committee scoring of the pending bill--S. 1168, the Energy and \nWater Development Appropriations bill for FY 2000.\n  The scoring of the bill reflects an amendment I offered at the \nbeginning of this debate to correct an inadvertent error in the bill as \nreported to the Senate. With this correction of a clerical error, the \nbill provides $21.3 billion in new budget authority (BA) and $13.3 \nbillion in new outlays to support the programs of the Department of \nEnergy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of \nReclamation, and related federal agencies. The bill provides the bulk \nof funding for the Department of Energy, including Atomic Energy \nDefense Activities and civilian energy research and development (R) \nother than fossil energy R and energy conservation programs.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the pending bill totals $21.3 billion \nin BA and $20.9 billion in outlays for FY 2000. The bill is $2 million \nin BA below the Subcommittee's 302(b) allocation, and at the 302(b) \nallocation for outlays.\n  The Senate bill is $0.1 billion in BA and $0.5 billion in outlays \nabove the 1999 level. The bill is $0.3 billion in both BA and outlays \nbelow the President's budget request for FY 2000.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the FY 2000 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bill be printed in the Record.\n  I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  S. 1168, ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS, 2000, SPENDING COMPARISON--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 2000, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   General\n                                  purposes   Crime   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSENATE-REPORTED BILL: \\1\\\n  Budget authority..............   21,278   .......  .........   21,278\n  Outlays.......................   20,868   .......  .........   20,868\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..............   21,280   .......  .........   21,280\n  Outlays.......................   20,868   .......  .........   20,868\n1999 Level:\n  Budget authority..............   21,177   .......  .........   21,177\n  Outlays.......................   20,366   .......  .........   20,366\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority..............   21,557   .......  .........   21,557\n  Outlays.......................   21,172   .......  .........   21,172\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority..............  ........  .......  .........  ........\n  Outlays.......................  ........  .......  .........  ........\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority..............

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment \nspecifically focused on encouraging small business partnership \ninteractions with the Department of Energy's national laboratories and \nother facilities associated with Defense Activities.\n  Congress has frequently encouraged the national laboratories and \nfacilities of the Department of Energy to craft partnerships that are \nsupportive of their mission interests. Congress has emphasized that all \nprogram funding at these institutions can be used for mission-\nsupportive partnerships.\n  Through industrial interactions, the best practices from industry, \nfrom improved technologies to improved operations, can be infused into \nDepartment missions. These interactions also provide opportunities for \nU.S. industry to benefit from technologies developed in support of the \nDepartment's mission areas, with a corresponding impact on the \ncompetitive position of our nation.\n  In past years, Congress has identified large amounts of funding, over \n$200 million per year, to encourage formation of these partnerships. \nThere is less need for these funds for industrial interactions today, \nsince the labs and facilities should have learned how to optimally use \nthese partnerships. However, the reduction in funding for industrial \ninteractions does not imply that Congress is less supportive of them, \nit only indicates the expectations that the Department's programs \nshould be able to continue to use these partnerships without line item \nfunding.\n  One specific class of industrial interactions, however, requires \ncontinued attention and specific funding from Congress. This involves \ninteractions with small businesses. Small businesses are a primary \nengine of U.S. economy. They frequently represent the greatest degree \nof innovation in their approaches. Their focus on innovation makes them \na particularly important partner for the labs and facilities, yet their \nsmall size and less developed business operations make interactions \nwith the large Departmental facilities difficult.\n  In addition, each of the labs and facilities needs a supportive small \nbusiness community surrounding them, one\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\nthat can provide needed technical services as well as provide an \neconomic climate that assists in recruitment and retention of the \nspecialized personnel required at these facilities.\n  For these reasons, we need a focused small business initiative to \nencourage interactions with this vital community. These partnership \ninteractions can take many forms, from very formal cooperative research \nand development agreements to less formal technology assistance. They \nshould be justified either on a mission relevance or regional economic \ndevelopment basis.\n  Four these reasons, Mr. President, this amendment creates a Small \nBusiness Initiative within Defense Activities for $10 million. With \nthis Initiative, this vital class of interactions will be encouraged.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to speak about an amendment to add $10 \nmillion for a specific area of civilian research and development. This \narea involves assessment of accelerator transmutation of waste \ntechnology that may be able to significantly reduce the radioactivity \nand radio-toxicity of certain isotopes found in spent nuclear fuel.\n  Accelerator transmutation of waste or ATW may enable the nation to \nconsider alternative strategies for spent nuclear fuel at some future \npoint in time. Our present plan involves no options, it involves only \nthe disposition of spent fuel in a permanent underground geologic \nrepository. Yet that spent fuel still has most of its energy potential.\n  Depending on future generation's needs for energy, the availability \nof cost effective technologies for generation of electricity, and \nwhatever limitations on power plant emissions may be in place, the \nnation may want to re-examine the advisability of continuing the \ncurrent path for spent fuel. Transmutation technologies could enable \nenergy recovery, along with significant reduction in the toxicity of \nthe resulting final waste. However, while transmutation is technically \nfeasible, much research and development will be required to determine \nits economic implications.\n  There is intense international interest in transmutation--from \nFrance, Japan, and Russia as examples. This is an excellent subject for \ninternational collaboration, and may lead to additional cooperation in \nthe entire area of spent fuel management. The U.S. needs to have a \nsufficiently strong program to participate in such an international \nprogram, and ideally to exert a degree of leadership on the directions \nof international spent fuel programs.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, this amendment adds $10 million to \nthe civilian research and development funding line within the nuclear \nenergy programs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the bill we are considering today, the \nenergy and water appropriations bill, is fundamental to our nation's \nenergy and defense related activities, and takes care of vitally \nimportant water resources infrastructure needs. Unfortunately, this \nbill diverts from its intended purpose by including a multitude of \nadditional, unrequested earmarks to the tune of $531 million.\n  This amount is substantially less than the earmarks included in the \nFY'99 appropriations bill and I commend my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee for their hard work in putting this bill \ntogether. In fact, this year's recommendation is about 60 percent lower \nthan the earmarks included in last year's appropriation bill. My \noptimism was raised upon reading the committee report which states that \nthe Committee is ``reducing the number of projects with lower priority \nbenefits.'' Unfortunately, while the Committee attempts to be more \nfiscally responsible, there is a continuing focus on parochial, special \ninterest concerns.\n  Funding is provided in this bill for projects where it is very \ndifficult to ascertain their overall importance to the security and \ninfrastructure of our nation.\n  Let me highlight a few examples:\n  $3,000,000 is provided for an ethanol pilot plant at Southern \nIllinois University;\n  $300,000 is provided to the Vermont Agriculture Methane project;\n  $400,000 is included for aquatic weed control at Lake Champlain in \nVermont, and,\n  $100,000 in additional funding for mosquito control activities in \nNorth Dakota.\n  How are these activities connected to the vital energy and water \nresource needs of our nation? Why are these projects higher in priority \nthan other flood control, water conservation or renewable energy \nprojects? These are the type of funding improprieties that make a \nmockery of our budget process.\n  Various projects are provided with additional funding at levels \nhigher than requested by the Administration. The stated reasons include \nthe desire to finish some projects in a reasonable timeframe. \nUnfortunately, other projects are put on hold or on a slower track. The \ninconsistency between the Administration's request, which is \nresponsible for carrying out these projects, and the views of the \nAppropriators on just how much funding should be dedicated to a \nproject, is troubling. As a result, various other projects that may be \nequally deserving or higher in priority do not receive an appropriate \namount of funding, or none at all. Many of my objections are based on \nthese types of inconsistencies and nebulous spending practices.\n  Another $92 million above the budget request is earmarked in \nadditional funding for regional power authorities. I fail to understand \nwhy we continue to spend millions of federal dollars at a time when \npower authorities are increasingly operating independent of federal \nassistance. Even the Bonneville Power Administration, one of these \npower entities, is self-financed and operates without substantial \nfederal assistance.\n  We must stop this practice of wasteful spending. It is unconscionable \nto repeatedly ask the taxpayers to foot the bill for these biased \nactions. We must work harder to focus our limited resources on those \nareas of greatest need nationwide, not political clout.\n  I remind my colleagues that I object to these earmarks on the basis \nof their circumvention of our established process, which is to properly \nconsider, authorize and fund projects based on merit and need. Indeed, \nI commend my colleagues for not including any projects which are \nunauthorized. However, there are still too many cases of erroneous \nearmarks for projects that we have no way of knowing whether, at best, \nall or part of this $531 million should have been spent on different \nprojects with greater need or, at worst, should not have been spent at \nall.\n  I will support passage of this bill, but let me state for the Record \nthat this is not the honorable way to carry out our fiscal \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list of \nobjectionable provisions in S. 1186 and its accompanying Senate report \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Objectionable Provisions in S. 1186 Fiscal Year 2000 Energy and Water \n                          Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n     Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers\n       General investigations\n       Earmark of $226,000 for the Great Egg Harbor Inlet to \n     Townsend's Inlet, New Jersey\n       General construction\n       Earmark of $2,200,000 to Norco Bluffs, California\n       Earmark of $3,000,000 to Indianapolis Central Waterfront, \n     Indiana\n       Earmark of $1,000,000 to Ohio River Flood Protection, \n     Indiana\n       Earmark of $800,000 to Jackson County, Mississippi\n       Earmark of $17,000,000 to Virginia Beach, Virginia \n     (Hurricane Protection)\n       An additional $4,400,000 to Upper Mingo County (including \n     Mingo County tributaries),\n       Lower Mingo County (Kermit), Wayne County, and McDowell \n     County, elements of the Levisa and Tug Forks of the Big Sandy \n     River and Upper Cumberland River project in West Virginia\n       Earmark of $2,000,000 to be used by the Secretary of the \n     Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is directed to \n     construct bluff stabilization measures at authorized \n     locations for Natchez Bluff, Mississippi\n       Earmark of $200,000 to be used by the Secretary of the \n     Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to initiate a \n     Detailed Project Report for the Dickenson County, Virginia \n     elements of the Levisa and Tug Forks of the Big Sandy River \n     and Upper Cumberland River West Virginia, Virginia and \n     Kentucky, project\n       An additional $35,630,000 above the budget request to flood \n     control, Mississippi River and Tributaries, Arkansas, \n     Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and \n     Tennessee\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\n     POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS\n       $39,594,000 restored to the Southeastern Power \n     Administration above the budget request.\n       An additional $60,000 above budget request for operation \n     and maintenance at Southwestern Power Administration.\n     INDEPENDENT AGENCIES\n       An additional $5,000,000 above the budget request is \n     provided for the Appalachian Regional Commission\n       An amount of $25,000,000 above the budget request is \n     provided for the Denali Commission\n       General provisions\n       Language which stipulates all equipment and products \n     purchased with funds made available in this Act should be \n     American-made.\n\n\n                            report language\n\n     Department of Defense, Army Corps of Engineers\n       General Investigations\n       Earmark of $100,000 to the Barrow Coastal Storm Damage \n     Reduction, AK.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Chandalrr River Watershed, AK.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Gastineau Channel, Juneau, AK.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Skagway Harbor, AK.\n       Earmark of $150,000 to Rio De Flag, Flagstaff, AZ.\n       Earmark of $250,000 to North Little Rock, Dark Hollow, AR.\n       Earmark of $250,000 to Llagas Creek, CA.\n       An additional $450,000 to Tule River, CA.\n       An additional $450,000 to Yuba River Basin, CA.\n       Earmark of $250,000 to Bethany Beach, South Bethany, DE.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Lake Worth Inlet, Palm Beach County, \n     FL.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Mile Point, Jacksonville, FL.\n       An additional $170,000 to Metro Atlanta Watershed, GA.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Kawaihae Deep Draft Harbor, HI.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Kootenai River at Bonners Ferry, ID.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Little Wood River, ID.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Mississinewa River, Marion, IN.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Calcasieu River Basin, LA.\n       Earmark of $500,000 to Louisiana Coastal Area, LA.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to St. Bernard Parish, LA.\n       Earmark of $100,000 to Detroit River Environmental \n     Dredging, MI.\n       Earmark of $400,000 to Sault Ste.

amounts of earmarks: $531,124,000.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to explain my amendment to S. 1186, \na bill making appropriations for certain Department of Energy programs. \nAmong these programs is the radioactive waste management program which \nis responsible for developing a nuclear waste repository at Yucca \nMountain, in Nevada.\n  This repository will, if successfully completed, one day hold the \nspent nuclear fuel from all of this country's commercial nuclear power \nplants, in addition to defense high-level radioactive waste left-over \nfrom the development of nuclear weapons.\n  It has been 12 years since passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nAmendments of 1987, and I believe the Department of Energy's Yucca \nMountain program is in serious trouble. In 1983, the Department of \nEnergy signed contracts with every one of this country's nuclear power \ngenerators saying that the government would start taking their spent \nfuel for disposal in January of 1998.\n  Because of the Government's failure to meet that deadline, a number \nof utility companies, in conjunction with many State governments, are \nsuing the Federal Government for failure to fulfill its contractual \ncommitments. Many of these utilities are being forced, because of the \nGovernment's failure, to construct additional storage capacity at their \nsites. Many of these companies are seeking monetary damages from the \nGovernment.\n  Inheriting this situation from his predecessors at the Department of \nEnergy, Secretary Richardson laid a proposal before the nuclear \nutilities last year. Secretary Richardson told the utilities that if \nthey would agree to drop all future claims against the government, the \nDepartment of Energy would be willing to pay the utilities for their on \nsite storage costs and that DOE would ``take title''--meaning DOE would \ntake over ownership and all liability--for the spent nuclear fuel and \nstore it at the nuclear power plants for an indefinite period of time.\n  It is safe to say--since this administration opposes my interim \nstorage legislation--that we can expect spent nuclear fuel under their \nscenario to be stored at reactors until at least the year 2015, because \nthat is when the repository is expected to open--at the earliest.\n  The amendment I offer today speaks to the heart of this issue. To be \nblunt, I think it is irresponsible to create some 80 new federal \ninterim storage sites for spent fuel scattered around this country. And \nI think the Administration compounds their neglect of this crisis by \ndepleting the funds collected for development of the permanent \nsolution--the Nuclear Waste Fund, created by law in 1982--by dispersing \nthese funds back out to the same utilities who paid them in the first \nplace, only now they are being used as a ``band-aid'' to pay to store \nfuel at reactors.\n  Very simply put, my amendment prohibits the Department of Energy from \nusing funds appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund for the purpose of \nsettling lawsuits or paying judgments arising out of the failure of the \nfederal government to accept spent nuclear fuel from commercial \nutilities.\n  Money in the Nuclear Waste Fund has been collected to pay for a \npermanent solution to our nuclear waste problem. Mr. President, I don't \nthink we should be squandering these funds on band-aid schemes. My \namendment prohibits this from happening.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will my colleague from Idaho yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I share the concerns of the Senator from \nIdaho. However, it is not clear to me that the Department of Energy \ncurrently has the authority to use appropriated funds from the Nuclear \nWaste Fund for the purpose--on site storage at nuclear power plants--\nthat is of concern to the Senator from Idaho. As I interpret current \nlaw, there exists no statutory provision allowing the Department of \nEnergy to fund on-site storage. If that were the case, would my \ncolleague from Idaho still feel the need to offer his amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, with my colleague's comment regarding the \nlack of current Department of Energy authority to use the Nuclear Waste \nFund in the way I am concerned, I will reconsider offering my amendment \nat this time. I thank the Chair and my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few remarks with \nregard to the FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation. \nFirst, let me state that I am pleased that this bill takes strides to \nsignificantly reduce, in the name of fiscal soundness, appropriations \nfor two programs about which I have been concerned for quite some \ntime--the non-power programs of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) \nand the Animas La-Plata project by the Bureau of Reclamation. I intend \nto support this appropriations bill this year.\n  For the past few Congresses, I have argued that the non-power \nprograms of the TVA should be seriously scrutinized and reduced \nappropriately. I have introduced legislation which would put TVA on a \nglidepath toward eliminating federal funding for the non-power \nprograms. The former Senator from Alabama (Mr. Heflin) and I personally \nmet with TVA to discuss this legislation and the appropriate length of \ntime for a federal fund phase-out. In the last two appropriations \ncycles, I have written to the appropriations committee\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\nasking them to reduce TVA non-power appropriations, and in the FY99 \nappropriations bill the funds for TVA were reduced significantly to a \nthird of the more than $150 million that TVA received when I began \nraising this issue in the 104th Congress. My voice in the Senate on \nthis issue is echoed by a number of members of the House Appropriations \nCommittee who zeroed out funds for TVA non-power programs in the House-\nversion of the FY99 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation.\n  I am pleased that this resounding call for scrutiny of these programs \nis leading to real results. In FY99 the TVA received $50 million \ndollars, with $7 million of that total specifically for the Land \nBetween the Lakes (LBL) Recreation Area. This appropriations \nlegislation virtually eliminates appropriations for TVA non-power \nprograms, retaining only $7 million in flat funding for LBL. The TVA \nnon-power activities for which we have previously provided funds \ninclude providing recreational programs, making economic development \ngrants to communities, and promoting public use of TVA land and water \nresources. I understand the Committee's concerns that the management of \nthe LBL is a federal responsibility. I believe that the Committee has \nacted appropriately in this matter. In fulfilling this function, which \nis federal, the Committee has provided resources specifically for LBL \nbut not for the other non-power programs. In the future, Congress needs \nto evaluate whether other federal land management agencies, such as the \nInterior Department, might be able to manage this area, but this is the \nright step at this time.\n  I believe it is appropriate for the Senate to significantly reduce \nfunds for TVA's appropriated programs because there are lingering \nconcerns, brought to light in a 1993 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \nreport, that non-power program funds subsidize activities that should \nbe paid for by non-federal interests. In its 1993 report, CBO focused \non two programs: the TVA Stewardship Program and the Environmental \nResearch Center, which no longer receives federal funds. Stewardship \nactivities historically received the largest share of TVA's \nappropriated funds. The funds are used for dam repair and maintenance \nactivities. According to 1995 testimony provided by TVA before the \nHouse Subcommittee on Energy and Water Appropriations, when TVA repairs \na dam it pays 70%, on average, of repair costs with appropriated \ndollars and covers the remaining 30% with funds collected from \nelectricity ratepayers. This practice of charging a portion of dam \nrepair costs to the taxpayer, CBO highlighted, amounts to a significant \nsubsidy. If TVA were a private utility, and it made modifications to a \ndam or performed routine dredging, the ratepayers would pay for all of \nthe costs associated with that activity. I think that removing \nappropriations for this program largely ends concerns about taxpayer \nsubsidization of the dam repair and maintenance program.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation contains a $1 million \nreduction from the Budget Request for the Animas La-Plata project. In \nthis bill, the project receives a total of $2 million for FY 2000. As \nmy colleagues know, I have long been active in raising Senate awareness \nabout the financial costs of moving forward with development and \nconstruction of the full-scale version of the Animas-La Plata project. \nI do not want the federal government to proceed with construction of \nthe full-scale project while the Department of the Interior continues \nits discussion about alternatives to that project.\n  As my colleagues will recall from the debate on an amendment I \noffered to the FY 98 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation on \nthis matter, the currently authorized Animas-La Plata project is a $754 \nmillion dollar water development project planned for southwest Colorado \nand northwest New Mexico, with federal taxpayers slated to pay more \nthan 65% of the costs. I am glad that we are not proceeding on this \nproject full steam ahead, and I am pleased to see that the \nAppropriators recognize that on-going alternatives discussions can \nproceed without a large infusion of new resources.\n  Despite these gains in reducing funds for some questionable programs, \nthe bill contains some shifts in program funding about which I am \nconcerned. Particularly troubling is the reduction in the President's \nproposed increase in the renewable energy budget. The bill provides \n$261 million more for the DOE defense activities than requested by the \nAdministration, but reduces the request for solar and renewable energy \nprograms by $92.1 million. I believe that it is important for the \nfederal government to make appropriate investment in solar and \nrenewable technology, particularly in light of our efforts to \nrestructure the electricity system and meet our overall energy \nefficiency goals. I would hope that we could find a way to shift \nresources within this legislation to make it possible to fulfill the \nAdministration's request.\n  Overall, Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill can meet our \nrequirements under the budget caps by reducing unnecessary spending. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as in recent years, the energy and water \nAppropriation bill has been faced with dilemmas about funding the \ndiverse activities within its jurisdiction. For example, last year, the \nbudget request for the Corps of Engineers was significantly decreased \nand in this subcommittee we had the challenge of keeping the Corps of \nEngineers viable and focused. Clearly this year's appropriation bill \nwas just as dramatic--since for the first time in over twenty years the \nCorps of Engineers funding is reduced below the enacted bill's level. \nDespite the problems, there are many positives to this particular \nappropriation which the Chairman and I pointed out in opening \nstatements.\n  Additionally, we have worked hard to find ways to accommodate our \ncolleagues with their amendments. I believe that the responsibility of \na Senator is not simply to listen to the bureaucrats who plan ways to \nspend the appropriations, but to request those amendments the Senator \nsees as necessary for his or her constituents. While Members may not be \nsatisfied with every aspect or the resolution of every request, the \nchairman and I have made a conscientious effort to work with those \namendments.\n  I recommend this bill to my colleagues for the vital functions across \nthe nation that are funded through these appropriations. I recognize \nthe difficult work done by the subcommittee staff and their efforts in \npreparing this bill and responding to the members of the Senate. So I \ncommend the diligence of Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, Gregory Daines, \nLashawnda Leftwich, Elizabeth Blevins, Sue Fry, a detail from the Corps \nof Engineers, and Bob Perret, a congressional fellow, in my office.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are ready to go to final passage. We \nneed 2 minutes, and then we will call for third reading. Senator \nHutchison wanted 2 minutes. I ask that she be granted 2 minutes, and \nthen we will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor allowing me 2 minutes. I was introducing a judicial candidate and \nwas not able to come earlier.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the committee, \nfor the great help he has given to many of us who particularly have \nstrong water needs in our States.\n  I particularly want to mention the Port of Houston. The Port of \nHouston is the second largest port in the Nation, and it is the largest \nin foreign tonnage. It is the largest container port. We have the \nlargest petrochemical complex in the entire world.\n  It is very important that our port be competitive. This bill will \nfully fund the dredging of that port, which is the last port in America \nthat has not gone under 40 feet. This will take us to 45.\n  It is a very important bill.\n  I think both Senator Domenici and Senator Leahy have done a great job \non this bill, but particularly I appreciate the support for this great \nPort of Houston and the efforts that were made to continue this \ndredging project that will help us in trade and help us remain \ncompetitive in the world market.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?

Mr. President, I now call up S. 1206.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1206) making appropriations for the legislative \n     branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand that the senior Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, is on her way to the floor. I will wait \nuntil she is here to express to the entire Senate my appreciation for \nher assistance as the ranking member of the Legislative Branch \nSubcommittee of Appropriations.\n  I have been delighted to have the opportunity to work with her on \nthis legislation and I will make that clear when she arrives. I \nunderstand she is in another committee meeting, and in the pattern of \nthe Senate, finds herself torn between two equally important \nresponsibilities. That is a situation with which we are all familiar.\n  I will, for the information of Senators, point out that the \nlegislative branch bill provides $1.68 billion in budget authority, \nexclusive of House items, for fiscal year 2000. This is $114 million or \n6.4 percent less than the fiscal 1999 level. It represents $105 million \nor a 5.9-percent decrease from the President's budget request. So in \nthis time of difficulty, we are coming in below last year's spending \nand below where the President recommended.\n  There are increases in the bill, of course. There always will be in \nan appropriations bill. You cut some places, and you increase others. \nThe majority of the increases in the bill account for cost-of-living \nadjustments only, and they are estimated at 4.4 percent across the \nboard.\n  The Senate portion of the bill increases funding for the Senate by \nonly 3 percent above the fiscal 1999 level, which is less than the 4.4-\npercent COLA adjustment. So while the Senate portion of the bill is \ngoing up, it is going up less than the mandatory COLA that is required \nby law.\n  The bill funds 79 percent of the budget request of the Architect of \nthe Capitol. Of the funds provided, 73 percent will fund operations, \nwith the other 27 percent to fund Capitol projects.\n  I have always been one who has insisted on funding Capitol projects. \nAs a businessman, I know that sometimes the most expensive savings you \ncan achieve are savings that you take in the name of maintenance \ndeferral. As things begin to deteriorate around the Capitol, it is \ntempting to say we can put it off for another year and look good in the \nshort term. All you do when you do that is raise your costs in the long \nterm. So throughout my tenure on the Legislative Branch Subcommittee \nand particularly my tenure as the chairman of that subcommittee, I have \nalways been a champion of funding the Capitol projects and funding the \nmaintenance projects to their fullest level, believing that in the long \nrun that saves money.\n  Why then am I standing here today and saying that we are not going to \ndo that in this bill, and we are not giving the Architect of the \nCapitol the funds that were requested? Well, there are several reasons \nfor that. I think it is worth an explanation.\n  The subcommittee did not fund the Architect's request for $28 million \nfor Capitol dome renovations. I have been in the Capitol dome with the \nArchitect of the Capitol, and I have seen firsthand how desperately in \nneed of renovation it is. However, the full scope of the project will \nbe determined during the paint removal process which is currently \nunderway. The paint removal process is not expected to be completed\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\nuntil next summer. Therefore, I think it prudent for us to delete the \nfunds from this bill until we have the completion of that process and \nhave the information available to us that will come as a result. That \nis why we do not recommend proceeding until the full scope of the \nproject has been determined. That is where a large part of the savings \nthat we referred to have come from.\n  I see the Senator from California has arrived. I wish to make public \nacknowledgment of the great contribution she has made to the \nLegislative Branch Subcommittee. This is her first assignment on the \nsubcommittee as its ranking member, and I have found her not only \ndelightful and cooperative to deal with but, perhaps even more \nappreciated, fully engaged. It is one thing to have a colleague who is \nnice to deal with but who never shows up and never pays any attention \nto any of the issues. The Senator from California not only shows up but \ncomes with her homework having been done, a full agenda of her own, and \ncomplete understanding of the issues. I appreciate very much the \nopportunity I have had of working with her and welcome her to the \nsubcommittee and to this particular bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bennett, and commend him for the fair and \nresponsible bill that has been put together. This is my first year as \nthe ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, and I have \nfound Senator Bennett to be very open and willing to discuss issues. \nHis leadership on our subcommittee is carried out in the best \nbipartisan spirit.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator and appreciate her \ncomments.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Bennett, just outlined for the Senate, the fiscal \nyear 2000 legislative branch appropriation bill was reported out of the \nfull Appropriations Committee on Thursday, June 10, 1999, by a vote of \n28-0. As reported by the committee, the bill, which totals \n$1,679,010,000 in budget authority, exclusive of House items, is \n$113,962,000, or 6.4 percent, below last year's enacted level and \n$104,529,000, or 5.9 percent, below the President's request. For Senate \nitems only, the subcommittee recommends a total of $489,406,000--a \nreduction of $28,187,000, or 5.4 percent, from the President's request.\n  For the Capitol Police, the subcommittee recommends a total of $88.7 \nmillion for salaries and general expenses. This is an increase of $5.8 \nmillion, or 6.8 percent, over last year's enacted level. I commend the \nagency for soliciting a management review which was conducted by an \noutside consulting firm. Since that time, the Capitol Police has been \nvery aggressive in addressing the management deficiencies outlined in \nthat report. First, they provided the subcommittee with a departmental \nresponse which addressed the findings of the review, and they are \ncurrently in the process of developing a strategic planning process \nwhich will provide for a systematic approach to organizational \nenhancements and professional growth for the future. In this regard, \nthis bill contains the funding required for improvements to information \ntechnology and transfers this responsibilities from the Senate Sergeant \nat Arms to the Capitol Police. This action was recommended in the \nmanagement review report. The bill also provides for cost-of-living and \ncomparability increases for the men and women of the United States \nCapitol Police.\n  For the General Accounting Office, the subcommittee recommends a \nfunding level of $382.3 million, which is $4.8 million below the budget \nrequest, but is almost $10 million above what the House is proposing. \nThe level proposed by the subcommittee will permit the GAO to maintain \nthe current level of 3,275 FTEs, which is what the Comptroller \nrequested for Fiscal Year 2000 and it will also provide adequate funds \nfor them to meet their mandatory requirements.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take a minute, as I did during our full \ncommittee markup, to talk about the Senate Employees Child Care Center. \nAs Members may be aware, the groundbreaking for the child care center \nbegan in the fall of 1996, and the center was to be completed in the \nfall of 1997. Here we are in June of 1999, and the center remains \nincomplete. I have encouraged the Architect of the Capital to raise the \npriority of this project and bring this problem-plagued project to \ncompletion by the current targeted date of September 1, 1999. This new \ncenter will expand the quality of child care services available to the \nstaff who help us.\n  Again, Mr. President, I want to personally thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bennett, for the courtesies he has extended to \nme. He is, indeed, a most thoughtful and gracious chairman--a real \ngentleman--who has made my first year on the subcommittee a most \npleasant one.\n  If I may, Mr. President, I extend my very sincere thanks to Mary \nDewald and Christine Ciccone of the staff for their excellent work on \nthis bill. It has been very special, and we are blessed with wonderful \nstaff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California and \nparticularly thank her for remembering the staff. We stand here before \nthe television cameras, but we take credit for the work they do. I \nappreciate her doing that.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 683 and 684, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, ever since I arrived here in 1993, I \nhave supported initiatives to help restore the public's confidence in \ngovernment by limiting the influence of special interests over the \nlegislative process. It's a big task, Mr. President and along the way I \nhave offended and even angered some people around here.\n  I have worked to require greater disclosure of the expenses and \nactivities of lobbyists. I pushed to put in place new gift restrictions \nthat stopped Senators and staff from accepting free vacations and fancy \ndinners from lobbyists as used to be the norm around here. And finally, \nI have argued that we need to reform the woefully loophole-ridden \ncampaign finance system that we currently live under. Reforming \nCongress is a crucial issue for me because the electorate has grown to \nview this institution with cynicism and disdain, and even to \nfundamentally distrust their own elected representatives.\n  Now Mr. President, a crucial part of the culture of special interest \ninfluence that pervades Washington is the revolving door between public \nservice and private employment. But by putting a lock on this revolving \ndoor for some period of time, we can send a message that those entering \ngovernment employment should view public service as an honor and a \nprivilege--not as another wrung on the ladder to personal gain and \nprofit.\n  There are countless instances of former members of Congress who once \nchaired or served on committees with jurisdiction over particular \nindustries or special interests now lobbying their former colleagues on \nbehalf of those very industries or special interests. Former committee \nstaff directors are using their contacts and knowledge of their former \ncommittees to secure lucrative positions in lobbying firms and \nassociations with interests related to those committees.\n  There have been some very interesting studies showing just how \nregularly the revolving door swings. Of the 91 lawmakers who left \nCongress at the end of 1994, at least 25 later registered to lobby. A \n1995 study of 353 former lawmakers showed that one in four had lobbied \nfor private interests after leaving office. In fact, there were more \nthan 100 former Members of Congress who appear on the lobbying reports \nfiled in August 1997, and that doesn't count Members who left office in \n1996, since they could not yet register without violating the current \nrevolving door law. I could go on, Mr. President, and on and on and on. \nThe problem of revolving door lobbying is quite clear.\n  The amendment I am offering today is designed to strengthen the post-\nemployment restrictions on Members of Congress and senior congressional \nstaff that are currently in place. Keep in mind, post-employment \nrestrictions are nothing new. There is currently a one year ban on \nformer members of Congress lobbying the entire Congress as well as a \none-year ban on senior congressional staff lobbying the committee or \nthe Member for whom they worked. And by Senate rule, we prohibit all \ndeparting Senate staff from lobbying their former employing entity for \none year. Members and senior staff are also prohibited from lobbying \nthe executive branch on behalf of a foreign entity for one year.\n  The amendment would double the current restriction and prohibit \nmembers of Congress from lobbying the entire Congress for two years. \nThus, in most cases, an entire two year Congress will intervene before \na former Member can be back lobbying his or her former colleagues. \nPerhaps the longer period will encourage those who leave the Congress \nto seek opportunities for future employment outside of the lobbying \nworld. Perhaps it will discourage big business from putting former \nMembers on their payroll right after they leave office. But in any \nevent, this longer ``cooling off period'' will give the public more \nconfidence in the integrity of this body.\n  With respect to staff, the amendment makes some changes as well. Here \nwe are talking only about those staff who make three quarters or more \nof the salary of a member of Congress. In other words, this amendment \nwould change the post-employment restrictions only on staff making over \n$102,000 per year. These senior staff work closely with us, at the \ncommittee level, or with the leadership, or in our personal offices. \nThis amendment would prohibit these very senior staffers from lobbying \nthe House of Congress in which they work during the same 2-year period \nas we are prohibited from lobbying the entire Congress. So senior \nSenate staffers couldn't lobby the Senate and senior House staffers \ncouldn't lobby the House.\n  Now here we have struck a balance, Mr. President. It seems clear to \nme\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\nthat the current restrictions which prohibit lobbying contacts only \nwith the former employer, whether Member or committee, are inadequate. \nHigh level staffers have contacts and work closely with people \nthroughout the body, not just with the other staff or Members on their \ncommittees or in their Member's office. These are people making \n$102,000 or more. They are highly in demand in the lobbying world, not \njust for their expertise but for their contacts. If the cooling off \nperiod is to mean anything with respect to these senior staff, it must \ncover more than the individual committee or member of Congress for whom \nthey worked.\n\n  Some senior staff undoubtedly have contacts with their counterparts \nin the other body. But their day to day work, and therefore their \nclosest contacts will be in the house of Congress in which they work. \nSo this amendment leaves an outlet for the use of a former staffer's \nexpertise in lobbying the other body. To me, that is a reasonable \nbalance, and not an unreasonable restriction on a staffer's future \nemployment.\n  Now some might argue that we are inhibiting talented individuals from \npursuing careers in policy matters on which they have developed \nsubstantial expertise. It may be asked why a former high-level staffer \non the Senate Subcommittee on Communications of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee cannot accept employment with a telecommunications company? \nAfter all, this person has accumulated years of knowledge of our \ncommunication laws and technology. Why should this individual be \nprevented from accepting private sector employment in the \ncommunications field ?\n  But my amendment does not bar anyone from seeking private-sector \nemployment. Staffers can take those jobs with the telecommunications \ncompany, but what they cannot do is lobby their former colleagues in \nthe house of Congress for which they worked for two years. They can \nconsult, they can advise, they can recommend, but they cannot lobby \ntheir former colleagues.\n  I considered an even longer cooling off period for staffers to be \nbarred from lobbying their former employer, be it a member or a \ncommittee, but decided that the two year, house of Congress limitation \nstrikes the best balance. Two years is the length of an entire \nCongress. That period of time should be enough to mitigate to a great \nextent the special access that the staffer is likely to have because of \nhis or her former position. At the same time, it allows the staffer who \nis intent on pursuing a lobbying career to concentrate on the other \nbody for two years, and then return to the side of the Capitol in which \nhe or she worked after that period.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not an attack on the profession of \nlobbying. The right to petition the government is a fundamental \nconstitutional right. Simply attacking lobbyists does not address the \ntrue flaws of our political system. Lobbying is merely an attempt to \npresent the views and concerns of a particular group and there is \nnothing inherently wrong with that. In fact, lobbyists, whether they \nare representing public interest groups or Wall Street, can present \nimportant information to Members of Congress that may not otherwise be \navailable.\n  I strongly believe that there is no more noble endeavor than to serve \nin government. But we need to take immediate action to restore the \npublic's confidence in their government, and to rebuild the lost trust \nbetween members of Congress and the electorate. This amendment is a \nstrong step in that direction because it addresses a perception that \ntoo often rises to the level of reality--that the interests that hire \nformer Members or staffers from the Congress have special access when \nthey lobby the Congress. We need to slow the revolving door to address \nthat perception, and this amendment will do just that.\n  I am pleased that the managers have agreed to accept my amendment and \nthat it has become part of the bill that will go to the President for \nsignature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss S. 96, the McCain bill concerning Y2K litigation. It is \nunfortunate that this bill has, to some extent, been utilized by those \non both extremes of the tort reform debate: with proponents arguing \nthat opposition to the bill reflects contempt for our economy and a few \nopponents accusing the bill's supporters of contempt for consumers' \nrights. The truth, as usual, is somewhere in between these two poles.\n  As our economy evolves, becoming national and international in scope, \nsituations will arise that demand procedural and substantive changes to \nour legal system. Moderate, balanced tort reform is an issue on which I \nhave worked for some years. I approach each issue with the same \nquestion: can our legal system be made more efficient while continuing \nto provide adequate, just protections to consumers? This approach has \nled me to support reforms which have been validated by the test of \ntime.\n  Mr. President, in 1994, I supported one of the first tort reform \nmeasures to pass Congress, the Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994. At \nthat time small plane manufacturers had been almost extinguished by \ncostly litigation. This narrowly-tailored legislation limited the \nperiod, to eighteen years, in which manufactures could be sued for \ndesign or manufacturing defects. In the six\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nyears since enactment, the industry has reemerged to create thousands \nof new jobs while providing consumers with safe products.\n  In 1995, I sought to apply this same principle to all durable goods, \nsome of which remain in the workplace for forty, fifty, sixty years or \nmore. Tool and machine manufacturers in Rhode Island and the nation \nwere saddled with costs stemming from litigation over products they \nmade a half century ago, some of which had been modified by others. As \na result, I supported tort reform for durable goods which limited the \nstatute of repose, reasonably capped punitive damages, and implemented \nproportionate liability to de minimis tortfeasors. In an effort to \nfurther the reform effort, I voted for this bill even though I was \nconcerned that its punitive damage caps and proportionate liability \nsections were too broad. My support for the bill included a vote to \noverride President Clinton's veto.\n  My concerns about this bill were borne out by the fact that the veto \noverride was not successful. Proponents of tort reform allowed their \nview of perfection to become an enemy of good, sensible reform. Indeed, \ntheir stubbornness continues to frustrate progress to this day.\n  Just last year, a compromise tort reform bill negotiated by Senator \nRockefeller between the Clinton Administration and members of the \nbusiness community was rejected by some who wanted only sweeping \nchanges to current tort law. I am afraid that some have brought this \nsame sentiment to the Y2K issue.\n  In addition to addressing the products liability reform issue in \n1995, I was also approached by members of the securities industry \nseeking to amend litigation rules pertaining to securities law. The \nindustry wished to combat frivolous litigation. Indeed, it was obvious \nthat some class action suits were being filed after a precipitous drop \nin the value of a corporation's stock, without evidence of fraud. Such \nlawsuits frequently inflict substantial legal costs upon corporations, \nharming both the business and its shareholders. This sort of activity \nbenefitted no one but the attorneys who brought the cases.\n  As a result, I supported both procedural changes and requirements \nthat specific examples of fraud be listed in a lawsuit as embodied in \nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Again, my support \nfor this legislation required my vote to override a veto. This time, \nthat override was successful. In my view, that success was due to the \nmoderate, balanced approach of the bill.\n  In practice, the legislation successfully ended frivolous lawsuits in \nfederal courts such that I worked with colleagues and the Chairman of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission to implement the same rules at \nthe state level. This effort resulted in the Securities Litigation \nUniform Standards Act of 1998. Again, this bill only received \nPresidential support after an attempt to inject overly broad provisions \ninto the bill were defeated. Courts are now applying this standard in a \nmanner that balances the interest we all have in ensuring consumer \nprotection, while also deterring nonmeritorious law suits.\n  I think the record is clear. When Congress addresses identifiable \ninequalities or inefficiencies in our legal system, progress can be \nmade. However, when legislation focuses on broader, philosophical \ndebates, directly pitting the interests of consumers against \nmanufactures, consensus cannot be reached. It is my hope that the \nSenate will keep this lesson in mind when the Y2K legislation goes to \nconference.\n  As the work of the Senate's Y2K Committee and the President's Council \non the Year 2000 Conversion have shown, the millennium bug will cause \ndisruptions. These disruptions will inflict costs on individuals and \nbusinesses. The question is: how will we adjudicate who will bear the \nburden of these costs?\n  Thus far, as demonstrated by a recent report by the Congressional \nResearch Service, there have been only 48 Y2K related lawsuits filed. \nRecently, the Gartner Group, a consulting firm specializing in Y2K \nredress, reported that a quarter of all Y2K failures have already \noccurred. Given the paucity of Y2K lawsuits today, one could question \nwhether the dire predictions of billions of dollars in Y2K litigation \nis overestimated. At the very least, it is certain that the current 48 \nsuits have not provided much in the way of proof concerning the \ninequities in our legal system that will allow attorneys to compound \nand exacerbate the costs associated with the Y2K problem.\n\n  Some of these 48 lawsuits are class actions against inexpensive \nsoftware manufactured several years ago. The merit of such suits is \ndubious, given that no harm has yet occurred and the ``reasonableness'' \nof a consumer's expectation that $30 software would last several years \nand withstand the millennium bug.\n  These 48 lawsuits also contain examples, however, of companies \nattempting to improperly profit from their own Y2K unpreparedness. For \nexample, one software company sold a product to small business men and \nwomen for $13,000 in 1996 with implied warrantees for proper use for a \ndecade. A year later the company sent its customers notice that the \nsoftware was not Y2K compatible. The software, would, therefore, not \nwork in two years. The company offered its customers a $25,000 \n``upgrade'' which would ensure that the software would work properly \nfor half the time it was warranted. Needless to say, a free fix was \nquickly offered by this software manufacturer once a class action \nlawsuit was filed.\n  The question the Senate must address in this legislation is what \nchanges in our legal system will encourage everyone to address Y2K \nproblems before they strike while allowing defrauded consumers \ncontinued opportunity to obtain redress. Indeed, the greatest danger \nwould seem to be that this legislation unintentionally rewards bad \nfaith companies that fail to address Y2K problems. Again, according to \nthe Gartner Group, some $600 billion will be spent by the end of the \nyear in trying to find, patch, and test computer systems at risk of \nfault. Bad faith companies that have not taken these responsible steps \nshould not be rewarded.\n  I supported legislation put forward by Senators Kerry, Robb, Breaux, \nReid and Leader Daschle which encourages redress not litigation, deters \nfrivolous lawsuits, provides good-faith actors with additional \nprotections if they are sued, and allows individual consumers the \nprotections they are afforded under current law. Specifically, the \namendment requires that plaintiffs provide defendants with notice of a \nlawsuit and time for the defendant to respond with proposed redress to \nthe problem. Additionally, plaintiffs would have to cite with \nspecificity the material defect of their product as well as the damages \nincurred. Class action lawsuits are limited to those involving material \nharm. Current redress of Y2K problems is encouraged by the provision of \nthe amendment which requires immediate mitigation and limits damages \nfor those who fail in this regard. The amendment provides commercial \ntransactions with the benefit of their express contract, while omitting \nconsumers, who do not have the economic bargaining power or legal \ndepartments of large corporations, from the scope of the legislation. \nThe amendment also discourages plaintiffs from simply suing the \ndefendant with the ``deepest pockets'' by providing proportionate \nliability for companies that have acted responsibly in addressing Y2K \nproblems in their products.\n  On balance, the Kerry/Daschle amendment is a fair method of \naddressing identifiable problems in our litigation system as they \nrelate to potential Y2K litigation.\n  I must also acknowledge that the McCain legislation has markedly \nimproved from its original form due in no small part to the efforts of \nSenator Dodd. As first introduced, the bill appeared to be a wish-list \nfor those who have attempted over the past decades, without success, to \ncompletely overhaul our litigation system. S. 96, however, continues to \ncontain provisions that simply appear to transfer Y2K costs from \ndefendants to plaintiffs without equitable cause. The bill provides \nprotections to plaintiffs not afforded defendants, caps punitive \ndamages for bad faith actors, limits joint and several liability for \nbad faith businesses, prohibits states like Rhode Island from awarding \nnon-economic damages even in instances of fraud, federalizes all class \naction lawsuits, and fails\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\nto distinguish between consumers and large corporations.\n  Perhaps just as importantly as its substantive problems, the Clinton \nAdministration has threatened a veto of S. 96. With six months until \nthe end of the year, we do not have two, three, or four months to \nnegotiate compromises.\n  It is my hope that those of us who are truly in support of reforming \nthe current system will prevail in softening some of S. 96's provisions \nto arrive at legislation that the Administration can and will support. \nWhile this will not result in legislation that organizations can use to \nfuel their drive to overhaul the entire tort system, it will allow us \nto mitigate Y2K litigation costs while protecting those who have been \nwronged.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7122-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMENDING THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN FOR AID TO KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

As a member of the world community committed to protecting \nand promoting human rights, the Republic of China on Taiwan is deeply \nconcerned about the plight of the Kosovars and hopes to contribute to \nthe reconstruction of their war-torn land. To that end, President Lee \nTung-hui announced on June 7, 1999 that Taiwan will grant $300 million \nin an aid package to the Kosovars. The aid package will consist of the \nfollowing:\n  1. Emergency support for food, shelters, medical care and education, \netc. for Kosovar refugees living in exile in neighboring countries.\n  2. Short-term accommodations for some of the Kosovar refugees in \nTaiwan with opportunities for job training to enable them to be better \nequipped for the restoration of their homeland upon their return.\n  3. Support for the restoration of Kosovo in coordination with \ninternational long-term recovery programs once a peace plan is \nimplemented.\n  I commend the Republic of China on Taiwan for their commitment to \nhumanitarian assistance for these victims of the war in Yugoslavia. \nTheir aid will contribute to the promotion of the peace plan for Kosovo \nand will help the refugees return safety to their homes as soon as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7122-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Goldwater, Deputy \n     Majority Whip in the Maryland House of Delegates, urging \n     members of Congress to strengthen requirements for the \n     appeals processes for plans covered by the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA); and\n       Whereas, In her presentation, Ms. Goldwater noted that it \n     is important to have strong, effective and responsive \n     internal grievance and appeal mechanisms in place; and\n       Whereas, Every state requires managed care entities to have \n     an internal appeals process in place; and\n       Whereas, If it is determined that a federal external \n     appeals process is appropriate, it should be administered by \n     the Federal Government according to rules established by \n     federal law, with states managing those plans under their \n     regulatory authority; and\n       Whereas, Several states have enacted legislation to revise \n     and refine both the internal and external appeals processes; \n     and\n\n[[Page S7127]]\n\n       Whereas, In Maryland, legislation was enacted to strengthen \n     the state's internal grievance and appeals processes, \n     establish an external appeal mechanism and provide additional \n     regulatory authority to the state's insurance commissioner \n     over medical directors in health maintenance organizations; \n     and\n       Whereas, In Florida, the nation's first external review \n     process was created in 1985, and Florida continues to fine \n     tune its process by utilizing a panel of six state employees \n     for the external review process, with explicit time frames \n     from ``extreme emergency'' cases to ``nonurgent'' cases; and\n       Whereas, New Jersey enacted legislation in 1997 that \n     requires health maintenance organizations to establish an \n     external appeal process and now operates a consumer hot line \n     for consumer questions and complaints; and\n       Whereas, Texas enacted landmark legislation in 1998 that \n     permits managed care enrollees to sue their health plans for \n     malpractice in cases where they have been harmed by a plan's \n     decision to delay or deny treatment; and\n       Whereas, According to ``The Best From the States II: The \n     Text of Key State HMO Consumer Protection Provisions'' by \n     Families USA Foundation (October 1998), key consumer \n     protection provisions include the establishment of explicit \n     time frames for appeal of decisions, implementation of \n     methods for expediting the review of emergency and urgent \n     care situations, acceptance of oral appeals and adoption of \n     laws that require reviewers to be health care providers with \n     expertise in the clinical area being reviewed and that \n     prohibits reviewers from participating in the review of \n     cases in which they were involved in the original \n     decisions; and\n       Whereas, On February 9, 1999, in a letter to the editor of \n     the Las Vegas Sun, Marie Soldo, immediate past Chairman of \n     the Nevada Association of Health Plans, wrote that, because \n     the state has limited jurisdiction regarding the regulation \n     of health insurance plans, more than two-thirds of Nevadans, \n     including state and federal employees, Medicare and Medicaid \n     enrollees and others whose employers are self-insured, are \n     not affected by state legislative action such as mandated \n     benefits, improved grievance and appeals processes and the \n     proposed ombudsman office; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges Congress to \n     take steps to ensure that those plans which are exempt from \n     state regulation provide adequate protection provisions for \n     persons covered by such health plans; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-188.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to encourage students, including young women, to pursue \ndemanding careers and higher education degrees in mathematics, science, \nengineering and technology; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will ensure our nation's students, and young women in \nparticular, are encouraged to pursue degrees and careers in math, \nscience, engineering, and technology.\n  Mr. President, if our children are to be prepared for the globally \ncompetitive economy of the next century, they must not only have access \nto the technologies that will dominate the workforce and job market \nthat they will enter--but they should also be encouraged to pursue \ndegrees in the fields that underlie these technologies.\n  We simply cannot ignore that six out of ten new jobs require \ntechnological skills--skills that are seriously lacking in our \nworkforce today. The impact of this technological illiteracy is \ndevastating for our nation's businesses, with an estimated loss in \nproductivity of $30 billion every year, and the inability of companies \nacross the nation to fill an estimated 190,000 technology jobs in mid- \nto large-sized companies. In fact, these very job vacancies led to \nCongress passing legislation last year that increased the number of H1-\nB visas that could be issued to foreign workers to enter the United \nStates.\n  Furthermore, according to a 1994 report by the American School \nCounselors Association, 65 percent of all jobs will require technical \nskills in the year 2000, with 20 percent being professional and only 15 \npercent relying on unskilled labor. In addition, between 1996 and 2006, \nall occupations expect a 14 percent increase in jobs, but Information \nTechnology occupations should jump by 75 percent. As this data implies, \ntoday's students must gain a different knowledge base than past \ngenerations of students if they are to be prepared for, and competitive \nin, the global job market of the 21st Century.\n  Mr. President, even as we should seek to increase student access and \nexposure\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\nto advanced technologies in our nation's schools and classrooms through \nthe E-rate and other programs, we should also seek to increase the \ninterest of our students in the fields that are the backbone of these \ntechnologies: namely, math, science, engineering, and other technology-\nrelated fields. Clearly, if technology will be the cornerstone of the \njob market of the future, then it is vital that our nation's students--\nwho will be tomorrow's workers--be the architects that build that \ncornerstone.\n  Accordingly, the legislation I am offering today is designed to \nensure that our nation's students are encouraged to pursue degrees in \nthese demanding fields. In particular, my legislation will ensure that \nyoung girls--who are currently less likely to enter these fields than \ntheir male counterparts--be encouraged to enter these fields of study.\n  Mr. President, as was highlighted in the American Association of \nUniversity Women report, ``Gender Gaps: Where Schools Still Fail Our \nChildren,'' when compared to boys, girls might be at a significant \ndisadvantage as technology is increasingly incorporated into the \nclassroom. Not only do girls tend to come into the classroom with less \nexposure to computers and other technology, but they also tend to \nbelieve that they are less adept at using technology than boys.\n  In light of these findings, it should come as no surprise that girls \nare dramatically underrepresented in advanced computer science courses \nafter graduation from high school. Furthermore, it should come as no \nsurprise that girls tend to gravitate toward the fields of social \nsciences, health services, and education, while boys disproportionately \ngravitate toward the fields of engineering and business.\n  In fact, data gathered in 1997 on the intended majors of college-\nbound students found that a larger proportion of female than male SAT \ntest-takers intended to major in visual and performing arts, biological \nsciences, education, foreign or classical languages, health and allied \nservices, language and lierature, and the social sciences. In contrast, \na larger portion of boys than girls intended to major in agriculture \nand natural resources, business and commerce, engineering, mathematics, \nand physical sciences.\n  While all of these fields are invaluable--and students should always \nbe encouraged to choose the fields of study and careers that interest \nthem most--I believe it is critical that we ensure students do not balk \nat entering a particular field of study or career simply because it has \ntypically been associated with ``males'' or ``females.'' Instead, all \nstudents should be aware of the multitude of opportunities that are \navailable to them, and encouraged to enter those fields that they find \nof interest.\n  Mr. President, young women should not shy away from technical careers \nsimply because they are more often associated with men--and they should \nnot avoid higher education courses that would give them the knowledge \nand skills they need for these jobs simply because they are more \ntypically taken by young men. Accordingly, my legislation will ensure \nthat fields relying on skills in math, science, engineering, and \ntechnology will be promoted to all students--and especially girls--to \nensure that the numerous opportunities and demands of the job market in \nthe 21st Century are met.\n  Specifically, the ``High Technology for Girls Act'' will expand the \npossible uses of monies provided under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act (ESEA) of 1965 to ensure young women are encouraged to \npursue demanding careers and higher education degrees in mathematics, \nscience, engineering, and technology. As a result, monies provided for \nProfessional Development Activities, the National Teacher Training \nProject, and the Technology for Education programs can be used by \nschools to ensure these fields of study and careers are presented in a \nfavorable manner to all students.\n\n  Of critical importance, schools will be able to use these monies for \nthe development of mentoring programs, model programs, or other \nappropriate programs in partnership with local businesses or \ninstitutions of higher education. As a result, programs will be created \nthat meld the best ideas from educators and the private sector, thereby \nimproving the manner in which these fields are presented and taught--\nand ultimately putting a positive ``face'' on fields that may otherwise \nbe shunned by young women.\n  Mr. President, as Congress moves forward in its effort to reauthorize \nthe ESEA, I believe the provisions contained in this legislation would \nbe a positive and much-needed step toward preparing our students for \nthe jobs of the 21st Century. We cannot afford to let any of our \nnation's students overlook the fields of study that will be the \ncornerstone of the global job market of the future, and my legislation \nwill help ensure that does not happen.\n  Accordingly, I urge that my colleagues support the ``High Technology \nfor Girls Act,'' and look forward to working for its adoption during \nthe consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Burns, \n        Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 1225. A bill to provide for a rural education initiative, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                     rural education initiative act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nEducation Initiative Act. I am very pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Gregg, Conrad, Kerrey, Burns, Hutchinson, and Hagel \nas original cosponsors of this commonsense, bipartisan proposal to help \nrural schools make better use of Federal education dollars. I also want \nto acknowledge the valuable assistance provided by the American \nAssociation of School Administrators in the drafting of this \nlegislation.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act authorizes formula and \ncompetitive grants that allow many of our local school districts to \nimprove the education of their students. These Federal grants support \nefforts to promote such laudable goals as the professional development \nof teachers, the incorporation of technology into the classroom, gifted \nand talented programs and class-size reduction. Schools receive several \ncategorical grants supporting these programs, each with its own \nauthorized activities and regulations and each with its own redtape and \npaperwork. Unfortunately, as valuable as these programs may be for \nthousands of predominantly urban and suburban school districts, they \nsimply do not work well in rural areas.\n  The Rural Education Initiative Act will make these Federal grant \nprograms more flexible in order to help school districts in rural \ncommunities with fewer than 600 students. Six hundred may not sound \nlike many students to some of my colleagues from more populous or urban \nStates, but they may be surprised to learn that more than 35 percent of \nall school districts in the United States have 600 or fewer students. \nIn my State of Maine, 56 percent, or 158 of its 284 school districts, \nhave fewer than 600 students. The two education initiatives contained \nin our legislation will overcome some of the most challenging obstacles \nthat these districts face in participating in Federal education \nprograms.\n  The first rural education initiative deals with four formula grants. \nFormula-driven grants from some education programs simply do not reach \nsmall rural schools in amounts that are sufficient to improve \ncurriculum and teaching in the same way that they do for larger \nsuburban or urban schools.\n  This is because the grants are based on school district enrollment. \nUnfortunately, these individual grants confront smaller schools with a \ndilemma; namely, they simply may not receive enough funding from any \nsingle grant to carry out meaningful activity. Our legislation will \nallow a district to combine the funds from four categorical programs.\n  Under the Rural Education Initiative Act, rural districts will be \npermitted to combine the funds from these programs and use the money to \nsupport reform efforts of their own choice to improve the achievement \nof their students and the quality of the instruction. Instead of \nreceiving grants from four independent programs, each insufficient to \naccomplish the program's objectives, these rural districts will have \nthe flexibility to combine the grants and the\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\ndollars to support locally chosen educational goals.\n  I want to emphasize that the rural initiative I have just described \ndoes not change the level of funding a district receives under these \nformula grant programs. It simply gives these rural districts the \nflexibility they need to use the funds far more effectively.\n  The second rural initiative in our legislation involves several \ncompetitive grant programs that present small rural schools with a \ndifferent problem. Because many rural school districts simply do not \nhave the resources required to hire grant writers and to manage a \ngrant, they are essentially shut out of those programs where grants are \ncompetitively awarded.\n  The Rural Education Initiative Act will give small, rural districts a \nformula grant in lieu of eligibility for the competitive programs of \nthe ESEA. A district will be able to combine this new formula grant \nwith the funds from the regular formula grants and use the combined \nmoneys for any purpose that will improve student achievement or \nteaching quality.\n  Districts might use these funds, for example, to hire a new reading \nor math teacher, to fund important professional development, to offer a \nprogram for gifted and talented students, to purchase high technology, \nor to upgrade a science lab, or to pay for any other activity that \nmeets the district's priorities and needs.\n  Let me give you a specific example of what these two initiatives will \nmean for one Maine school district, School Administrative District 33. \nThis district serves two northern Maine communities, Frenchville and \nSt. Agatha. Each of these communities has about 200 school-age \nchildren. SAD 33 receives four separate formula grants ranging from \nabout $1,900 from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program to $9,500 \nunder the Class Size Reduction Act.\n  You can see the problem right there. The amounts of the grants under \nthese programs are so small that they really are not useful in \naccomplishing the goals of the program. The total received by this \nsmall school district for all four of the programs is just under \n$16,000. But each grant must be applied for separately, used for \ndifferent--and federally mandated--purposes, and accounted for \nindependently.\n  Under our legislation, this school district will be freed from the \nmultiple applications and reports, and it will have $16,000 to use for \nlocally identified education priorities. In addition, since SAD 33 does \nnot have the resources needed to apply for the current competitively \nawarded grant programs, our legislation will allow this school district \nto receive a supplemental formula grant of $34,000. The bottom line is, \nunder my legislation this district will have about $50,000 and the \nflexibility to use these Federal funds to address its most pressing \neducational needs.\n\n  But with this flexibility and additional funding comes \nresponsibility. In return for the advantages and flexibility that our \nlegislation provides, participating districts will be held accountable \nfor demonstrating improved student performance. Each participating \nschool district will be required to administer the same test of its \nchoice annually during the 5-year period of this program. Based on the \nresults of this test, a district will have to show that student \nachievement has improved in order to continue its participation beyond \nthe 5-year period.\n  Since Maine and many other States already administer annual education \nassessments, districts will not incur any significant administrative \nburden in accounting and complying with this accountability provision. \nMore important, the schools will be held responsible for what is really \nimportant, and that is improved student achievement, rather than for \ntime-consuming paperwork in the form of applications and reports.\n  As one rural Maine superintendent told me: ``Give me the resources I \nneed plus the flexibility to use them, and I am happy to be held \naccountable for improved student performance. It will happen.''\n  The Federal Government has an important role to play in improving \neducation in our schools. But it has a supporting role, whereas States \nand communities have the lead role. We must improve our education \nsystem, we must enhance student achievement, without requiring every \nschool in this Nation to adopt a plan designed in Washington and \nwithout imposing burdensome and costly regulations in return for \nFederal assistance.\n  The two initiatives contained in our bill will accomplish those \ngoals. They will allow rural schools to use their own strategies for \nimprovement without the encumbrance of onerous regulations and \nunnecessary paperwork. It is my hope that we will be able to enact this \nimportant and bipartisan legislation this year.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, I join my esteemed colleagues \nSenator Collins and Conrad in introducing the Rural Education \nInitiative Act (REA). This Act represents a bipartisan approach to \naddress the unique needs of 35% of school districts in the United \nStates, specifically small, rural school districts. It does not \nauthorize any new money. Rather, REA amends the Rural Education \nDemonstration Grants under Part J, of Title X, of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act (ESEA) and retains the current ESEA \nauthorization of up to $125 million for rural education programs.\n  Rural school districts are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes \nto both receiving and using federal education funds. They either don't \nreceive enough federal funds to run the program for which the funds are \nallocated or don't receive federal funds for programs for which they \nhave to fill out applications. Small rural school districts rarely \napply for federal competitive grants because they lack the resources \nand expertise required to fill out complicated and time intensive \napplications for federal education grants, which means that rural \nschool districts lose out on millions of federal education dollars each \nyear.\n  The Rural Education Initiative Act addresses both the problem of \nrural school districts' inability to generate enough money under \nfederal formula grants to run a program and the problem of rural school \ndistricts' inability to compete for federal discretionary grants.\n  With regard to federal education formula grants, REA permits rural \nschool districts to merge funds from the President's 100,000 New \nTeachers program and several Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nprograms, specifically Eisenhower Professional Development, Safe and \nDrug Free Schools, Innovative Education Program Strategies. Under REA, \nschool districts can pool funds from these federal education programs \nand use the money for a variety of activities that the district \nbelieves will contribute to improved student achievement.\n  With regard to federal discretionary grants for which rural grants \nhave to compete, the bill stipulates that small rural school districts \nwho decline to apply for federal discretionary grants are eligible to \nreceive money under a rural education formula grant. As a result, \nschool districts would no longer have to go through the application \nprocess to receive federal funds. School districts that had to forgo \napplying for discretionary grants simply because they did not have the \nresources to do so, would no longer be penalized. As with their other \nfederal grant money, a school district would have broad flexibility on \nhow to use funds provided under this new grant to improve student \nachievement and the quality of instruction.\n  A local school district can combine their other formula grant money \nwith this new direct grant to create a large flexible grant at the \nschool district level to: hire a new teacher, purchase a computer, \nprovide professional development, offer advanced placement or \nvocational education courses or just about any other activity that \nwould contribute to increased student achievement and higher quality of \ninstruction.\n  In addition to the aforementioned changes, REA has a strong \naccountability piece. The bill stipulates that rural school districts \nmay only continue to receive the rural education initiative grant and \nhave enormous flexibility over other federal education dollars if in \nfact they can show a marked improvement in student achievement.\n  In conclusion, this bill not only builds momentum for driving more \nfederal dollars directly down to rural school districts but marks an \nimportant sea change in federal education\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\npolicy in that it cedes unprecedented authority to school districts to \nuse federal funds as they see fit, not as the federal government \nprescribes and it links increased flexibility and increased federal \nfunds directly to student achievement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues from Maine, New Hampshire, and Nebraska in introducing the \nRural Education Initiative Act. Over the past five years, Congress and \nthe Administration have significantly increased education funding for \nStates and local school districts. They have also undertaken a number \nof new initiatives in response to educational concerns including Class \nSize Reduction and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program.\n  Unfortunately, rural schools are not benefiting from these new \ninitiatives or from funding increases to the same degree as many urban \nand suburban schools. In fact, on the basis of discussions with \neducators in North Dakota, Federal education laws are discouraging many \nrural schools from making the best use of funds that are currently \nallocated by formula from the Department of Education.\n  The formulas developed to allocate education funding, formulas which \ntake into consideration a number of factors including student \nenrollment, in many cases do not result in sufficient funding to permit \nthe smaller school to most effectively use the funds for local \neducational priorities.\n  Many small, rural schools, for example, don't have the enrollment \nnumbers or special categories of students that result in sufficient \nrevenue under the education formulas to hire a new teacher under the \nClass Size Reduction initiative, or to participate in a more \nspecialized education program like the 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Program.\n  Additionally, these schools are not able to compete as effectively as \nlarger districts for funding under some Department of Education \ncompetitive grant programs. Limited resources do not permit smaller \ndistricts to hire specialists to prepare and submit grant applications. \nIn some cases, the only option for a smaller school district is to form \na consortium with other rural districts to qualify for sufficient \nfunding.\n  No more clearly are the concerns of rural school educators expressed \nthan in a letter that I received from ElRoy Burkle, Superintendent for \nthe Starkweather Public School District, in Starkweather, North Dakota, \na school district with 131 students. In his letter, ElRoy expressed the \ndifficulty that smaller, rural schools are having in accessing Federal \neducation funds.\n  ElRoy remarked, ``. . . school districts have lost their ability to \naccess funds directly, and as a result of forming these consortiums in \norder to access these monies, it is my opinion, we have lost our \nindividual ability to utilize these monies in an effective manner that \nwould be conducive to promoting the educational needs of our individual \nschools.''\n  Mr. President, the Rural Education Initiative Act responds to the \nunique needs of rural school districts by enabling these districts to \nmore fully participate in Department of Education formula and \ncompetitive grant programs.\n  Under Section 4 of the proposed legislation, school districts with \nless than 600 students would be eligible to pool resources from four \nDOE formula programs, and use the funding for quality of instruction or \nstudent achievement priorities determined by the local school district.\n  These programs include the DOE's Class-Size Reduction, Eisenhower \nProfessional Development, Title VI (Innovative Education Strategies), \nand Safe and Drug Free Schools, Title I GOALS 2000, Individuals With \nDisabilities Education, and Impact Aid are not included in this \nlegislation.\n  Additionally, to qualify for funding under the Rural Education \nInitiative Act, a school district would elect not to apply for \ncompetitive grant funding from seven programs including Gifted and \nTalented Children Grants; State and Local Programs for Technology \nResources; 21st Century Community Learning Centers; Grants under the \nFund for the Improvement of Education; Bilingual Education Professional \nDevelopment Grants; Bilingual Education Capacity and Demonstration \nGrants; and Bilingual Education Research, Evaluation, and Dissemination \nGrants.\n  In opting out of these competitive grant programs, the rural school \ndistrict would be entitled to a formula grant, based on student \nenrollment, to use for education reform efforts to improve class \ninstruction and student achievements. The grant amount would be reduced \nby the level of funding received by the School district under the \nformula grant programs outlined in Section 4.\n  To remain in the Rural Education Initiative, school districts, after \nfive years, would be required to assess the academic achievement of \nstudents using a statewide test, or in the case where there is no \nstatewide test, a test selected by the local education agency.\n  Additionally, the Rural Education Initiative Act will not abolish or \nreduce funding for any DOE education program including the eleven grant \nprograms discussed in this initiative.\n  Mr. President, It's very important that we consider the Rural \nEducation Initiative Act as part of the re-authorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act during the 106th Congress. No \nissue is more important for rural America than the future of our \nschools. In North Dakota 86 percent of school districts, 198 schools, \nhave less than 600 students.\n  Additionally, many of these school districts are facing declining \nenrollments. According to the Report Card for North Dakota's Future \n(1998) prepared by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, \nover the past two decades school districts in the State have declined \nfrom 364 to 214, almost 40 percent.\n  This decline in student population is not unique to North Dakota. \nMany other states have a significant percentage of rural school \ndistricts, and many are also experiencing a decline in rural student \npopulation. While the quality of education, including smaller classes, \nin many of these smaller communities remains excellent, the more \nlimited resources of smaller, rural schools, coupled with the declining \nstudent enrollments, pose extraordinarily challenges for rural schools \nacross America.\n  These factors along with current Federal education formulas have \nlimited the ability of smaller districts to take full advantage of \nfederal education grants. In some instances, they have limited \neducational opportunities for students such as distance learning, or \nadvanced academic and vocational courses. Rural schools are unique and \nhave educational needs that are not being met.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the American Association of School \nAdministrators (AASA) for the key role they have played in the \ndevelopment of this rural schools initiative. AASA has a remarkable \nrecord of achievement on behalf of the education community, parents, \nand students. For several years, they have been examining the \ndifficulties that rural schools were experiencing in applying and \nqualifying for Federal education funding. The proposal developed by \nAASA would have a significant impact on almost 200 school districts in \nNorth Dakota.\n  I also want to commend the Organizations Concerned About Rural \nEducation for their efforts on behalf of this initiative, and the \nexemplary work on behalf of other educational issues for rural America.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Collins for taking the lead on this \nimportant education initiative, and I strongly urge the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions to carefully consider this \nlegislation and the educational needs of rural schools during the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. \nBurkle, a summary of the bill, and a description of the rural schools \nformula under the Rural Education Initiative Act, prepared by the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Rural Education Initiative Act\n\n\n                          qualifying districts\n\n       A district eligible to elect to receive its funding through \n     this initiative must have 599 students or fewer and have a \n     Beale Code rating of 6, 7, 8, or 9. The Beale Codes are used\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\n     by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to determine how \n     relatively rural or urban a county is. Beale Codes range from \n     0 to 9, with 0 being most urban and 9 being most rural.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The purpose of this letter is to voice \n     several concerns that are facing rural districts in North \n     Dakota and ask for your assistance as the reauthorization \n     process for various educational legislation is currently \n     being addressed by congress. I currently serve as a shared \n     superintendent for both the Starkweather and Munich Public \n     School Districts. At this particular time these two districts \n     are two independent districts, with the Starkweather District \n     serving 131 students and Munich serving 154 students. Each \n     district covers in excess of 200 square miles.\n       The first issue that I have deals with the recently \n     approved Class-Size Reduction Program. I support the primary \n     legislative intent of this legislation, however, this office \n     disagrees with the way in which the funds can be accessed. \n     Please allow me to explain.\n       This office received information at a recent regional \n     meeting that the allocation for the Starkweather District is \n     $5,003, and $6,020 for Munich. It was also shared that in \n     order to access these funds our individual district \n     allocations must be equal to or greater than the cost of \n     hiring a first-year teacher at our schools. This equates to \n     approximately $23,000. If a school allocation is less than \n     that, the school district can create or join a consortium to \n     access these dollars, so long as the aggregate amount equals \n     or exceeds that cost of a first-year teacher. Therefore, as \n     you can see, the two school districts that I serve would be \n     forced to enter into another consortium in order to obtain \n     these allocated funds through this program.\n       Currently, both the Munich and Starkweather School \n     Districts are members of various consortiums in order to \n     access our federal allocated monies. These consortiums \n     include Title II, Lake Area Carl-Perkins, and Goals 2000. \n     This is in addition to having consortiums for special \n     education and school improvement. My point is that each of my \n     respective school districts have lost their individual \n     ability to access funds directly, and as a direct result of \n     forming these consortiums in order to access our entitled \n     monies, it is of my opinion, we have lost our individual \n     ability to utilize these monies in an effective manner that \n     would be conducive to promoting the educational needs of our \n     individual schools. Let me cite an example of how this loss \n     of effectiveness has occurred for my districts.\n       3. Legislation for rural school districts. Something needs \n     to be done for us. Rural districts with low student \n     enrollments and high square miles have to form consortiums to \n     access federal funds. If legislation were created as cited \n     above, my two districts could better utilize allocated funds \n     and still be in-line with federal education goals.\n       In closing, I understand that it is difficult to write \n     legislation to meet everyone's needs. However, I do believe \n     that we need to address our educational needs as our children \n     deserve the same opportunity as those in larger districts. \n     Our issues may be different, but we all hold the common \n     thread of providing the best education for each child.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration regarding the \n     issues shared. Your office has my permission to share this \n     letter with any individual who may need to review the \n     concerns voiced. Your office may feel free to contact me at \n     the address and telephone provided, or e-mail messages to me \n     at elburkle@sendit.nodak.edu (work) or my home e-mail \n     stburkle@stellarnet.com.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     ElRoy Burkle,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Rural Education \nInitiative introduced by Senator Collins today, and I am pleased to be \na cosponsor of this important piece of legislation.\n  The Rural Education Initiative takes a significant step toward \nensuring that all young people have a shot at the American Dream. It \naddresses an important problem that many rural schools face: Often they \nreceive small amounts of funding for a variety of programs, but they \ndon't have the budget and personnel to develop and sustain multiple \nprograms. Yet they still have students who need our help to raise their \nachievement levels and become productive, successful citizens.\n  The Rural Education Initiative asks us to make a $125 million \ninvestment in rural schools. And it allows small rural districts to \npool funds from a handful of federal programs and target funding in \nthose areas where they see the greatest need and where the funding will \nhave the greatest impact.\n  But this legislation also ensures that districts remain accountable--\nin exchange for increased flexibility, they must demonstrate improved \nperformance.\n  Over 70 percent of Nebraska's school districts are small, rural \ndistricts, as defined by this legislation. Currently Nebraska receives \napproximately $92 million in federal funds for elementary and secondary \neducation. The Rural Education Initiative would increase that \ncontribution by more than $10 million.\n  Mr. President, recently I contacted Jim Havelka, superintendent of \nboth Dodge and Howells Public Schools in Nebraska. Dodge has 175 \nstudents K-12, and Howells has 225 students K-12. I said, ``Jim, what \ndo you need to do a better job of educating your kids?''\n  Jim said, ``You know, it's awfully hard to start a new initiative on \n$900. But if I could pool funds from a few programs, I could hire an \nexperienced instructional technology teacher to help us make even \nbetter use of computer hardware and software that is so crucial in \nimproving learning opportunities for our students. And I could share \nthat instructor with 2 or 3 other schools. Keep Title I, special \neducation, and other major programs intact, but give me a little \nflexibility with a few other programs, and I'll give you results.''\n  Mr. President, I intend to do what I can to help Jim and his students \nproduce results. I believe that in addition to this initiative, we \nshould increase our investment in Title I and in education technology, \nboth of which are especially important to rural schools. I look forward \nto working with Senator Collins and the other cosponsors of this \nlegislation to accomplish these goals as we move this legislation \nthrough Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK:\n  S. 1226. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat interest on indebtedness used to finance the furnishing or sale of \nrate-regulated electric energy or natural gas in the United States \nshall be allocated solely to sources within the United States; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\n ALLOCATION TO SOURCES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON \n INDEBTEDNESS FINANCING RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC ENERGY OR NATURAL GAS \n                       INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to remedy \na problem in the way the U.S. taxes the foreign operations of U.S. \nelectric and gas utilities. With the 1992 passage of the National \nEnergy Policy Act, Congress gave a green light to U.S. utilities \nwishing to do business abroad, lifting a long-standing prohibition. \nU.S. utilities were allowed to compete for the foreign business \nopportunities created by the privatization of national utilities and \nthe need for the construction of facilities to meet increased energy \ndemands abroad.\n  Since 1992, U.S. utility companies have made significant investments \nin utility operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Eastern Europe, \nthe Far East and South America. These investments in foreign utilities \nhave created domestic jobs in the fields of design, architecture, \nengineering, construction, and heavy equipment manufacturing. They also \nallow U.S. utilities an opportunity to diversify and grow.\n  Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes these investments \nby subjecting them to double-taxation. U.S. companies with foreign \noperations receive tax credits for a portion of the taxes they pay to \nforeign countries, to reduce the double-taxation that would otherwise \nresult from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. The size of \nthese foreign tax credits are affected by a number of factors, as U.S. \ntax laws recalculate the amount of foreign income that is recognized \nfor tax credit purposes.\n  Section 864 of the tax code allocates deductible interest expenses \nbetween the U.S. and foreign operations based on the relative book \nvalues of assets located in the U.S. and abroad. By ignoring business \nrealities and the peculiar circumstances of U.S. utilities, this \nallocation rule overtaxes them. Because U.S. utilities were until \nrecently prevented from operating abroad, their foreign plants and \nequipment have been recently-acquired and consequently have not been \nmuch depreciated, in contrast to their domestic assets which are in \nmost cases fully-depreciated. Thus, a disproportionate amount of \ninterest expenses are allocated to foreign income, reducing the foreign \nincome base that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes thus the size of \nthe corresponding foreign tax credits.\n  The allocation rules increase the double-taxation of foreign income \nby reducing foreign tax credits, thereby increasing domestic taxation. \nThe unfairness of this result is magnified by the fact that the \ninterest expenses--which are the reason the foreign tax credit \nshrinks--are usually associated with domestically-regulated debt, which \nis tied to domestic production and is not as fungible as the tax code \nassumes.\n  The result of this economically-irrational taxation scheme is a very \nhigh effective tax rate on certain foreign investment and a loss of \nU.S. foreign tax credits. Rather than face this double-tax penalty, \nsome U.S. utilities have actually chosen not to invest overseas and \nothers have pulled back from their initial investments.\n  One solution to this problem is found in the legislation that I am \nintroducing today. This remedy is to exempt from the interest \nallocation rules of Section 864 the debt associated with a U.S. \nutility's furnishing and sale of electricity or natural gas in the \nUnited States. This proposed rule is similar to the rule governing \n``non-recourse'' debt, which is not subjected to foreign allocation. In \nboth cases, lenders look to specific cash flows for repayment and \nspecific assets as collateral. These loans are thus distinguishable \nfrom the typical risks of general credit lending transactions.\n  The specific cash flow aspect of non-recourse financing is a critical \nelement of the non-recourse debt exception, and logic requires that the \nsame tax treatment should be given to analogous utility debt. Thus, my \nbill would exempt from allocation to foreign source income the interest \non debt incurred in the trade or business of furnishing or selling \nelectricity or natural gas in the United States. The current situation \nis a very real problem that must be remedied, and I urge my colleagues \nto support the solution I am proposing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title IV of the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to provide States with the \noption to allow legal immigrant pregnant women and children to be \neligible for medical assistance under the medical program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          immigrant children's health improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Immigrant \nChildren's Health Improvement Act of 1999. I also want to thank \nSenators McCain, Graham, Mack, Moynihan, and Jeffords for their support \nand cosponsorship of this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\n  In 1996, legal immigrants in this country lost critical public \nbenefits because of changes made under welfare reform. While I \nsupported the underlying goals of welfare reform--self sufficiency and \nindividual responsibility--I continue to believe that the cuts made to \nimmigrants' benefits as part of the 1996 reforms were unwarranted. \nWhile some of those cuts were reversed in 1997 and again in 1998, we \nstill have a long way to improve the lives of the millions of \nimmigrants who are legally in this country. The Immigrant Children's \nHealth Improvement Act is one small but important step toward this \ngoal.\n  While cash benefits such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and \nfood stamps are critical to the well-being of low-income immigrants, \naccess to health care is their largest concern. Immigrants who were \nlegally in the country before the enactment of the welfare reform \nlegislation are still eligible for Medicaid. However, those \nimmigrants--including children and pregnant women--who arrived after \nAugust 22, 1996, the enactment date of the welfare bill, are barred for \nfive years from receiving health benefits under Medicaid or the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). While these individuals \nmay still get emergency medical care, they are ineligible for the basic \nmedical services that may reduce the need for such emergency care. This \nmakes no sense.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would fix this problem by \ngiving states the option to lift the five-year bar for pregnant women \nand children, allowing this narrow group of legal immigrants to receive \nhealth care services under either SCHIP or Medicaid. I want to \nemphasize that this legislation does not require states to cover these \nimmigrant children--it merely allows the state to do so if it chooses. \nThis approach is consistent with Congress' shift toward more state \nflexibility and will provide needed relief to states, such as Rhode \nIsland, with high immigrant populations.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important \nmeasure. I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1227\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nChafee, Mack, McCain, and Moynihan, to introduce the Immigrant Children \nHealth Improvement Act of 1999. I believe that these efforts are \nnecessary in order to guarantee a healthy generation of children.\n  This legislation is simple. It provides states the option to provide \nhealth care coverage to legal immigrant children through Medicaid and \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--in essence \neliminating the arbitrary designation of August 22, 1996 as the cutoff \ndate for benefits eligibility to children. The welfare reform \nlegislation passed in 1996 prohibits states from covering these \nimmigrant children during their first five years in the United States. \nThis prohibition has serious consequences.\n  Children without health insurance do not get important care for \npreventable diseases. Many uninsured children are hospitalized for \nacute asthma attacks that could have been prevented, or suffer from \npermanent hearing loss from untreated ear infections. Without adequate \nhealth care, common illnesses can turn into life-long crippling \ndisease, whereas appropriate treatment and care can help children with \ndiseases like diabetes live relatively normal lives. A lack of adequate \nmedical care will also hinder the social and educational development of \nchildren, as children who are sick and left untreated are less ready to \nlearn.\n  In addition to allowing extended coverage of legal immigrant \nchildren, this initiative aims to provide Medicaid to legal immigrant \npregnant women who are also barred from receiving services as a result \nof the 1996 welfare reform law.\n  This legislation attempts to diminish the arbitrary cutoff date used \nin the 1996 welfare law to determine the eligibility of legal \nimmigrants to benefits they desperately need. Our nation was built by \npeople who came to our shores seeking opportunity and a better life, \nand America has greatly benefitted from the talent, resourcefulness, \ndetermination, and work ethic of many generations of legal immigrants. \nTime and time again, they have restored our faith in the American \nDream. We should not discriminate between these important members of \nour community based on nothing more than an arbitrary date.\n  As our nation enters what promises to be a dynamic century, the \nUnited States needs a prudent, fair immigration policy to ensure that \navenues of refuge and opportunity remain open for those seeking \nfreedom, justice, and a better life.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague Senator \nChafee in introducing the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act \nof 1999. This legislation would help provide access to health care \nthrough the\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nMedicaid system for pregnant women and children who are legal \nimmigrants.\n  In 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act making \ncritical reforms to our nation's welfare system. This greatly needed \npiece of legislation is dramatically improving our nation's welfare \nsystem by requiring able-bodied welfare recipients to work and \nencouraging individuals to become self-sufficient.\n  As my colleagues know, the welfare reform law limits most means-\ntested benefits for legal residents who are not citizens. The specific \nprovision affecting these benefits is based on the principle that those \nwho immigrate to this nation pledge to be self-sufficient, and should \ncomply with that agreement. However, I have been concerned that this \nprovision is having a negative impact on a vulnerable segment of our \npopulation, children and pregnant women.\n  My concern is not new. While Congress was considering this \nlegislation, I raised concerns regarding several provisions which could \nhave negative impact on certain vulnerable populations including \nchildren, pregnant women, the elderly and disabled. I believe our \nnation has a responsibility to provide assistance, when necessary, to \nour most vulnerable citizens, regardless of whether they were born here \nor in another country. I am pleased that Congress has addressed many of \nthese concerns and implemented a number of changes to the 1996 welfare \nreform law. However, my concern for the pregnant women and children who \nare legal immigrants but were not protected by the changes implemented \nsince 1996 still remains.\n  The consequences of lack of insurance are problematic for everyone, \nbut they are particularly serious for children. Uninsured and low \nincome children are less likely to receive vital primary and \npreventative care services. This is quite discouraging since it is \nrepeatedly demonstrated that regular health care visits facilitate the \ncontinuity of care which plays a critical role in the development of a \nhealthy child. For example, one analysis found that children living in \nfamilies with incomes below the poverty line were more likely to go \nwithout a physician visit than those with Medicaid coverage or those \nwith other insurance. The result is many uninsured, low-income children \nnot seeking health care services until they are seriously sick. These \ndismal consequences of lack of access to quality health care also have \ndisastrous impacts on pregnant women and their unborn children.\n  Studies have further demonstrated that many of these children are \nmore likely to be hospitalized or receive their care in emergency \nrooms, which means higher health care costs for conditions that could \nhave been treated with appropriate outpatient services or prevented \nthrough regular checkups. Receiving the appropriate prenatal care is \nessential for the health delivery and development for the unborn child \nwhich can help stave off future, more costly health care needs.\n  Under our bill, states would be given the option to allow legal \nimmigrant children and pregnant women to have access to medical \nservices under the Medicaid program. Again, let me reiterate--this is \ncompletely optional for the states and is not mandatory This bill would \nprovide our states with the flexibility to address the health care \nneeds of some of our most vulnerable--our children and pregnant women.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to cosponsor the \nImmigrant Children's Health Improvement Act of 1999, introduced by my \ngood friend and colleague Senator Chafee. We are joined by our \ncolleagues Senators McCain, Jeffords, and Mack, and by Senator Graham, \nwho has long been a leader on this issue.\n  This bill includes three provisions which are part of the Fairness \nfor Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 (S. 792), which I introduced, along \nwith Senator Graham, on April 14th of this year. They would restore \nhealth coverage to legal immigrants--mostly children--whose eligibility \nfor benefits is denied to them by the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. It is a crucial step we should \ntake. I will continue to work to move forward the broader Fairness for \nLegal Immigrants Act as well because it contains important provisions \nto prevent hunger and help the elderly and disabled.\n  The Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act would: Permit states \nto provide Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal immigrant children; \npermit states to provide Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal \nimmigrant pregnant women; and permit states to provide coverage under \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to all eligible legal \nimmigrant children.\n  Note that these provisions are optional. There are no mandates in \nthis bill. It would merely allow states to take common sense steps to \naid legal immigrant children.\n  The problem is that under current law, states are not allowed to \nextend such health care coverage--which is so important for the \ndevelopment of healthy children--to families who have come to the U.S. \nafter August 22, 1996, until the families have been here for five \nyears. Five years is a very long time in the life of a child. Such a \nbar makes little sense for them, and is nonsensical for pregnant women. \nIt is common knowledge that access to health care is essential for \nearly childhood development. We should, at a minimum, permit states to \nextend coverage to all poor legal immigrant children, no matter when \nthey have arrived here. Let me emphasize that under the 1996 law, \nstates cannot use federal funds for this--and we are restoring this \noption to them. This builds upon our recent achievements in promoting \nhealth care for children--legal immigrant children should not be \nneglected in these efforts.\n  The provisions of that 1996 law concerning legal immigrants were \nbased on the false premise that immigrants are a financial burden to \nAmerican taxpayers. On the contrary. A recent comprehensive study by \nthe National Academy of Sciences concluded that immigration actually \nbenefits the U.S. economy. In fact, the study found that the average \nlegal immigrant contributes $1,800 more in taxes than he or she \nreceives in government benefits.\n  Many Americans may not realize this, but legal immigrants pay income \nand payroll taxes. And without continued legal immigration, the long-\nterm financial condition of Social Security and Medicare would be \nworsened. According to the most recent Social Security trustees report, \na decline in net immigration of 150,000 per year will reduce payroll \ntax revenues and require a 0.1% payroll tax increase to replace.\n  It is in our interest to see that these immigrant families have \nhealthy children. And it is not merely wise, it is just. These \nimmigrants have come here under the rules we have established and they \nhave abided by those rules.\n  The 1996 law did grevious harm to the safety net for immigrants. Some \nstates have begun their own efforts--without federal funding--to assist \nimmigrants to make up the difference. Yet a new Urban Institute study \nconcluded that ``[d]espite the federal benefit restorations and the \nmany states that have chosen to assist immigrants, the social safety \nnet for immigrants remains weaker than before welfare reform and \nnoncitizens generally have less access to assistance than citizens.'' \nThe Urban study also notes that ``[b]y barring many immigrants from \nfederal assistance, the federal government shifted costs to states, \nmany of which already bore a fiscal burden for providing assistance to \nimmigrants.'' We in Washington should do our fair share.\n  Mr. President, simple decency requires us to continue to provide a \nmeasure of a safety net to legal immigrant families. I urge the \nenactment of this legislation to ensure that we do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Conrad):\n  S. 1228. A bill to provide for the development, use, and enforcement \nof a system for labeling violent content in audio and visual media \nproducts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  MEDIA VIOLENCE LABELING ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in \nintroducing the 21st Century Media Responsibility Act. This bill would \nestablish a uniform product labeling system for violent\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\ncontent by requiring the manufacturers of motion pictures, video \nprograms, interactive video games, and music recording products, \nprovide plain-English labels on product packages and advertising so \nthat parents can make informed purchasing decisions.\n  The most basic and profound responsibility that our culture--any \nculture--has, is raising its children. We are failing that \nresponsibility, and the extent of our failure is being measured in the \ndeaths, and injuries of our kids in the schoolyard and on the streets \nof our neighborhoods and communities.\n  Primary responsibility lies with families. As a country, we are not \nparenting our children. This is our job, our paramount responsibility, \nand most unfortunately, we are failing. We must get our priorities \nstraight, and that means putting our kids first.\n  However, parents need help, because our homes and our families--our \nchildren's minds, are being flooded by a tide of violence. this \ndehumanizing violence pervades our society: our movies depict graphic \nviolence; our children are taught to kill and maim by interactive video \ngames; much of the music that inundates our children's lives delivers \nmessages of hate and violence. Our culture is dominated by media, and \nour children, more so than any generation before them, is vulnerable to \nthe images of violence that, unfortunately, are dominant themes in so \nmuch of what they see, and hear.\n  It is beyond debate that exposure to media violence is harmful to \nchildren. Study after scientific study, beginning with the Surgeon \nGeneral's report in the early 1970's, has established this. Certainly, \nthere is a hard consensus in our society that something must be done. \nWhat this bill makes clear is that the manufacturers and producers of \nthese consumer products should have a legal responsibility to provide \nplain-english so that parents can make truly informed decisions about \nwhat their children consume.\n  This is not a rating system. It is a labeling system. it is not \ncensorship. We are not talking about limiting free speech. Rather, we \nare talking about providing content labels on highly sophisticated, \nhighly targeted, and highly promoted consumer products. This is common \nsense.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ndistinguished colleague and friend, the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator McCain, and my colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, in introducing legislation that we believe will move us another \nstep forward in ameliorating the culture of violence surrounding our \nchildren, and in helping parents protect their kids from harm.\n  This is a problem that has been much on our minds in the wake of the \nschool massacre in Littleton and the other tragic shootings that \npreceded it, a series of events which has continued to reverberate \nthrough the national consciousness, which has in particular heightened \nour awareness as a nation to the violent images and messages bombarding \nour children, and which has in turn spurred a renewed debate about the \nentertainment media's contributing role in the epidemic of youth \nviolence we are experiencing across the nation, not just in suburban \nschools but on the streets and in homes in every community.\n  We made an initial attempt to respond to this problem through the \njuvenile justice bill that the Senate recently passed, and I believe it \nwas a good start. Senator McCain and I joined Senators Brownback and \nHatch in cosponsoring a bipartisan amendment that would, among other \nthings, authorize an investigation of the entertainment industry's \nmarketing practices to determine the extent to which they are targeting \nthe sale of ultraviolent, adult-rated products directly to kids.\n  This amendment, which was approved unanimously, would also facilitate \nthe development of stronger codes of conduct for the various \nentertainment media and thereby encourage them to accept greater \nresponsibility for the products they distribute.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the 21st Century Media \nResponsibility Act, would build on that initial response and \nsignificantly improve our efforts in the future to limit children's \nsuccess to inappropriate and potentially harmful products.\n  Specifically, it calls for the creation of a uniform labeling system \nfor violent entertainment media products, to provide parents with \nclear, easy-to-understand warnings about the amount and degree of \nviolence contained in the movies, music, television shows, and video \ngames that are being mass-marketed today. Beyond that, it would require \nthe businesses where these products are sold or distributed--the movie \ntheaters, record and software stores, and rental outlets--to strictly \nenforce these new ratings, and thus prohibit children from buying or \nrenting material that is meant for adults and may pose a risk to kids.\n  This proposal is premised in many respects on our concerted efforts \nto keep cigarettes out of the hands of minors, and with good reason. As \nwith tobacco, decades of research have shown definitively that media \nviolence can be seriously harmful to children, that heavy, sustained \nexposure to violent images, particularly those that glamorize murder \nand mayhem and that fail to show any consequences, tends to desensitize \nyoung viewers and increase the potential they will become violent \nthemselves. As with tobacco, and its mascot Joe Camel, we are beginning \nto see substantial evidence indicating that the entertainment industry \nis not satisfied with mass marketing mass murder, but that it is \nactually targeting products to children that the producers themselves \nadmit are not appropriate for minors.\n  And as with tobacco, we are seeking to change the behavior of a \nmulti-billion dollar industry that too often seems locked in deep \ndenial, that has shown little inclination to acknowledge there is a \nproblem with its products, let alone work with us to find reasonable \nsolutions to reduce the threat of media violence to children.\n  Of course, there are differences between the tobacco and \nentertainment industries and the products they make. Cigarettes are \nfilled with physical substances that have been proven to cause cancer \nin longtime smokers. Violent entertainment products have a less visible \nand physical effect on longtime viewers and listeners, and, more \nsignificantly, they are forms of speech that enjoy protection under the \nFirst Amendment.\n  It is because of our devotion to the First Amendment that Senator \nMcCain and I, along with many other concerned critics, have been \nreluctant to call for government restrictions on the content of movies, \nmusic, television and video games. All along, we have urged \nentertainment industry leaders to police themselves, to draw lines and \nset higher standards, to balance their right to free expression with \ntheir responsibilities to the larger community to which they belong. We \nrepeated these pleas with a new sense of urgency in the days following \nthe shooting at Columbine High School, asking the most influential \nmedia voices to attend the White House summit meeting the President \nconvened and to engage in open dialogue about what all of us can do to \nreduce the likelihood of another Littleton.\n  And there has been a smattering of encouraging responses emanating \nfrom the entertainment media. For example, the Interactive Digital \nSoftware Association, which represents the video game manufacturers, \nhas acknowledged that the grotesque and perverse violence used in some \nadvertisements crosses the line, and it is reexamining its marketing \ncode to respond to some of the concerns we have raised. Disney for its \npart announced that it would no longer house violent coin-operated \nvideo games in its amusement parks. The National Association of Theater \nOwners pledged to tighten the enforcement of its policies restricting \nthe access of children to R-rated movies. And several prominent \nscreenwriters, speaking at a recent forum sponsored by the Writers \nGuild of America, raised concerns about the level of violence in \ntoday's movies and called on the industry to rethink its fascination \nwith murder and mayhem.\n  But overall the silence from the men and women who make the decisions \nthat shape our culture has been deafening, their denials extremely \ndisappointing. Not one CEO from the major entertainment conglomerates--\nSony, Disney, Seagram, Time Warner, Viacom, and Fox--accepted the \nPresident's invitation to attend the White House summit meeting. And \nsince\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nthen, not one has made a statement accepting some responsibility for \nthe culture of violence surrounding our children, or indicating their \nwillingness to address their part of the lethal mix that is turning \nkids into killers. What we have heard, from Seagram's Edgar Bronfman \nand Time Warner's Gerald Levin and Viacom's Sumner Redstone, are more \nshrill denials and diversions, along with attacks on those of us in \nCongress who are concerned about what they are doing to our country and \nour kids.\n  This is the responsibility vacuum in which we are operating, and this \nis the vacuum we are trying to fill with the legislation we are \nintroducing today. Ideally, our bill would be unnecessary. Ideally, the \nvarious segments of the entertainment industry would agree to adopt and \nimplement a set of common-sense, uniform standards that would provide \nfor clear and concise labeling of media products, that would prohibit \nthe marketing and sales of adult-rated products to children, and that \nwould hold producers or retail outlets that violate the code \naccountable for their irresponsibility. But there is no sign that is \ngoing to happen any time soon, which is why we feel compelled to go \nforward with this proposal today.\n  We are not advocating censorship, or placing restrictions on the kind \nof entertainment products that can be made and sold commercially. What \nwe are doing through this bill is treating violent media like tobacco \nand other products that pose risks to children, requiring producers to \nprovide explicit warnings to parents about potentially harmful content, \nand requiring retailers to take reasonable steps to limit the \navailability of adult-rated products with high doses of violence to \naudiences for which they are designed. That is why we have chosen to \namend the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, to accentuate \nthe fact that we are not regulating artistic expression but the \nmarketing and distribution of commercial products, and that we are not \ncriminalizing speech, but demanding truth in labeling and enforcement.\n  If a video game company is telling parents a game is not appropriate \nfor children under 17, then parents should have a realistic expectation \nthat this game will not be marketed or sold to that audience. \nUnfortunately, that is often not the case these days, and we would \ncorrect that by authorizing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate \nand punish retailers and rental outlets and movie theaters that in \neffect deceive parents about the products they are selling or renting \nto their kids. Specifically, it would authorize the FTC to levy fines \nof up to $10,000 per violation of the act's provisions prohibiting the \nsale or rental of adult-rated products to children.\n  This bill does not just respond to concerns of today, but anticipates \nthe media landscape of tomorrow. According to most experts, as \ntechnologies converge over the next few years, more and more of our \nentertainment is going to be delivered through a single wire into the \nhome over the Internet. In this radically different universe, it only \nmakes sense to modernize the ratings concept to fit the new contours of \nthe Information Age, and develop a standard labeling system for the \nvideo, audio, and interactive games we will consume through a common \nportal. Our legislation will move us in that direction and prod the \nentertainment industry to help parents meet the new challenges of this \nnew era, and hopefully usher in a new ethic of media responsibility, a \ngoal that is reflected in the bill's title.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to make clear that I do not \nconsider this legislation to be ``the'' answer to the threat of media \nviolence or the solution to repairing our culture. It won't \nsinglehandedly stop media standards from falling, or substitute for \nindustry self-restraint. No one bill or combination of laws could \nreplace the exercise of corporate citizenship, particularly given our \nrespect for the First Amendment. We must continue to push the \nentertainment industry to embrace its responsibilities. But this bill \nis a common-sense, forward looking response that will in fact help \nreduce the harmful influences reaching our children and thereby reduce \nthe risk of youth violence. That makes it more than worthwhile, and I \nask my colleagues to join us in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 1229. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to permit a State to register a foreign pesticide for \ndistribution and use within that State; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud sponsor of this \npesticide harmonization legislation. As many of you are aware, there \nare a number of trade imbalances facing the agricultural industry.\n  In my home State of Montana and many other western and mid-western \nstates, trade imbalances occur primarily between Canada and the United \nStates. However, disparities occur between the United States and many \nforeign countries.\n  One of those trade imbalances is pesticide harmonization, which is a \nserious issue for American farmers. There are numerous disparities \nbetween chemicals and pesticides that are allowed in foreign countries \nand those that are allowed here in the United States.\n  In many cases a chemical will have the identical chemical structure \nin both countries but be named and priced differently. Why should an \nAmerican producer be expected to pay twice the amount for an identical \nchemical available in a foreign country for less?\n  In order for free trade to truly occur, this issue must be addressed. \nFarmers have dealt with several years of depressed prices with no \nimmediate end in sight. To compound the economic crunch American \nfarmers are feeling, American agricultural producers must pay nearly \ntwice the amount that foreign producers pay in their country for nearly \nthe same chemical.\n  This leads to a huge disparity between the break-even price on crop \nproduction between foreign and American farmers, and gives foreign \nproducers an unfair advantage. It is unfair for American producers to \npay twice the amount for pesticides and chemicals as many of our \ntrading partners.\n  Furthermore, it is against the law for American producers to purchase \nan identical chemical in a foreign country and bring it across the \nborder. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must be held \naccountable to American producers and assure that producers have the \nsame advantages in this country in regards to pesticides and chemicals \nthat foreign producers enjoy.\n  My bill assures that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will \nbe held accountable to domestic agricultural producers. Primarily, it \nmandates that the EPA give mutual recognition to the same chemical \nstructures, on both existing and new products, in the United States and \ncompeting foreign countries.\n  It does this by several provisions. First, it permits any \nagricultural individual or group, within a state, to put forth a \nrequest through the State Ag Commissioner (Head of the Department of \nAgriculture) to the EPA to register chemicals with substantially \nsimilar make-up to those registered in a foreign country.\n  Within 60 days of receiving that request the EPA would be held \nresponsible to either accept or deny that request. They must then give \nthe same recognition to American producers for chemical structures that \nare substantially similar to cheaper products available in competing \nforeign countries.\n  Additionally, my bill will ensure that the Administrator of the EPA \nwill take into account both NAFTA and the Canada/U.S. Trade Agreement, \nin making these determinations.\n  These provisions will level the pricing structure by making sure that \nchemicals with the same (or substantially similar) structures are \npriced fairly in the United States.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue \nto American farmers and ranchers.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1230.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Electric \nVehicle Consumer Incentive Tax Act of 1999'' to\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\nprovide new incentives and extend previous ones to spark the zero \nemission vehicle market. This legislation is similar to previous bills \nthat I have introduced in the 104th and 105th Congresses.\n  I am pleased to see that already the market for electric vehicles is \nemerging. All major domestic automakers and most of foreign automakers \nhave zero emission vehicles in the market. However, we still need to \nprovide tax incentives to help lower the cost of the new technology \nvehicles. Despite the what appears to be a new understanding from our \nautomakers that they must begin to produce environmentally friendly \nvehicles, the costs of these new generation of vehicles are still steep \nfor most Americans.\n  The need to decrease automobile pollution is still critical. Since \n1970, total U.S. population increased 31 percent and vehicle miles \ntraveled--that's our best measure of vehicle use--increased 127 \npercent. During that time, emissions for most of the key pollutants \nhave decreased from the introduction of new technologies. But we are \nstill failing to meet air quality standards in many areas. In fact, the \nemissions of one key pollutant--nitrogen oxides--actually increased 11 \npercent from 1970 to 1997. Nitrogen oxides, produced largely from \nautomobile fuel combustion, is the building block for smog. About 107 \nmillion Americans were residing in counties that did not meet the air \nquality standards for at least one of the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards pollutants in 1997.\n  These emissions still produce profound and troubling impacts on the \nhealth of Americans, particularly the young.\n  That is why I believe Congress should help and encourage Americans to \npurchase or lease zero emission vehicles. Electric vehicles, which \nproduce no pollution from their engines, will not become the preferred \nautomobile for all Americans, but for many it can become the preferred \ncommuter vehicle or city car. Electric vehicles can also help state and \nlocal governments, and private fleet operators, meet new and future air \nquality requirements.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say that previous provisions of my \nclean fuel vehicle legislation have become law. The lowering of the \nexcise tax on liquified natural gas will help spur the market for that \nfuel for heavy duty vehicles. The repeal of the luxury tax on electric \nvehicles also helps remove or lessen market barriers. But more needs to \nbe done. That is why I have introduced the ``Electric Vehicle Consumer \nIncentive Tax Act of 1999.'' U.S. Representative Mac Collins of Georgia \nhas introduced the companion bill in the House, H.R. 1108.\n  The bill provides four major incentives. First, it removes the \ngovernmental use restrictions for electric vehicles. At present, the \nInternal Revenue Code prohibits any tax credit taken for property (in \nthis case electric vehicles) used by the United States or any state or \nlocal government. Removing this bar will encourage the leasing of \nelectric vehicles for state and local use. By removing restriction on \ngovernmental use of electric vehicles, owners of electric vehicle \nfleets could ``pass on'' any cost savings from tax credits to the \ngovernment.\n  Second, the bill makes large electric trucks, vans, and buses \neligible for the same tax deduction available now for other clean-fuel \nvehicles under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Large electric trucks, \nvans and buses currently are limited to the maximum tax credit of \n$4,000 under the Code. Other clean-fuel vehicles, however, may receive \na $50,000 tax deduction. This section of the bill would remove the \nunfair distinction between large electric and other large clean-fuel \nvehicles. Each would qualify for the tax deduction incentive which \nwould serve to promote the greatest use of clean-fuel vehicles. The \nbill would end the tax credit for large electric vehicles and provide a \ntax deduction instead.\n  Third, the bill provides a flat $4,000 tax credit on the purchase of \nan electric vehicle. Under current law, electric vehicles are eligible \nunder the Code for a 10 percent tax credit for the cost of qualified \nelectric vehicles, up to a maximum of $4,000. The bill would modify \nthat section to provide for a flat $4,000 tax credit (rather than 10 \npercent of the purchase price up to $4,000) in order to maximize the \ntax incentive.\n  Fourth, the bill extends the sunset period for the tax credit. \nCurrent law phases out the electric vehicle tax credit beginning in the \nyear 2002. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 anticipated that electric \nvehicles would be available commercially in 1992. The first electric \nvehicles were not available to the public until 1997. All major \nautomakers now have electric vehicles on the market. However, that \nmarket is still very small. Therefore, the bill extends the phase out \nfor four years with the credit sunsetting December 31, 2008, instead of \nDecember 31, 2004. The phase out provisions are conformed by amending \nthe Code to provide that the credit will be phased out, at a 25 percent \nannual cumulative rate, for each of the three years preceding \ntermination.\n  I believe these provisions can provide important market incentives \nfor Americans to purchase automobiles that do not contribute to urban \nsmog or other pollution and at a modest cost in reduced Federal taxes. \nI ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this legislation and \nmaking way for a clean fuel future in the 21st Century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to encourage students, including young women, to pursue \ndemanding careers and higher education degrees in mathematics, science, \nengineering and technology; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will ensure our nation's students, and young women in \nparticular, are encouraged to pursue degrees and careers in math, \nscience, engineering, and technology.\n  Mr. President, if our children are to be prepared for the globally \ncompetitive economy of the next century, they must not only have access \nto the technologies that will dominate the workforce and job market \nthat they will enter--but they should also be encouraged to pursue \ndegrees in the fields that underlie these technologies.\n  We simply cannot ignore that six out of ten new jobs require \ntechnological skills--skills that are seriously lacking in our \nworkforce today. The impact of this technological illiteracy is \ndevastating for our nation's businesses, with an estimated loss in \nproductivity of $30 billion every year, and the inability of companies \nacross the nation to fill an estimated 190,000 technology jobs in mid- \nto large-sized companies. In fact, these very job vacancies led to \nCongress passing legislation last year that increased the number of H1-\nB visas that could be issued to foreign workers to enter the United \nStates.\n  Furthermore, according to a 1994 report by the American School \nCounselors Association, 65 percent of all jobs will require technical \nskills in the year 2000, with 20 percent being professional and only 15 \npercent relying on unskilled labor. In addition, between 1996 and 2006, \nall occupations expect a 14 percent increase in jobs, but Information \nTechnology occupations should jump by 75 percent. As this data implies, \ntoday's students must gain a different knowledge base than past \ngenerations of students if they are to be prepared for, and competitive \nin, the global job market of the 21st Century.\n  Mr. President, even as we should seek to increase student access and \nexposure\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\nto advanced technologies in our nation's schools and classrooms through \nthe E-rate and other programs, we should also seek to increase the \ninterest of our students in the fields that are the backbone of these \ntechnologies: namely, math, science, engineering, and other technology-\nrelated fields. Clearly, if technology will be the cornerstone of the \njob market of the future, then it is vital that our nation's students--\nwho will be tomorrow's workers--be the architects that build that \ncornerstone.\n  Accordingly, the legislation I am offering today is designed to \nensure that our nation's students are encouraged to pursue degrees in \nthese demanding fields. In particular, my legislation will ensure that \nyoung girls--who are currently less likely to enter these fields than \ntheir male counterparts--be encouraged to enter these fields of study.\n  Mr. President, as was highlighted in the American Association of \nUniversity Women report, ``Gender Gaps: Where Schools Still Fail Our \nChildren,'' when compared to boys, girls might be at a significant \ndisadvantage as technology is increasingly incorporated into the \nclassroom. Not only do girls tend to come into the classroom with less \nexposure to computers and other technology, but they also tend to \nbelieve that they are less adept at using technology than boys.\n  In light of these findings, it should come as no surprise that girls \nare dramatically underrepresented in advanced computer science courses \nafter graduation from high school. Furthermore, it should come as no \nsurprise that girls tend to gravitate toward the fields of social \nsciences, health services, and education, while boys disproportionately \ngravitate toward the fields of engineering and business.\n  In fact, data gathered in 1997 on the intended majors of college-\nbound students found that a larger proportion of female than male SAT \ntest-takers intended to major in visual and performing arts, biological \nsciences, education, foreign or classical languages, health and allied \nservices, language and lierature, and the social sciences. In contrast, \na larger portion of boys than girls intended to major in agriculture \nand natural resources, business and commerce, engineering, mathematics, \nand physical sciences.\n  While all of these fields are invaluable--and students should always \nbe encouraged to choose the fields of study and careers that interest \nthem most--I believe it is critical that we ensure students do not balk \nat entering a particular field of study or career simply because it has \ntypically been associated with ``males'' or ``females.'' Instead, all \nstudents should be aware of the multitude of opportunities that are \navailable to them, and encouraged to enter those fields that they find \nof interest.\n  Mr. President, young women should not shy away from technical careers \nsimply because they are more often associated with men--and they should \nnot avoid higher education courses that would give them the knowledge \nand skills they need for these jobs simply because they are more \ntypically taken by young men. Accordingly, my legislation will ensure \nthat fields relying on skills in math, science, engineering, and \ntechnology will be promoted to all students--and especially girls--to \nensure that the numerous opportunities and demands of the job market in \nthe 21st Century are met.\n  Specifically, the ``High Technology for Girls Act'' will expand the \npossible uses of monies provided under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act (ESEA) of 1965 to ensure young women are encouraged to \npursue demanding careers and higher education degrees in mathematics, \nscience, engineering, and technology. As a result, monies provided for \nProfessional Development Activities, the National Teacher Training \nProject, and the Technology for Education programs can be used by \nschools to ensure these fields of study and careers are presented in a \nfavorable manner to all students.\n\n  Of critical importance, schools will be able to use these monies for \nthe development of mentoring programs, model programs, or other \nappropriate programs in partnership with local businesses or \ninstitutions of higher education. As a result, programs will be created \nthat meld the best ideas from educators and the private sector, thereby \nimproving the manner in which these fields are presented and taught--\nand ultimately putting a positive ``face'' on fields that may otherwise \nbe shunned by young women.\n  Mr. President, as Congress moves forward in its effort to reauthorize \nthe ESEA, I believe the provisions contained in this legislation would \nbe a positive and much-needed step toward preparing our students for \nthe jobs of the 21st Century. We cannot afford to let any of our \nnation's students overlook the fields of study that will be the \ncornerstone of the global job market of the future, and my legislation \nwill help ensure that does not happen.\n  Accordingly, I urge that my colleagues support the ``High Technology \nfor Girls Act,'' and look forward to working for its adoption during \nthe consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Burns, \n        Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 1225. A bill to provide for a rural education initiative, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                     rural education initiative act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nEducation Initiative Act. I am very pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Gregg, Conrad, Kerrey, Burns, Hutchinson, and Hagel \nas original cosponsors of this commonsense, bipartisan proposal to help \nrural schools make better use of Federal education dollars. I also want \nto acknowledge the valuable assistance provided by the American \nAssociation of School Administrators in the drafting of this \nlegislation.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act authorizes formula and \ncompetitive grants that allow many of our local school districts to \nimprove the education of their students. These Federal grants support \nefforts to promote such laudable goals as the professional development \nof teachers, the incorporation of technology into the classroom, gifted \nand talented programs and class-size reduction. Schools receive several \ncategorical grants supporting these programs, each with its own \nauthorized activities and regulations and each with its own redtape and \npaperwork. Unfortunately, as valuable as these programs may be for \nthousands of predominantly urban and suburban school districts, they \nsimply do not work well in rural areas.\n  The Rural Education Initiative Act will make these Federal grant \nprograms more flexible in order to help school districts in rural \ncommunities with fewer than 600 students. Six hundred may not sound \nlike many students to some of my colleagues from more populous or urban \nStates, but they may be surprised to learn that more than 35 percent of \nall school districts in the United States have 600 or fewer students. \nIn my State of Maine, 56 percent, or 158 of its 284 school districts, \nhave fewer than 600 students. The two education initiatives contained \nin our legislation will overcome some of the most challenging obstacles \nthat these districts face in participating in Federal education \nprograms.\n  The first rural education initiative deals with four formula grants. \nFormula-driven grants from some education programs simply do not reach \nsmall rural schools in amounts that are sufficient to improve \ncurriculum and teaching in the same way that they do for larger \nsuburban or urban schools.\n  This is because the grants are based on school district enrollment. \nUnfortunately, these individual grants confront smaller schools with a \ndilemma; namely, they simply may not receive enough funding from any \nsingle grant to carry out meaningful activity. Our legislation will \nallow a district to combine the funds from four categorical programs.\n  Under the Rural Education Initiative Act, rural districts will be \npermitted to combine the funds from these programs and use the money to \nsupport reform efforts of their own choice to improve the achievement \nof their students and the quality of the instruction. Instead of \nreceiving grants from four independent programs, each insufficient to \naccomplish the program's objectives, these rural districts will have \nthe flexibility to combine the grants and the\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\ndollars to support locally chosen educational goals.\n  I want to emphasize that the rural initiative I have just described \ndoes not change the level of funding a district receives under these \nformula grant programs. It simply gives these rural districts the \nflexibility they need to use the funds far more effectively.\n  The second rural initiative in our legislation involves several \ncompetitive grant programs that present small rural schools with a \ndifferent problem. Because many rural school districts simply do not \nhave the resources required to hire grant writers and to manage a \ngrant, they are essentially shut out of those programs where grants are \ncompetitively awarded.\n  The Rural Education Initiative Act will give small, rural districts a \nformula grant in lieu of eligibility for the competitive programs of \nthe ESEA. A district will be able to combine this new formula grant \nwith the funds from the regular formula grants and use the combined \nmoneys for any purpose that will improve student achievement or \nteaching quality.\n  Districts might use these funds, for example, to hire a new reading \nor math teacher, to fund important professional development, to offer a \nprogram for gifted and talented students, to purchase high technology, \nor to upgrade a science lab, or to pay for any other activity that \nmeets the district's priorities and needs.\n  Let me give you a specific example of what these two initiatives will \nmean for one Maine school district, School Administrative District 33. \nThis district serves two northern Maine communities, Frenchville and \nSt. Agatha. Each of these communities has about 200 school-age \nchildren. SAD 33 receives four separate formula grants ranging from \nabout $1,900 from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program to $9,500 \nunder the Class Size Reduction Act.\n  You can see the problem right there. The amounts of the grants under \nthese programs are so small that they really are not useful in \naccomplishing the goals of the program. The total received by this \nsmall school district for all four of the programs is just under \n$16,000. But each grant must be applied for separately, used for \ndifferent--and federally mandated--purposes, and accounted for \nindependently.\n  Under our legislation, this school district will be freed from the \nmultiple applications and reports, and it will have $16,000 to use for \nlocally identified education priorities. In addition, since SAD 33 does \nnot have the resources needed to apply for the current competitively \nawarded grant programs, our legislation will allow this school district \nto receive a supplemental formula grant of $34,000. The bottom line is, \nunder my legislation this district will have about $50,000 and the \nflexibility to use these Federal funds to address its most pressing \neducational needs.\n\n  But with this flexibility and additional funding comes \nresponsibility. In return for the advantages and flexibility that our \nlegislation provides, participating districts will be held accountable \nfor demonstrating improved student performance. Each participating \nschool district will be required to administer the same test of its \nchoice annually during the 5-year period of this program. Based on the \nresults of this test, a district will have to show that student \nachievement has improved in order to continue its participation beyond \nthe 5-year period.\n  Since Maine and many other States already administer annual education \nassessments, districts will not incur any significant administrative \nburden in accounting and complying with this accountability provision. \nMore important, the schools will be held responsible for what is really \nimportant, and that is improved student achievement, rather than for \ntime-consuming paperwork in the form of applications and reports.\n  As one rural Maine superintendent told me: ``Give me the resources I \nneed plus the flexibility to use them, and I am happy to be held \naccountable for improved student performance. It will happen.''\n  The Federal Government has an important role to play in improving \neducation in our schools. But it has a supporting role, whereas States \nand communities have the lead role. We must improve our education \nsystem, we must enhance student achievement, without requiring every \nschool in this Nation to adopt a plan designed in Washington and \nwithout imposing burdensome and costly regulations in return for \nFederal assistance.\n  The two initiatives contained in our bill will accomplish those \ngoals. They will allow rural schools to use their own strategies for \nimprovement without the encumbrance of onerous regulations and \nunnecessary paperwork. It is my hope that we will be able to enact this \nimportant and bipartisan legislation this year.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, I join my esteemed colleagues \nSenator Collins and Conrad in introducing the Rural Education \nInitiative Act (REA). This Act represents a bipartisan approach to \naddress the unique needs of 35% of school districts in the United \nStates, specifically small, rural school districts. It does not \nauthorize any new money. Rather, REA amends the Rural Education \nDemonstration Grants under Part J, of Title X, of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act (ESEA) and retains the current ESEA \nauthorization of up to $125 million for rural education programs.\n  Rural school districts are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes \nto both receiving and using federal education funds. They either don't \nreceive enough federal funds to run the program for which the funds are \nallocated or don't receive federal funds for programs for which they \nhave to fill out applications. Small rural school districts rarely \napply for federal competitive grants because they lack the resources \nand expertise required to fill out complicated and time intensive \napplications for federal education grants, which means that rural \nschool districts lose out on millions of federal education dollars each \nyear.\n  The Rural Education Initiative Act addresses both the problem of \nrural school districts' inability to generate enough money under \nfederal formula grants to run a program and the problem of rural school \ndistricts' inability to compete for federal discretionary grants.\n  With regard to federal education formula grants, REA permits rural \nschool districts to merge funds from the President's 100,000 New \nTeachers program and several Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nprograms, specifically Eisenhower Professional Development, Safe and \nDrug Free Schools, Innovative Education Program Strategies. Under REA, \nschool districts can pool funds from these federal education programs \nand use the money for a variety of activities that the district \nbelieves will contribute to improved student achievement.\n  With regard to federal discretionary grants for which rural grants \nhave to compete, the bill stipulates that small rural school districts \nwho decline to apply for federal discretionary grants are eligible to \nreceive money under a rural education formula grant. As a result, \nschool districts would no longer have to go through the application \nprocess to receive federal funds. School districts that had to forgo \napplying for discretionary grants simply because they did not have the \nresources to do so, would no longer be penalized. As with their other \nfederal grant money, a school district would have broad flexibility on \nhow to use funds provided under this new grant to improve student \nachievement and the quality of instruction.\n  A local school district can combine their other formula grant money \nwith this new direct grant to create a large flexible grant at the \nschool district level to: hire a new teacher, purchase a computer, \nprovide professional development, offer advanced placement or \nvocational education courses or just about any other activity that \nwould contribute to increased student achievement and higher quality of \ninstruction.\n  In addition to the aforementioned changes, REA has a strong \naccountability piece. The bill stipulates that rural school districts \nmay only continue to receive the rural education initiative grant and \nhave enormous flexibility over other federal education dollars if in \nfact they can show a marked improvement in student achievement.\n  In conclusion, this bill not only builds momentum for driving more \nfederal dollars directly down to rural school districts but marks an \nimportant sea change in federal education\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\npolicy in that it cedes unprecedented authority to school districts to \nuse federal funds as they see fit, not as the federal government \nprescribes and it links increased flexibility and increased federal \nfunds directly to student achievement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues from Maine, New Hampshire, and Nebraska in introducing the \nRural Education Initiative Act. Over the past five years, Congress and \nthe Administration have significantly increased education funding for \nStates and local school districts. They have also undertaken a number \nof new initiatives in response to educational concerns including Class \nSize Reduction and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program.\n  Unfortunately, rural schools are not benefiting from these new \ninitiatives or from funding increases to the same degree as many urban \nand suburban schools. In fact, on the basis of discussions with \neducators in North Dakota, Federal education laws are discouraging many \nrural schools from making the best use of funds that are currently \nallocated by formula from the Department of Education.\n  The formulas developed to allocate education funding, formulas which \ntake into consideration a number of factors including student \nenrollment, in many cases do not result in sufficient funding to permit \nthe smaller school to most effectively use the funds for local \neducational priorities.\n  Many small, rural schools, for example, don't have the enrollment \nnumbers or special categories of students that result in sufficient \nrevenue under the education formulas to hire a new teacher under the \nClass Size Reduction initiative, or to participate in a more \nspecialized education program like the 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Program.\n  Additionally, these schools are not able to compete as effectively as \nlarger districts for funding under some Department of Education \ncompetitive grant programs. Limited resources do not permit smaller \ndistricts to hire specialists to prepare and submit grant applications. \nIn some cases, the only option for a smaller school district is to form \na consortium with other rural districts to qualify for sufficient \nfunding.\n  No more clearly are the concerns of rural school educators expressed \nthan in a letter that I received from ElRoy Burkle, Superintendent for \nthe Starkweather Public School District, in Starkweather, North Dakota, \na school district with 131 students. In his letter, ElRoy expressed the \ndifficulty that smaller, rural schools are having in accessing Federal \neducation funds.\n  ElRoy remarked, ``. . . school districts have lost their ability to \naccess funds directly, and as a result of forming these consortiums in \norder to access these monies, it is my opinion, we have lost our \nindividual ability to utilize these monies in an effective manner that \nwould be conducive to promoting the educational needs of our individual \nschools.''\n  Mr. President, the Rural Education Initiative Act responds to the \nunique needs of rural school districts by enabling these districts to \nmore fully participate in Department of Education formula and \ncompetitive grant programs.\n  Under Section 4 of the proposed legislation, school districts with \nless than 600 students would be eligible to pool resources from four \nDOE formula programs, and use the funding for quality of instruction or \nstudent achievement priorities determined by the local school district.\n  These programs include the DOE's Class-Size Reduction, Eisenhower \nProfessional Development, Title VI (Innovative Education Strategies), \nand Safe and Drug Free Schools, Title I GOALS 2000, Individuals With \nDisabilities Education, and Impact Aid are not included in this \nlegislation.\n  Additionally, to qualify for funding under the Rural Education \nInitiative Act, a school district would elect not to apply for \ncompetitive grant funding from seven programs including Gifted and \nTalented Children Grants; State and Local Programs for Technology \nResources; 21st Century Community Learning Centers; Grants under the \nFund for the Improvement of Education; Bilingual Education Professional \nDevelopment Grants; Bilingual Education Capacity and Demonstration \nGrants; and Bilingual Education Research, Evaluation, and Dissemination \nGrants.\n  In opting out of these competitive grant programs, the rural school \ndistrict would be entitled to a formula grant, based on student \nenrollment, to use for education reform efforts to improve class \ninstruction and student achievements. The grant amount would be reduced \nby the level of funding received by the School district under the \nformula grant programs outlined in Section 4.\n  To remain in the Rural Education Initiative, school districts, after \nfive years, would be required to assess the academic achievement of \nstudents using a statewide test, or in the case where there is no \nstatewide test, a test selected by the local education agency.\n  Additionally, the Rural Education Initiative Act will not abolish or \nreduce funding for any DOE education program including the eleven grant \nprograms discussed in this initiative.\n  Mr. President, It's very important that we consider the Rural \nEducation Initiative Act as part of the re-authorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act during the 106th Congress. No \nissue is more important for rural America than the future of our \nschools. In North Dakota 86 percent of school districts, 198 schools, \nhave less than 600 students.\n  Additionally, many of these school districts are facing declining \nenrollments. According to the Report Card for North Dakota's Future \n(1998) prepared by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, \nover the past two decades school districts in the State have declined \nfrom 364 to 214, almost 40 percent.\n  This decline in student population is not unique to North Dakota. \nMany other states have a significant percentage of rural school \ndistricts, and many are also experiencing a decline in rural student \npopulation. While the quality of education, including smaller classes, \nin many of these smaller communities remains excellent, the more \nlimited resources of smaller, rural schools, coupled with the declining \nstudent enrollments, pose extraordinarily challenges for rural schools \nacross America.\n  These factors along with current Federal education formulas have \nlimited the ability of smaller districts to take full advantage of \nfederal education grants. In some instances, they have limited \neducational opportunities for students such as distance learning, or \nadvanced academic and vocational courses. Rural schools are unique and \nhave educational needs that are not being met.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the American Association of School \nAdministrators (AASA) for the key role they have played in the \ndevelopment of this rural schools initiative. AASA has a remarkable \nrecord of achievement on behalf of the education community, parents, \nand students. For several years, they have been examining the \ndifficulties that rural schools were experiencing in applying and \nqualifying for Federal education funding. The proposal developed by \nAASA would have a significant impact on almost 200 school districts in \nNorth Dakota.\n  I also want to commend the Organizations Concerned About Rural \nEducation for their efforts on behalf of this initiative, and the \nexemplary work on behalf of other educational issues for rural America.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Collins for taking the lead on this \nimportant education initiative, and I strongly urge the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions to carefully consider this \nlegislation and the educational needs of rural schools during the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. \nBurkle, a summary of the bill, and a description of the rural schools \nformula under the Rural Education Initiative Act, prepared by the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Rural Education Initiative Act\n\n\n                          qualifying districts\n\n       A district eligible to elect to receive its funding through \n     this initiative must have 599 students or fewer and have a \n     Beale Code rating of 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The purpose of this letter is to voice \n     several concerns that are facing rural districts in North \n     Dakota and ask for your assistance as the reauthorization \n     process for various educational legislation is currently \n     being addressed by congress. I currently serve as a shared \n     superintendent for both the Starkweather and Munich Public \n     School Districts. At this particular time these two districts \n     are two independent districts, with the Starkweather District \n     serving 131 students and Munich serving 154 students. Each \n     district covers in excess of 200 square miles.\n       The first issue that I have deals with the recently \n     approved Class-Size Reduction Program. I support the primary \n     legislative intent of this legislation, however, this office \n     disagrees with the way in which the funds can be accessed. \n     Please allow me to explain.\n       This office received information at a recent regional \n     meeting that the allocation for the Starkweather District is \n     $5,003, and $6,020 for Munich. It was also shared that in \n     order to access these funds our individual district \n     allocations must be equal to or greater than the cost of \n     hiring a first-year teacher at our schools. This equates to \n     approximately $23,000. If a school allocation is less than \n     that, the school district can create or join a consortium to \n     access these dollars, so long as the aggregate amount equals \n     or exceeds that cost of a first-year teacher. Therefore, as \n     you can see, the two school districts that I serve would be \n     forced to enter into another consortium in order to obtain \n     these allocated funds through this program.\n       Currently, both the Munich and Starkweather School \n     Districts are members of various consortiums in order to \n     access our federal allocated monies. These consortiums \n     include Title II, Lake Area Carl-Perkins, and Goals 2000. \n     This is in addition to having consortiums for special \n     education and school improvement. My point is that each of my \n     respective school districts have lost their individual \n     ability to access funds directly, and as a direct result of \n     forming these consortiums in order to access our entitled \n     monies, it is of my opinion, we have lost our individual \n     ability to utilize these monies in an effective manner that \n     would be conducive to promoting the educational needs of our \n     individual schools. Let me cite an example of how this loss \n     of effectiveness has occurred for my districts.\n       3. Legislation for rural school districts. Something needs \n     to be done for us. Rural districts with low student \n     enrollments and high square miles have to form consortiums to \n     access federal funds. If legislation were created as cited \n     above, my two districts could better utilize allocated funds \n     and still be in-line with federal education goals.\n       In closing, I understand that it is difficult to write \n     legislation to meet everyone's needs. However, I do believe \n     that we need to address our educational needs as our children \n     deserve the same opportunity as those in larger districts. \n     Our issues may be different, but we all hold the common \n     thread of providing the best education for each child.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration regarding the \n     issues shared. Your office has my permission to share this \n     letter with any individual who may need to review the \n     concerns voiced. Your office may feel free to contact me at \n     the address and telephone provided, or e-mail messages to me \n     at elburkle@sendit.nodak.edu (work) or my home e-mail \n     stburkle@stellarnet.com.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     ElRoy Burkle,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Rural Education \nInitiative introduced by Senator Collins today, and I am pleased to be \na cosponsor of this important piece of legislation.\n  The Rural Education Initiative takes a significant step toward \nensuring that all young people have a shot at the American Dream. It \naddresses an important problem that many rural schools face: Often they \nreceive small amounts of funding for a variety of programs, but they \ndon't have the budget and personnel to develop and sustain multiple \nprograms. Yet they still have students who need our help to raise their \nachievement levels and become productive, successful citizens.\n  The Rural Education Initiative asks us to make a $125 million \ninvestment in rural schools. And it allows small rural districts to \npool funds from a handful of federal programs and target funding in \nthose areas where they see the greatest need and where the funding will \nhave the greatest impact.\n  But this legislation also ensures that districts remain accountable--\nin exchange for increased flexibility, they must demonstrate improved \nperformance.\n  Over 70 percent of Nebraska's school districts are small, rural \ndistricts, as defined by this legislation. Currently Nebraska receives \napproximately $92 million in federal funds for elementary and secondary \neducation. The Rural Education Initiative would increase that \ncontribution by more than $10 million.\n  Mr. President, recently I contacted Jim Havelka, superintendent of \nboth Dodge and Howells Public Schools in Nebraska. Dodge has 175 \nstudents K-12, and Howells has 225 students K-12. I said, ``Jim, what \ndo you need to do a better job of educating your kids?''\n  Jim said, ``You know, it's awfully hard to start a new initiative on \n$900. But if I could pool funds from a few programs, I could hire an \nexperienced instructional technology teacher to help us make even \nbetter use of computer hardware and software that is so crucial in \nimproving learning opportunities for our students. And I could share \nthat instructor with 2 or 3 other schools. Keep Title I, special \neducation, and other major programs intact, but give me a little \nflexibility with a few other programs, and I'll give you results.''\n  Mr. President, I intend to do what I can to help Jim and his students \nproduce results. I believe that in addition to this initiative, we \nshould increase our investment in Title I and in education technology, \nboth of which are especially important to rural schools. I look forward \nto working with Senator Collins and the other cosponsors of this \nlegislation to accomplish these goals as we move this legislation \nthrough Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK:\n  S. 1226. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat interest on indebtedness used to finance the furnishing or sale of \nrate-regulated electric energy or natural gas in the United States \nshall be allocated solely to sources within the United States; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\n ALLOCATION TO SOURCES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON \n INDEBTEDNESS FINANCING RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC ENERGY OR NATURAL GAS \n                       INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to remedy \na problem in the way the U.S. taxes the foreign operations of U.S. \nelectric and gas utilities. With the 1992 passage of the National \nEnergy Policy Act, Congress gave a green light to U.S. utilities \nwishing to do business abroad, lifting a long-standing prohibition. \nU.S. utilities were allowed to compete for the foreign business \nopportunities created by the privatization of national utilities and \nthe need for the construction of facilities to meet increased energy \ndemands abroad.\n  Since 1992, U.S. utility companies have made significant investments \nin utility operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Eastern Europe, \nthe Far East and South America. These investments in foreign utilities \nhave created domestic jobs in the fields of design, architecture, \nengineering, construction, and heavy equipment manufacturing. They also \nallow U.S. utilities an opportunity to diversify and grow.\n  Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes these investments \nby subjecting them to double-taxation. U.S. companies with foreign \noperations receive tax credits for a portion of the taxes they pay to \nforeign countries, to reduce the double-taxation that would otherwise \nresult from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. The size of \nthese foreign tax credits are affected by a number of factors, as U.S. \ntax laws recalculate the amount of foreign income that is recognized \nfor tax credit purposes.\n  Section 864 of the tax code allocates deductible interest expenses \nbetween the U.S. and foreign operations based on the relative book \nvalues of assets located in the U.S. and abroad. By ignoring business \nrealities and the peculiar circumstances of U.S. utilities, this \nallocation rule overtaxes them. Because U.S. utilities were until \nrecently prevented from operating abroad, their foreign plants and \nequipment have been recently-acquired and consequently have not been \nmuch depreciated, in contrast to their domestic assets which are in \nmost cases fully-depreciated. Thus, a disproportionate amount of \ninterest expenses are allocated to foreign income, reducing the foreign \nincome base that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes thus the size of \nthe corresponding foreign tax credits.\n  The allocation rules increase the double-taxation of foreign income \nby reducing foreign tax credits, thereby increasing domestic taxation. \nThe unfairness of this result is magnified by the fact that the \ninterest expenses--which are the reason the foreign tax credit \nshrinks--are usually associated with domestically-regulated debt, which \nis tied to domestic production and is not as fungible as the tax code \nassumes.\n  The result of this economically-irrational taxation scheme is a very \nhigh effective tax rate on certain foreign investment and a loss of \nU.S. foreign tax credits. Rather than face this double-tax penalty, \nsome U.S. utilities have actually chosen not to invest overseas and \nothers have pulled back from their initial investments.\n  One solution to this problem is found in the legislation that I am \nintroducing today. This remedy is to exempt from the interest \nallocation rules of Section 864 the debt associated with a U.S. \nutility's furnishing and sale of electricity or natural gas in the \nUnited States. This proposed rule is similar to the rule governing \n``non-recourse'' debt, which is not subjected to foreign allocation. In \nboth cases, lenders look to specific cash flows for repayment and \nspecific assets as collateral. These loans are thus distinguishable \nfrom the typical risks of general credit lending transactions.\n  The specific cash flow aspect of non-recourse financing is a critical \nelement of the non-recourse debt exception, and logic requires that the \nsame tax treatment should be given to analogous utility debt. Thus, my \nbill would exempt from allocation to foreign source income the interest \non debt incurred in the trade or business of furnishing or selling \nelectricity or natural gas in the United States. The current situation \nis a very real problem that must be remedied, and I urge my colleagues \nto support the solution I am proposing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title IV of the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to provide States with the \noption to allow legal immigrant pregnant women and children to be \neligible for medical assistance under the medical program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          immigrant children's health improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Immigrant \nChildren's Health Improvement Act of 1999. I also want to thank \nSenators McCain, Graham, Mack, Moynihan, and Jeffords for their support \nand cosponsorship of this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\n  In 1996, legal immigrants in this country lost critical public \nbenefits because of changes made under welfare reform. While I \nsupported the underlying goals of welfare reform--self sufficiency and \nindividual responsibility--I continue to believe that the cuts made to \nimmigrants' benefits as part of the 1996 reforms were unwarranted. \nWhile some of those cuts were reversed in 1997 and again in 1998, we \nstill have a long way to improve the lives of the millions of \nimmigrants who are legally in this country. The Immigrant Children's \nHealth Improvement Act is one small but important step toward this \ngoal.\n  While cash benefits such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and \nfood stamps are critical to the well-being of low-income immigrants, \naccess to health care is their largest concern. Immigrants who were \nlegally in the country before the enactment of the welfare reform \nlegislation are still eligible for Medicaid. However, those \nimmigrants--including children and pregnant women--who arrived after \nAugust 22, 1996, the enactment date of the welfare bill, are barred for \nfive years from receiving health benefits under Medicaid or the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). While these individuals \nmay still get emergency medical care, they are ineligible for the basic \nmedical services that may reduce the need for such emergency care. This \nmakes no sense.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would fix this problem by \ngiving states the option to lift the five-year bar for pregnant women \nand children, allowing this narrow group of legal immigrants to receive \nhealth care services under either SCHIP or Medicaid. I want to \nemphasize that this legislation does not require states to cover these \nimmigrant children--it merely allows the state to do so if it chooses. \nThis approach is consistent with Congress' shift toward more state \nflexibility and will provide needed relief to states, such as Rhode \nIsland, with high immigrant populations.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important \nmeasure. I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1227\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nChafee, Mack, McCain, and Moynihan, to introduce the Immigrant Children \nHealth Improvement Act of 1999. I believe that these efforts are \nnecessary in order to guarantee a healthy generation of children.\n  This legislation is simple. It provides states the option to provide \nhealth care coverage to legal immigrant children through Medicaid and \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--in essence \neliminating the arbitrary designation of August 22, 1996 as the cutoff \ndate for benefits eligibility to children. The welfare reform \nlegislation passed in 1996 prohibits states from covering these \nimmigrant children during their first five years in the United States. \nThis prohibition has serious consequences.\n  Children without health insurance do not get important care for \npreventable diseases. Many uninsured children are hospitalized for \nacute asthma attacks that could have been prevented, or suffer from \npermanent hearing loss from untreated ear infections. Without adequate \nhealth care, common illnesses can turn into life-long crippling \ndisease, whereas appropriate treatment and care can help children with \ndiseases like diabetes live relatively normal lives. A lack of adequate \nmedical care will also hinder the social and educational development of \nchildren, as children who are sick and left untreated are less ready to \nlearn.\n  In addition to allowing extended coverage of legal immigrant \nchildren, this initiative aims to provide Medicaid to legal immigrant \npregnant women who are also barred from receiving services as a result \nof the 1996 welfare reform law.\n  This legislation attempts to diminish the arbitrary cutoff date used \nin the 1996 welfare law to determine the eligibility of legal \nimmigrants to benefits they desperately need. Our nation was built by \npeople who came to our shores seeking opportunity and a better life, \nand America has greatly benefitted from the talent, resourcefulness, \ndetermination, and work ethic of many generations of legal immigrants. \nTime and time again, they have restored our faith in the American \nDream. We should not discriminate between these important members of \nour community based on nothing more than an arbitrary date.\n  As our nation enters what promises to be a dynamic century, the \nUnited States needs a prudent, fair immigration policy to ensure that \navenues of refuge and opportunity remain open for those seeking \nfreedom, justice, and a better life.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague Senator \nChafee in introducing the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act \nof 1999. This legislation would help provide access to health care \nthrough the\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nMedicaid system for pregnant women and children who are legal \nimmigrants.\n  In 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act making \ncritical reforms to our nation's welfare system. This greatly needed \npiece of legislation is dramatically improving our nation's welfare \nsystem by requiring able-bodied welfare recipients to work and \nencouraging individuals to become self-sufficient.\n  As my colleagues know, the welfare reform law limits most means-\ntested benefits for legal residents who are not citizens. The specific \nprovision affecting these benefits is based on the principle that those \nwho immigrate to this nation pledge to be self-sufficient, and should \ncomply with that agreement. However, I have been concerned that this \nprovision is having a negative impact on a vulnerable segment of our \npopulation, children and pregnant women.\n  My concern is not new. While Congress was considering this \nlegislation, I raised concerns regarding several provisions which could \nhave negative impact on certain vulnerable populations including \nchildren, pregnant women, the elderly and disabled. I believe our \nnation has a responsibility to provide assistance, when necessary, to \nour most vulnerable citizens, regardless of whether they were born here \nor in another country. I am pleased that Congress has addressed many of \nthese concerns and implemented a number of changes to the 1996 welfare \nreform law. However, my concern for the pregnant women and children who \nare legal immigrants but were not protected by the changes implemented \nsince 1996 still remains.\n  The consequences of lack of insurance are problematic for everyone, \nbut they are particularly serious for children. Uninsured and low \nincome children are less likely to receive vital primary and \npreventative care services. This is quite discouraging since it is \nrepeatedly demonstrated that regular health care visits facilitate the \ncontinuity of care which plays a critical role in the development of a \nhealthy child. For example, one analysis found that children living in \nfamilies with incomes below the poverty line were more likely to go \nwithout a physician visit than those with Medicaid coverage or those \nwith other insurance. The result is many uninsured, low-income children \nnot seeking health care services until they are seriously sick. These \ndismal consequences of lack of access to quality health care also have \ndisastrous impacts on pregnant women and their unborn children.\n  Studies have further demonstrated that many of these children are \nmore likely to be hospitalized or receive their care in emergency \nrooms, which means higher health care costs for conditions that could \nhave been treated with appropriate outpatient services or prevented \nthrough regular checkups. Receiving the appropriate prenatal care is \nessential for the health delivery and development for the unborn child \nwhich can help stave off future, more costly health care needs.\n  Under our bill, states would be given the option to allow legal \nimmigrant children and pregnant women to have access to medical \nservices under the Medicaid program. Again, let me reiterate--this is \ncompletely optional for the states and is not mandatory This bill would \nprovide our states with the flexibility to address the health care \nneeds of some of our most vulnerable--our children and pregnant women.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to cosponsor the \nImmigrant Children's Health Improvement Act of 1999, introduced by my \ngood friend and colleague Senator Chafee. We are joined by our \ncolleagues Senators McCain, Jeffords, and Mack, and by Senator Graham, \nwho has long been a leader on this issue.\n  This bill includes three provisions which are part of the Fairness \nfor Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 (S. 792), which I introduced, along \nwith Senator Graham, on April 14th of this year. They would restore \nhealth coverage to legal immigrants--mostly children--whose eligibility \nfor benefits is denied to them by the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. It is a crucial step we should \ntake. I will continue to work to move forward the broader Fairness for \nLegal Immigrants Act as well because it contains important provisions \nto prevent hunger and help the elderly and disabled.\n  The Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act would: Permit states \nto provide Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal immigrant children; \npermit states to provide Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal \nimmigrant pregnant women; and permit states to provide coverage under \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to all eligible legal \nimmigrant children.\n  Note that these provisions are optional. There are no mandates in \nthis bill. It would merely allow states to take common sense steps to \naid legal immigrant children.\n  The problem is that under current law, states are not allowed to \nextend such health care coverage--which is so important for the \ndevelopment of healthy children--to families who have come to the U.S. \nafter August 22, 1996, until the families have been here for five \nyears. Five years is a very long time in the life of a child. Such a \nbar makes little sense for them, and is nonsensical for pregnant women. \nIt is common knowledge that access to health care is essential for \nearly childhood development. We should, at a minimum, permit states to \nextend coverage to all poor legal immigrant children, no matter when \nthey have arrived here. Let me emphasize that under the 1996 law, \nstates cannot use federal funds for this--and we are restoring this \noption to them. This builds upon our recent achievements in promoting \nhealth care for children--legal immigrant children should not be \nneglected in these efforts.\n  The provisions of that 1996 law concerning legal immigrants were \nbased on the false premise that immigrants are a financial burden to \nAmerican taxpayers. On the contrary. A recent comprehensive study by \nthe National Academy of Sciences concluded that immigration actually \nbenefits the U.S. economy. In fact, the study found that the average \nlegal immigrant contributes $1,800 more in taxes than he or she \nreceives in government benefits.\n  Many Americans may not realize this, but legal immigrants pay income \nand payroll taxes. And without continued legal immigration, the long-\nterm financial condition of Social Security and Medicare would be \nworsened. According to the most recent Social Security trustees report, \na decline in net immigration of 150,000 per year will reduce payroll \ntax revenues and require a 0.1% payroll tax increase to replace.\n  It is in our interest to see that these immigrant families have \nhealthy children. And it is not merely wise, it is just. These \nimmigrants have come here under the rules we have established and they \nhave abided by those rules.\n  The 1996 law did grevious harm to the safety net for immigrants. Some \nstates have begun their own efforts--without federal funding--to assist \nimmigrants to make up the difference. Yet a new Urban Institute study \nconcluded that ``[d]espite the federal benefit restorations and the \nmany states that have chosen to assist immigrants, the social safety \nnet for immigrants remains weaker than before welfare reform and \nnoncitizens generally have less access to assistance than citizens.'' \nThe Urban study also notes that ``[b]y barring many immigrants from \nfederal assistance, the federal government shifted costs to states, \nmany of which already bore a fiscal burden for providing assistance to \nimmigrants.'' We in Washington should do our fair share.\n  Mr. President, simple decency requires us to continue to provide a \nmeasure of a safety net to legal immigrant families. I urge the \nenactment of this legislation to ensure that we do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Conrad):\n  S. 1228. A bill to provide for the development, use, and enforcement \nof a system for labeling violent content in audio and visual media \nproducts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  MEDIA VIOLENCE LABELING ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in \nintroducing the 21st Century Media Responsibility Act. This bill would \nestablish a uniform product labeling system for violent\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\ncontent by requiring the manufacturers of motion pictures, video \nprograms, interactive video games, and music recording products, \nprovide plain-English labels on product packages and advertising so \nthat parents can make informed purchasing decisions.\n  The most basic and profound responsibility that our culture--any \nculture--has, is raising its children. We are failing that \nresponsibility, and the extent of our failure is being measured in the \ndeaths, and injuries of our kids in the schoolyard and on the streets \nof our neighborhoods and communities.\n  Primary responsibility lies with families. As a country, we are not \nparenting our children. This is our job, our paramount responsibility, \nand most unfortunately, we are failing. We must get our priorities \nstraight, and that means putting our kids first.\n  However, parents need help, because our homes and our families--our \nchildren's minds, are being flooded by a tide of violence. this \ndehumanizing violence pervades our society: our movies depict graphic \nviolence; our children are taught to kill and maim by interactive video \ngames; much of the music that inundates our children's lives delivers \nmessages of hate and violence. Our culture is dominated by media, and \nour children, more so than any generation before them, is vulnerable to \nthe images of violence that, unfortunately, are dominant themes in so \nmuch of what they see, and hear.\n  It is beyond debate that exposure to media violence is harmful to \nchildren. Study after scientific study, beginning with the Surgeon \nGeneral's report in the early 1970's, has established this. Certainly, \nthere is a hard consensus in our society that something must be done. \nWhat this bill makes clear is that the manufacturers and producers of \nthese consumer products should have a legal responsibility to provide \nplain-english so that parents can make truly informed decisions about \nwhat their children consume.\n  This is not a rating system. It is a labeling system. it is not \ncensorship. We are not talking about limiting free speech. Rather, we \nare talking about providing content labels on highly sophisticated, \nhighly targeted, and highly promoted consumer products. This is common \nsense.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ndistinguished colleague and friend, the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator McCain, and my colleague from North Dakota, Senator \nConrad, in introducing legislation that we believe will move us another \nstep forward in ameliorating the culture of violence surrounding our \nchildren, and in helping parents protect their kids from harm.\n  This is a problem that has been much on our minds in the wake of the \nschool massacre in Littleton and the other tragic shootings that \npreceded it, a series of events which has continued to reverberate \nthrough the national consciousness, which has in particular heightened \nour awareness as a nation to the violent images and messages bombarding \nour children, and which has in turn spurred a renewed debate about the \nentertainment media's contributing role in the epidemic of youth \nviolence we are experiencing across the nation, not just in suburban \nschools but on the streets and in homes in every community.\n  We made an initial attempt to respond to this problem through the \njuvenile justice bill that the Senate recently passed, and I believe it \nwas a good start. Senator McCain and I joined Senators Brownback and \nHatch in cosponsoring a bipartisan amendment that would, among other \nthings, authorize an investigation of the entertainment industry's \nmarketing practices to determine the extent to which they are targeting \nthe sale of ultraviolent, adult-rated products directly to kids.\n  This amendment, which was approved unanimously, would also facilitate \nthe development of stronger codes of conduct for the various \nentertainment media and thereby encourage them to accept greater \nresponsibility for the products they distribute.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the 21st Century Media \nResponsibility Act, would build on that initial response and \nsignificantly improve our efforts in the future to limit children's \nsuccess to inappropriate and potentially harmful products.\n  Specifically, it calls for the creation of a uniform labeling system \nfor violent entertainment media products, to provide parents with \nclear, easy-to-understand warnings about the amount and degree of \nviolence contained in the movies, music, television shows, and video \ngames that are being mass-marketed today. Beyond that, it would require \nthe businesses where these products are sold or distributed--the movie \ntheaters, record and software stores, and rental outlets--to strictly \nenforce these new ratings, and thus prohibit children from buying or \nrenting material that is meant for adults and may pose a risk to kids.\n  This proposal is premised in many respects on our concerted efforts \nto keep cigarettes out of the hands of minors, and with good reason. As \nwith tobacco, decades of research have shown definitively that media \nviolence can be seriously harmful to children, that heavy, sustained \nexposure to violent images, particularly those that glamorize murder \nand mayhem and that fail to show any consequences, tends to desensitize \nyoung viewers and increase the potential they will become violent \nthemselves. As with tobacco, and its mascot Joe Camel, we are beginning \nto see substantial evidence indicating that the entertainment industry \nis not satisfied with mass marketing mass murder, but that it is \nactually targeting products to children that the producers themselves \nadmit are not appropriate for minors.\n  And as with tobacco, we are seeking to change the behavior of a \nmulti-billion dollar industry that too often seems locked in deep \ndenial, that has shown little inclination to acknowledge there is a \nproblem with its products, let alone work with us to find reasonable \nsolutions to reduce the threat of media violence to children.\n  Of course, there are differences between the tobacco and \nentertainment industries and the products they make. Cigarettes are \nfilled with physical substances that have been proven to cause cancer \nin longtime smokers. Violent entertainment products have a less visible \nand physical effect on longtime viewers and listeners, and, more \nsignificantly, they are forms of speech that enjoy protection under the \nFirst Amendment.\n  It is because of our devotion to the First Amendment that Senator \nMcCain and I, along with many other concerned critics, have been \nreluctant to call for government restrictions on the content of movies, \nmusic, television and video games. All along, we have urged \nentertainment industry leaders to police themselves, to draw lines and \nset higher standards, to balance their right to free expression with \ntheir responsibilities to the larger community to which they belong. We \nrepeated these pleas with a new sense of urgency in the days following \nthe shooting at Columbine High School, asking the most influential \nmedia voices to attend the White House summit meeting the President \nconvened and to engage in open dialogue about what all of us can do to \nreduce the likelihood of another Littleton.\n  And there has been a smattering of encouraging responses emanating \nfrom the entertainment media. For example, the Interactive Digital \nSoftware Association, which represents the video game manufacturers, \nhas acknowledged that the grotesque and perverse violence used in some \nadvertisements crosses the line, and it is reexamining its marketing \ncode to respond to some of the concerns we have raised. Disney for its \npart announced that it would no longer house violent coin-operated \nvideo games in its amusement parks. The National Association of Theater \nOwners pledged to tighten the enforcement of its policies restricting \nthe access of children to R-rated movies. And several prominent \nscreenwriters, speaking at a recent forum sponsored by the Writers \nGuild of America, raised concerns about the level of violence in \ntoday's movies and called on the industry to rethink its fascination \nwith murder and mayhem.\n  But overall the silence from the men and women who make the decisions \nthat shape our culture has been deafening, their denials extremely \ndisappointing. Not one CEO from the major entertainment conglomerates--\nSony, Disney, Seagram, Time Warner, Viacom, and Fox--accepted the \nPresident's invitation to attend the White House summit meeting. And \nsince\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nthen, not one has made a statement accepting some responsibility for \nthe culture of violence surrounding our children, or indicating their \nwillingness to address their part of the lethal mix that is turning \nkids into killers. What we have heard, from Seagram's Edgar Bronfman \nand Time Warner's Gerald Levin and Viacom's Sumner Redstone, are more \nshrill denials and diversions, along with attacks on those of us in \nCongress who are concerned about what they are doing to our country and \nour kids.\n  This is the responsibility vacuum in which we are operating, and this \nis the vacuum we are trying to fill with the legislation we are \nintroducing today. Ideally, our bill would be unnecessary. Ideally, the \nvarious segments of the entertainment industry would agree to adopt and \nimplement a set of common-sense, uniform standards that would provide \nfor clear and concise labeling of media products, that would prohibit \nthe marketing and sales of adult-rated products to children, and that \nwould hold producers or retail outlets that violate the code \naccountable for their irresponsibility. But there is no sign that is \ngoing to happen any time soon, which is why we feel compelled to go \nforward with this proposal today.\n  We are not advocating censorship, or placing restrictions on the kind \nof entertainment products that can be made and sold commercially. What \nwe are doing through this bill is treating violent media like tobacco \nand other products that pose risks to children, requiring producers to \nprovide explicit warnings to parents about potentially harmful content, \nand requiring retailers to take reasonable steps to limit the \navailability of adult-rated products with high doses of violence to \naudiences for which they are designed. That is why we have chosen to \namend the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, to accentuate \nthe fact that we are not regulating artistic expression but the \nmarketing and distribution of commercial products, and that we are not \ncriminalizing speech, but demanding truth in labeling and enforcement.\n  If a video game company is telling parents a game is not appropriate \nfor children under 17, then parents should have a realistic expectation \nthat this game will not be marketed or sold to that audience. \nUnfortunately, that is often not the case these days, and we would \ncorrect that by authorizing the Federal Trade Commission to investigate \nand punish retailers and rental outlets and movie theaters that in \neffect deceive parents about the products they are selling or renting \nto their kids. Specifically, it would authorize the FTC to levy fines \nof up to $10,000 per violation of the act's provisions prohibiting the \nsale or rental of adult-rated products to children.\n  This bill does not just respond to concerns of today, but anticipates \nthe media landscape of tomorrow. According to most experts, as \ntechnologies converge over the next few years, more and more of our \nentertainment is going to be delivered through a single wire into the \nhome over the Internet. In this radically different universe, it only \nmakes sense to modernize the ratings concept to fit the new contours of \nthe Information Age, and develop a standard labeling system for the \nvideo, audio, and interactive games we will consume through a common \nportal. Our legislation will move us in that direction and prod the \nentertainment industry to help parents meet the new challenges of this \nnew era, and hopefully usher in a new ethic of media responsibility, a \ngoal that is reflected in the bill's title.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to make clear that I do not \nconsider this legislation to be ``the'' answer to the threat of media \nviolence or the solution to repairing our culture. It won't \nsinglehandedly stop media standards from falling, or substitute for \nindustry self-restraint. No one bill or combination of laws could \nreplace the exercise of corporate citizenship, particularly given our \nrespect for the First Amendment. We must continue to push the \nentertainment industry to embrace its responsibilities. But this bill \nis a common-sense, forward looking response that will in fact help \nreduce the harmful influences reaching our children and thereby reduce \nthe risk of youth violence. That makes it more than worthwhile, and I \nask my colleagues to join us in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 1229. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to permit a State to register a foreign pesticide for \ndistribution and use within that State; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud sponsor of this \npesticide harmonization legislation. As many of you are aware, there \nare a number of trade imbalances facing the agricultural industry.\n  In my home State of Montana and many other western and mid-western \nstates, trade imbalances occur primarily between Canada and the United \nStates. However, disparities occur between the United States and many \nforeign countries.\n  One of those trade imbalances is pesticide harmonization, which is a \nserious issue for American farmers. There are numerous disparities \nbetween chemicals and pesticides that are allowed in foreign countries \nand those that are allowed here in the United States.\n  In many cases a chemical will have the identical chemical structure \nin both countries but be named and priced differently. Why should an \nAmerican producer be expected to pay twice the amount for an identical \nchemical available in a foreign country for less?\n  In order for free trade to truly occur, this issue must be addressed. \nFarmers have dealt with several years of depressed prices with no \nimmediate end in sight. To compound the economic crunch American \nfarmers are feeling, American agricultural producers must pay nearly \ntwice the amount that foreign producers pay in their country for nearly \nthe same chemical.\n  This leads to a huge disparity between the break-even price on crop \nproduction between foreign and American farmers, and gives foreign \nproducers an unfair advantage. It is unfair for American producers to \npay twice the amount for pesticides and chemicals as many of our \ntrading partners.\n  Furthermore, it is against the law for American producers to purchase \nan identical chemical in a foreign country and bring it across the \nborder. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must be held \naccountable to American producers and assure that producers have the \nsame advantages in this country in regards to pesticides and chemicals \nthat foreign producers enjoy.\n  My bill assures that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will \nbe held accountable to domestic agricultural producers. Primarily, it \nmandates that the EPA give mutual recognition to the same chemical \nstructures, on both existing and new products, in the United States and \ncompeting foreign countries.\n  It does this by several provisions. First, it permits any \nagricultural individual or group, within a state, to put forth a \nrequest through the State Ag Commissioner (Head of the Department of \nAgriculture) to the EPA to register chemicals with substantially \nsimilar make-up to those registered in a foreign country.\n  Within 60 days of receiving that request the EPA would be held \nresponsible to either accept or deny that request. They must then give \nthe same recognition to American producers for chemical structures that \nare substantially similar to cheaper products available in competing \nforeign countries.\n  Additionally, my bill will ensure that the Administrator of the EPA \nwill take into account both NAFTA and the Canada/U.S. Trade Agreement, \nin making these determinations.\n  These provisions will level the pricing structure by making sure that \nchemicals with the same (or substantially similar) structures are \npriced fairly in the United States.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue \nto American farmers and ranchers.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1230. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage the production and use of clean-fuel vehicles, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        The Electric Vehicle Consumer Incentive Tax Act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Electric \nVehicle Consumer Incentive Tax Act of 1999'' to\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\nprovide new incentives and extend previous ones to spark the zero \nemission vehicle market. This legislation is similar to previous bills \nthat I have introduced in the 104th and 105th Congresses.\n  I am pleased to see that already the market for electric vehicles is \nemerging. All major domestic automakers and most of foreign automakers \nhave zero emission vehicles in the market. However, we still need to \nprovide tax incentives to help lower the cost of the new technology \nvehicles. Despite the what appears to be a new understanding from our \nautomakers that they must begin to produce environmentally friendly \nvehicles, the costs of these new generation of vehicles are still steep \nfor most Americans.\n  The need to decrease automobile pollution is still critical. Since \n1970, total U.S. population increased 31 percent and vehicle miles \ntraveled--that's our best measure of vehicle use--increased 127 \npercent. During that time, emissions for most of the key pollutants \nhave decreased from the introduction of new technologies. But we are \nstill failing to meet air quality standards in many areas. In fact, the \nemissions of one key pollutant--nitrogen oxides--actually increased 11 \npercent from 1970 to 1997. Nitrogen oxides, produced largely from \nautomobile fuel combustion, is the building block for smog. About 107 \nmillion Americans were residing in counties that did not meet the air \nquality standards for at least one of the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards pollutants in 1997.\n  These emissions still produce profound and troubling impacts on the \nhealth of Americans, particularly the young.\n  That is why I believe Congress should help and encourage Americans to \npurchase or lease zero emission vehicles. Electric vehicles, which \nproduce no pollution from their engines, will not become the preferred \nautomobile for all Americans, but for many it can become the preferred \ncommuter vehicle or city car. Electric vehicles can also help state and \nlocal governments, and private fleet operators, meet new and future air \nquality requirements.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say that previous provisions of my \nclean fuel vehicle legislation have become law. The lowering of the \nexcise tax on liquified natural gas will help spur the market for that \nfuel for heavy duty vehicles. The repeal of the luxury tax on electric \nvehicles also helps remove or lessen market barriers. But more needs to \nbe done. That is why I have introduced the ``Electric Vehicle Consumer \nIncentive Tax Act of 1999.'' U.S. Representative Mac Collins of Georgia \nhas introduced the companion bill in the House, H.R. 1108.\n  The bill provides four major incentives. First, it removes the \ngovernmental use restrictions for electric vehicles. At present, the \nInternal Revenue Code prohibits any tax credit taken for property (in \nthis case electric vehicles) used by the United States or any state or \nlocal government. Removing this bar will encourage the leasing of \nelectric vehicles for state and local use. By removing restriction on \ngovernmental use of electric vehicles, owners of electric vehicle \nfleets could ``pass on'' any cost savings from tax credits to the \ngovernment.\n  Second, the bill makes large electric trucks, vans, and buses \neligible for the same tax deduction available now for other clean-fuel \nvehicles under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Large electric trucks, \nvans and buses currently are limited to the maximum tax credit of \n$4,000 under the Code. Other clean-fuel vehicles, however, may receive \na $50,000 tax deduction. This section of the bill would remove the \nunfair distinction between large electric and other large clean-fuel \nvehicles. Each would qualify for the tax deduction incentive which \nwould serve to promote the greatest use of clean-fuel vehicles. The \nbill would end the tax credit for large electric vehicles and provide a \ntax deduction instead.\n  Third, the bill provides a flat $4,000 tax credit on the purchase of \nan electric vehicle. Under current law, electric vehicles are eligible \nunder the Code for a 10 percent tax credit for the cost of qualified \nelectric vehicles, up to a maximum of $4,000. The bill would modify \nthat section to provide for a flat $4,000 tax credit (rather than 10 \npercent of the purchase price up to $4,000) in order to maximize the \ntax incentive.\n  Fourth, the bill extends the sunset period for the tax credit. \nCurrent law phases out the electric vehicle tax credit beginning in the \nyear 2002. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 anticipated that electric \nvehicles would be available commercially in 1992. The first electric \nvehicles were not available to the public until 1997. All major \nautomakers now have electric vehicles on the market. However, that \nmarket is still very small. Therefore, the bill extends the phase out \nfor four years with the credit sunsetting December 31, 2008, instead of \nDecember 31, 2004. The phase out provisions are conformed by amending \nthe Code to provide that the credit will be phased out, at a 25 percent \nannual cumulative rate, for each of the three years preceding \ntermination.\n  I believe these provisions can provide important market incentives \nfor Americans to purchase automobiles that do not contribute to urban \nsmog or other pollution and at a modest cost in reduced Federal taxes. \nI ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this legislation and \nmaking way for a clean fuel future in the 21st Century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care is important to all Americans.\n       (2) Health care is particularly important to individuals \n     with disabilities and special health care needs who often \n     cannot afford the insurance available to them through the \n     private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the \n     private sector, and are at great risk of incurring very high \n     and economically devastating health care costs.\n       (3) Americans with significant disabilities often are \n     unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage \n     of the services and supports that enable them to live \n     independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Personal \n     assistance services (such as attendant services, personal \n     assistance with transportation to and from work, reader \n     services, job coaches, and related assistance) remove many of \n     the barriers between significant disability and work. \n     Coverage for such services, as well as for prescription \n     drugs, durable medical equipment, and basic health care are \n     powerful and proven tools for individuals with significant \n     disabilities to obtain and retain employment.\n       (4) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing \n     health care and related services is one of the greatest \n     barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their \n     employment, earning potential, and independence.\n       (5) Individuals with disabilities who are beneficiaries \n     under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     401 et seq., 1381 et seq.) risk losing medicare or medicaid \n     coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that \n     is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of \n     cash benefits associated with working.\n       (6) Currently, less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of social \n     security disability insurance and supplemental security \n     income beneficiaries cease to receive benefits as a result of \n     employment.\n       (7) Beneficiaries have cited the lack of adequate \n     employment training and placement services as an additional \n     barrier to employment.\n       (8) If an additional \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the current \n     social security disability insurance (DI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) recipients were to cease receiving \n     benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social \n     Security Trust Funds in cash assistance would total \n     $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of the individuals.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide health care and employment preparation and \n     placement services to individuals with disabilities that will \n     enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on cash \n     benefit programs.\n       (2) To encourage States to adopt the option of allowing \n     individuals with disabilities to purchase medicaid coverage \n     that is necessary to enable such individuals to maintain \n     employment.\n       (3) To provide individuals with disabilities the option of \n     maintaining medicare coverage while working.\n       (4) To establish a return to work ticket program that will \n     allow individuals with disabilities to seek the services \n     necessary to obtain and retain employment and reduce their \n     dependency on cash benefit programs.\n         TITLE I--EXPANDED AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Also \nincluded in the aid package is funds for job-training and \nrehabilitation programs to help promote the reconstruction of Kosovo in \nthe long run.\n  This is just another remarkable example of the thoughtfulness and \ngenerosity of the people in Taiwan and should serve as a model for the \nentire international community. I would like to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in expressing our deep appreciation to President Lee and the \npeople of Taiwan for this compassionate offer. Hopefully, this act will \nencourage other nations to aid in rebuilding the Balkans so that the \npeople there can move past the horrible atrocities that have been \ncommitted over the past few months and begin rebuilding their lives and \nfamilies in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7154-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE LIEN, PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nClarence Lien of Forest Lake, Minnesota. On June 7, 1999, I had the \ngreat honor of presenting a belated Purple heart to Clarence. He is \nmost deserving of this long overdue recognition. I take this \nopportunity to congratulate Clarence and thank him for his service and \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record remarks by \nClarence Lien made at his award presentation.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                        Remarks by Clarence Lien\n\n       I am a bit overwhelmed. I honestly didn't think this would \n     ever happen, but I'm glad it did. And I'm really amazed that \n     all of you would take time to come here today to be part of \n     this. I feel lucky, I feel honored.\n       And you know that I'm not a speech maker, or a big talker \n     for that matter. But there is one thing that I would talk \n     about, and that one thing is ``freedom''.\n       Next to family, freedom is the most precious thing that you \n     have. When I was in Stalag 17, I had a lot of time to think. \n     And when you are in a situation where everything is taken \n     away from you, you quickly realize where your priorities are. \n     I can tell you, as if it was yesterday, that the things that \n     I missed the most were my family and my freedom.\n       Freedom is a word we all know and to many of us, take for \n     granted. But, boy, if you don't have it for a year or so, you \n     realize what a gift it is. Imagine, if you can, being told \n     when or if you can eat, and what you can eat. Imagine someone \n     else dictating when you can speak, and what you can say. Try \n     to visualize being afraid for your life every waking moment.\n       Freedom gives you the ability to make decisions, right and \n     wrong ones. When you have that taken away, it makes you feel \n     like an animal, a caged animal at that.\n       Freedom to me is a treasure.\n       There is something odd to me about the word ``free''. In \n     every day living, we think free means ``At no cost.'' But \n     that is so far from the truth. There is a huge cost \n     associated with being free. And we should never forget that.\n       I will always remember a certain moment back in 1945. I was \n     being shipped home after the war ended, and we entered New \n     York harbor. In the distance I could see the Statue of \n     Liberty. I tell you, I was so happy and so thankful to be \n     coming home, and Lady Liberty was the symbol that I had \n     arrived. And that I was once again free.\n       Yep, Stalag 17 taught me a lot about freedom.\n       So I'd like to challenge you today to appreciate every \n     decision you are allowed to make--even the hard ones. And to \n     appreciate the veterans of today and tomorrow for protecting \n     the freedom we all enjoy. And to never forget that this \n     country we live in is truly ``the land of the free.'' Thank \n     you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7154-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7154-S7155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SHIRLEY COCHRAN\n\n Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I am pleased that this weekend I \nwill be helping to celebrate the eightieth anniversary of Vermont's \nfarmer owned Cabot Creamery Cooperative.\n  The Cabot Creamery Cooperative was founded in 1919 by 94 farmers, who \ncame together with a vision of a better way to operate a dairy. The \noriginal farmers each pledged $5 per cow and a cord of firewood to fire \nthe boiler. The total investment was $3,700. Today, over 1,600 farm \nfamilies from all of the New England States and upstate New York belong \nto the cooperative. The creamery and the Cabot brand name are \ninternationally known, having been named ``World's Best Cheddar'' in \n1997 and ``Best Cheddar in the USA'' in 1998. Their outstanding \nproducts can be found in stores across the country.\n  The cooperative is a shining example of farmers working together for \na common good. Together they control their own financial destiny by \nowning a brand name, the facilities to produce a high quality product \nand a cooperative to supply the needed milk. Their way of doing \nbusiness continues to secure a sound future for their family farms and \nthe unique rural way of life of their communities. Just as the original \n94 farmers were visionary in the early part of the century, 80 years \nlater their cooperative has taken the leading role in working for the \nNortheast Dairy Compact, ensuring a bright future for the dairy \nindustry in the Northeast.\n  During its history, the profits, size and scope of Cabot Creamery \nCooperative may have grown, but its small town values and sense of \ncommunity have continued to dictate the way it does business. These \nvalues have kept the original purpose and intent of the cooperative \nintact over the years and have allowed it to remain a locally owned \ncreamery.\n  For all of these reasons, I couldn't think of a more appropriate way \nto celebrate Cabot's eightieth anniversary than through the upcoming \n``Cabot Creamery Heritage Festival,'' in conjunction with the Vermont \nHeritage Weekend. I am delighted that the Vermont Historical Society, \nalong with thirty-six community historical societies, will be helping \nCabot celebrate by showcasing Vermont's community treasures. These \ncommunities will provide examples of the best of Vermont's history, \ntraditions and scenery, ranging from granite artisans, Morgan horses, \nagricultural exhibits, small town museums, covered bridges, and the \nbeautiful Green Mountains.\n  I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Cabot Creamery \nCooperative on its eightieth anniversary and commend it for its \npositive influence on the past, present, and future of Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7155-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7155-S7156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO KELO-TV, SIOUX FALLS, SOUTH DAKOTA, FOR ITS OUTSTANDING \n                    RESPONSE TO THE SPENCER TORNADO\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

WILLIAM R. WILSON JR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, few touch the lives of others in so \npersonal a manner as doctors, and this relationship takes on an even \nmore special meaning when the patients are children. Dr. William Wilson \nJr. has worked to ensure that young children with severe heart ailments \nreceive the very finest medical care available. He has been \ninstrumental in advancing many of the recent breakthroughs in heart \nsurgery, and it gives me great pleasure to recognize the achievements \nof this remarkable man as he is awarded the 1999 Norwich Native Son \naward for his work within the medical profession.\n  The Norwich Native Son award is presented to that native of Norwich, \nConnecticut who has made significant contributions to his or her field \noutside of the state of Connecticut. As a pediatric cardiovascular \nsurgeon in Missouri, Dr. Wilson has established himself as a leader \nwithin the medical profession and continues to enlighten the field with \nhis knowledge and expertise. His innovative procedures are used \nthroughout the country to educate new generations of doctors helping to \nensure that this country remains a leader in medical advances.\n  Born, raised, and educated in Norwich, Dr. Wilson ventured beyond \nConnecticut's borders to earn his bachelor's degree in biology from \nKenyon College. He soon returned to the state to attend the University \nof Connecticut where he received his doctorate in anatomy and cell \nbiology and, eventually, his medical degree in 1983.\n  Currently making his home in Missouri, he is the Chief of Pediatric \nCardiovascular Surgery at the Children's Hospital, University Hospital \nand Clinics in Columbia. It is at the University Hospital and Clinics \nthat Dr. Wilson has changed hundreds of children's lives. Dr. Wilson \nperforms delicate procedures on infants and young children with severe \nheart defects giving countless children an opportunity for healthy \nnormal lives.\n  Dr. Wilson began performing his advanced heart procedures while \nserving as the Chief of the Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Division of the \nMedical College of Ohio in Toledo. Dr. Wilson's breakthrough techniques \nhelped to transform the Medical College of Ohio into the regional \nleader in performing these surgeries. He has also expanded his work to \ninclude heart transplantation, and to date, he has performed this \nprocedure on over 125 adults and children.\n  Dr. Wilson has also distinguished himself internationally through \nseveral outreach programs. Twice he has organized mobile surgical teams \nand traveled to countries where these vital procedures are unavailable \nto those in need.\n  In 1996, Dr. Wilson journeyed to Peru where he performed surgery on \n15 local children. He most recently led a medical mission to the \nchildren's hospital in Tbilisi in the Republic of Georgia, where he \noperated on 11 children. Moreover, he has brought children from other \ncountries to medical facilities in the United States to undergo surgery \nin modern hospitals. His humanitarian efforts have helped shed light on \nthe over one million children worldwide who suffer from heart ailments \nand on the desperate need for these procedures in other countries.\n  Mr. President, I take special pride, along with the Wilson family, in \nrecognizing the wonderful accomplishments of Dr. William Wilson. While \nhe may no longer live in Norwich, he has never forgotten the lessons \nlearned from this close-knit community. Dr. William Wilson is being \nhonored for his noble efforts within the medical field by friends and \nneighbors who fondly remember the spirited young boy who grew up in \nNorwich and who are so proud of the caring healer he has become. I wish \nhim much success as he continues to leave his mark on the medical \ncommunity, and I congratulate him for being honored with this most \ndeserved award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7156-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7156-S7157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO CHAPLAIN (MG) DONALD W.

Throughout his career, Chaplain Shea has \nserved with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many \naccomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has \nprovided the United States Army and our nation.\n  Chaplain Shea's retirement on 30 June 1999 will bring to a close over \nthree decades of dedicated service to the United States Army. Born and \nraised in Butte, Montana, Chaplain Shea attended Carroll College in \nHelena, Montana and graduated from The Saint Paul Seminary in St. Paul, \nMinnesota. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1962 for the \nDiocese of Helena and commissioned as a U.S. Army chaplain and entered \nactive duty in August 1966.\n  During his career Chaplain Shea has contributed to every available \nfacet of religious ministry in our armed forces. Entering active duty \nduring a very difficult period for our military and Nation, he provided \nthe leadership and ministering that was invaluable to our forces in the \nVietnam conflict. Following this conflict, during which he \ndistinguished himself to seniors and peers alike, Chaplain Shea went on \nto serve in a variety of positions through his career. He was nominated \non May 20, 1994 by President Clinton for promotion to Major General and \nfollowing his Senate confirmation was appointed Chief of Army Chaplains \non September 1, 1994.\n  As Chief of Chaplains he held the Army staff responsible for the \nreligious, moral, and spiritual welfare for the total Army. He focused \nand advised the Army leadership in dealing with and resolving a number \nof difficult issues facing today's force. Of note was his establishment \nof a Chaplain Recruiting Program within the US Army Recruiting Command \nto aggressively recruit the best-qualified candidates from all \ndenominations, the successful relocation of the Army Chaplain Center \nand School from Fort Monmouth, NJ to Fort Jackson, SC and as President \nof the Armed Forces Chaplain Board, he shaped joint methodologies by \nwhich Service Chiefs of Chaplain and their staffs approached common \nissues.\n  Chaplain Shea has been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, \nDefense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with ``V'' \ndevice and two Oak Leaf Clusters, Meritorious Service Medal with two \nOak Leaf Clusters, Army Commendation Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, \nPurple Heart, Vietnam Service Medal with six Campaign Stars, Vietnam \nCivil Actions Medal (First Class), Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Army Service \nRibbon, Army Overseas Medal (with ``3'' device), Senior Parachute \nBadge, Special Forces Tab, Bundeswehr Parachute Badge, and the \nVietnamese Parachute Badge.\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\n  Chaplain Shea will retire from the Department of the Army June 30, \n1999, after thirty-three years of dedicated service.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize Joe Beyrle, a \nWorld War II veteran and long-time friend from Norton Shores, Michigan. \nJoe Beyrle's service during the war was truly extraordinary.\n  As an eighteen-year-old in 1942, Joe Beyrle enlisted in the Army, \nlater volunteering for the parachute infantry. Joe quickly \ndistinguished himself as a member of the 101st Airborne Division \nstationed in England. Early in his service Joe was twice chosen to make \ndangerous jumps into Nazi-occupied France while fitted with bandoliers \nfilled with gold for the French Resistance. Joe's last jump into France \nwas on the night before D-Day with the objective of destroying two \nwooden bridges behind Utah Beach. However, while on his way to \naccomplish this mission, Joe was captured by the Germans.\n  On June 10, 1944, the parents of Joe Beryle received a letter from \nthe United States Government informing them that their son had perished \nwhile serving his country in France. On September 17, 1944, family and \nfriends held a funeral mass for Joe at St. Joseph's Church in Muskegon, \nMichigan. However, Joe was still alive and being held in a POW camp. A \ndead German soldier wearing an American uniform and Joe's dog tags had \nbeen mistakenly identified as Joe.\n  Joe was eventually able to escape from his captors and later joined a \nRussian tank unit to continue the fight against the Germans. Joe fought \nwith the Russians until an injury forced him to be sent to a Moscow \nhospital. When he finally regained his strength, Joe went to the \nAmerican Embassy in Moscow and was eventually sent back to the United \nStates. On September 14, 1946, almost two years after the funeral mass \nin his honor, Joe Beyrle married his wife, JoAnne, in the very same \nchurch.\n  I ask to have printed in the Congressional Record an article which \nappeared recently in the Detroit Free Press regarding Joe Beyrle. The \narticle highlights in greater detail the extraordinary experience of \nJoe Beryle during World War II. I know my Senate Colleagues will join \nme in honoring Joe Beyrle on his tremendous sacrifice and service to \nour nation.\n  The article follows:\n\n      World War II Vet Holds on to a Special Appreciation of Life\n\n                          (By Ron Dzwonkowski)\n\n       Memorial Day has to be a little strange for Joe Beyrle, \n     even after all these years. He pays tribute to the nation's \n     war dead knowing that, for a time, he was among them. Even \n     had a funeral with full honors.\n       ``Oh, what parents went through,'' says Beyrle, (pronounced \n     buy early.) ``My mother would never talk about it. My dad \n     wouldn't at first. But I finally talked to him at some \n     length. The emotions . . . well, it was quite a talk.''\n       Beyrle, who will turn 76 this summer and lives in Norton \n     Shores, south of Muskegon, was among the hundreds of \n     thousands of young Americans who enlisted in the Armed Forces \n     to fight World War II. A strapping 18-year-old, he passed up \n     a scholarship to the University of Notre Dame and volunteered \n     in June 1942 for what was then called the parachute infantry.\n       By September of '43, Beyrle was in England with the 101st \n     Airborne Division.\n       His commanders must have seen something of the rough-and-\n     ready in the young man from western Michigan, for Beyrle was \n     twice chosen to parachute into Nazi-occupied France wearing \n     bandoliers laden with gold for the French Resistance. After \n     each jump, he had to hide for more than a week until he could \n     be returned to his unit in England.\n       Then came D-Day. Beyrle's unit jumped into France on the \n     night before the invasion, assigned to disrupt Nazi defenses \n     for the huge frontal assault.\n       The going was rough. Beyrle saw several planes full of his \n     comrades go down in flames before he hit the silk from 400 \n     feet up, landing on the roof of a church. Under fire from the \n     steeple, he slid down into a cemetery and set out for his \n     demolition objective, two wooden bridges behind Utah Beach.\n       Beyrle never made it. He was on the loose for about 20 \n     hours while the battle raged on the beaches, and he did \n     manage to blow up a power station and some trucks, slash the \n     tires on the other Nazi vehicles and lob some grenades into \n     clusters of Hitler's finest. But then he crawled over a \n     hedgerow, fell into a German machine gun nest and was \n     captured.\n       What followed was a long ordeal of brutality and terror as \n     the Germans herded the American POWs inland while being \n     hammered by Allied bombs and artillery. Beyrle was hit by \n     shrapnel, but had to shake it off so he could apply \n     tourniquets to two men whose legs were blown off. He escaped \n     once for about 16 hours, but ran back into a German patrol.\n       Somewhere in all this chaos, Beyrle lost his dog tags, \n     those little metal necklaces that identify military \n     personnel. They ended up around the neck of a German soldier \n     who was killed in France on June 10, wearing an American \n     uniform, probably an infiltrator.\n       In early September, the dreaded telegram arrived for \n     Beyrle's parents in Muskegon, the one that includes the \n     nation's ``deep sympathy for your loss.''\n       The body believed to be Joe Beyrle was buried in France \n     under a grave marker bearing his name. A funeral mass was \n     held on Sept. 17, 1994, at St. Joseph's Church in Muskegon. \n     Beyrle's name was inscribed on a plaque honoring the \n     community's war dead.\n       Joe Beyrle, meantime, was being hauled by train all over \n     Europe, locked in about a half-dozen POW camps, beaten, \n     interrogated and nearly starved. But he never quit trying to \n     escape, and finally managed it in January 1945, as the Nazi \n     war machine was starting to crumble under the onslaught of \n     Americans on the west and Russians from the east. Beyrle \n     hooked up with a Russian tank unit and fought with them for a \n     month before he was wounded and shipped to a hospital outside \n     Moscow.\n       When he was able, Beyrle made his way to the U.S. embassy \n     in the Russian capital, but he had a terrible time convincing \n     officials of his identity, especially since he was listed as \n     dead. He was actually arrested and grew so frustrated that he \n     jumped one of his guards in an attempt to escape.\n       Fingerprints finally proved that Joe Beyrle was alive and \n     well.\n       The next telegram to Muskegon carried a much happier \n     message.\n       On Sept. 14, 1946, Joe Beyrle married his wife, JoAnne, in \n     the same church where his funeral mass was held two years \n     earlier. The same priest presided at both. Almost 53 years \n     later, JoAnne says with a smile that her husband's war \n     stories ``get better every year.''\n       This weekend, Beyrle will rejoin the 101st for ceremonies \n     honoring its war dead at Arlington National Cemetery. Then \n     he's off to Europe to walk once again over the ground where \n     he fought and bled for freedom. He will even visit the grave \n     that for months was thought to hold his body.\n       ``Some of them aren't's even sure what war I'm talking \n     about,'' he said. ``They really don't understand that I felt \n     it was my duty to volunteer, and what went on and what it was \n     like. I tell them that if it wasn't for what we did, they \n     would all be marching the goose-step today, and the first \n     question is, `what's the goose-step?'\n       ``I grew up real fast. We all had to,'' Beyrle said. ``You \n     just learn to believe that somebody up there is looking out \n     for you. . . . I came home with such an appreciation of life, \n     and I don't think I've ever lost it.''\n       He came home with a handful of medals, too, but doesn't \n     consider himself a hero.\n       ``There were 200 guys in my unit that jumped into Normandy, \n     and 50 or 60 were killed in action right there, maybe 40 were \n     wounded; five or six were captured,'' Beryle says. ``I'm just \n     one of the lucky ones. The heroes are the guys who didn't \n     make it back.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7157-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7157-S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RETIREMENT OF JOHN P.

Rezendes, who has served East \nProvidence public schools for 30 years, and is retiring as Principal of \nEdward R. Martin Junior High School.\n  John Rezendes built his career in Rhode Island, just as he received \nhis education in our state. He graduated from East Providence Senior \nHigh School in 1965, received a bachelor's and a master's degree from \nProvidence College, and later pursued additional studies at Rhode \nIsland College.\n  Over the years, John Rezendes has amassed an impressive record of \npublic service. During his tenure in the East Providence public school \nsystem, John has worked with students in a variety of capacities, \nincluding as a classroom teacher, a ``House Leader,'' and a principal.\n  Early in his career, John served as a history and civics teacher at \nCentral Junior High School. In 1977, when a new facility was \nconstructed to replace Central Junior High School, John was one of the \nfirst faculty members to occupy this new ``four house facility.'' That \nsame year, he was promoted to House Leader where he continued a close \nrelationship with his students and built a strong working relationship \nwith the teachers he supervised.\n  In 1983, John was appointed Principal of Riverside Junior High \nSchool. In this capacity, he brought many personal touches to the \nschool. His work\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\non revamping student schedules and creating ``teaching teams'' within \nindividual grades are just a couple of the positive marks he left on \nthe Riverside community.\n  However, John Rezendes did not stop there. In 1986, Principal \nRezendes was transferred to Martin Junior High School where he remained \nfor the next thirteen years. During this time, John worked diligently \non the educational needs of his students. In fact, in 1998, he began \nmolding the East Providence Educational Development Center. This Center \nserves as an alternative high school for non-traditional students and \nfocuses on the development of academic schedules to meet their \nindividual needs.\n  John Rezendes' work in the East Providence public school system \ncertainly is well known. For over thirty years, John has made a lasting \nimpact on thousands of students. He has treated his job as both a \nchallenge and a privilege.\n  As John prepares for his private life away from the duties of his \nterribly demanding job, I want to congratulate and thank him for all \nthat he has given to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7158-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

He is retiring after 13 years of service \nwith ACPA where he served as the chief advisor on scientific and \ntechnical matters. He was named Vice President in 1988.\n  Prior to joining the American Crop Protection Association, Dr. \nMcCarthy spent 23 years with the Agricultural Chemicals Group of FMC \nCorporation. At FMC he was involved in all aspects of agricultural \nchemicals research and development, starting as a synthesis chemist and \nrising to the position of Director of Product Development and \nRegistrations.\n  John testified many times before the House Agriculture Committee when \nI served as chairman. He was always available to provide technical \nexpertise when our Committee was considering amendments to FIFRA. He \nalso testified in the Senate answering endless questions about \ndifficult scientific and policy issues. John was always able to put the \nissues in perspective and kept the protection of public health at the \nforefront of his presentation. His retirement will leave a void in the \nagricultural crop protection community which can not be easily filled.\n  He received his B.S. degree in Pharmacy from the Albany College of \nPharmacy in 1958 and his Ph.D in Medicinal Chemistry from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin in 1962. Previous to joining FMC, he did \nresearch at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, N.Y.\n  John is very family oriented and his wife, Ann, should also be \nrecognized for her willingness to loan John to us for all these years. \nWithout her commitment and understanding, those long hours and late \nevenings would not have been possible. Please join me in wishing John \nthe best for a well deserved and fulfilling retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7158-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GARY ARRUDA\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to pay \ntribute to Gary Arruda of Hollis, NH for the critical assistance he \nprovided with the aid of a wireless phone to save another individual's \nlife. Gary, along with individuals from each state across America, the \nDistrict of Columbia and Puerto Rico, received the ``VITA Wireless \nSamaritan Award.''\n  This award, which is awarded by the Cellular Telecommunications \nIndustry Association (CTIA) is presented to honor the contributions \nheroic individuals make to their communities. Gary, who is an emergency \nmedical technician (EMT), responded to a page to assist an injured \nmountain biker, who was too deep in the woods for an ambulance to \nreach. The biker, who had been stung by bees and was having a severe \nallergic reaction, was unable to make it out of the woods on her own, \nGary went in the woods with his four-wheel drive vehicle, emergency \nmedical equipment and his wireless phone. He and two other EMTs were \nable to stabilize the biker while maintaining contact with emergency \ndispatch and the ambulance that was waiting at the edge of the woods. \nGary kept both dispatchers and ambulance attendants apprised of the \nvictim's condition, enabling them to prepare to take over the rescue as \nsoon as he got the woman out of the woods.\n  I commend Gary for his excellent reaction in a situation that called \nfor immediate attention. He is a true hero. I am proud to represent him \nin the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7158-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION COMMENDING THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMED FORCES FOR \n                 THE SUCCESS OF OPERATION ALLIED FORCE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Eric K. Shinseki, 0000.\n\n\n                              marine corps\n\n       The following named officer for appointment as Commandant \n     of the Marine Corps, and appointment to the grade indicated \n     while assigned to a position of importance and responsibility \n     under title 10, U.S.C., sections 601 and 5043:\n\n                             To be general\n\n     Lt. Gen. James L. Jones, Jr., 0000.\n\n\n                  Nomination Of Gen. Eric K. Shinseki\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nreviewed the qualifications of General Shinseki. It was a memorable \nday. One of our most distinguished and revered colleagues, the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, introduced General Shinseki. I have said \npreviously that it was one of the most moving statements I have ever \nheard by a Senator in my 21 years. I placed the statement of Senator \nInouye in the Record of Wednesday, June 9, 1999, at Page S6813, and I \nurge all Senators to look at that. It was, indeed, one of the most \nextraordinary statements on behalf of another individual that I have \never witnessed.\n  Basically, Senator Inouye referred back to 1942, the year in which \nGeneral Shinseki was born. At that time, Senator Inouye was \nvolunteering to serve in the U.S. Army. It was a very personal and \nmoving statement, and I urge all Senators to look at it.\n  As chairman, I asked Senator Cleland to note his signature on the \nnomination of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, given his most \ndistinguished career as a soldier serving this Nation in the cause of \nfreedom.\n\n\n               Nomination Of Lt. Gen. James L. Jones, Jr.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I had the privilege of introducing on the \nsame day General Jones to become the next Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, succeeding General Krulak who discharged the responsibilities of \nthe Office of Commandant with great credit to the Nation and to \nhimself. He is a most distinguished officer. His father served in World \nWar II in the Marine Corps. His father served in the Pacific as a \nsenior three-star Marine officer just before I became Under Secretary \nof the Navy. The Krulak family is a proud family, and they have done \nmuch for our Nation and, indeed, for the Marine Corps.\n  General Jones served in the Senate in the Marine Corps liaison \noffice. Thereafter, he continued a most distinguished career. His last \npost as a lieutenant general was the principal military adviser--of \ncourse, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is the principal military \nadviser--but General Jones on the immediate staff of the Secretary of \nDefense, our former colleague, Mr. Cohen, was the principal adviser on \nhis personal staff.\n  This is recognition, again, of a distinguished marine who likewise \nhad a family member, an uncle, who was a highly decorated marine in \nWorld War II. It is continuity in the Corps for those like myself, I \nsay with great humility, who had the opportunity to serve at one time \nin the Marine Corps. It is a proud day today for the U.S. Marine Corps, \nfor the soon retirement of the most distinguished Commandant and \nsuccession of General Jones whose potential equals any Commandant who \never served in that office in the history of this country.\n  I asked that Senator Roberts pen his signature on the nomination of \nGeneral Jones to be Commandant. Again, Senator Roberts is a former \nmarine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/16/senate-section/article/S7159-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
