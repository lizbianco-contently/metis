Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4810, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany H.R. 4810, an act to \n     provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 103(a)(1) of \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 30 \nminutes equally divided for debate.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the provisions in this bill will help 45 million \nfamilies, and that is substantially every family in the U.S. Some of my \ncolleagues have argued that almost half of those families do not \ndeserve any tax relief. I reject that. I reject it because in my home \nstate of Delaware it would mean leaving over 30,000 families that \ncontributed to our ever-growing budget surplus out of family tax \nrelief. They contributed to the surplus and they should benefit from \nthe surplus.\n  Today's bill amounts to less than 5 percent of the total budget \nsurplus over the next 5 years. That is less than a nickel on the dollar \nof our total budget surplus. It amounts to just 9 percent of the total \nnon-Social Security surplus over the next 5 years. That is less than a \ndime on the dollar of the non-Social Security surplus. A nickel and a \ndime--by any comparison or estimation, this marriage tax relief is \nfiscally responsible. Those who dispute\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\nthat are themselves seeking to ``nickel-and-dime'' America's families \nout of tax relief.\n  I ask those who oppose this family tax relief: just how big will \nAmerica's budget surplus have to get before America's families deserve \nto receive some of their tax dollars back? If not now, when? If just 5 \npercent of the budget surplus and just 9 percent of the tax overpayment \nis too big a refund, how little should it be? How long do they have to \nwait? How hard do they have to work? How large an overpayment do they \nhave to make?\n  This bill is fair. We have addressed the three largest sources of \nmarriage tax penalties in the tax code--the standard deduction, the \nrate brackets, and the earned income credit. We have done so in a way \nthat does not create any new penalties--any new disincentives in the \ntax code. We have ensured that a family with one stay-at-home parent is \nnot treated worse for tax purposes than a family where both parents \nwork outside the home. This is an important principle because these are \nimportant families.\n  Finally, we have made this tax relief immediate for the current year. \nThat means when a couple files their tax return next April, they will \nbe able to see and feel the results of our work. As a result, I believe \nthat we should call this bill the ASAP tax relief bill for America's \ntaxpayers--tax relief for America's families now.\n  Despite the red flags thrown up by those who want to stand in the way \nof marriage tax relief, this bill actually makes the tax code more \nprogressive. As a result, families with incomes under $100,000 will \nreceive a proportionally larger tax cut.\n  There is no honest way people can claim that this bill is tilted \ntowards the rich. I believe that the real complaint of those who oppose \nthis bill is not that it is tilted towards the rich--because it is \nnot--but because it is tilted away from Washington.\n  While I would rather have seen the 28 percent bracket doubling \nincluded in the bill, its absence does do one thing. Its absence \nremoves any excuse for the President not to sign this bill. If \nPresident Clinton does not sign this bill, then there is only one \nexplanation. No matter how much the amount of surplus, no matter how \nmuch the size of the tax overpayment, no matter how high the overall \ntax burden, and no matter how much families deserve tax relief, it is \nall less important to him than the fact that Washington wants the money \nmore.\n  Mr. President, the time for excuses has passed, the time for family \ntax relief has come. Yet some in the White House still disagree. \nYesterday I received a letter from Treasury Secretary Summers in which \nhe tried to raise two new excuses that are as transparent as they are \nlate.\n  First, he tried to over-estimate the cost of the tax relief passed by \nCongress this year. Despite his exaggerated figures, when Congress \nsends this bill to the President it, along with the other bills we have \npassed, comprise just $120 billion worth of tax relief over the next 5 \nyears.\n  Second, there is only one bill before us today and there will be only \none bill when it arrives on his desk: family tax relief. When we look \nat this bill, we need to look at its actual provisions--not some \nconcocted estimate of what another Congress and another President will \ndo. Congress' official estimator scores this bill at under $90 billion \nfor both five and ten years. That is the accurate figure and that is \nthe appropriate measure of the tax relief before us today.\n  Despite what the President's advisers may wish, the issue is whether \nhe will or won't grant America's families the tax relief they have \nearned. Let's approve the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2000 and let's divorce the marriage tax penalty from the tax code once \nand for all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I first express my gratitude to \nour chairman who suggested that the 10 hours reserved for a conference \ncommittee report be reduced, in this case, to a half an hour in order \nthat we might continue with the Senate's business on appropriations, \nthe sooner to reach the issue of permanent normal trade relations with \nChina, which is a wholly admirable purpose with which I agree and \ncongratulate him.\n  Having said that, I cannot wholly recognize the legislation he \ndescribes. I cannot be entirely certain because, although I was a \nconferee, as appointed by the Senate, to the House-Senate conference on \nthe bill, I was never notified of any meeting, and all I really know \nabout this legislation is what I read in the newspapers.\n  I read this morning in the New York Times on the front page an \narticle by Richard W. Stevenson, a well-respected journalist, with the \nheadline: ``An Effort to Soften a Tax Cut Only Hardens the \nOpposition'':\n\n       Hoping to make it harder for President Clinton to veto a \n     measure they see as having tremendous political appeal, \n     Republicans have unveiled a new version of their tax cut for \n     married couples, but as the bill passed the House today, they \n     promptly found themselves under fire for making the bill cost \n     $44 billion more overnight.\n\n  Mr. President, $44 billion more overnight. The ways in which this \nhappened are obscure, but the outcome is clear. The House originally \npassed a $248 billion measure. This now is $292 billion, almost a third \nof a trillion dollars.\n  In the Finance Committee and on the floor, the Democratic Members \nmade the point that, yes, the marriage penalty needed to be addressed, \nand we had a measure, a device that was simplicity itself. We said in \none sentence: A couple is free to file jointly or singly, period.\n  There are 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code. The measure before \nus deals with one, half of another, and half of yet another, leaving, \nif you count, as you will, 62 or 63 untouched.\n  The most notorious and the most difficult, dealing directly with a \npalpable social problem, which is that of single parents, is the \nearned-income tax credit. In this morning's New York Times, also, there \nis an article by David Riemer, who is the Milwaukee director of \nadministration for the Wisconsin's welfare replacement program, which \nhas received very encouraging notices in recent years. It is entitled \n``The Marriage Tax on the Poor.'' He describes how this works.\n  The earned-income tax credit evolved in the aftermath of President \nNixon's effort to establish a guaranteed national income, family \nassistance plan, and Congress rejected that. The House passed it. The \nSenate did not. The Senate thought at least we should do something \nequivalent for people who work; hence, the earned-income tax credit. It \nhas been expanded over the years, and it is our most effective \nantipoverty program, period, if you describe poverty in terms of \nresources, of income.\n  I read one paragraph:\n\n       The earned-income tax credit's marriage penalty can be \n     huge. Imagine a young woman and the father of her two \n     children, living together as one household, unmarried but \n     hoping to wed. She earns $12,000 a year; he earns $20,000. \n     Under the tax rules, her credit is the maximum, $3,888. If \n     they marry, the mother's ``family earnings'' will rise from \n     $12,000 to $32,000. Her credit will go from $3,888 to zero--a \n     big loss of income for a couple of such modest earnings.\n\n  The bill before us does almost nothing about that, less than the bill \nthat left the floor in the middle of this week.\n  Our alternative measure is simplicity, one line, which says to that \ncouple, as to any other: By all means, get married and choose to file \njointly or separately. Separately, you retain the mother's earned-\nincome tax credit.\n  This is a great opportunity lost, part of a strategy to have lots of \nindividual tax cuts which will cumulate into an enormous tax cut. The \nPresident has said he will veto it. He should. We can get back to this \nnext year. Do the simple thing, the reasonable thing: Get rid of all \nmarriage tax penalties, 65 in all, and particularly those on the poor \nderiving a significant benefit from the earned-income tax credit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed, ``The Marriage \nTax on the Poor'' by David Riemer, in today's New York Times, be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the New York Times, Friday, July 21, 2000]\n\n                      The Marriage Tax on the Poor\n\n                           (By David Riemer)\n\n       Milwaukee.--Congress has agreed on a plan to eliminate the \n     ``Marriage penalty''\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\n     long embedded in our tax laws--the tax advantage that the \n     Internal Revenue Code now confers on couples who choose to \n     live together outside marriage, or who get divorced. The \n     House has voted to double the standard deduction and the \n     ceiling on the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples, \n     and the Senate is expected to follow suit.\n       Though President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill \n     because most of its benefits go to relatively well-off \n     couples, in the end he may find it hard to resist signing a \n     measure that is popular and is advertised as family-friendly.\n       But there's a big flaw in this supposed erasure of the \n     marriage penalty: It doesn't erase the marriage penalty. \n     Lawmakers have barely touched one of the tax law's biggest \n     and most socially damaging taxes on matrimony--the penalty \n     for people eligible for the earned-income tax credit.\n       This credit, which benefits the working poor, has done more \n     to reduce poverty than almost any other federal program. But \n     as workers' earnings rise, the tax code imposes a heavy fine \n     on marriage for millions of low-income workers with children.\n       The earned-income tax credit pays workers a maximum of \n     $2,353, or $3,888 if the worker has two or more children, but \n     this payment is gradually reduced once earnings increase \n     above $12,690, going down by 16 to 21 cents for each extra \n     dollar earned. The credit phases out entirely at $27,432 in \n     earnings, or $31,152 if there are two or more children.\n       The marriage penalty arises because the tax credit \n     calculations use family earnings, not individual earnings. If \n     a single mother lives with her boyfriend, his wages aren't \n     included in figuring her tax credit, since he is not \n     officially a part of her family. Should she marry him, their \n     real joint income will stay the same, but her official family \n     earnings will rise, and her tax credit will go down or \n     disappear.\n       The earned-income tax credit's marriage penalty can be \n     huge. Imagine a young woman and the father of her own \n     children, living together as one household, unmarried but \n     hoping to wed. She earns $12,000; he earns $20,000. Under the \n     tax rules, her credit is the maximum: $3,888.\n       If they marry, the mother's ``family earnings'' will rise \n     from $12,000 to $32,000. Her credit will go from $3,888 to \n     zero--a big loss of income for a couple of such modest \n     earnings.\n       If Congress is serious about eliminating the marriage \n     penalty in the tax code, it must fix the earned-income tax \n     credit as dramatically as it is fixing the standard deduction \n     and the tax brackets. This low-income marriage disincentive \n     probably turns away far more individuals from wedlock than \n     are discouraged by the other disincentives. Low-income \n     workers, who count every penny, are much more likely to avoid \n     marriages that will cost them dearly than are the high-\n     salaried live-ins that Congress has its eye on helping.\n       The Senate and House have agreed to trim the earned-income \n     tax credit's marriage penalty somewhat, for some couples, by \n     increasing the income levels where it applies by $2,000. But \n     most of the marriage penalty remains. The only real solution \n     is to reduce significantly the rate at which the tax credit \n     decreases as income goes up--in other words, to expand the \n     upper limit of eligibility. Such a change would cost the \n     Treasury more money, but it would make the distribution of \n     benefits more equitable. Why thwart the marital aspirations \n     of those who work for McDonald's and Walgreen's while \n     rewarding the ties that bind the middle class and rich?\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor. My friend from \nMassachusetts has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this vote is about our priorities as a \nnation. The price tag on this tax giveaway is almost exactly what we \nneed to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit to millions of \nsenior citizens who desperately need this help: $292 billion over the \nnext decade.\n  In the past week or so, our Republican friends have passed tax breaks \nthat total about a trillion dollars over the next ten years, benefiting \nthe wealthiest Americans. We don't just look at it over 5 years, we \nought to be looking at the consequences of this bill over a 10-year \nperiod, and even longer. And the record shows that the tax proposals \nare not what they are claimed to be.\n  This so-called marriage penalty tax break is a sham. Democrats \nstrongly support eliminating the marriage penalty in the tax laws, and \nour Democratic alternative will do that. But less than half the tax \nbreaks in the phony Republican bill are actually directed, as the \nSenator from New York pointed out, at the marriage penalty.\n  Once again, our Republican friends are using an attractive label like \n``marriage penalty'' as a cover for unjustified tax breaks for the \nwealthy at the expense of urgently needed priorities, such as \nprescription drug coverage for our senior citizens.\n  The Republican trillion dollar tax breaks for the wealthy mean: No \nMedicare prescription drug benefit for the Nation's senior citizens; no \nnew teachers for the Nation's schools; no increase in the minimum wage \nfor the Nation's hard-working, low-wage workers; no protections for \npatients across the Nation facing abuses by HMOs; nothing to make the \nNation's schools or our neighborhoods safer.\n  This tax break for the wealthy is a giant step in the wrong direction \nfor America. President Clinton is right to veto it.\n  Never in the history of the Senate has so much been given to so few, \nwith so little consideration for working families in America.\n  Mr. President, Republicans say that President Clinton himself called \nfor marriage penalty relief in the State of the Union address that he \ndelivered five months ago, so he should hurry and sign this bill. I \nwonder whether they heard the same speech that I heard last February. \nPresident Clinton certainly called for elimination of the marriage \npenalty, but he also urged action on other national priorities that are \nevery bit as important--a Medicare prescription drug benefit, support \nfor the nation's schools, and many other urgent national needs.\n  This is a do-nothing Republican Congress on all of these other \npriorities. The shamefully excessive single-minded focus has been on \ntax breaks for the wealthy, to the exclusion of all other major \npriorities. The GOP tax cuts already approved by this Congress will \nconsume about a trillion dollars of the projected surplus over the next \nten years. The bill that Republicans brought to the Senate today is a \nmarriage penalty in name only.\n  It fails to eliminate 62 of the 65 marriage penalties in the tax \ncode--while the Democrats' marriage penalty alternative eliminates \nevery single one.\n  In the interest of all Americans, President Clinton offered to \ncompromise and sign the Republican marriage penalty bill despite its \nshortcomings, but only if the Republican Congress made progress on at \nleast one of the other urgent needs facing the nation--prescription \ndrug coverage to end the unconscionable crisis that millions of senior \ncitizens face every day--the high cost of the drugs they need to \nsafeguard their health. The extraordinary promise of fuller and \nhealthier lives offered by new discoveries in medicine is often beyond \ntheir reach. They need help to afford the life-saving, life-changing \nmiracle drugs that are increasingly available.\n  Republicans in Congress have rejected this reasonable offer by the \nPresident and are still pursuing their irresponsible tax-cut agenda. \nRepublicans have eyes only for tax breaks. They've attached tax breaks \nto the minimum wage bill in the House, more tax breaks to the \nbankruptcy bill in the Senate, and still more tax breaks to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights in the House. They have tried to pass tax \nbreaks to subsidize private school. They even want to eliminate the \nestate tax, the ultimate tax break for the wealthy.\n  Earlier this week, the Republican leadership forced through the \nSenate a complete repeal of the estate tax which will cost over $50 \nbillion a year when fully implemented. Over 90 percent of the benefits \nin that bill will go to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. In total, \nRepublicans in the House and Senate have already passed tax cuts that \nwould consume almost a trillion dollars of the budget surplus over the \nnext ten years, and far more than that in the next decade, because \nthese GOP tax schemes are so backloaded to conceal their true cost to \nthe nation's future.\n  Fortunately, the nation has a President who will not hesitate to \nstamp ``veto'' on all of these irresponsible GOP giveaways. But what if \nwe had a President who would sign these monstrosities?\n\n  The American people have a basic choice to make in November. Do they \nwant the record budget surplus to be used for strengthening Social \nSecurity and Medicare--for providing a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare--and for improving our schools? Or do they want to give \ntrillions of dollars to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in \nthe nation?\n  These are the basic policy choices for what kind of America we want \nin the years ahead. Democrats do not oppose\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\ntax cuts, but we do insist that tax cuts must be reasonable in amount \nand must be fairly allocated to all Americans.\n  We also want action on other key priorities for the nation's future. \nTaking a trillion dollars out of the federal treasury for tax breaks \nclearly jeopardizes our ability to provide a prescription drug benefit \nfor Medicare. It jeopardizes our ability to fix crumbling schools, \nreduce class sizes, and ensure that teachers are properly trained. It \njeopardizes our ability to help the 4 million Americans who have no \nhealth insurance today because their employers won't provide it and \nthey can't afford it on their own.\n  Just one of the Republican bills--the repeal of the estate tax--will \ngive $250 billion to America's 400 wealthiest families over ten years. \n$250 billion will buy ten years of prescription drug coverage for \neleven million senior citizens who have no coverage now. Yet, these \nastronomical tax giveaways are being rammed through Congress by a right \nwing Republican majority in Congress bent on rewarding the wealthy and \nignoring the country's true priorities that have a far greater claim on \nthese resources.\n  The prosperous economy is helping many Americans. But those who work \nday after day at the minimum wage are falling farther and farther \nbehind. The number of families without health insurance is rising \nalarmingly.\n  A recent study by the pro-business Conference Board finds that the \nnumber of working poor is actually rising, in spite of the record \nprosperity. More and more working families are being forced to seek \nemergency help in soup kitchens and food pantries, and those charities \nare often unable to meet the increasing need. Yet Congress stands on \nthe sidelines.\n  The result of the GOP tax break frenzy is to crowd out necessary \nspending on priorities that the American people care most about. These \nother priorities for all Americans are being ignored by the GOP \nCongress in this unseemly stampede to enact tax breaks so heavily \nskewed to the wealthiest Americans. Never in the entire history of the \ncountry has so much been given away so quickly to so few, with so \nlittle semblance of fairness or even thoughtful consideration.\n  If we are serious about ending the marriage penalty, instead of using \nit as a fig leaf for enormous tax breaks for the wealthy, we can easily \ndo so at a reasonable cost that leaves ample room for other high \npriorities. I strongly support tax relief to end the marriage penalty. \nThe marriage penalty is unfair, and it should be eliminated.\n  But I do not support the GOP proposal. That proposal is a trojan \nhorse. Marriage penalty relief is not its real purpose. Only 42 percent \nof the tax benefits--less than half of the total--goes to persons \nsubject to the marriage penalty. The rest of the tax breaks--58 \npercent--go to those who pay no marriage penalty at all, and many of \nthem are actually receive what is called a marriage bonus under the \nlaw. Republicans who claim their bill is intended only to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty either haven't read the bill, or they are violating \nthe ``Truth in Advertising'' laws.\n\n  Most married couples today do not pay a marriage penalty. A larger \npercentage of couples actually receive a marriage bonus than pay a \nmarriage penalty. The marriage penalty is paid by couples in which both \nspouses work and also have relatively equal incomes. They deserve \nrelief from this penalty. They deserve it immediately, and we can \nprovide it modest cost.\n  But the Republican bill does not target its tax cuts to those who \nactually pay a marriage penalty. The cost of their bill is highly \ninflated and heavily backloaded to make the cost in the early years \nseem low. The current bill will cost nearly fifty billion dollars more \nover the next ten years than the bill which the Senate passed earlier \nthis week. In just three days, the price tag has risen from $248 \nbillion to $293 billion. That's an inflation rate which should alarm \nevery American.\n  As with all Republican tax breaks, the bill earmarks the overwhelming \nmajority of its tax benefits for the wealthiest taxpayers. The final \nbill sandpapers one of the roughest edges by deleting a provision that \nwould have solely benefitted taxpayers with six figure incomes. But the \noverall bill is still grossly unfair to middle and low income working \nfamilies. More than two thirds of the total tax savings go to the \nwealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers.\n  An honest plan to eliminate the marriage penalty could easily be \ndesigned at much lower cost. House Democrats offered such a plan, and \nso did Senate Democrats. Our Democratic proposal would cost $11 billion \na year less, when fully implemented, than the Republican plan, yet \nprovide more marriage penalty tax relief to middle income families.\n  The problem is obvious. Republican colleagues insist on using \nmarriage penalty relief as a cover for large tax breaks that have \nnothing to do with the marriage penalty and that are heavily weighted \nto the wealthiest individuals in the nation. The message to all \nAmericans is clear and unmistakable--Beware of Republicans bearing tax \ncuts. They're not what they seem, and they're not fair to the vast vast \nmajority of the American people.\n  This GOP Congress is a dream Congress for the very wealthy and their \nspecial interest friends, but it is a nightmare Congress for hard-\nworking families all across America. Whether the Republican tax breaks \narrive at the White House in smaller prices or in one big mess, their \ntrillion-dollar tax breaks will eminently deserve the veto that \nPresident Clinton is about to give them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I guess we are reading different bills \nhere. The bill that we have is a 5-year bill. It sunsets in 5 years. It \nis scored at $89 billion. At the end of 5 years, it sunsets. We don't \nknow what happens at the end of that. It is only on the 15-percent tax \nbracket. It doubles the standard deduction over a period of years from \n$26,250 per individual to $52,500. I hardly see how that is wealthy. It \nis 5 percent of the on-budget surplus, not Social Security. It does not \nsteal money from other priority programs. I guess I am confused. I \nguess he is talking about a different bill than I will vote on this \nmorning.\n  My final point is, this will pass with a large margin. It will pass \nwith over 60 votes. Then it is up to the President of the United States \nand the Vice President--President Clinton and Vice President Gore--\nwhether this tax cut will reach our working families across America. It \nwill be up to them. I call on them to sign this bill and not penalize \nour people across this country for the simple act of being married.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I keep hearing the Democrats talk \nabout tax breaks for the wealthy. I have talked to couples who make \n$30,000 apiece. I have asked them directly: Do you think that you are \nwealthy? Do you think that you do not send enough money to the \nGovernment? Do you think you are paying more than your fair share?\n  The answer is, they do not think they are wealthy. They do think they \nare doing their fair share. And they are trying to do something for \ntheir children that they will not be able to do if they send $1,400 \nmore to Washington, DC, instead of being able to save it for their \nchildren's education or taking a family vacation or giving them extra \ncomputers or books or clothes that they would want to have for their \nown families.\n  A couple that earns $30,000 each is not wealthy. We must understand \nthey are hard-working Americans. Many times the spouse who wants to \nstay home to help their children does not do so because they think they \nneed to work to bring in the extra income. We are talking about tax \nrelief for the hardest hit among us--people who make $25,000 a year, \n$30,000 a year, $40,000 a year. They are paying 28 percent in Federal \nincome taxes. And they do not think they are wealthy. They earn this \nmoney, and they deserve to keep more of it.\n  We are talking about 50 million Americans who would benefit from the\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\ntax relief we are giving today. Twenty-five million couples will get \nrelief from the marriage tax penalty.\n  Over 60 percent of the House of Representatives voted to pass this \nbill. Over 60 percent of the Senate will vote to pass this bill. Is the \nPresident going to fly in the face of the elected Representatives--in \nthose numbers--who want to give relief to hard-working Americans?\n\n  If we were saying that this was going to take up all of the surplus, \nthat we were not going to be able to pay down debt this year, that \nwould be one thing. That is not the case. Instead, we are being good \nstewards of our taxpayer dollars. We are putting a fence around the \nSocial Security surplus so that it stays in Social Security. We are \ngoing to pay down the debt by billions this year.\n  But we think it is time to return to the people who earn the money \nmore of the money they earn to keep for the decisions in their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, tear down this unfair tax. It is time to have a tax \ncorrection for the hard-working married couples in this country.\n  We are sending the bill to the President today to do just that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as we say, ``yea'' today on this historic \nvote, Congress pays its respects to the venerable institution of \nmarriage. It is as simple as that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this issue is really quite simple. It is \nunfortunate that it has been confused by lots of statements, which are \nsomewhat true but not entirely true.\n  The goal here is to eliminate the marriage tax penalty. Remember, \nthere is nothing in the code that we enacted to create the penalty. It \nwas not an intentional act. It is just a consequence of the way the \ncode has worked. It is a necessary consequence if we want to have \nprogressive tax rates and also have the same taxation for American \ncitizens with the same income.\n  We also have to remind ourselves that there is a bonus in the Tax \nCode; that is, certain people who get married get a bonus. In fact, \nthere are more taxpayers receiving a bonus than there are taxpayers who \nreceive a penalty. That is indisputable. That is a solid fact. But we \nare here to try to find a way to help eliminate the marriage tax \npenalty for those who get a penalty as a consequence of getting \nmarried.\n  There are two approaches here. One is the approach by the majority, \nand one is the approach by the Democratic side of the aisle. The \nmajority eliminates only 3 of the 65 provisions in this code that \ncreate a penalty--only 3. The Democratic proposal eliminates them all, \nall 65. There is a big difference between the two.\n  In the Democratic alternative, taxpayers have the right to choose. \nThey can choose which way to file their taxes so it benefits them. On \nthe majority side, the taxpayer does not have a choice. That is just \nthe way it is.\n  I might also say, if we say we are going to pass marriage tax penalty \nrelief, we should pass marriage tax penalty relief. That is what the \nDemocrats have tried to do. The Republicans are doing some of that--\nalbeit only 3 out of the 65--but they are also giving a tax cut, \nirrespective of marriage, which widens the disparity between married \ncouples and singles.\n  A lot of single people in this country, when they see what is passed \nby the majority party, are going to wonder what in the world is \nhappening. Why are we giving the 60 percent of married people who don't \neven have a marriage penalty such a big tax break and not giving a tax \nbreak to them simply because they are single? That is not fair at all. \nAgain, the Democratic proposal says, we will give a break, a true break \nfor marriage, but not widen the discrepancy between marrieds and \nsingles.\n  The long and short is, we have a conference report. The battle has \nbeen waged and the battle is over.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Has he seen the conference report?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my good friend from New York, no, I have not. I \nhave heard there is one, but I have not seen one.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Did the Senator hear there was a conference?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I heard there was, but I don't know who was there.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well, I am a conferee, and, while I heard there was a \nconference, I wasn't told about any meetings.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That sometimes happens. Conferees on our side of the \naisle hear of a conference, but they are never asked to attend.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. This is one such instance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that has \nhappened under this Republican majority.\n  To sum it up, Mr. President, we on this side are definitely for tax \ncuts, very significant tax cuts. We are for eliminating entirely the \nmarriage tax penalty. We want to reduce the Federal estate tax \ndramatically. But it is unfortunate that the conference report before \nus goes way too far. It is unbalanced. It is unfair. If the American \npeople truly see all the components of it, compare it to all the other \ntax provisions going through here, I think they will say: Wait a \nminute, this is kind of a funny thing the Congress is doing. It is not \nwhat they say it is. Why don't they fess up and be honest and say what \nis really in the conference report.\n  That is sometimes the way this place operates. It is up to us on this \nside of the aisle to get the facts out, to allow more sun to shine on \nthe conference report so that more married American people will know \nexactly what is in it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 4 minutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the Senator 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has only 3 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will take the 3 minutes then. I thank \nmy colleague.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 1 minute from our \nside.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think the world of my colleague from \nNew York, and I am very grateful.\n  I want to make a couple comments. First, I compliment Senator Roth. \nThis is really his proposal. He is greatly responsible for making this \nhappen. He introduced this in the Finance Committee, and it is going to \npass today. I hope, and will even say I expect, it will become law. It \nwill be a shame if it doesn't become law.\n  I also compliment Senator Hutchison for her leadership, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Santorum, and Senator Abraham. \nThey have been working tirelessly on this. They have been pushing in \ncaucuses and conferences. They said: We need to pass marriage penalty \nrelief. We have a chance to do that today. I thank the House leaders \nfor doing it.\n  I heard some people saying they are against this. I heard my friends \nspeak against it. They kept saying it is $290 billion. It is not. We \nare voting today on a $90 billion tax cut, period. Those are the facts. \nIf it is to be extended--and I hope it will be--Congress is going to \nhave to pass another bill, and it is going to have to be signed by a \nPresident, a different President. That is another action. That may \nhappen 3 or 4 years from now. I hope it does. We will have to see what \nthe circumstances are at that time. The bill we have before us is $90 \nbillion.\n  I read the President's letter--at least it came from his Secretary of \nthe Treasury--which said: We provided significant marriage penalty \nrelief. In his bill, in his budget proposal, he has a $9 billion tax \nincrease for next year--not a tax cut, a $9 billion tax increase. His \nmarriage penalty relief over the next 5 years is $9 billion. It doesn't \ndo it. It won't work. It won't happen. He has more tax increases in the \nfirst year than tax cuts. Over 5 years, he has a net tax cut of only $5 \nbillion.\n  We are going to have a surplus of $1.8 trillion in the next 5 years, \n$4.5 trillion over the next 10. The only tax cut we are talking about \nright now is marriage penalty relief totaling $90 billion. That figure \nloses people.\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\n  Let's talk about what it means for families. Some people say this \ntargets the wealthy. That is not true. People are entitled to their own \nopinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts. The fact is \nwhat we do is double the standard deduction, $4,400 for an individual, \n$8,800 for a couple. The fact is, people pay taxable income up to \n$26,000, an individual at 15 percent. That is $26,000. We say for \ncouples, that should be $52,000. We double it for couples, whether both \nare working or not. We don't penalize stay-at-home spouses. The \nDemocrat proposal provided no relief for stay-at-home spouses. We say \nthe 15-percent bracket should be twice as much for couples, income \nadjusted, as it is for individuals. So we don't penalize people if they \nhappen to stay at home.\n  We provide tax relief for millions of American families. How much? It \nis a couple hundred. By doubling the standard deduction, that is a \ncouple hundred dollars for all married couples. Then by doubling the \n15-percent rate, that equals the $1,125, if somebody makes up to \n$52,000. That is the maximum benefit. The maximum benefit is basically \n$1,125 if somebody makes up to $52,000. It is weighted towards the low-\nincome people, middle-income people. There are millions of American \nfamilies with one or two wage earners making $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, \nwho will save $1,300, $1,350, if this becomes law. The only reason it \nwon't become law is if the President vetoes it.\n  I urge the President to sign this bill and provide marriage penalty \nrelief as he said he would.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. My friend and colleague gave me a nice note. The other \nday I said if I am factually incorrect, I will eat this paper. He gave \nme a paper that was a March proposal; the proposal we passed in the \nSenate was $56 billion. The proposal we will pass today is $90 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am afraid my time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in the best economic and budget times in \nour country's history, I believe that we should provide American \nfamilies with tax relief. That is why I supported this bill when it \npassed the Senate earlier this week, and that is why I will vote for it \nagain today.\n  But I vote today knowing that this bill will be vetoed by the \nPresident. Everyone here knows that. I hope that passage here today \nwill lead to the kind of eventual compromise between the President and \nCongress--maybe a grand compromise that will include a prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare--that we can all support.\n  If that kind of compromise is not reached, Mr. President, I will vote \nto sustain that veto.\n  Since we voted just a few days go, the cost of this bill has gone up \nover $40 billion--that is the wrong direction. I still prefer an \nalternative that would cost less and that would be better targeted at \nthe marriage penalty and at those families with the greatest need, one \nthat would give families more flexibility to deal with their own \ncircumstances.\n  Passage of this bill today is the beginning of the debate on this \nissue, Mr. President, not the end.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this conference report is evidence of a \nmissed opportunity. It is, in fact, yet another in what is becoming a \nseries of missed opportunities. Today, the majority is missing the \nopportunity to enact marriage penalty relief.\n  The majority is missing that opportunity by insisting on its poorly-\ntargeted, expensive tax breaks. It is missing that opportunity by \nrejecting the better-targeted, more responsible Democratic alternative. \nAnd it is missing that opportunity by rejecting President Clinton's \noffer to enact both marriage penalty relief and prescription drug \nbenefits.\n  Everyone in this chamber wants marriage penalty relief. The question \nnow is how we transform that wish into law.\n  By presenting the Senate with this conference report, the majority \nshows that it would rather have marriage penalty relief next year than \nthis year. For now, they appear to prefer an old issue to a new law.\n  The majority continues today to pass poorly-targeted, expensive tax \nbreaks. Earlier this week, the Treasury Department released a study \nthat analyzed all the major tax cuts that the majority has passed in \nthis Congress this year to date.\n  That study found that more than three-fourths of the benefits of the \nRepublican tax bills would go to the best-off fifth of the population--\nthose making more than $82,000.\n  The study found that those in the best-off fifth of the population \nwould get an average tax cut of more than $2,000 a year, while those in \nthe middle fifth would get less than $200. Republicans want to spend 10 \ntimes as much on the best-off than on middle-income families.\n  The study found that almost half of the benefits of the Republican \ntax bills would go to the best-off 5 percent, those with incomes over \n$150,000.\n  The study found that more than a quarter of the benefits of the \nRepublican tax bills would go to the best-off one percent--those with \nincomes over $346,000--who would get an average tax cut of more than \n$15,000 a year.\n  And as an op-ed piece in this morning's New York Times by Milwaukee \ndirector of administration David Riemer points out, the conference \nreport before us today fails to solve the marriage penalty for working \nfamilies who get the Earned Income Tax Credit. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that this op-ed be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  And yesterday, the Joint Committee on Taxation released distribution \ntables on the conference report before us today. Those tables indicate \nthat in 2004, nearly four-fifths of this conference report's benefits \nwould go to those with incomes over $75,000. The conference report's \nbenefits are thus more skewed to the better off than the Senate bill we \nconsidered earlier this week. In the Senate bill, 68 percent of \nbenefits in 2004 would have gone to the best-off, while in the \nconference report, 79 percent would.\n  And because the majority's bills are so poorly targeted, they cost \nmore than they should. The conference report before us today would join \nthe other bills passed to date, spending more than it should because it \ngives more to the very well-off than it should. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, the conference report before us today would \nspend $34 billion more than the costly bill that the Senate considered \nearlier this week.\n  Wednesday, the White House estimated that the tax bills considered by \nthe House and Senate this year to date have already sought to spend \nroughly $700 billion over the next 10 years, a price tag that would \nincrease to $850 billion when one accounts for financing costs on the \ndebt. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nPresident's Chief of Staff on this subject be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The majority continues today to reject the better-targeted, more \nresponsible Democratic alternative. The Democratic alternative would \nhave focused its relief on those who actually endure a marriage \npenalty. That is, after all, how the majority chose to name the bill \nbefore us. The Democratic alternative would have held the majority to \nits word. It was a truth-in-advertising amendment.\n  The majority shows again today that they did not really want to cure \nthe marriage penalty. That is not what most of this conference report \ndoes. Three-fifths of the benefits of this conference report go to \npeople who do not experience marriage penalties. And that's another \nreason why this conference report costs more than it should.\n  The majority shows again today that it does not really want to enact \na law to relieve the marriage penalty. By moving this conference \nreport, the majority rejects President Clinton's offer to work out an \nagreement that would allow enactment of both marriage penalty relief \nand needed coverage for prescription drugs on the other. That's what \nthe majority could have done if it really wanted to enact marriage \npenalty relief this year.\n  Sadly, by bringing this conference report before us today, the \nmajority shows that what it really wants is\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\nsomething that the President will have to veto right before the \nRepublican Convention. The enterprise upon which they have embarked has \nmore of theater than of law about it.\n  The President will veto this bill, and he should. The majority should \npass better-targeted marriage penalty relief, but apparently they'd \nrather not.\n  They miss another opportunity today. Mr. President, I hope they do \nnot miss the next one.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial and letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Marriage Tax on the Poor\n\n                           (By David Riemer)\n\n       Congress has agreed on a plan to eliminate the ``marriage \n     penalty'' long embedded in our tax laws--the tax advantage \n     that the Internal Revenue Code now confers on couples who \n     choose to live together outside of marriage, or who get \n     divorced. The House has voted to double the standard \n     deduction and the ceiling on the 15 percent tax bracket for \n     married couples, and the Senate is expected to follow suit.\n       Though President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill \n     because most of its benefits go to relatively well-off \n     couples, in the end he may find it hard to resist signing a \n     measure that is popular and is advertised as family-friendly.\n       But there's a big flaw in this supposed erasure of the \n     marriage penalty: It doesn't erase the marriage penalty. \n     Lawmakers have barely touched one of the tax law's biggest \n     and most socially damaging taxes on matrimony--the penalty \n     for people eligible for the earned-income tax credit.\n       This credit, which benefits the working poor, has done more \n     to reduce poverty than almost any other federal program. But \n     as workers' earnings rise, the tax code imposes a heavy fine \n     on marriage for millions of low-income workers with children.\n       The eared-income tax credit pays workers a maximum of \n     $2,353, or $3,888 if the worker has two or more children, but \n     this payment is gradually reduced once earnings increase \n     above $12,690, going down by 16 to 21 cents for each extra \n     dollar earned. The credit phases out entirely at $27,432 in \n     earnings, or $31,152 if there are two or more children.\n       The marriage penalty arises because the tax credit \n     calculations use family earnings, not individual earnings. If \n     a single mother lives with her boyfriend, his wages aren't \n     included in figuring her tax credit, since he is not \n     officially a part of her family. Should she marry him, their \n     real joint income will stay the same, but her official family \n     earnings will rise, and her tax credit will go down or \n     disappear.\n       The earned-income tax credit's marriage penalty can be \n     huge. Imagine a young woman and the father of her two \n     children, living together as one household, unmarried but \n     hoping to wed. She earns $12,000; he earns $20,000. Under the \n     tax rules, her credit is the maximum: $3,888.\n       If they marry, the mother's ``family earnings'' will rise \n     from $12,000 to $32,000. Her credit will go from $3,888 to \n     zero--a big loss of income for a couple of such modest \n     earnings.\n       If Congress is serious about eliminating the marriage \n     penalty in the tax code, it must fix the earned-income tax \n     credit as dramatically as it is fixing the standard deduction \n     and the tax brackets. This low-income marriage disincentive \n     probably turns away far more individuals from wedlock than \n     are discouraged by the other disincentives. Low-income \n     workers, who count every penny, are much more likely to avoid \n     marriages that will cost them dearly than are the high-\n     salaried live-ins that Congress has its eye on helping.\n       The Senate and House have agreed to trim the earned-income \n     tax credit's marriage penalty somewhat, for some couples, by \n     increasing the income levels where it applies by $2,000. But \n     most of the marriage penalty remains. The only real solution \n     is to reduce significantly the rate at which the tax credit \n     decreases as income goes up--in other words, to expand the \n     upper limit of eligibility. Such a change would cost the \n     Treasury more money, but it would make the distribution of \n     benefits more equitable. Why thwart the marital aspirations \n     of those who work for McDonald's and Walgreen's while \n     rewarding the ties that bind the middle class and rich?\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: The President is increasingly concerned \n     about the spending binge under way in Congress as we approach \n     the summer recess. With the political conventions drawing \n     near, both the House and the Senate are voting every day on \n     bills that deplete the projected budget surplus at a rapid \n     rate.\n       In the last few weeks, the House and Senate have already \n     considered tax bills that spend roughly $700 billion of our \n     surpluses over the next ten years, a price tag that will \n     increase to $850 billion when we account for financing costs \n     on the debt. Moreover, Republican leaders promise that these \n     tax cuts are a mere a ``down-payment'' on massive, trillion-\n     dollar tax breaks to come. At the same time, Congress has \n     passed several spending bills that have exceeded the \n     President's request.\n       It is time to answer some simple questions about this tax \n     and spending frenzy: what does it all cost, and can we afford \n     it? The President's budget team cannot, in good conscience, \n     advise the President to sign various spending or tax bills \n     until we have a fuller accounting of Congress's overall \n     spending plans for the year. Let me be clear: Congress has \n     embarked on a course to obliterate a surplus that is the \n     hard-won product of nearly eight years of fiscal discipline. \n     We cannot and will not let that happen.\n       Fiscal discipline has been critical to the prosperity we \n     enjoy today, and prosperity in turn has created a brighter \n     outlook for tomorrow's budget surpluses. But projections are \n     simply that--projections. Now is not the time to abandon \n     responsible budgeting by spending money before it even comes \n     in the door. Congress should provide the American people with \n     a more complete accounting of just how much it intends to \n     spend this year.\n       We can cut taxes for the middle class, while maintaining \n     fiscal discipline and making critical investments in our \n     future. The President's budget does just that--strengthening \n     Social Security and modernizing Medicare with a prescription \n     drug benefit, while cutting taxes for education, retirement, \n     and health care and paying off the debt by 2012. The right \n     way to get things done is to work together within a balanced \n     framework so that we honor our commitment to fiscal \n     discipline.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John Podesta,\n                                  Chief of Staff to the President.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today, the Senate passed the Conference \nReport reflecting the agreement between the House and Senate to provide \nneeded relief to American families from the onerous marriage tax \npenalty. I am pleased to support this agreement.\n  For too long, the current tax code has been at war with our values, \npenalizing the basic social institution: marriage. The American people \nknow that this is unfair--they know it is not right that the code \npenalizes marriage.\n  25 million American couples pay an average of approximately $1,400 in \nmarriage penalty annually as a result of the marriage penalty. Ending \nthis penalty will give couples the freedom to make their own choices \nwith their money.\n  The conference agreement between the House and the Senate will make \nthe standard deduction for married couples double that of singles. This \nis especially important to families that do not itemize their tax \nreturns. It will also make the 15 percent tax bracket double the size \nof that for single people and fix the marriage penalties associated \nwith the Alternative Minimum Tax and the Earned Income Credit. Doubling \nthe 15 percent tax bracket for married couples will benefit all married \ncouples. It is just and fair that all couples benefit from this bill, \nwhether one spouse works outside the home, or both do so. Most \nimportantly, it will begin to provide this much-needed relief this \nyear, so that the American people will see that their government \nrecognizes and values the institution of marriage.\n  The President has indicated that he will veto this bill. That is \nunfortunate. If the President is truly for ending the marriage penalty, \nas he has said, he will sign this bipartisan bill, which passed with \nthe support of 60 percent of the House of Representatives. The Senate \nhas also voted on this bill in a bipartisan manner, approving the \nConference Report by a vote of 60-34. I hope the President will change \nhis mind and join us in bringing this historic tax relief to American \nfamilies.\n  This bill will help 830,000 couples in Missouri, couples like Bruce \nand Kay Morton, from Camdenton, MO, who have written to me and asked \nfor me to help bring an end to this unfair penalty. With this \nconference agreement, the House and Senate stand united in trying to \nhelp couples like the Mortons. I respectfully ask the President to join \nus.\n  This conference agreement demonstrates our support for an important \nprinciple: that families should not be taxed extra because they are \nmarried. Couples choosing marriage are making the right choice for \nsociety. It is in our interest to encourage them to make this choice.\n  Unfortunately, the marriage penalty discourages this choice. I \nbelieve that the government, in its policies, should uphold the basic \nvalues that give strength and vitality to our culture. Marriage is one \nof those values, and it\n\n[[Page S7416]]\n\nis time for the government to stop punishing this value.\n  The marriage penalty has endured for too long and harmed too many \ncouples. It is time to abolish the prejudice that charges higher taxes \nfor being married. It is time to take the tax out of saying ``I do.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, let me say this vote on the \nmarriage penalty represents a great victory for working Americans. I \nthink we can all take great satisfaction that, for the typical \nAmerican, it will mean something like $1,300 to $1,500 in a tax cut.\n  I thank my friends and colleagues who supported this legislation. I \nthink it is only fair, it is only right. I believe this has, indeed, \nbeen a great week for the working people of America.\n  Mr. President, it has been a busy two weeks for the Members of the \nSenate Finance Committee and our staff. I would like to take a moment \nto thank the staff who worked on this conference report and also H.R. \n8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000.\n  With respect to both bills, I thank John Duncan, my Administrative \nAssistant.

Presnell, of Florida, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Middle District of Florida.\n       James S. Moody, Jr., of Florida, to be United States \n     District Judge for the Middle District of Florida.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF DENNIS CAVANAUGH\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Dennis Cavanaugh to the United States District Court for \nNew Jersey, and I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed him.\n  Dennis Cavanaugh has compiled an impressive record in both the public \nand private sectors. He has consistently demonstrated the efficiency, \nfairness and compassion that we have come to expect from our federal \njurists. And he will be a tremendous asset as a district judge.\n  Since 1993, he has served as a magistrate judge. In that position, he \nhas handled a number of difficult and complex cases. His current duties \ninclude managing all the civil cases assigned to two active district \njudges and half of the civil cases assigned to a senior district judge. \nThat brings his total workload to more than 600 cases.\n  In fulfilling these duties, Magistrate Cavanaugh has shown the strong \nwork ethic that is essential for judges who are called on to handle \nliterally hundreds of cases at a time.\n  Magistrate Cavanaugh's legal career also includes several years of \nservice as a public defender--from 1973 until 1977. After that, he \nentered private practice as a trial attorney handling civil litigation \nand some criminal cases. And he has been a partner with several \ndistinguished firms in New Jersey.\n  His clients have included small businesses, educational institutions, \ninsurance companies, public entities and police benevolent \nassociations. And his experience with such a broad range of interests \nis one of the reasons he has performed so effectively as a magistrate \njudge.\n  Magistrate Cavanaugh has also done his part to help ease the \ncaseloads overwhelming other judges. He volunteered for pro bono \nassignments at the\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\nSuperior Court in Essex County, where there was a severe backlog of \ncivil cases.\n  In addition to his judicial duties, Magistrate Cavanaugh also finds \ntime to teach as an adjunct professor at his alma mater, Seton Hall \nUniversity School of Law in Newark.\n  That is the kind of experience and energy that has made New Jersey's \nfederal bench one of the most impressive in the country. Magistrate \nCavanaugh's entire career reflects the integrity and dedication that we \nwant to see in all our federal judges. And I know his service on the \ndistrict court bench will be equally outstanding.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed Magistrate Cavanaugh's \nnomination. With his confirmation, there will be no vacancies on New \nJersey's district court. I thank Chairman Hatch for moving this \nnomination so expeditiously, and I thank all of my colleagues for their \nsupport of Magistrate Cavanaugh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7417-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee for not giving up on marriage tax penalty \nrelief for hard-working American families. He deserves praise because \nthere is no doubt this has been a rugged road.\n  We passed marriage tax penalty relief last year and sent it to the \nPresident in a bill that had other tax relief measures. The President \nsaid: No, that is too much tax relief for the American people; send me \nsmaller bills.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Roth, and with the help of our \ndistinguished assistant majority leader, Don Nickles, Sam Brownback, \nJohn Ashcroft, Spencer Abraham, Rod Grams, together as a team we said \nwe were going to send the President a clean marriage tax penalty relief \nbill; we were going to make sure that hard-working American families \nwho are paying a penalty for being married got relief this year. That \nis the result of what we have done today.\n  Sixty percent of the Senate today is sending this bill to the \nPresident. Over 60 percent of the House passed the same bill this week. \nWe say to the President: You asked us to send you a smaller bill, and \nwe are doing it.\n  Most of us wanted to give tax relief in a bigger way. We wanted to go \nall the way through the 28-percent bracket, but the President said no. \nWe came back with 15 percent, doubling of the standard deduction \nthrough the 15-percent bracket. What that means is a couple earning \nbetween $43,000 and $52,000 combined will stay in the 15-percent \nbracket. If one person in a couple makes $25,000 a year and the other \nmakes $35,000 a year, they will stay in the 15-percent bracket longer.\n\n  It means tax relief for every American couple. Every American couple \nwho uses the standard deduction is going to get relief because that \nstandard deduction is doubled. Fifty million people in our country will \nget tax relief if the President signs the bill.\n  We are increasing the amount of the earned-income tax credit because \nwe believe married couples who have just come off welfare or who are \nthe working poor deserve that earned-income tax credit so they know \nthat working is better than being on welfare. We want them to have the \nincentive to do that. We want them to have the pride of going to work \nand contributing to their families every day because we know they think \nbetter of themselves when they do that.\n  I do not see how President Clinton can use an excuse to veto the bill \nwe are sending him today. I do not see what excuse remains. We have \ntaken all of the excuses off the table.\n  He said in his State of the Union Message to Congress and to the \nAmerican people he favored marriage tax penalty relief. We sent him a \nbill last year; he vetoed it. He said there were too many other tax \ncuts in the bill. Today, we are sending him a plain, simple marriage \ntax penalty relief bill for hard-working Americans who earn in the \n$25,000 to $35,000 range of income. That is who will benefit.\n  I have heard people on the other side say that this is a tax cut for \nthe rich. There is no way anyone who has visited in the home of a \ncouple, each of whom make $25,000 a year, can say that those people are \nrich. We say they have earned this money and we want them to keep more \nof the money they earn. The fundamental difference is we believe the \nmoney that people earn belongs to them. We do not believe it belongs to \nthe Federal Government.\n  We have a non-Social Security surplus. This is only letting them keep \nmore of the money they earn rather than sending it to Washington \nbecause we are being good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars today. We \nare setting aside the Social Security surplus for Social Security only, \nwe are paying down the debt, and we are giving back to the people part \nof the money they earned if the President will sign the bill.\n  This week has been a good week for hard-working Americans, for small \nbusiness people, and for people who own farms and ranches because we \nhave given relief from the death tax to small businesses and family-\nowned farms so their heirs will not have to sell that business and put \npeople out of jobs, and we have given marriage tax penalty relief.\n  This is the right thing to do, and I urge the President of the United \nStates to hear 60 percent of the Senate and 63 percent of the House of \nRepresentatives who said they believe in marriage tax penalty relief, \nand we urge the President of the United States to sign this bill and \ngive relief to Americans today because this will take effect \nimmediately.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the Senate just passed the Marriage \nPenalty Tax Relief Reconciliation Act by 60 votes. Sixty percent of the \nSenate voted in favor of eliminating the marriage penalty tax. Now it \nis up to the President and the Vice President--President Clinton and Al \nGore--whether or not we will continue to tax marriage in America. This \nrelief is available now to more than 50 million Americans. The \nPresident and the Vice President decide whether this is going to become \nlaw. All that remains for this legislation to become law is the \nPresident's signature. He is the one who can decide. He is the one who \nwill decide, along with the Vice President, whether or not the marriage \npenalty will be eliminated. It is on their desk. It is up to the \nPresident. He is the one who decides.\n  He said he is for it. He said it during the State of the Union \nmessage. Now he will have a chance to go ahead and act and sign the \nbill. I say to the President yet again: Sign this into law.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, \nwho has done wonderful work, yeoman work on getting this bill passed. I \ncongratulate the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, who has waged a \ncrusade for several years, seeing this was wrong in the Tax Code, and \nhas fought diligently to get this done. I thank the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Ashcroft, for his work in pushing this over a period of \ntime. Now we are close to getting it done. We are almost there. It is \ntime to be able to do it. We have the wherewithal. It is time. The \nPresident and the Vice President will decide whether or not this \nbecomes law.\n  I want to cite what is in the bill so that people know what is there. \nI know we have been through this a number of times, but just to make \nsure people are clear what we are doing, we are doubling the standard \ndeduction; we eliminate the penalty there. The current standard \ndeduction is $4,400 for singles. For couples it is $7,350. We just \ndouble it. We make it $8,800 for married couples. It seems only fair \nthat for two people you should have a standard deduction that would be \ndouble what it is for one person.\n\n[[Page S7418]]\n\n  In the 15-percent tax bracket, for a married couple filing, we double \nthe income amount. Currently, a single taxpayer, hits the top of the \n15-percent bracket when they make over $26,250. If it is a couple, they \nhit the top when they earn $43,850. We say that is not fair. If it is \ntwo people, it should be double what it is for one, so we move it up to \n$52,500.\n  Those are the two main features of this bill. That is the big end of \nthe bill. It is taking a standard deduction from $4,400 for a single \nand that is now $7,350 for a married couple and saying we will make it \n$8,800. We are saying on the 15-percent bracket, which is the one we \nhit here, we are saying right now that if you are a couple, that you \nhit the top of that bracket at $43,850, even though it is $26,250 for a \nsingle person. We are saying if you are a married couple, we will move \nit up to $52,500. That is the guts of the bill.\n  Then on the earned-income tax credit, we increase the phaseout by \n$2,000 for a married couple so that low-income individuals don't hit \nthat same marriage penalty.\n  Those are the three main features. That is what was passed. That is \nwhat 60 Senators and 63 percent of the House voted for. That is now \nwhat is in front of the President.\n  Some people say it costs too much--$89 billion. This is a 5-year tax \nbill. It sunsets after 5 years--$89 billion. It is 5 percent of the on-\nbudget surplus. Setting the Social Security surplus aside, just leaving \nwhat is still the on-budget surplus, it is only 5 percent. That is all \nit is. Some people say we should be using it for debt reduction. This \nyear, we will pay down the national debt--the debt, not the deficit--we \nwill pay down the national debt about $200 billion. We will buy down \nthe national debt this year by $200 billion, probably the most in the \nhistory of the United States. I haven't looked up the actual number, \nbut it is probably the most in real terms, $200 billion of debt buy-\ndown.\n  The simple point here is there are no excuses remaining for the \nPresident not to sign this into law. There is no excuse on debt \nreduction. There is no excuse that it is too expensive. There is no \nexcuse that it is just for the wealthy. All of those are false \nstatements. There is just no substance to them. There is no excuse for \nhim to deny 25 million American families this tax cut. I wouldn't even \ncall it a tax cut. I think the Senator from Texas has it right. It is a \ntax correction.\n  Should we tax marriage more than we are taxing single people, when we \nare having so much trouble with the family in the country? We ought to \ngive them a bonus to encourage family values.\n  This is a big day for this body. This is a major piece of \nlegislation. It has cleared Congress. It has cleared through the House; \nit has cleared through the Senate. It now sits on the desk of the \nPresident; for the President and Vice President of the United States to \ndecide. They can be heroes. They can sign this bill into law or they \ncan say, no, we are going to veto this piece of legislation.\n  I hope they will say, no, we don't want to send a signal to the \nmarried people of America that we think they ought to be taxed.\n  Democrats offered an alternative. It was a fine alternative, but it \ncreated a homemaker penalty that if you had one wage earner, but a \nsecond spouse who decided to stay home to take care of older parents \nand children, it actually taxed them more. So you had a homemaker \npenalty that was put into the Democratic alternative. It had a number \nof positive things about it, but the last thing we want to do is to say \nto people: Well, we really don't value somebody who stays at home to \ntake care of family members, young or old, or other friends.\n  I think we ought to say this is a critical thing. We don't want to \nsend the signal that we are going to tax in that situation. That is why \nwe have worked out over the years all the problems in this bill.\n  I don't know what the President will come up with in vetoing it, but \nit has been a great bipartisan majority that has passed this bill; \nsixty votes, a number of our Democratic colleagues joining us on this \nbill that has now passed.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in honoring \nthe memory of our dear friend and colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell. My \ndeepest condolences and prayers go out to Nancy, his family, staff, and \nthe people of Georgia.\n  Paul Coverdell's career in public service as a state senator in \nGeorgia, as Director of the United States Peace Corps, and as a U.S. \nSenator stand as an enduring tribute to his fine character, many \ntalents, and boundless energy and commitment for his work. They also \nserve to remind us how one individual, working quietly and \nresourcefully, can accomplish so much in an all too brief period of \ntime.\n  In his public life, Paul Coverdell was a vigorous and congenial \nadvocate for initiatives and issues he cared deeply about and an \neffective leader in the Senate and for his party. While I did not have \nmany opportunities to work closely with Senator Coverdell, we share a \ncommitment to quality education for our Nation's young people and \nappreciation for the importance of agriculture to our respective \nStates' economies. Peanut farmers and sugar growers are frequent allies \nwhen commodity issues came before the Senate, and Senator Coverdell was \na strong voice for Georgia farmers and his State's agricultural \ninterests. On educational initiatives, Paul Coverdell and I rarely \nagreed; but he was never disagreeable. I admired his passion and \ntenacity on education issues, and appreciated the courtesy and humanity \nthat characterized his work here in the Senate.\n  Paul Coverdell has left a mark for the better in the lives of \nmillions of people, in America and around the world. He served his \ncountry and constituents conscientiously, earning our respect, \nadmiration, and affection. We grieve for his passing from this life. I \nam reassured that we will find comfort in his splendid legacy of public \nservice and the knowledge that death is a transition to life eternal \nand he is now with God. As we bid our dear friend and colleague one \nlast fond farewell, I am reminded of the passage from Scriptures, from \nMatthew, 25:23:\n\n       His Master said unto him, ``Well done, good and faithful \n     servant; you have been good and faithful over a few things, I \n     will make you ruler over many things. Now enter into the joy \n     of your Master.''\n\n  May God bless Nancy, the Coverdell family and staff.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am delighted the acting minority leader \nhas brought up the energy and water measure because I have just \nreceived some very disturbing news, that the minority leader has \nindicated we can't bring up the energy and water bill unless a \nprovision that was in the bill signed last year, that was in the bill \nsigned the year before, that was in the bill signed the year before \nthat and the year before that--he now finds it objectionable, and he \nwill not let this bill be brought up unless we strike it out.\n  This provision deals with the spring rise on the Missouri River that \nFish and Wildlife thinks is a good idea. But all of the people \ndownstream know it would cause flooding, hardship, damage, property \nloss, and loss of lives from floods.\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\n  This is a serious matter. It also threatens commerce and \ntransportation, not just on the Missouri River but on the Mississippi \nRiver, because in dry years, 65 percent of the flow of the Mississippi \nat St. Louis comes from the Missouri River. If they have a spring rise, \nthere isn't water to maintain river transportation during the summer \nand the fall.\n  I had understood, from the minority leader's staff, that he wanted a \ntime agreement so he could move to strike it. I think this matter needs \nto be aired. We are willing to enter into a time agreement, so on \nMonday or Tuesday--whenever he wants--we can talk about the reason that \nthis was included in the bill last year, the year before, the year \nbefore, and the year before that, because it is of vital importance to \nour State and to other States on both the Missouri and the Mississippi \nRivers.\n  We have a way of doing business around here and that is, the \ncommittee acts and they report out a bill; the bill comes to the floor. \nIf somebody does not like a provision in the bill, they have a right to \nmove to strike it. That right is totally protected. We are trying to \nget appropriations bills passed.\n  Frankly, I do not want to be held hostage by an idea that the \nminority leader has, that all of a sudden we can't put a provision in \nthis year's bill that was in last year's bill and the bill the year \nbefore that.\n  I call on the minority leader to follow through with the commitment \nto have a time agreement. If he wants to move to strike it, fine. We \nhave a lot of good reasons, and we want to let our colleagues know why \nthat provision needs to be kept.\n  I do not want to be held hostage by the minority leader saying, we \nare going to stop the appropriations process unless you take it out of \nthe bill--a measure that is vitally important to the State of Missouri, \nto the States of Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Arkansas, Tennessee, \nKentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana. I am ready to talk about and \nargue against the minority leader's motion to strike. But to say that \nwe can't even bring up the bill with that provision in it is, I think, \ninappropriate, unwise, and unprecedented.\n\n  So I am here. I will be back here on Monday or Tuesday to do \nbusiness. I just ask that the minority leader let us bring up the bill. \nThis is an unbelievable effort to hold a bill hostage because of a \nparticular interest he may have in that bill. He can deal with it by an \namendment to strike, a motion to strike--whatever he wants. But let us \nbring the bill up because there is too much that is important in it to \nhave it be held hostage by an effort to say what can be in the bill, \napproved by the committee, where somebody does not like something in \nthe bill.\n  There is a remedy: A motion to strike or a motion to amend. We will \nbe here to do business Monday, Tuesday--whenever the minority leader \nwants.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Kansas, if I could \njust have 2 minutes to respond to my friend, because I have a dual role \nas not only whip but also I am ranking member on the subcommittee, I \nsay to my friend, I think the proposal the minority leader has made is \neminently fair: This provision should be taken out, that there will not \nbe an amendment offered on the floor, and whatever took place in \nconference he would be willing to live with.\n  I am not going to go through the merits of the case. I think there is \nsignificant merit on the side of the minority leader. Basically, sure, \nthis provision has been in the appropriations bill before, but it has \nhad no impact on the upper basin States. Now it does, because the Corps \nof Engineers is at a point where they want to change the manual to \ndetermine how the river is going to operate.\n  What this bill says is there can be no funds spent to change the \nmanual. That is how the flow of the river is going to be impacted. We \nshould leave this to bureaucrats. It should not be done, preventing \nmoney from going to change how the river is operated.\n  This is something that, as indicated by my friend from Missouri, we \ncan debate at a subsequent time. But the bill will not be brought up \nuntil this provision is out of the bill.\n  We can, during the process of the bill, and before it gets to \nconference, decide what to do with it. This provision is unfair to the \nupper basin States. There should not be a provision preventing \nadministrative agencies of this Government from spending money as to \nhow that river system should be operated.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Nevada, if we pass a \nbill out of committee, what is the precedent for saying, oh, we have to \nchange it before you even bring the bill to the floor, the measure that \nis reported out of the committee?\n  We have a process around here. There are many things that come out of \ncommittees that we disagree with. We have the option to change it on \nthe floor. We need to move forward. Energy and water is vitally \nimportant.\n  I appreciate the excellent work my colleague from Nevada does on this \nand other measures. But why, for Heaven's sake, are we supposed to hold \nan entire bill hostage because a single Senator wants to strike \nsomething out of a measure that has been adopted at the subcommittee \nand full committee level? I just do not understand why we can't do this \nin the normal course of business.\n  Mr. REID. I made my remarks very short because my friend from Kansas \nyielded to me. So I will make this response very short.\n  We are following what takes place in the Senate every week. A person \nhas the right to stop a bill from going forward. The rules of this \nSenate have been in effect for many years. I will insert in the Record \ntoday why the provision in the bill is so unfair to the upper basin \nStates.\n  I won't take the time of my friend from Kansas. There are many \nreasons this provision is unfair that will be inserted in the Record \ntoday.\n  I say to my friend from Missouri that the procedure that is being \nexercised by the minority in this instance--the minority leader and \nothers who are affected; the minority leader is not the only one who is \nexercising his rights--are rights that are exercised every day in the \nSenate. The procedures of the Senate may seem burdensome and \ncumbersome, but they have always been here to make sure the minority's \ninterests are protected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, I rise today to once again draw \nattention to the continuing war in Chechnya. This war has raged for too \nlong. The war in Chechnya from 1994-1996 left over 80,000 civilians \ndead, and the Foreign Relations Committee has received credible \nevidence that the current war has again resulted in the death of \nthousands of innocent civilians and the displacement of well over \n250,000 others. The committee also received credible evidence of \nwidespread looting, summary executions, detentions, denial of safe \npassage to fleeing civilians, torture and rape, committed by Russian \nsoldiers. Colleagues, regardless of the politics of this war, this kind \nof behavior is unacceptable. War has rules, and the evidence and \ntestimony the Foreign Relations Committee received raises serious \ndoubts as to whether or not the Russian Federation is playing by those \nrules. Much of the evidence we received showed clear violations of \ninternational humanitarian law, including the well-established Geneva \nConvention.\n  The President must use this opportunity to relay our serious concerns \nwith the actions of the Russian Government in Chechnya. Let's remember, \nwhat was the Group of Seven and became the G-8 with the inclusion of \nthe Russian Federation, is an association of democratic societies with \nadvanced economies. Although Russia is not yet a liberal democracy or \nan advanced economy, it was invited to take part in this group to \nencourage its democratic evolution. Today as I watch Russia refuse to \ninitiate a political dialogue\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\nwith the Chechen people, and continue to deny international \nhumanitarian aid organizations and international human rights monitors \naccess to Chechnya, I must question that evolution.\n  I am disappointed that the Group of Eight will not include the \nsituation in Chechnya on its formal agenda, but I am hopeful that the \nPresident will voice our serious concerns about Russia's conduct in \nChechnya and take concrete action to demonstrate our concern, during \nbilateral talks with President Putin.\n  The United States should demand that the Russian Federation push for \na negotiated, just settlement to this conflict. The conflict will not \nbe resolved by military means and the Russian Federation should \ninitiate immediately a political dialogue with a cross-section of \nrepresentatives of the Chechen people, including representatives of the \ndemocratically elected Chechen authorities. The United States should \nremind the Russian Federation of the requests the Council of Europe for \nan immediate cease-fire and initiation of political dialogue, and of \nRussia's obligation to that institution and the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe.\n  The President must also remind the Russian Federation government of \nits accountability to the international community and take steps to \ndemonstrate that its conduct will effect its standing in the world \ncommunity. This body and the U.N. Human Rights Commission has spoken \nout demanding the Russian government allow into Chechnya humanitarian \nagencies and international human rights monitors, including U.N. \nSpecial Rapporteur, yet the Russian government has not done so. This \nbody and the international community has also demanded that the Russian \nFederation undertake systematic, credible, transparent and exhaustive \ninvestigations into allegations of violations of human rights and \ninternational humanitarian law in Chechnya, and to initiate, where \nappropriate, prosecutions against those accused. But again, the Russian \nFederation has not done so.\n  During his meeting with President Putin, the President is expected to \ndiscuss economic reform in Russia and regional stability issues. \nPresident Clinton must relay to the Russian President that Russia's \nconduct in Chechnya is not only a violation of international \nhumanitarian law, but that it threatens Russia's ability for economic \nreform and creates instability in the region. And President Clinton \nmust make clear to President Putin that while the United States fully \nsupports the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, and is \nfully aware of the evidence of grave human rights violations committed \nby soldiers on both sides of the conflict, we strongly condemn Russia's \nconduct of the war in Chechnya and will continue to publicly voice our \nopposition to it. President Clinton should tell President Putin that \nthe United States will take into consideration Russian conduct in \nChechnya in any request for further rescheduling of Russia's \ninternational debt and U.S. assistance, until it allows full and \nunimpeded access into Chechnya humanitarian agencies and international \nhuman rights monitors, in accordance with international law.\n  The war in Chechnya has caused enormous suffering for both the \nChechen and Russian people, and the reports of the grave human rights \nviolations committed there, on both sides of the conflict, continue \ndaily. We must raise our concerns about the war in Chechnya at every \nchance and in every forum possible, including the G-8 Summit.\n  That is why I speak on the floor of the Senate today.\n  I fear we have already given human rights a back seat to economic \nissues by not placing Russia's conduct in Chechnya on the formal agenda \nof the G-8 summit, which is meeting right now. I hope that will not be \nthe outcome of our bilateral talks with Russia in Japan.\n  I hope the President will be firm. I hope the President will be \nstrong. I hope the U.S. Government is on the side of human rights. As a \nSenator from Minnesota, I want to communicate in the strongest possible \nlanguage that I hope Russia will do well. My father fled persecution in \nRussia. My hope is that Russia will be able to build a democratic \neconomy. That is my hope for the Russian people. But I also want to \nmake it clear to the Russian Federation that the conduct in Chechnya is \nunacceptable, in violation of basic international law, and that we \nshould be talking about and moving toward some kind of peaceful \nsettlement; and, for certain, international humanitarian agencies and \nhuman rights agencies should have unimpeded access to Chechnya now. \nOtherwise, the murder, the rape, the torture, and the killing of \ninnocent people will continue. We in the Senate should speak out on \nthis matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PASTORE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the day before yesterday, I \nwent with a delegation to the State of Rhode Island for the funeral of \nour former colleague, John O. Pastore. I was accompanied by Senators \nJack Reed and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, Ted Kennedy and John \nKerry of Massachusetts, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and Joseph Biden of \nDelaware. Former Senators Claiborne Pell and Harris Wofford were also \npresent.\n  The Catholic Mass at the Church of the Immaculate Conception was \nuplifting. John Pastore, Jr., and grandson, Gregory, spoke warmly of \nour former colleague. Senator Ted Kennedy was especially eloquent in \nhis remembrance of Senator Pastore. It was obvious that this man was \nmuch beloved by his family and community.\n  Mr. President, I can recollect John Pastore's departing speech from \nthe Senate. There he remarked that he had wanted to be a physician, but \nthat his father had died when he was nine, and he had to help raise his \nfour brothers and sisters and support his mother, who worked as a \nseamstress. How proud he must have been of his son, John, Jr., a Notre \nDame graduate, a physician and cardiologist. So the son became what the \nfather--John O. Pastore, the Senator--had wanted to be.\n  Instead of being a physician, Senator Pastore studied law at night at \nBoston's Northeastern University, eventually graduating with a Bachelor \nof Laws degree. This is an effort I can especially appreciate. At age \n36, he became Governor of the State of Rhode Island, and was reelected \ntwice before winning a Senate seat in 1950, where he served for 26 \nyears.\n  Senator Pastore was a strong supporter of the National Defense \nestablishment, with a great appreciation for the U.S. Navy--and \nespecially the nuclear Navy. As the Chairman of the Joint Committee on \nAtomic Energy, he was equally mindful of the power, and the terror, of \nall matters nuclear, and worked hard for passage of the first nuclear \ntest ban treaty, which barred nuclear tests in the atmosphere.\n  John Pastore and I served for some 18 years together in the Senate. \nJohn was an effective and fiery orator. My recollection is that not \nmany members were willing to take him on in a debate, because of his \nquick mind and fierce demeanor. Sometimes he would finish his debating \npoints, leaving his opponent's arguments in shreds, and stride off the \nfloor. But, even then he maintained his self-deprecating sense of \nhumor--sometimes remarking under his breath, ``If I had been a foot \ntaller, I would have been president.''\n  Mr. President, I wonder why he would have wanted to be President. He \nwas an extraordinary Senator. But he may well have become President had \nhe wanted to do so.\n  He was the keynote speaker at the 1964 Democratic Convention. \nAccording to news reports, his 36-minute speech was interrupted by \napplause 36 times, and he enjoyed a brief consideration for the Vice-\nPresidential nomination that eventually went to Senator Hubert \nHumphrey.\n  John Pastore's priorities were love of, and dedicated service to, \nGod, Country, and family--especially family. I am told that John had \nthe desk in his office equipped with a special buzzer that rang out to \nalert him whenever Elena, his wife since 1941, would call. I am told \nthat no matter how important a visitor he might have in his office even \nif it had been Admiral Rickover, if the buzzer went off John Pastore \nwould interrupt his meeting to take the call from ``Mama''--as he \naffectionately referred to his wife--for a list of\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\ngroceries, perhaps, to pick up on the way home or some other domestic \nchore. After carefully writing down her instructions, he would turn to \nhis visitor and resume the meeting.\n  John Pastore was the Chairman of the Communications Subcommittee of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee. He was instrumental in the formation of \nlegislation that created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and \nthe Public Broadcasting Service. John Pastore was opposed to violence \non television and, especially, in children's programming. The \ndeterioration of TV programming to what it is today must have been \nupsetting to him.\n  John Pastore's commitment to God, to competence, and to compassion, \nset a high standard. He used these commitments, I believe, to promote \njustice and peace. He was so very proud that his son John, Jr., who \nserved as secretary of the Boston-based International Physicians for \nthe Prevention of Nuclear War, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in \n1985.\n  So on Wednesday, I took the opportunity along with my illustrious \ncolleagues whom I have named, to extend, on behalf of the Senate, my \nsympathy and prayers to John's wife, Elena, his son, John, Jr., and his \ndaughters, Francesca and Louise.\n  What a great outpouring that was on Wednesday--a huge church \nauditorium, and a great crowd. What a wonderful family.\n  I was so very impressed with Mrs. Pastore, by her grace and poise, \nand with the two daughters and with that son, John Jr., the physician, \nwhich John himself had wanted to be.\n  I close with words by John Donne:\n\n                           Death Be Not Proud\n\n     Death, be not proud, though some have called thee\n     Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;\n     For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,\n     Die not, poor Death; nor yet canst thou kill me,\n     From Rest and Sleep, which but they picture be,\n     Much pleasure, then from thee much more must flow;\n     And soonest our best men with thee do go--\n     Rest of their bones and souls' delivery!\n     Thou'rt slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,\n     And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell;\n     And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well\n     And better than thy stroke.

Mr. President, in May I stood on this floor and \ncastigated the pharmaceutical industry for going behind the scenes and \nkilling an amendment that Senator Feingold and I had introduced, and \nwhich was part of the African trade bill. They killed this amendment in \nconference.\n  This amendment essentially would have allowed countries in the midst \nof a national HIV/AIDS emergency to use the cheapest possible drugs to \nfight that national health emergency by allowing the country to \ndistribute the drugs through ``parallel importing'' and ``compulsory \nlicensing.''\n  Fortunately, the President put forward an Executive order to carry \nout the intent of our amendment.\n  Since that time, some substantial things have happened.\n  Because I was so critical of the industry I feel it is only fitting \nthat I always come to the floor and acknowledge those that have \nresponded to the crisis.\n  When Senator Feingold and I began this fight last fall, 6 months \nafter the World Health Organization declared HIV/AIDS the most deadly \ninfectious disease in the world, very few people were aware at the time \nof the scope of the devastation as a result of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  Today, things have changed. Virtually not a day goes by without the \nmedia running a story about the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. \nI will not recapitulate today all of the horrifying numbers behind this \nAIDS crisis. It suffices to say that more than 22 million people are \ninfected with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, including over 30 percent \nof the adult population in many of the countries in the region. AIDS \nkills more than 2 million people a year in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  The media, the public, and governments from around the world are now \nincreasingly aware of the catastrophe that is unfolding on this \ncontinent. Of course, the pharmaceutical community is also aware.\n  Today, I will discuss some of the positive steps the pharmaceutical \nindustry is now taking to address this issue. I am very pleased and \nvery grateful to see that the industry now recognizes its moral \nobligation and appears to be stepping up to the plate and taking the \ninitiative to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa and \nother flashpoints throughout the developing world.\n  On July 7, Boehringer Ingelheim announced that Nevirapine will be \noffered free of charge for a period of 5 years for the prevention of \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV in developing countries. They \nactually said that any country that asks for the drug will obtain it \nfor free. That is a huge step forward. Reducing mother-to-child \ntransmission can literally save millions of lives and reduce the rate \nof increase of HIV/AIDS in the developing world. In South Africa alone, \naccording to a study published in the Lancet on June 17, as many as \n110,000 cases of HIV in infants could be prevented over the next 5 \nyears if all pregnant women in South Africa take a short course of \nantiretroviral medication such as Nevirapine during labor.\n  Today, I believe there are literally millions of orphans in Africa, \norphans whose mothers, fathers, and families have died of AIDS, orphans \nwho are living without food, without water. It is a devastating \nsituation. The initiative by Boehringer Ingelheim is part of the \ncollaborative effort between the United Nations, the World Bank, and \nfive pharmaceutical companies. I salute them today. Boehringer \nIngelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glaxo-Wellcome, Merck, and Hoffman-La \nRoche are now trying, together, to expand access to HIV/AIDS treatment \nin the developing world. They deserve to be saluted by this body.\n  If efforts by the international community to address the HIV/AIDS \ncrisis in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions of the developing world \nare to be successful, they must be part of a coordinated effort, and \nthat effort has to include education, prevention, and adequate health \ncare infrastructure. They must also include access to affordable \nmedication. This is where participation by the pharmaceutical industry \nis so essential.\n  I am pleased to see that at long last pharmaceutical companies have \nrecognized they have a profound social responsibility and moral \nobligation to meet the HIV/AIDS crisis, and that the lifesaving drugs \nthey can provide are essential. We all know that AIDS drugs are \nextraordinarily costly. Therefore, access to low cost or generic drugs \nbecomes critical.\n  It is important, however, to sound a note of caution and place the \ninitiatives of these pharmaceutical companies in perspective. According \nto Doctors' Without Borders, for example, past experience with the \nproposed Pfizer fluconazole donation shows that these programs \nsometimes come with conditions for national health ministries that make \nthem unsustainable over the long term. Many of these conditions are \nworthy. For example, it is worthy that the drug companies actually try \nto prevent the distribution of these drugs on the black market, and I \nunderstand the requirement that these drugs only be dispensed by a \nphysician.\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\n If a country doesn't have an adequate physician corps, it makes the \ndispensation of these drugs extraordinarily difficult, if not \nimpossible.\n\n  Because of these experiences, I believe it is critical that the \nUnited Nations and the national governments concerned work with the \npharmaceutical companies to make sure that any future efforts, \nincluding Boehringer Ingelheim's offer on Nevirapine, do not include \nhidden conditions which may serve to undermine these important \ninitiatives.\n  Nevirapine, given in tablet form, as I understand it, does not have a \nlot of side effects and can be given in a way that encourages pregnant \nwomen throughout the continent to use it, and thereby in 90 percent of \nthe cases prevent the transmission of the HIV virus to the unborn \nchild.\n  In addition, I believe alongside initiatives by the pharmaceutical \nindustry, access to low cost and/or generic drugs embodied in the \nPresident's May 11 Executive Order is still very important. The few \ndeveloping countries that have significant access to medicines for \npeople with HIV/AIDS gained access by aggressively pursuing generic \nstrategies. In Brazil, 80,000 people have been treated with generic \ndrugs that have brought the cost of triple drug therapy down to \napproximately $1,000 a year. While in Uganda, where the Government was \nworking with brand name drugs through a U.N. AIDS initiative, fewer \nthan 1,000 people have been treated, due to cost constraints.\n  Bringing the HIV/AIDS pandemic under control in sub-Saharan Africa \nand preventing HIV/AIDS from becoming a pandemic in other regions of \nthe developing world is one of the great moral tests of our time. If \ngovernments, nonprofits, and the pharmaceutical industry work together, \nI believe we can control what will otherwise be the greatest \npreventable humanitarian catastrophe in history.\n  Government and nonprofits are now beginning to take this crisis \nseriously. So are the pharmaceutical companies that produce drugs to \ntreat HIV/AIDS. The offer by Boehringer Ingelheim to provide free \nNevirapine to developing countries for 5 years to prevent mother-to-\nchild transmission of HIV, and the creation of a coalition of five \nmajor manufacturers of HIV/AIDS drugs to work with the United Nations \nto deliver drugs to victims of this crisis, are major steps in the \neffort to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  I just want to say I am very grateful. I believe this Senate should \nalso salute this action. I would like to encourage other pharmaceutical \ncompanies to follow the example these five companies are setting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Mr. President, it has been a difficult week working in the \nSenate. All of us have had a heavy heart, missing Paul Coverdell. My \noffice is in the immediate vicinity of his, and I keep thinking he will \npop out the door on my way to a vote or back.\n  In the Bible, there is a famous story about a man named Paul. God had \na special mission for him. Though Paul was not aware of it, God made \nHis presence known when He needed him and called him into service. That \nPaul had no choice. He answered the call and did as he was asked. God \ncalls us all like that, though some of us never hear it. God called \nPaul Coverdell like that, too. When Paul heard the call, he listened \nand he answered.\n  First, He called him to work in the Peace Corps, as there was a need \nand someone had to fill it. During his service there, he made a \ndifference in a lot of lives. God must have been very pleased with him \nbecause then He decided to put him in charge of greater things.\n  Those greater things led him to serve in the Senate. Again, there was \na need and, again, Paul was there to answer the call. He was a \nremarkable force here, an incredible powerhouse of principles and \nideas, and they were all in motion whenever he would speak. He had an \ninfectious enthusiasm that seemed to emanate from every fiber of his \nbeing as he made his points. His gestures and his facial expressions \nalways drew the listener in and caught their attention as he spoke with \npassion about his philosophy and his politics.\n  He was a great strategist because he could put himself in someone \nelse's shoes and understand how someone else thought and felt about the \nissues that came up for debate and discussion. He could see many \nperspectives, and all at once he had an innate sense of how they would \nall interplay, how they would connect and collide. That was why he \nalways seemed to have the answers. He knew what his opponents were \nthinking before they were even thinking it.\n\n  But the biggest reason for his successes in the Senate was his great \ndevotion to the principles of common sense. He knew that the best \nanswer was the one that made the most sense. All of his hard work and \ndetermined effort was aimed at one target: finding common ground, \nworking with his colleagues, and creating a consensus that led to a \nsolution to the problem.\n  When I arrived in the Senate, I found myself on the last rung of the \nseniority ladder, No. 100. I did not know how lucky I was. After the \nroom selections were made, I got the office that was left, and it \nturned out to be a great office in disguise. My staff and I moved in, \nadded a few touches to make it more like home, and then greeted our \nneighbors. Paul Coverdell was the neighbor, along with his staff. He \nwas right next door, so we got to see him often. He and his staff were \nalways walking by or on their way out, and I would see Paul as he left \nto go home. He was a regular and a welcome sight to all of us.\n  When the bells would ring for us to vote, we seemed to answer that \ncall at the same time. We often came out of our doors at the same time \nand walked over together. We had a lot of interesting discussions about \npolitics and legislative strategy. I lapped it all up. I was an eager \nand ready student, and he was a tremendous mentor.\n  Our staffs seemed to bond, too. We were all in this together, and the \ncamaraderie that developed among us helped us take on some issues that \nneeded to be addressed. It is a tradition I have adopted from him that \nI hope to continue through my years of service in the Senate.\n  Through the years, I remember the times we spent in difficult \nmeetings with emotions running high and pressure coming down from all \nsides to get something done. That is when Trent Lott would say: ``Let's \nlet Mikey do it.'' I was always relieved to see that he was talking \nabout Paul. I never knew Trent was making a reference to an old-time \ntelevision commercial, but I knew he meant Paul and not me, which was a \nrelief because Paul always got the job done.\n  Paul Coverdell had a lot of jobs to do in the Senate, and he took \nthem all on eagerly and with enthusiasm because he loved legislating; \nhe loved serving the people of Georgia, the people of this Nation, and \nhis neighbors around the world because he cared so very deeply about \neach and every person.\n  I heard it said that there is no higher calling than public service. \nIt must be true because it caught Paul Coverdell's attention. In all he \ndid in his life, there is no question that he was a remarkable public \nservant by any standard.\n  Unfortunately, he will not get to a lot of the landmarks we cherish \naround here, like casting 10,000 votes, but every vote he did cast was \nwith the greatest thought, consideration, and reflection, and that is \nthe true mark of a legislator.\n  He lived every day with great enthusiasm, energy, focus, concern, and \nimagination. In fact, I think of him as an ``imagineer.'' That is \nsomeone who can see a problem as a challenge and then use a great \nreservoir of talent, skill, and a little luck to solve it. That is the \ntrue mark of a great human being and great friend. Someday when we \nleave the Senate and return home to begin another adventure in each of \nour lives, I have no doubt we will take with us at least one or two \nspecial memories of Paul that we will cherish for a lifetime.\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\n  As mortals we cannot see the great plan of the Master's hand for the \nuniverse, so we cannot understand why He works the way He does. The \nword ``why'' does not even appear in the Bible, and there is good \nreason for that. It is not for us to know the why; it is for us to hear \nthe word of our Lord and to answer the call when it comes.\n  At 6:10 p.m. on Tuesday, July 18, Paul Coverdell heard that call for \nthe last time, and once again he answered it. The only understanding I \nhave is that God must have needed somebody with special talents and \nabilities, and so He sent for Paul. Now heaven is richer for his having \ngone home, and we are all richer for having known him and been able to \nshare his life. He will be deeply missed and fondly remembered by us \nall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Senior \nSenator from Georgia, Paul Coverdell, who passed away Tuesday in \nAtlanta.\n  Mr. President, while Senator Coverdell and I came from different \npolitical parties and ideologies, we shared several things in common. \nWe both served our country in the U.S. Army, and after our service we \nboth returned home to run successful businesses.\n  With our military and business background we decided to turn our \nattention to serving the public, and Senator Coverdell had a impressive \nrecord of public service.\n  Senator Coverdell served in the George State Senate--rising to the \nposition of Minority Leader. He then served as Director of the Peace \nCorps under President Bush, focusing on the critical task of serving \nthe emerging democracies of post-Soviet Eastern Europe. In 1992, he was \nelected to serve in the United States Senate.\n  Although we failed to agree on many issues before this body, Senator \nCoverdell always demonstrated honor and dignity in this chamber. He \nargued seriously for the positions he believed in. When he pushed \nlegislation to fight illegal drugs or promote volunteerism, it was \nobvious that his heart was always in it. And his motivation was sincere \nand simple--to help the people of Georgia and the nation.\n  I send my deepest sympathies to his wife Nancy, his parents, and the \nentire Coverdell family. I also extend my sympathy to the people of \nGeorgia.\n  We will all miss Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to hear of Paul \nCoverdell's untimely passing. Paul was a man of such energy and \ndetermination, it is difficult to imagine this body without him. Paul \nwas a skilled legislator and one of the hardest working legislators \namong us. I had the highest admiration for the way he conducted himself \nhere--how committed he was to the people of his state, and to his many \nduties here in the Senate.\n  We did not agree on a lot of policy matters, but that couldn't be \nless important as I stand here today, Mr. President. We've all lost a \ncolleague and a friend, who was taken from this earth far too soon. At \n61, Paul had served his country in more ways than most Americans can \nhope to in a lifetime. From his service in the Armed Forces to the \nPeace Corps to the Foreign Relations Committee, where we served \ntogether, Paul had a keen understanding of foreign affairs. He was also \na natural leader, despite his soft-spoken personality and his habit of \navoiding the limelight. He served as the minority leader in the Georgia \nState Senate from 1974 to 1989, attaining that post just four years \nafter he was elected to the State Senate in 1970.\n  Paul and I were both first elected to the Senate in 1992, Mr. \nPresident. We arrived here at the same time, both former State Senators \nwho had the honor of coming here and learning the ways of this Senate. \nAnd learn them Paul did. He quickly rose through the ranks to a top \nleadership post. And along the way he won the respect and admiration of \nall who knew him. The nation has lost a skilled leader, and all of us \nhave lost an honorable colleague and friend. I join my colleagues in \nmourning his passing, and in paying tribute to his memory. To his wife \nNancy, his family, his staff and his many friends, I offer my \ncondolences and my deepest sympathies. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to share in the memory of one of \nthis body's most esteemed colleagues, Senator Paul Coverdell. His \nuntimely death Tuesday was a shock to us all. My prayers and \ncondolences go out to his family at their time of mourning.\n  It so happens that Senator Coverdell was born in my home state of \nIowa--in Des Moines. That made him an honorary constituent of mine. For \nthat reason, he was always a special colleague to me.\n  We in this body knew of his background in the Peace Corps just before \nhe was elected to the Senate. He very quickly began to show his \noutstanding leadership skills. He built a respect among his colleagues \nbecause of his hard work and his dedication to those issues most dear \nto him--especially education and the war on drugs.\n  Senator Coverdell did almost all of his work behind-the-scenes, work \nthat the public never knew about. But we knew, because we worked with \nhim. His interest was not the limelight. You rarely saw his name in the \npapers. Instead, it was rolling up his sleeves and working one-on-one \nwith his colleagues in an effective way. No one among us had such \nenergy, enthusiasm for public service, and organizing ability.\n  I worked closest with him on international narcotics issues, as \nchairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control. He \nwas chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western \nHemisphere, Peace Corps, Narcotics and Terrorism. We worked very \nclosely together on narcotics matters. We would hold joint hearings on \nfighting drug cartels in Colombia and other countries. No one felt \nstronger about stopping the scourge of drugs in this country than he \ndid. He cared deeply about the debilitating effect drugs have had on \nthe future of our country and our youth.\n  It was a real privilege to work with Paul Coverdell in the United \nStates Senate. He was a statesman, a public servant in the true sense \nof the word. And he was a good friend, I join my colleagues in \nexpressing how much we will miss his energy, enthusiasm and friendship. \nHis presence will be greatly missed in the Senate. I wish all the best \nto his family, knowing of their profound grief at their loss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my thoughts and views \nabout our good friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell. I commend my \ncolleague from Wyoming for his very thoughtful and appropriate remarks \nabout Paul Coverdell.\n  I do not have a long set of prepared remarks about my colleague, but \nI wanted to take a couple of minutes and express some feelings about \nthis fine man from Georgia whom I got to know back in the Bush \nadministration.\n  I was chairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \nPresident Bush nominated Paul Coverdell to be the Director of the Peace \nCorps. Because I chaired the committee with jurisdiction over the Peace \nCorps and the fact I was a former Peace Corps volunteer--I think the \nonly one in this body to have served in the Peace Corps--Paul and I \ndeveloped a very quick and close relationship. I helped him through the \nconfirmation process, and over the next number of years, as he served \nas Director and traveled the world expanding and enriching the Peace \nCorps as an institution, I developed a deep fondness for Paul \nCoverdell. I did not know in those days that I would be only a few \nyears away from calling him a colleague.\n\n  In January of 1993, Paul arrived in the Senate, and quickly joined \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, and quickly became, in those days, the \nranking Republican on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee with \njurisdiction over the Peace Corps. What more appropriate place for Paul \nCoverdell, in that he had been the Director of the Peace Corps. He \nprovided tremendous assistance, information, and support for this \nwonderful institution that was begun by President Kennedy back in the \n1960s. It enjoyed remarkable support over the years. Every single \nadministration backed and supported the Peace Corps. Even during \ndifficult economic times in this country, there was a sense that this \nwas a valuable institution. Paul Coverdell made it even more so because \nof his tenure as Director and then during his stewardship on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee with particular jurisdiction over this \narea.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n  I then became his ranking member, as my friends on the Republican \nside ended up in the majority, and Paul and I worked together. In fact, \njust recently, we were able to actually increase the funding for the \nPeace Corps. I do not think we would have won the decision here about \nwhether or not to provide additional support to the Peace Corps and \nthose additional funds would not have been forthcoming, had it not been \nfor Paul Coverdell.\n  We also worked together on the narcotics issue. We had a passionate \ninterest in trying to do something to stem the tide of narcotics, the \nuse of drugs in this country, and worked tirelessly on that effort \ninternationally, through the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, to \nfashion a formula that would reduce the consumption of drugs in this \ncountry and reduce the production and the transmission of drugs and the \nmoney laundering that went on all over the world.\n  In fact, he came up with a very creative idea of trying to involve \nall of the countries that were involved in this issue, either as \nsources of production, transition, money laundering, or consumption--as \nis the case in the United States. I used to tease him a bit because I \nthink I was a more public advocate of the Coverdell idea on narcotics \nthan he was.\n  Paul Coverdell was one of the most self-effacing Members I have known \nin this body. George Marshall used to have a saying: There was no limit \nto what you could accomplish in Washington, DC, as long as you were \nwilling to give someone else credit for it.\n  Paul Coverdell understood that, I think, as well as any Member who \nhas served in this body. He came up with ideas, such as he did, in the \narea of drugs and narcotics, and then was more interested in the idea \nbeing advanced than he was having his name associated with it.\n  I wanted to mention those two particular areas: The Peace Corps and \nthe drugs and narcotics effort. There were others he was involved in \nsubstantively: Education and the like. These were two areas where we \nworked most closely together.\n  Paul Coverdell was a partisan, a strong Republican, with strong \nviews, strong convictions. But he also was a gentleman, thoroughly a \nSenate person. I say that because I do not think this institution \nfunctions terribly well without both of those elements.\n  People who come here with convictions and beliefs, who try to advance \nthe causes that they think will strengthen our country, are in the \nposition to make a contribution to this body and to the United States; \nbut you also have to be a person who understands that you do not win \nevery battle. This is a legislative body, a body where you must \nconvince at least 50 other people of your ideas, and in some cases more \nthan 60. If you just have strong convictions and strong beliefs, and \nare unable to work with this small body, then those ideas are nothing \nmore than that--ideas.\n  Paul Coverdell had a wonderful ability to reach across this aisle--\nthat is only a seat away from me--and build relationships on ideas he \ncared about. That, in my view, is the essence of what makes this \ninstitution work.\n\n  Usually it takes someone a longer period of time to get the rhythms, \nif you will, the sensibilities of this institution, that are not \nwritten in any rule book, that you are not going to find in any \nprocedural volume. You need to know the rules--which he did--and \nunderstand the procedures. But the unwritten rules of how this \ninstitution functions are something that people take a time to acquire. \nWhat somewhat amazed me was that Paul Coverdell, in very short order, \nunderstood the rhythms of this room, understood the rhythms of this \ninstitution, and was able to build relationships and coalitions.\n  He could be your adversary one day--and a tough adversary he was; a \ntough, tough adversary--and, without any exaggeration, on the very next \nday he could be your strongest ally on an issue. Those are qualities \nthat inherently and historically have made some moments in the Senate \ntheir greatest--when leaders have been able to achieve that ability of \nbeing strong in their convictions but also have the ability to reach \nacross the aisle and develop those relationships that are essential if \nyou are going to advance the ideas that improve the quality of life in \nthis country.\n  I suspect he acquired some of those skills in his years with the \nGeorgia Legislature. It has been said--and I can understand it--when he \nwas the Republican leader in Georgia, there were not a lot of \nRepublicans in Georgia. And even though we have our disagreements, \nthere is a respect for those who help build something. It is not an \nexaggeration to say that Paul Coverdell, in no small way, was \nresponsible for building the Republican Party in Georgia. I do not say \nthat with any great glee, but it is a mark of his tenacity, his \nconvictions, his ability to be responsible for building a strong two-\nparty system in that State.\n  So from the perspective of this Connecticut Yankee, to the people of \nGeorgia, we thank you for helping this man find a space in the \npolitical life of Georgia and for sending him here to the Senate on two \noccasions.\n  I send my deepest sympathies to his wife Nancy, to his friends, to \nhis staff in Georgia and those here in Washington. Paul Coverdell will \nbe missed. He was a fine Member of this institution. He was a good and \ndecent human being. He will be missed deeply by all of us here. So my \nsympathies are extended to all whose lives he touched so deeply.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4733, the energy and water \nappropriations bill. I further ask that the committee substitute be \nagreed to and the substitute be considered original text for the \npurpose of further amendment, with no points of order waived.\n  I further ask consent that if a motion to strike section 103 is \noffered, the motion to strike be limited to 3 hours to be equally \ndivided in the usual form, and a vote occur on the motion to strike \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, without any intervening \naction, motion, or debate.\n  I further ask consent that any votes ordered with respect to this \nbill, either on amendments or final passage, be stacked to occur at 6 \np.m. on Monday, July 24.\n  I observe that both managers of the appropriations bill for energy \nand water are present and ready to proceed, and therefore I submit that \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, as has been stated here--and \nthere has been a conversation between Senator Bond from Missouri and \nthe Senator from Nevada--we are willing to move forward on this \nlegislation. There is one provision in it that is offensive to a \nsignificant number of Senators. If that were taken out, and there were \nno amendment offered on the floor, we would be ready to move forward \nwith that. I have spoken to Senator Domenici on many occasions. I think \nwe could finish this bill quite rapidly.\n  Based on that, Mr. President, unless my friend from New Mexico has a \nstatement, I object.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I make a statement?\n  Mr. REID. I extend my reservation for the Senator from New Mexico to \nspeak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and fellow Senators, first, I thank the \ndistinguished majority leader for the effort he has just made. This is \na very good bill and very important to America. It contains all of the \nnuclear weapons funding, some very important money for the enhanced \nsecurity apparatus for the National Laboratories that we have all been \nconcerned about. It contains about $100 million to build some of our \nold, decrepit nuclear manufacturing facilities which are still being \nused for parts in other things and are held in abeyance in case they \nare needed.\n  We have a report saying they are in desperate shape. We have a report \nthat some of the facilities we are trying to maintain in the State of \nNevada--that are still there from the underground testing--need to be \nfixed up because they will not be in a position of readiness.\n  We have hundreds of water projects in this bill for Senators. And we \nwait\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\nto go to conference to even fill in some more.\n  Oh, let me talk about the Missouri conflict. I am not aware of the \nsubstance of it, but when the distinguished Senator from Nevada says \nthere are quite a few Senators who are concerned on your side, let me \nsuggest that there are more than quite a few Senators who are worried \non the other side--and they are here, and they are there--as to who is \nbeing impacted.\n  I hope at some point they would let us fight that issue out. We would \nbe willing to have a full debate on it, if the minority leader will let \nus. He is a wonderful and hard-working minority leader who tries to put \nthings together. We all agree with that. But in this instance, these \nprovisions have been in three previous bills that I have brought to the \nfloor with my good friend, Senator Reid. They have been in there and \nsigned by the President of the United States.\n  To take a bill we worked on diligently, that contains all of these \nimportant issues I have just discussed, and say we can't get it done--I \nsee the minority leader. I just said I have great respect for \neverything he does in the Senate. I just want to make sure that \neverybody understands, this is a very important bill. We ought to get \nit done and go to conference. We need some additional resources to get \nthe job done on the water side and other aspects, but we will get a \ngood bill completed. I hope we are not in a position where we will \nnever get this bill.\n  If the Senator insists that it go his way, I think we won't get a \nbill. I hope at some point he will let us vote, I say to the minority \nleader. I have told him before and I confirm, I put the language in \nthree times that is in this bill. The President signed it. I would very \nmuch like to move ahead. I am not trying to put any untoward pressure \non anyone, just to state the problem that I see in not moving ahead.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the distinguished assistant minority \nleader will yield to me under his reservation, I will be brief. Then \nunder his reservation or on his own, Senator Daschle may want to \ncomment.\n  What I have asked is consent that we go to the energy and water bill, \nand I asked consent that if a motion to strike section 103 is offered, \nthe motion to strike be limited to 3 hours to be equally divided in the \nusual form, and we would go to a vote.\n  Under Senator Reid's reservation, if I could respond to two points: \nOne, in addition to the very important energy aspects of this \nlegislation that have been mentioned, I will focus on the water side. \nSo much of America benefits from our water and our water projects, \nwhether it is navigation or recreation, flood control. These are not \njust projects that individual Members want to get for their particular \ndistrict for political benefit. They have a lot to do with the economy \nof this country, the creation of jobs and the lifestyle in America.\n  This is an important bill both on the energy and water side. I know \nboth sides want to get it done. I have absolutely no doubt about that. \nI know the managers of this legislation, Senator Domenici and Senator \nReid, are probably two of the best we have in the Senate. It would \nprobably look as though magic had been performed, how quickly this bill \ncould be completed.\n  The issue we are talking about is a very difficult one with which to \ncope. It has been in the mill a long time. I know there are very strong \nbeliefs on both sides of the issue, probably on both sides of the \naisle. I hope we will continue to work to see if we can't find a way to \ndeal with this issue in a way that is fair. My thinking is under an \nagreement to try to take it out with a time limit; that is fine, or an \nagreement to try to take it out and then put it back in with a time \nagreement; that is fine. We are looking for any possible solution. I \nhope we will find a solution in the next few minutes or next couple \nhours today.\n\n  If we can't, then I am already looking, I say to Senator Daschle, to \nsee if we can get managers available and try to proceed to the \nTreasury-Postal Service appropriations bill Monday afternoon, see if we \ncan make progress on that. I don't know of any big controversy on that \none. Of course, it funds the Treasury. It also funds the Postal \nService, and it funds White House operations. Hopefully, we could look \nto that as an alternative. I would rather do energy and water. I would \nlike to do them both so we can get them into conference and so progress \ncan be made next week and they will be hopefully ready to go to the \nPresident soon after that.\n  I thank Senator Reid for allowing me to speak under his reservation. \nI will withhold if Senator Daschle wants to respond or comment under \nreservation, too.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor. There has \nnot been an objection filed yet.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have the floor and I propounded a unanimous consent \nrequest, if the Senator would like to respond under a reservation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nrespond to the distinguished majority leader. I thank my colleague, as \nI always must, the assistant Democratic leader, for being on the floor. \nI was not aware that a unanimous consent request was going to be \npropounded. I was downstairs. I am disappointed I was not able to be \nhere at the time.\n  Let me very succinctly explain the circumstances. In the past, there \nhas not been any real concern about revising the master manual. The \nmaster manual was written by the Corps of Engineers in 1960. It has \nbeen the law of the land with regard to the operation of the river \nsince that time, now 40 years. There has been an effort underway in \nearnest over the course of this last year to look for ways that more \naccurately reflect how the Missouri River ought to be managed, taking \ninto account, now, the extraordinary relevance of fish and wildlife \nissues.\n  Economically, the fish, wildlife and recreational benefits of the \nriver now constitute over $80 million. Navigation constitutes $7 \nmillion. In economic wherewithal, that is what the reality is today: $7 \nmillion for navigation, over $80 million for fish, wildlife and \nrecreation. Yet the master manual is written in a way that only \nrecognizes the navigational issues because that is all there was in \n1960 when this was written.\n  The Corps is now looking for a way to provide better balance. I think \nthere is a compromise that more and more States are becoming more \ncomfortable with. But what this provision in this bill says is they \ncan't even consider it. Now that all this work and effort has gone into \nconsidering ways in which to accommodate all the States, the provision \nsays we won't even consider it.\n  I have to use my prerogatives as a Senator to say that we must find a \ncompromise on that language. We are not going to be able to do it with \none vote on a Friday or a Monday afternoon, so I would like to work \nwith the leader. I told him I would like to find a way to resolve this \nmatter. He said, we are looking at, we will take any option. I \nsuggested one to the leader: Let's go to conference on this provision. \nI am willing to live with whatever the conference decides. Of course, \nthe administration is going to weigh in. They said it will be vetoed if \nthis provision is in there. So if we are going to get this bill done, \nlet's be realistic.\n  I want to get this bill done. I have as many things in this bill as I \nhave in any appropriations bill. I want to get it done. I would like to \nget it done this afternoon, and I am willing to let the conference make \nits decision. But to say that the bill must have that provision or \nthere is no bill, is just not fair to this side, to this Senator.\n  That is my reservation. If the Senator from Nevada has not objected, \nI will. I think it is important to resolve this matter. I am prepared \nto offer a compromise. Let's resolve this in conference. I say that in \nfull recognition that I have no idea what would happen in conference. \nBut if they want to finish this bill and move it to the next phase, I \nam ready to do it. I will do it this morning. I will do it this \nafternoon. I will do it on Monday. But we have to deal with that \nprovision.\n  Having objected, I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say to the distinguished minority \nleader and to Senator Domenici and Senator Reid, we will continue to \nwork. I have learned from experience working on both sides of the \naisle, if everybody\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\njust hunkers down and says no, this way or no way, you don't ever get \nanything. I will continue to probe and work with Senator Daschle, \nSenator Reid, and Senator Domenici, to see if we can find a way to \nresolve this problem. I think perhaps we can. We will be talking \nfurther. I want to make sure we have on record that we are trying to \nget it done, and we will hopefully come back here in another hour or \ntwo and try again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7426-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after \nconclusion of the 6:00 p.m. vote or votes, if any, on Monday, the \nSenate proceed to the intelligence authorization bill, S. 2507, and \nfollowing the reporting by the clerk, Senator Thompson be recognized to \noffer an amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, can the \nmajority leader give me his latest report with regard to the hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee on Tuesday?\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been in contact through senior staff, the top staff \nof Senator Hatch, with a suggestion of how we could proceed on that and \nget that information back to Senator Daschle. I did that, I guess, \nabout an hour ago. I have not gotten a response back from them yet. But \nif I don't get one pretty quick, I will pursue another call to see if \nwe can work that out.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be constrained to object at this \ntime, with the hope and expectation that we can get a much larger and \nmore comprehensive unanimous consent agreement later in the afternoon. \nSo I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again, of course, judicial \nnominations are important to the country on both sides of the aisle. I \nguess in the Senate everything is related to everything else. But who \nthe hearings are on in Judiciary doesn't directly affect this bill. We \nneed to get the intelligence authorization bill done.\n  Once again, this is important to the national security of our \ncountry. There had been some objections to it, but we have worked \nthrough those, and it took a lot of give and take and cooperation on \nboth sides because there were objections on both sides of the aisle. We \nhave cleared that.\n  Regarding the amendment I pointed out of Senator Thompson, I have \nbeen looking for any number of ways to have this very important matter \nof nuclear weapon proliferation by China reviewed. Senator Thompson has \nbeen very helpful and willing to withhold, or to consider any number of \noptions as to how that would be considered. It seems to me that if we \ncan get the intelligence authorization bill up, that would be an \nappropriate place for this issue to be considered, so that we can move \nto the PNTR for China issue on Wednesday. We are going to do that \nanyway. But I would like to have been able to deal with Senator \nThompson's very meritorious amendment, either freestanding or as an \namendment before we go to the China PNTR issue because I think he is \ngoing to be constrained to offer it as an amendment to the bill. That \nwould be difficult because if it should be approved, of course, it \nwould have to go on the bill and it would go back to conference and the \nHouse would have to consider it again. Perhaps, there will be enough \nvotes to defeat it, but I, for one, do not feel constrained to vote \nagainst an issue of this significance. I think it is a legitimate \nargument that this is a national security and nuclear proliferation \nissue that should maybe be considered separate from the trade issue, \nbut it is related to how we are going to deal with China in the future.\n  So, again, Senator Daschle objected with the recognition that we are \nworking on another angle or issue. We will try to get that worked out, \nand then we will try again later this afternoon on this issue. Rather \nthan me controlling the floor for the debate, I think it would be best \nat this point if perhaps I would yield the floor, and perhaps Senator \nThompson and Senator Hollings, who are very interested in this issue, \ncould speak on their own time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say this to the majority leader \nbefore he leaves the floor. He and I have spent more time than we \nprobably care to calculate over the last couple of days trying to work \nthrough what is obviously a very complicated and difficult period. I \nhave appreciated his good nature as we have done this, his patience, \nhis tolerance. He is smiling now, which is encouraging to me. I am \ngoing to keep smiling, too. I hope we can accommodate this unanimous \nconsent request for the intelligence authorization. As Senator Lott, I \nrecognize that it is important, and I hope we can address it.\n  I also hope we can address the additional appropriations bills. There \nis no reason we can't. We can find a compromise if there is a will, and \nI am sure there is. But we also want to see the list of what we expect \nwill probably be the final list of judicial nominees to be considered \nfor hearings in the Judiciary Committee this year. I am anxious to talk \nwith him and work with him on that issue. All of this is interrelated, \nas he said, and because of that, we take it slowly. So far, we have \nbeen able to take it successfully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nminority leader for trying to work out these complicated matters. There \nis, understandably, some interrelationship. I think it is well known \nthat we are looking for a way to get a vote on the important issue of \nproliferation. It should not be considered to be a trade issue. It is \nan issue separate and apart. Many of us believe it is extremely timely \nbecause of the trade issue, and that while we need to extend our trade \nrelationship with China, at the same time, we need to demonstrate to \nthem and to the world that they must do something to improve their \nhabits in terms of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Every \nday, we see in some media outlet a further indication that the Chinese \nare intent upon continuing their proliferation habits, as long as we \nsupport Taiwan and as long as we perceive a national defense system.\n  I hope the objection is not based upon the desire by the Democratic \nleader to prevent a vote from happening on the issue of China's \nproliferation. Just as the majority leader and the Democratic leader \nhave been working together, so have the staffs been working together \nacross the aisle to try to bridge some of the differences on this bill. \nWe have made changes to the bill to accommodate some of the concerns. \nThis bill will not affect agriculture; this bill will not affect \nbusiness, except in those narrow circumstances when a business may be \ndealing directly with a known and determined foreign proliferator. At \nthat point, it is not too high a price to ask our American businesses \nnot to deal with those kinds of companies. That is what this is about.\n  So now that the majority leader has set a date for a vote on PNTR, I \ncertainly hope we will be able to rapidly reach a date prior to that \nwhen we can vote on the important issue of proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. Although trade, being as important as it is, it pales \nin comparison with the national security of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The very \ninteresting feature to the entire picture here is that they object, of \ncourse, to us defending ourselves. As I see it, in essence, they are \nsaying: Wait a minute. If you get a strategic defense initiative, if \nyou get an antiballistic missile defense, that is going to deter or \nretard our proliferation, our sales to Pakistan, our sales to Iran.\n  A nation's defense should never be negotiable. It is totally out of \nthe question.

Mr. President, two Saturdays ago, Mr. Peter S. Goodman \nreported in the Washington Post on the design of Deutsche Telekom, a \nGerman government company, which is designed to take over any and all \nU.S. telecommunications. In the final paragraph of that particular \nstory, the head of Deutsche Telekom said, no, they were not interested \nin joint ventures. They were interested in total control.\n  This Senator from South Carolina participated in the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act, deregulating and decontrolling the American \ntelecommunications industry. We certainly didn't take it out from under \nAmerican control to put it under German government control.\n  I placed a call to the head of the Federal Communications Commission. \nWe had a conversation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter of June 28 denoting that \nconversation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 2000.\n     Hon. William Kennard,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: When I called, I knew what your answer \n     would be. Section 310 of the Communication Act of 1934 \n     forbids a foreign government or any entity with 25% or more \n     foreign government ownership or control from being granted a \n     license by the FCC. I knew of the public interest waiver, but \n     in the 66 years of the Act the FCC has never waived, in any \n     significant fashion, the law for foreign government \n     ownership. I knew, also, that the Global Telecommunication \n     Agreement permitted the FCC to consider the public interest \n     satisfied if the entity or government was a member of the \n     WTO. However, this was permissive and not mandated. And other \n     countries, members of the WTO--Italy, Spain, and Hong Kong--\n     have prohibited foreign government ownership. I knew, also, \n     that the Congress and the Commission have been all out for \n     competition and that competition has cost domestic companies \n     their profits and values, making our companies vulnerable to \n     foreign takeover. And to my amazement, when I asked the FCC \n     position on foreign government ownership you hedged. First, \n     you said it ``was complicated''. You did mention the 310 \n     statute, but then talked about the WTO requirement. I \n     countered it was not a required and certainly not in the \n     public interest. You continued telling me you wanted to come \n     up to discuss it with me to learn my position. I kept telling \n     you I was giving you my position by calling. I'm opposed to \n     foreign government ownership. Yesterday, I introduced a bill \n     tightening legal prohibitions against foreign government \n     ownership. Thereupon, you said well, if US West was taken \n     over by a foreign government the Western states would be in \n     an uproar. I countered I was already in an uproar. Again, you \n     wanted to come up and discuss to learn my position. I stated \n     that no further discussion was necessary and I asked that \n     when responding to any downtown lawyers inquiring to learn \n     the position of the Commission, that you refer them to the \n     law. You then said you weren't getting any calls, that your \n     phone ``wasn't ringing off the hook''. I said I knew that the \n     downtown lawyers were smart enough not to call directly, but \n     to find out indirectly the position of the Commission. The \n     call was then terminated without you stating your position, \n     leaving me totally frustrated.\n       A treaty confirmed by a \\2/3\\ vote in the Senate amends the \n     law--not an agreement. And the global telecommunications \n     agreement was never submitted to Congress. I can't emphasize \n     enough that the WTO provision isn't absolute, only \n     permissive. I can't imagine you taking the extreme position \n     of foreign government ownership and concluding this was in \n     the public interest--particularly after all the effort we \n     have made with the 1996 Telecommunications Act to deregulate \n     and afford competition. Now, to allow a foreign government, \n     protected from competition, to pick up a domestic \n     telecommunications company, bloodied by the competition, and \n     control telecommunications in the United States is \n     unthinkable.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, since the distinguished Chairman of the \nFederal Communications Commission was rather elusive in that \nconversation, I then prevailed on 29 other colleagues in the Senate in \na letter of June 29--the next day--and again on July 12, since I had \nnot received a response.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those \nparticular letters dated June 29 and July 12 to the Chairman of the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2000.\n     Hon. William Kennard,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Recently, a foreign government owned \n     telecommunications monopoly announced that it planned to \n     purchase a controlling interest in a major U.S. \n     telecommunications firm. This is contrary to U.S. law and is \n     inconsistent with our policy to promote competition and \n     maintain a secure communications system for our national \n     security.\n       We would not be alone among WTO member countries in \n     adopting this point of view. Italy, Spain and Hong Kong have \n     prohibited similar transactions when the acquiring company \n     was owned by a foreign government. U.S. regulators should be \n     similarly skeptical of such acquisitions in this country.\n       Congress and the FCC have made tremendous progress with the \n     passage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act in deregulating \n     and forcing competition in our domestic communications \n     market. This has promoted investment and the fruits of this \n     competition have been a dramatic reduction in cost and more \n     choice for American consumers. This competition and the \n     strict enforcement of our anti-trust laws have also rendered \n     these same domestic companies vulnerable to takeover by \n     foreign firms which are still owned substantially by their \n     governments.\n       To allow a foreign government owned corporation to purchase \n     a U.S. telecommunications company would be putting domestic \n     competitors at the mercy of a foreign government. No country \n     should allow this.\n       We are not opposed to foreign investment in U.S. \n     communications firms. Rather, as the U.S. law provides, we \n     oppose the transfer of licenses to companies who are more \n     than 25 percent foreign government owned. For example, there \n     was no objection to vodaphone's purchase of Airtouch or \n     France Telecom's holding a non-controlling (10 percent) \n     interest in Sprint.\n       For these reasons, we would urge that you highly scrutinize \n     any merger involving foreign government owned providers.\n       Sincerely, Ernest F. Hollings and 29 other Senators.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2000.\n     Hon. William Kennard,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Recent press reports indicate that \n     foreign government owned telecommunications monopolies are \n     interested in purchasing a variety of U.S. telecommunications \n     assets. Such an action would be contrary to U.S. law, which \n     is clear on this issue. I urge that you publicly address this \n     issue and put to an end the speculation that such a \n     transaction might be approved.\n       The World Trade Organization Global Basic \n     Telecommunications Agreement does not address government \n     owned providers. Moreover, U.S. statutory law is quite \n     specific. Under 47 U.S.C. 310(a) governments or their \n     representatives are barred outright from purchasing U.S. \n     telecommunications entities. Deutsche Telekom or France \n     Telecom, for example, fit this mold. Indeed, Business Week \n     specifically notes this week that one third of Deutsche \n     Telekom's employees are government workers who cannot be \n     terminated. In 1995, Scott Blake Harris, then head of the \n     FCC's International Bureau, testified before the Senate \n     Commerce Committee that Section 310(a)'s outright ban on \n     foreign government ownership of radio licenses should be \n     retained. Subsequent to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, he \n     wrote in the National Law Journal: ``More problematic, \n     however, are the restrictions placed by the Communications \n     Act on ownership of wireless licenses by a foreign government \n     or it's `representative.' Section 310(a) flatly prohibits a \n     foreign government or its representative from holding any \n     wireless license, directly or indirectly. This limitation is \n     not subject to being waived by the FCC.'' In that article, he \n     specifically mentioned Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom \n     relative to that ban.\n       Others argue that these transactions may come under Section \n     310(b) of the Communications Act. In 1995, U.S. Trade \n     Representative Mickey Kantor wrote Senator Robert Byrd that \n     Section 310(b) ``is regarded by foreign companies as a major \n     barrier to market access in the United States.'' He went on \n     to indicate that legislative authority was needed to ``remove \n     this restraint through international negotiations.'' As you \n     well know, after extensive debate and consideration of this \n     issue in both the House and Senate, the 1996 \n     Telecommunications Act did not provide such authority. Thus, \n     it is not surprising that the European Union, in a 1999 trade \n     report, identifies Section 310 as retaining force and effect, \n     notwithstanding the Global Basic Telecommunications Agreement \n     in 1997. As the European Union correctly recognizes, an \n     executive agreement cannot override U.S. statutory text. As \n     George Washington stated in his farewell address, ``If the \n     distribution or modification of the powers under the \n     Constitution be in any particular wrong, let it\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\n     be changed in the way the Constitution designates, for while \n     usurpation in the one instance may be the instrument of good, \n     it is the customary weapon by which free governments are \n     destroyed.''\n       The law is clear. Moreover, public policy dictates that we \n     not permit the anticompetitive acquisition of our domestic \n     telecommunications companies by foreign government owned \n     entities. It's unthinkable, for example, under present law \n     that Bell South is forbidden from buying AT, but Deutsche \n     Telekom, a monopoly owned by the German government with one \n     third of their employees enjoying permanent employ, can buy \n     AT Bottom line: We did not deregulate U.S. \n     telecommunications to permit the regulated foreign government \n     owned telecommunications companies to take over the U.S. \n     market.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, finally, on July 20, I received a letter \nfrom the Honorable William E. Kennard, Chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission, which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Federal Communications Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     the reported plans of foreign government-controlled companies \n     to purchase a majority interest in U.S. telecommunications \n     firms. As you know, there is presently no application of the \n     type you describe before the Federal Communications \n     Commission, and thus I can only address your concerns as a \n     hypothetical matter. Nevertheless, I share your concern that \n     purchase of a U.S. carrier by a foreign government-controlled \n     company does present unique competition issues. Please be \n     assured that I will carefully scrutinize any transaction in \n     which a foreign government-controlled telecommunications \n     carrier seeks to control a U.S. carrier.\n       Any such proposed transaction would come before the \n     Commission as an application to exceed 25 percent foreign \n     indirect ownership of a common carrier radio license. In that \n     case, the applicant would have to meet both the statutory and \n     regulatory requirements established by Congress and the \n     Commission.\n       I wholeheartedly agree that we have made tremendous \n     progress since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 in deregulating and prying open our domestic \n     communications market and that we must remain vigilant in \n     ensuring that our market stays open and robust. Moreover, I \n     believe, as you do, that the Commission's approach must \n     promote competition and maintain a secure telecommunications \n     system for our national security. Thus, while it would be \n     inappropriate for me to prejudge the outcome of a \n     hypothetical transaction, I assure you that I would give \n     close scrutiny to any merger involving foreign government-\n     controlled providers to determine whether it would pose a \n     very high risk to competition in the United States, \n     compromise national security, and be consistent with the \n     Communications Act, the FCC's rules and U.S. international \n     obligations.\n       As always, I welcome the opportunity to work with you to \n     further address any questions or concerns related to our \n     scrutiny of such transactions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William E. Kennard,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, sections 310(a) and 310(b) are very \nclear.\n  It could be noted historically--because there has been an ongoing \nintramural debate with respect to the turning over of our \ntelecommunications to foreign governments by the White House, by this \nadministration, by the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador \nBarshefsky, and its minions--that we have had to struggle with, and I \nincluded those documents.\n  I reference also that particular letter of July 12 because in there I \ncited the ongoing concern of then former Ambassador Mickey Kantor with \nrespect to German government participation in America's \ntelecommunications.\n  I also cited in there that the head of the international bureau, Mr. \nScott Blake Harris, in 1995, testified before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee that section 310(a)'s outright ban on foreign government \nownership should be retained.\n  Of course, we had the act in February of 1996. Subsequent to that, \nlater in 1996, the head of the FCC's former international bureau, just \nretired, included a very instructive article in the National Law \nJournal:\n\n       More problematic, however, are the restrictions placed by \n     the Communications Act on ownership of wireless licenses by a \n     foreign government or its representative. Section 310(a) \n     flatly prohibits a foreign government or its representative \n     from holding any wireless license, directly or indirectly. \n     This limitation is not subject to an FCC waiver.\n\n  Mr. President, there is no question that law has not been changed.\n  I know about the attempts made by Ambassador Barshefsky and the \nglobal telecommunications agreement in 1997--that if you are a Member \nof the WTO, then you automatically qualify under the public interest \nrequirement of the telecommunications law to own U.S. \ntelecommunications assets. They say it's in the public interest, that \nit promotes competition.\n  That has been the wag, or argument, that I have heard from time \nimmemorial. But that is not the case at all. You take Deutsche Telekom, \nwhich recently had a bond issue. It was very successful--$14 billion. \nMind you me, they wouldn't have collected some $14 billion if it were a \nprivate company. But this is ``a government cannot fail'' with one-\nthird of the employees having permanent employment. You cannot fire \nthem. That is Deutsche Telekom, and by the Chairman's own \nacknowledgment, with 58-percent German government ownership.\n  We are not talking about German entities. We are talking about the \nGerman government. You can't let foreign governmental ownership enter \nthe free market here, a market that has been deregulated by the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act, and say: Oh, yes, we are ready to compete.\n  We have a strange situation whereby Deutsche Telekom under Ambassador \nBarshefsky and some in the White House--and perhaps some at the FCC--\nsay: Yes. It is already in the public interest. They are competitive; \nwe are promoting competition. But Deutsche Telekom can take over, let's \nsay, AT, but under the law, categorically, Bell South cannot.\n  Let me mention why I emphasize the German government--because there \nwas a letter by the distinguished chairman of our committee, the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, in which he referred to ``entities.'' \nHe didn't refer to the government. Let's get right to entities and \nglobalization.\n  There was a recent article that said, after all, Senator Hollings was \na veteran of World War II where he fought against the Germans. It \nsuggested that Sen. Hollings was anti-German and that he thought maybe \nthe German government wouldn't be friendly. You know, coming from South \nCarolina, we are supposed to be dumb, and Senator Hollings just didn't \nunderstand that we have moved into globalization, the world economy, \nand world competition.\n\n  I don't want to sound like Vice President Gore, but I am constrained \nto acknowledge that maybe I helped start globalization. As the Governor \nof South Carolina in 1960, I went to Europe in order to attract German \nindustry investment in South Carolina. As I stand on the floor, I have \n116 German industries in the State of South Carolina. I have the \nheadquarters of British Bowater. I have the North American headquarters \nof Michelin. They have 11,600 employees. I have Hoffman-LaRoche from \nSwitzerland.\n  You ought to come down there and join the smorgasbord of global \ncompetition.\n  That is not the case that concerns the Senator from South Carolina. \nWhat concerns me is ``governmental.'' We certainly didn't deregulate \nAmerican control to put it under German control. It is that clear. It \ndoes not require any careful review. The law is the law. We refuse to \nchange it. The White House acts like it has been changed. Some on the \nFCC act like it has been changed. The law and the policy have not been \nchanged.\n  Several things have occurred. We have a bill in with 15 cosponsors, \nwith the distinguished majority and minority leaders as cosponsors. We \nhave over on the House side Congressmen Dingell and Markey who \nintroduced a similar bill. We put a rider on the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill, which is an appropriations bill that lasts for \nonly one year, and no money is to be expended to give licenses to \nforeign governments under Section 310.\n  You would think that they would get it. The Dutch got it. It is very \ninteresting that KPN tried to take over Telefonica d'Espana. They were \nrejected. Incidentally, Deutsche Telekom tried to take over Telecom \nItalia. Italy voted them out. Singapore Tel tried to\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\ntake over Hong Kong Telephone. Hong Kong voted them out.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article dated July 19 printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Dutch State To Slash KPN Stake\n\n                   (By Kirstin Ridley and Matt Daily)\n\n       LONDON/THE HAGUE, July 19 (Reuters)--The Dutch government \n     may slash its 43.5 percent stake in Dutch carrier KPN Telecom \n     to just over 20 percent as part of a global share issue \n     slated for the fourth quarter, an industry source said on \n     Wednesday.\n       KPN is hoping to raise around 15 billion euros ($14 \n     billion) from the issue, with about four billion slated for \n     third generation mobile investments in Germany, the \n     Netherlands and Belgium and 10 billion for the government, \n     the source said.\n       The Dutch state had hoped to raise around nine billion \n     euros from its current auction of UMTS licenses. But with \n     only five major contenders for five licenses, analysts say \n     earlier estimates look for too high, and some now believe the \n     licenses might only fetch around three billion euros.\n       That shortfall for government coffers could now be made up \n     with the KPN share issue.\n       The Dutch Finance Ministry, whose large KPN stake was \n     blamed for prompting Madrid to help derail Dutch merger talks \n     with Spanish carrier Telefonica in May, said only it would \n     take part in the stock issue ``in a big way''.\n       ``We can't say the percentage (of our stake that will be \n     sold in the issue) * * * but we are going to participate in \n     the offering because we have said in the long-term we would \n     get rid of our stake,'' said Finance Ministry spokesman \n     Stephan Schrover.\n       The Dutch government has said it will have sold its entire \n     KPN stake by 2004. But it has so far given no timing details, \n     and news of the share issue sent KPN's stock plunging.\n       It ended 7.3 percent lower at 42.87 euros, valuing the \n     company at around 44.2 billion euros.\n       The industry source also noted that a listing of KPN \n     Mobile, KPN's cellphone business which is 15 percent-owned by \n     Japanese mobile phone giant NTT DoCoMo, was ``pencilled in'' \n     for next February or March. It was delayed from an earlier \n     proposed date of September, 2000, due to the planned KPN \n     share issue.\n\n\n                        kpn eyes belgium buy-out\n\n       Meanwhile KPN, which is seeking to buy the 50 percent it \n     does not own in Belgian mobile phone group KPN Orange, is \n     likely to offer its current joint venture partner France \n     Telecom around one billion euros for its stake.\n       France Telecom has to resolve questions surrounding its 50 \n     percent stake in KPN Orange, which it inherited from its \n     takeover of British mobile phone company Orange, for \n     regulatory reasons because it holds a competing Belgian \n     cellphone operator.\n       KPN will raise the 15 billion initially through a short-\n     term bridging loan, which it will pay back swiftly from the \n     issue.\n       For bankers say KPN would risk compromising an implied mid \n     investment grade credit rating if it sought to raise a long-\n     term loan of that size. Any credit is strictly conditional on \n     prompt pay-back through the share issue, they say.\n       The issue will be aimed at institutional investors around \n     the world and at private investors in the Netherlands, \n     Germany and the United States. ABN AMRO Rothschild, Goldman \n     Sachs International and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney will \n     act as joint global coordinators.\n\n\n                          FRESH SPANISH TALKS?\n\n       News that the state is cutting its stake could pave the way \n     for fresh merger talks with Spain's Telefonica.\n       KPN has said it remains open to any possible deal with \n     Spain's former state-owned telecoms giant. But it has also \n     noted that time is moving on.\n       Since May, it has signed up two new allies--Japanese \n     cellphone giant NTT DoCoMo and Hong Kong conglomerate \n     Hutchison Whampoa, making the accommodation of a Spanish deal \n     increasingly complex.\n       Nevertheless the aborted Spanish merger talks were partly \n     blamed on the fact that Telefonica's Chairman Juan Villalonga \n     had fallen out with his former schoolmate, Spanish Prime \n     Minister Jose Maria Aznar, as well as with key shareholders.\n       But Villalonga is now under mounting pressure from core \n     investors to resign amid a stock market probe into \n     allegations that he violated insider trading rules.\n       It remains uncertain whether any successor can be found \n     with the ambition and experience to run a Spanish/Dutch \n     venture.\n       (Additional reporting by Tessa Walsh.)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President:\n\n       The Dutch Government may slash its 43.5 percent stake in \n     Dutch carrier KPN Telecom to just over 20 percent as part of \n     a global share issue slated for the fourth quarter, an \n     industry source said on Wednesday.\n\n  If a foreign government owns more than 25 percent of the telephone \ncompany, they are not welcome. If they own less than 25 percent, they \nare welcome. We love the Germans. Tell them to come to America.\n  One addendum. This won't take but a couple of minutes because the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee is on the floor. I hold \nthe earlier announcement from a newspaper this week that the surplus \nforecast has doubled. We heard the distinguished Senator, Mr. Roth of \nDelaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, putting through \nhis budget. We had a vote this morning on the marriage penalty. Tax \ncut, tax cut, tax cut. To this Senator who lives in the real world, \nthat is an increase in the debt.\n  When they announced this, I went to what they call the Budget and \nEconomic Outlook of the Congressional Budget Office. That is what the \narticle quoted that said the surplus doubled. On page 17, we can see \nthe debt, as reported by the CBO, goes from $5.617 trillion to $6.370 \ntrillion, an increase of $753 billion.\n  It wasn't there that they found the surplus. I said, the President is \nalways good at finding surpluses, so I went to his Mid-session Review, \ntable 23 on page 49 in the back, and I see instead that the debt \nincreased $1 trillion.\n  Then I called Treasury and I asked them. I have now the most recent \nreport from this morning. It shows the public debt to the penny. It has \nincreased $22 billion according to the U.S. Treasury.\n  I reiterate the Budget Committee's wonderful offer: If you want to \nbecome a millionaire--and I am sure the distinguished chairman can find \nthat million in the surplus; I have heard him mention it, also--we will \ngive $1 million to anyone who can find a real surplus that Congress and \nall the media are talking about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I might ask Senator Hollings a question. I \nwas listening to the remarks about telecommunications, and I was very \nimpressed.\n  Am I to understand that we have a regulated, governmentally-owned \ncompany that wants to buy into a deregulated market which we have \ncreated?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator's question concludes--as astute as our \ndistinguished chairman is--the answer. It is that Deutsche Telekom is \ngovernment regulated and controlled. That is the best answer. We were \ntrying to continue the competition, but we cannot compete with the \ngovernment coming in. If they are going to allow that, I vote under \nyour budget and mine that we go over there and take over China's \ncommunications. If we can take over China's communications, we can cut \nthe defense budget in half. They wouldn't know where to go or how to do \nit. We would be in charge over there in Beijing.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I don't agree on whether we have a surplus or \nnot, and I listened attentively to that discussion, too, but I actually \nthink you are raising a very good point in telecommunications. I voted \nfor the telecommunications reform, but one of the big strengths, we \nwere deregulating the industry.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That has caused part of the economic boom we are \nenjoying at this particular time. All this stirring of investment and \nexpansion and services and competition is a wonderful dynamic that we \nall enjoy. Let's keep it going.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It seems to me the question we have to ask is, Do we \nwant a deregulated market that is working very, very well?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. In this particular company, Deutsche Telekom, one-third \nof the employees have permanent employment. Wouldn't you and I love \nthat--permanent employment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have been here 28 years. It is almost that.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have been here 34 years just about, and I am still \nthe junior Senator. And Senator Thurmond said, ``Get used to it.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On this one subject, I have great respect for you and \nconsider you a friend. I hope you are my friend.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You are my best friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7429-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7429-S7431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAXES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to lay before the Senate two \npropositions. One, using a normal conventional budget approach, I want \nto\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\nshare with the Senate the incredible amount of money we are taking from \nour taxpayers each year, and for the foreseeable future, that the \ncurrent Government doesn't need. The question is, How much of that \nextra money we are getting from our taxpayers should we give back to \nthem, and how much should we spend, and how much should we put on the \ndebt?\n  That is a very important threesome, with everybody knowing one of the \nmost significant things to do is to get the debt down. Pervasive in \neverybody's plan, whether it is a 10-year plan or whatever, is don't \ngive it all back; put some on the debt.\n  Those who know they want to spend a portion of it have to answer the \nquestion, Do you not want to give some back to the taxpayer? And a \nfurther question: Don't you want to try to fix the Tax Code where it is \nunfair and where it unfairly taxes Americans?\n  I think the answer would be, if you have a very large surplus, that \nessentially belongs to the taxpayer--not the Government; it just \nhappens we are putting in more taxes than we need. The question should \nbe, Do you want to fix the marriage tax penalty?\n  I believe almost anyone looking at the American Tax Code and taking \ninto account our culture, what we live by, what we say is powerful \nabout America, has to say that we honor and respect married life along \nwith families. We are not saying it has to be every family structure, \nbut I think nobody should disagree, we surely want to stay there and \nmove in that direction and cherish that concept.\n  If we do, then you have to answer a question: If that is the case, \nwhy would we leave a tax on the books that makes it more difficult for \nmarried couples to survive economically? We tax the working couple and \nthe married couple more than we would tax two individuals who are not \nmarried, earning the same income.\n  That is the essence of the problem. Most married husbands and wives \nare not quite aware, if they run into two people with whom they have \nbeen friends a long time and they have similar jobs to theirs, and the \ntwo who have a family are struggling, their friends are paying \nsignificantly less in taxes because they are not married. That is what \nwe are asked: Do we have enough resources accumulated in surpluses to \ndo that?\n  Second, there is a very onerous tax called the death tax. Anybody \nlooking at the Tax Code would have to say that deserves looking at, \nbecause at a point in time it is no longer considered to be very \nwealthy; or on an estate that has a lot of assets, citizens can wake up \nand find out that the Federal Government is going to take 55 percent of \nthe accumulated worth that might have come over 40 years of work.\n  Say you have parents, a mother and father living together, \nstruggling, both working, and they now own two filling stations--I use \nthat as an example--and a very nice house. Today, filling stations are \nnot the little filling stations with two pumps that were on Highway 66 \nwhen I grew up. If you were in the business, it was a pretty good \nenterprise, but you owned two of them because you worked at it. Both of \nthem are in an airplane crash and die. They have five kids, three \nkids--whatever. What a shock when those two filling stations and the \nhouse are worth, just hypothetically, probably in today's market, $1.5 \nmillion to $2 million.\n  They are going to get whacked by the Federal Government on everything \nover $650,000. That is not fair. The Democrats can deny this and talk \nabout all the rich people who are not going to pay, but most Americans \nsay it is not fair to take it away. Believe it; I may get there myself. \nThings are happening so vibrantly in the American economy, maybe this \nperson is looking at this and says: I might be rich enough for them to \ntake away 55 percent of what I had left and accumulated in my life. So \nwhat the Republicans have done is they have said: Let's, over time, get \nrid of that. Let's take the marriage tax penalty and really take the ax \nand chop a bunch of it away.\n  There can be two reasons the President will veto these bills, and two \nreasons that most of the Democrats who have voted against them would \nuse as their excuses. No. 1, they say it is too big a tax cut and \ntherefore it uses up too much of the surplus. They even use the word \n``risky.'' What is risky, in essence, to fix the marriage tax penalty? \nThere is nothing risky about that. What is risky about getting rid of \nthe death tax? That cannot be risky per se.\n  So this is what happens. The answer is it is risky because it is \ngiving too much back to the American taxpayer and we do not want to \ngive that much because that is risky economics.\n  I want to make one simple point today and that is for anybody who is \nlistening, wondering: Is there money left for Medicare if we want to do \nsomething, small or large, about it? Is there money left if we decide \nto move in a direction of more defense money each year? Is there money \nif we were to decide on a little more assistance for education? I will \ntell everyone you should understand we do not participate, out of the \nNational Treasury, in helping with education to any significant degree. \nSo we have our debates about education but we are talking about 8 \npercent of the funding for our public schools that comes out of Federal \ntax coffers. Maybe at one point it was 9, but it is now tottering \nbetween 7.5 and 8.5 percent. Maybe we want to change that and make it 2 \npercent higher.\n  I want to assure everyone, using conventional, acceptable budget \nanalysis, if the President were to sign the Republican tax cuts which \namount to $195 billion over 10 years--do you see this chart? You can \nhardly see the piece in red that the U.S. Government is giving back to \nthe people. See the little sliver?\n  All of this is money set aside for the Social Security trust fund or, \nbelieve it or not, a huge amount of money over the decade that the \ntaxpayer has sent us that does not belong to Social Security. Therefore \nwe say: Is that too much? We are calling this the love and death tax \ncuts. I don't know who nicknamed it that on the floor, but I borrowed \nit here. Only 5 percent of the non-Social Security surplus will be used \nover the decade. Five percent will be used for those two taxes.\n  Frankly, I challenge anybody to say to the American people this is \nrisky, giving back that much in tax cuts. All the rest of the money \nthat we might need for anything--Social Security, Medicare--is all the \nrest of this surplus that is in white. Because that total is $3.15 \ntrillion--trillion--of which we are giving back, under our cuts, $195 \nbillion. You understand, the argument cannot be maintained that it is \ntoo big. The only argument that can be made is that we would like to \nuse it for something else.\n  I would like somebody to come down and we can talk about President \nClinton's marriage tax penalty relief. It is so small, in his tax \npackage; it is 10 percent of what he would do in his various tax relief \ntargeted measures--10 percent. I believe the marriage tax penalty has \nto be solved, and it cannot be 10 percent of the tax package that you \nput before the Congress. It has to take care of the marriage tax \npenalty significantly, substantially, almost all.\n\n  Then let's look at this. The Clinton-Gore budget that we got showed \n10 years with new spending. Out of the $3.35 trillion, that plan would \nspend $1.35 trillion, leaving $1.99 trillion. I do not believe we are \never going to spend this much out of this surplus. But even if you gave \nthem all that money, there is $1.99 trillion left, of which we are \ngiving back $195 billion.\n  I truly believe when we really get down to this, in order to make \nsense to the American people, the President and those who oppose this \nare going to have to say we really don't believe that a significant \nportion of this money that is accumulating, that the taxpayer has paid \nto us, that is in excess of our Government needs--you have to be saying \nwe are not going to give much of it back. I believe that is a terrible \nmistake. Unless you could say--and nobody could say this--we are not \ngoing to touch any of it; we are going to put it all against the \nnational debt.\n  The next time I come to the floor I will tell you how much we are \nreducing the national debt already. It is the most significant \nreduction of the national debt, that will occur by the end of this \nyear, for a 3-year period. And there is no comparable debt reduction \nperiod in American history; it is so big.\n  So the only answer could be: Wait around for our plan and we will not \ngive the taxpayers back that much money; or they will come to the floor\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\nand say they want to give it all back to the poor taxpayer, the \ntaxpayer who is middle income and poor. Before we are finished, that \ndebate is going to be talked about, too.\n  What we have to do when we have a tax cut, we have to give it back to \npeople who are paying taxes. One would not think that tax relief would \nmean giving it back, in some way, so the people paying taxes do not get \nany relief, and those who are not paying, or paying very little, they \nget some relief--even a check from the Federal Government. To say we \nthink you are paying too much taxes, even if you are not paying any, so \nwe give you back more money--that may be one of the propositions. We \nought to debate that for the American people. You can then say the tax \nrelief is going to the working poor. Frankly, you are not giving it to \nanybody who earns money enough to pay a tax. I thought this all was \nabout tax reduction. I thought the overage was giving back Americans \nwho paid it a little more, a little bit more than what is being talked \nabout by the other side.\n  I close by saying some people think it is a mystery about all this \nnew revenue we have, this surplus, part of which goes to Social \nSecurity and part of it is left over. There is no mystery about it. \nCumulatively, all the taxpayers who are paying taxes, the American \npeople, the combined amount has increased. Some will come up and say, \n``but the median income has not increased, this has not increased, and \nthe tax on these people has not increased''--how does the tax take go \nup $3.35 trillion? Everybody out there combined is paying more taxes--\nand is it really more? Yes, it is. On average, America existed and \nexisted beautifully with 18 percent of the gross domestic product \ncoming into the Government as taxes.\n  We are now at 20.4 percent, 2.4 percent higher in terms of a tax take \nversus the gross domestic product of our Nation, a way to measure what \nwe want to measure, and that is out of the total economy how much are \nwe taking away and putting in our coffers. It is very high at 20.4 \npercent, and the economy is booming. The reason we have the surplus is \nbecause we are taking more from the taxpayers.\n  I believe if it can be understood and if we can get around ads that \nare confusing the issue and attack ads that have nothing to do with the \nreal problems and issues, if we can boil it down to: Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica, if the surplus is this much, would it seem fair to you that we \nshould give back 25 percent of it to the American people by way of tax \nrelief? I think most people would probably end up saying: I guess that \nseems fair; maybe that is even a little low.\n  That would leave 75 percent of this surplus for the things everybody \nsays we will take care of when we get a new Congress. I submit that we \ncannot forget the taxpayers as we think about new ways to spend this \nsurplus. We ought to probably start with them, not stop with them at \nthe end of the line. That is what we will be talking about, it seems to \nme, in the next few months, at least I hope so.\n  Then we can look at whose tax cuts are fair. We will see the other \nside stack up dollars and say the Republicans give it back to the rich \npeople. The marriage tax penalty relief in this bill, in terms of to \nwhom it goes--if the President of the United States would listen to us \ninstead of listening to the technical advice of the Treasury \nDepartment--it is eminently fair; it is loaded at the bottom end of the \nearnings and yet gives people in the middle- and high-income categories \nsomething.\n  If you do not want that, what do you want? Stack up the dollar \nbills--rich versus the poor--all you want when it comes to the marriage \ntax penalty, which is a very big and fair tax cut and tax reform at the \nsame time.\n  Obviously, I am on a subject on which I could talk for a long time, \nand I continue to have a lot of interest buildup in me. Sooner or \nlater, people listening cannot pay attention, and I believe we are \ngetting close to that.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senate for giving me the privilege of \nspeaking.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7431-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7431-S7435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONSERVATION AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor and spend \na few minutes this afternoon talking about a very important bill that \nis moving through this Congress--it is the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act of 2000--and to talk about some of the more important \naspects of this legislation as it passed the House by an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority a couple of weeks ago. This bill is being \nconsidered as I speak in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nwhich is ably chaired by my good friend from Alaska and the leadership \nof our friend from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  It is appropriate I follow with my remarks on the heels of our other \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, because as I appreciate his \nremarks, he was speaking about the obligation we have to make good and \nwise decisions about the surplus. He, of course, was arguing for as \nmuch of that money as possible to go to tax cuts, supported by many \nmembers of his party. Along that same line, we will be judged in this \nCongress by the discipline, restraint, and good judgment we show on \nthis issue. Truly, these are happy days in Washington because we are \ntalking about an extraordinarily historic surplus. A lot of that should \nbe credited to the current administration and the President's policies \nregarding discipline in budgets, spending restraint, as well as a \nstrategic investment for America's working families.\n  Nonetheless, it is much better when we can all agree to talk about \nallocating these surpluses than trying to fairly distribute sacrifices \nor fairly distributing cuts. It is a good time to be here so we can \nmake good judgments on behalf of all the people whom we represent--of \ncourse, coming from the State of Louisiana, that is 4.5 million \npeople--in the country and, frankly, the world as to our obligations to \nour neighbors around the world.\n\n  In this great discussion about how much should go for tax cuts and \nthen when we set aside money for tax cuts, how should it be allocated, \nwhat families should receive those tax cuts, how can we help to \nstrengthen and widen the circle of economic opportunity, that clearly \nhas a role and, hopefully, we will have more discussions about that in \nthe days ahead.\n  There will be, as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, an \nopportunity to make some strategic investments. We should pay down our \ndebt, and we should give a significant portion of tax breaks to working \nfamilies in America, helping them with the things that are most \nimportant to them--sustaining the strength of their family, providing \neducational opportunities and economic opportunities for children and \ngrandchildren. That is what every parent in America wants, to see the \nopportunities for their children greatly expanded.\n  The third thing we are going to be discussing is how to take some of \nthis money, hard earned by the American people--not necessarily the \nGovernment's money, but the people's money--how should we allocate the \npeople's money on their behalf for the good of their future.\n  That is part of our job as Members of Congress. I am very proud to be \nleading a great bipartisan effort by many Senators in this Chamber and \nHouse Members who are arguing that a small portion of this surplus, a \nsmall portion of the $2.2 trillion surplus--let me say our portion \nrepresents about 1 percent of this surplus; less than 1 percent \nactually--should be invested in the environmental resources of this \nNation, along our coasts, in our interior portions of the Nation, for \nwildlife conservation, preservation of our coastlines, and investments \nin other types of environmental programs that have been underfunded and \nundernourished for decades. There have been promises made by Congresses \nin the past but promises not kept. It is time that we make strategic \ninvestments to fund those programs and to hold and keep our promises to \nour children and grandchildren.\n  I wanted to come to the floor to show you the front page of USA \nToday. I am\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\ngoing to include this entire, lengthy, and well-researched and well-\nwritten article in the Record. The headline is: ``Growth Reshapes \nCoasts: A Wave of Development Overwhelms Our Shores.''\n  I want to read a couple of the important highlights from this article \nfor this debate and conversation this afternoon because the essence of \nthe CARA bill is that now is the time to take a portion of offshore oil \nand gas revenues that are currently streaming right into the general \nfund, to intercept some of these funds and send them back to coastal \ncounties and interior counties for investments, strategic investments \nin the environment, to help us have good growth, to make wise \ndecisions, so that we can start this century by laying down some \nresources that will help us to grow and develop in the right ways in \nthe years to come.\n  According to this article, again, the growth along the coasts is \ngoing to be explosive. Let me read a little bit from this article:\n\n       A USA TODAY analysis has found that an estimated 41 million \n     people--more than one in seven Americans--now reside in a \n     county that abuts the eastern or southern seaboard. That \n     number swells by several million when inland residents with \n     second homes near the shore are included. . . .\n       In making that choice, these coastal migrants are \n     transforming seasonal resort towns that used to bustle for \n     just a few summer months--\n\n  We are all used to communities such as this--\n\n     into sprawling, year-round communities that are starting to \n     look and feel like, well, everyplace else. Up and down the \n     coast, development is spreading for miles inland. New \n     residents attract new businesses to serve them, workers move \n     in to fill the new jobs that are created, and new housing, \n     schools, malls and hospitals spring up to serve the workers.\n\n  What are we doing today to prepare for this coming boom? It goes on \nto say:\n\n       This shoreline strip is growing significantly faster than \n     the rest of the country in population, employment and gross \n     domestic product. In many cases, these counties have the \n     fastest-growing economies in their states.\n\n  I think this is a very key point:\n\n       Since 1993, the population of these hot 100 counties has \n     grown nearly 50 percent faster than the entire USA. About \n     1,000 year-round settlers are arriving each day. Jobs have \n     been created at a 30 percent greater clip, and GDP through \n     1997, the latest year for county breakdowns, grew 20 percent \n     faster.\n\n  These counties are growing rapidly, as our more mobile, more affluent \npopulation seeks and chooses to live along the coasts.\n  In an interesting quote in the article by Cleveland State's Hill:\n\n       It used to be that you moved to where the jobs are. Now, \n     people are deciding where they want to live, and the jobs are \n     following them.\n\n  Part of our goal in Congress is to be leaders, and part of the job of \nbeing a leader is to have enough vision to see past where you are \ntoday, to be able to see where we are going, so that we can lay down \nand make the strategic decisions that will benefit our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  I have a 3-year-old and an 8-year-old. Frank and I are doing our best \nto be good parents in raising them. I often think about the fact that \nwhat I do here I want to do so that when Mary Shannon is 40 or 50 or \n60, and is finished raising her family and beginning to have \ngrandchildren, that everyone in America will be better off. What will \nthis country look like when she is that age or when Connor is in his \n40s or 50s or 60s?\n  That is what this bill is actually about, because CARA mandates that \nwe should take a small portion of our revenues to make important \ninvestments, which are shown by these projections that are listed here \nand in many articles and which are cited in many speeches, including \nthose given by Governors and local officials. They are saying, look \nwhat is happening. Let's make plans now.\n  Quoting the article further:\n\n       Urban planners say growth along the coast should be \n     propelled for another 10 to 20 years by demographic, economic \n     and social trends.\n\n  Additionally, it is clear--and the Senator from Florida was just \nspeaking about this earlier in the week in committee--\n\n       Until the 1990s, the destination of choice was Florida --\n\n  That one State has seen explosive and extraordinary growth in the \nlast 20 years--\n\n     with its perpetually balmy, one-season climate. But now the \n     entire coast lures settlers. Up north, the shore in winter \n     has higher temperatures and less snowfall. Farther south, \n     [along the shores] the winters are moderate, and mild sea \n     breezes offer relief from stifling heat.\n\n  People would flock to Florida in the 1980s and 1990s, but what these \ndemographers are saying is that in the next 20 to 30 years, all the \ncoast along the south and the eastern seaboard will experience similar \ngrowth.\n  My question to this Congress is, What are we doing today to prepare? \nOne of the things we can do is to pass CARA and to reinvest at least $1 \nbillion in our coastal resources to help our communities, our \nGovernors, our county commissioners, and our mayors cope with this \nexplosive growth, so we do have good development but that we preserve \nthe precious beaches; that we allow for public spaces, so that all \npeople, whether they are affluent enough to own a second home or \nwhether they can just manage to get their kids in the car and spend a \nweekend on a beach at a moderately priced hotel, or whether they can \njust manage a day or two camping outside--we must preserve our coast \nand invest some of this money so that as this country grows over the \nnext 20, 30, and 40 years, we can say we have done something.\n  I feel so passionately about these revenues. While they are general \nfund revenues, their source is from oil and gas, from the bounty that \nGod has given to this country. Oil and gas in the Outer Continental \nShelf is a depletable resource. One day, as those of us from Louisiana \nknow, these wells will be dried up. There will be no more gas. There \nwill be no more oil to be drawn. They will be depleted.\n\n  Hopefully, we will find other sources of fuel, some that are more \nenvironmentally friendly. I most certainly support that. Actually, \nnatural gas is a very environmentally friendly fuel.\n  My question to my colleagues is: When these oil and gas wells are \ndried up, and we no longer receive the taxes that are currently being \npaid, what will we have to show for our money?\n  I would like to look up and say: We invested those revenues well; we \nhave expanded through the interior of our Nation a great park system; \nwe have expanded hunting and fishing areas to preserve them for our \nchildren and grandchildren, and, yes, we were smart enough to take \ntaxes from resources from our coasts and invest them in coastlines all \nacross the United States, so that we would have sand dunes and beaches, \nand our fisheries would be protected, as well as to provide for the \nproper development of our coastal areas.\n  It would be a great shame to leave this Congress without making a \nserious commitment to the environment of our Nation and to coastal \ncommunities everywhere, not just in the South, not just on the east \ncoast, but in the Great Lakes region and along our precious western \nseaboard. This is the time to act.\n  I suggest to my colleague from New Mexico, in speaking about tax \ncuts, it is most appropriate to return some money from this great \nsurplus to hard-working Americans and middle-class families throughout \nthe Nation. There are many ways we can provide tax relief, and we \nshould certainly do that. But it is also equally important that we make \nstrategic investments, to lay down bills and initiatives and funding \nsources now that will help us, as our population in this Nation is \nexpected to double from 260 million to over 500 million people in the \nnext 100 years, much of that population moving to the coastal areas. As \npeople will decide where they want to move, the jobs will follow. There \nis going to be a migration to our coasts.\n  Let us begin this new century by making a smart choice and a wise \ninvestment and invest in some of our coasts.\n  The Chair has been patient because, representing Nebraska, we have \nnot figured out a way to get him a coastline yet, but we are working on \nit. He knows this bill takes care of interior States as well as coastal \nStates by allowing all Governors and local officials to make some wise \ninvestments with these funds.\n  I came to the floor to share this article. I will submit it for the \nRecord. I hope my colleagues will take an opportunity in the next \ncouple of days to\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\nread it. I again thank Senator Murkowski from Alaska and Senator \nBingaman from New Mexico for their leadership and also acknowledge the \nsupport of Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, as we have moved this bill \nthrough the process, and the President of the United States, for their \ncommitment and support to this effort.\n  I look forward to debating this even further next week.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, July 20, 2000]\n\n                         Growth Reshapes Coasts\n\n           (By Owen Ullmann, Paul Overberg and Rick Hampson)\n\n       A new American migration, one that rivals the exodus from \n     the Frostbelt to the Sunbelt a generation ago, is \n     transforming the Atlantic and Gulf shorelines.\n       From the rock-strewn shoreline of Maine to the sandy \n     barrier islands hugging Texas, an unprecedented influx of \n     residents is converting laid-back, seasonal resort towns into \n     year-round communities with burgeoning economies.\n       Sixtysomething retirees and aging baby boomers, aided by \n     fattened stock portfolios and flexible work arrangements, are \n     settling on the coast full-time or snapping up vacation homes \n     for retirement later. Al are drawn by a simple, alluring \n     premise: The weather, the recreation, the scenery--it's \n     better at the beach.\n       A USA TODAY analysis has found that an estimated 41 million \n     people--more than one in seven Americans--now reside in a \n     county that abuts the eastern or southern seaboard. That \n     number swells by several million when inland residents with \n     second homes near the shore are included.\n       ``We're in the midst of an amenities movement,'' observes \n     Edward Hill, a professor of urban studies at Cleveland State \n     University in Ohio. ``Improved technology, greater wealth and \n     better transportation are giving people more choices about \n     where to live. They're choosing the coast.''\n       In making that choice, these coastal migrants are \n     transforming seasonal resort towns that used to bustle for \n     just a few summer months into sprawling, year-round \n     communities that are starting to look and feel like, well, \n     everyplace else. Up and down the coast, development is \n     spreading for miles inland. New residents attract new \n     businesses to serve them, workers move in to fill the new \n     jobs that are created, and new housing, schools, malls and \n     hospitals spring up to serve the workers.\n       To a large extent, this migration is being fed by the \n     booming metropolitan centers along the East Coast: Boston, \n     New York, Washington, Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. Many \n     urban residents start out buying or renting a weekend home \n     along the coast and eventually move permanently.\n       To determine the extent of this boom at the beach, USA \n     TODAY examined development in the 100 counties along the \n     Atlantic and Gulf coasts that are magnets for new settlers. \n     The findings: This shoreline strip is growing significantly \n     faster than the rest of the country in population, employment \n     and gross domestic product (GDP). In many cases, these \n     counties have the fastest-growing economies in their states.\n       Since 1993, the population of these hot 100 counties has \n     grown nearly 50% faster than the entire USA. About 1,000 \n     year-round settlers are arriving each day. Jobs have been \n     created at a 30% greater clip, and GDP through 1997, the \n     latest year for country breakdowns, grew 20% faster. Gross \n     domestic product is the total value of goods and services \n     produced.\n       ``There's no question the growth along coastal areas is a \n     national phenomenon,'' says Dennis Gale, a professor or urban \n     and regional planning at Florida Atlantic University in Fort \n     Lauderdale. ``Harry and Jane Average are moving to the \n     coast.''\n       At least to the eastern and southern shorelines. The West \n     Coast has not experienced the same recent mass migration. Its \n     beaches and bluffs enjoy far stronger protection from \n     development. There are no barrier islands to tempt \n     development. And unlike the north-flowing Gulf Stream, which \n     tempers surf temperatures along the East Coast, the south-\n     flowing California Current chills even summer bathers.\n       The Atlantic Ocean's allure is hardly new. Americans have \n     been flocking there since at least 1802, when the \n     Philadelphia Aurora advertised beachfront tourist \n     accommodations along the beautiful Cape May, N.J., shore. \n     Back then few Americans had time for recreation. Most of the \n     population lived near the ocean because the great cities grew \n     up around shipping ports, the primary mode of commerce.\n       Then, as the USA entered the industrial age in the 19th \n     century, the population began stretching inland, where \n     factories needed raw materials and agricultural products to \n     process.\n       Now the emergence of the information economy, which has \n     spurred telecommuting, and the growing popularity of a \n     recreational lifestyle have sparked a mass yearning to return \n     to the coast.\n\n\n                       coastal counties exploding\n\n       How much is the boom at the beach transforming the \n     coastline?\n       In Maine, the top five counties in employment and GDP \n     growth are all along the coast. Their growth rates are double \n     the state average.\n       In Massachusetts, the four counties with the fastest job \n     creation include those covering Cape Cod, Nantucket Island \n     and Martha's Vineyard.\n       In South Carolina, five of the seven counties with the \n     fastest employment growth lie along the coast. Beaufort \n     County, which includes Hilton Head, tops the list with a 46% \n     increase in jobs since 1993, more than three times the state \n     average.\n       In Alabama, only two of the state's 67 counties touch the \n     coast. One of them, Baldwin County, which borders the Gulf \n     and Mobile Bay, led the state in GDP growth: 51% vs. a \n     statewide average of 24%.\n       ``It used to be that you moved to where the jobs are,'' \n     says Cleveland State's Hill. ``Now, people are deciding where \n     they want to live, and the jobs are following them.''\n       Just look at what's taking in Maine. ``Ten years ago, Knox \n     County had one traffic light and the main industry was \n     fishing,'' says Rutgers University political science \n     professor Ross Baker, 62, who owns a vacation home near \n     Rockland. ``Now you have a big bank-processing center here, \n     and downtown Rockland is filled with cappuccino bars and \n     bayberry candle stores.''\n       The same boom that is altering the rugged coast of Maine is \n     taking place 1,200 miles south near the lush greens of Hilton \n     Head, S.C. Along a 15-mile stretch of mainland, starting at \n     the bridge from Hilton Head Island, unspoiled Low Country \n     vistas have given way to mass development: golf-oriented \n     retirement communities, shopping malls, banks, office \n     buildings, new car showrooms, hospitals, even a new campus \n     for the University of South Carolina.\n       ``It just keeps growing and growing,'' says Carol Della \n     Vecchia, 58, formerly of Massapequa, N.Y., who moved to the \n     area in 1997 to escape the congestion of Long Island. ``But \n     in another five to 10 years, you're going to see another \n     Sunrise Highway all over again,'' she says, referring to the \n     commercial thoroughfare that runs through Long Island.\n       Urban planners say growth along the coast should be \n     propelled for another 10 to 20 years by demographic, economic \n     and social trends.\n       Foremost is the aging of the USA's 78 million baby boomers. \n     They are entering their pre-retirement years (the oldest are \n     54) and looking for more pleasant surroundings to spend their \n     post-working years. Developers in Hilton Head cite surveys \n     that show a majority of boomers want to retire within 50 \n     miles of the East or West coasts.\n       Millions of boomers, as well as people in their late 50s \n     and 60s, are expected to have the financial resources to \n     fulfill their retirement dreams. Barring a collapse on Wall \n     Street, the boomers' 401(k)s and individual retirement \n     accounts will keep growing. Plus, they will be on the \n     receiving end of an estimated $10 trillion to $20 trillion of \n     inherited wealth, the largest transfer of assets in history.\n\n\n                         seeking a better life\n\n       Thanks to the technological revolution, workers don't have \n     to wait until retirement to move to the coast; computers and \n     cell phones make it possible to do their jobs long-distance. \n     And for those who need to check in regularly at the office, \n     improved roads and the vast growth of regional airports and \n     commuter airlines put coastal destinations within a few hours \n     of most Eastern cities.\n       ``We're riding the crest of a new boomer craze,'' says \n     Michael Lawrence, president of Sea Pines, the largest private \n     development on Hilton Head. ``First it was Nike sneakers, \n     then oversized tennis rackets and BMWs. Now it's vacation and \n     retirement homes.''\n       The driving force behind this migration to the coast is the \n     quest for a better life: less congestion, crime and \n     pollution; better weather and scenery.\n       Until the 1990s, the destination of choice was Florida, \n     with its perpetually balmy, one-season climate. But now the \n     entire coast lures settlers. Up north, the shore in winter \n     has higher temperatures and less snowfall. Farther south, the \n     winters are moderate, and mild sea breezes offer relief from \n     stifling summer heat.\n       These migrants are coming predominantly from aging suburban \n     counties in the Northeast and Midwest that were hot \n     destinations 30 or 40 years ago.\n       Consider Horry County, S.C., which includes Myrtle Beach \n     and nearby towns known as the ``Grand Strand.'' IRS data show \n     that from 1997 to 1998, the county gained 2,000 households, \n     most from more than 100 counties in the Northeast and mid-\n     Atlantic.\n       Top feeder counties: suburban Washington's Fairfax, Va., \n     and Montgomery and Prince George's, Md. (119 households); \n     Long Island's Suffolk and Nassau (107); Allegheny, Pa., \n     including Pittsburgh (42); and Franklin, Ohio, including \n     Columbus (41). Other big sources: Syracuse, N.Y.; \n     Philadelphia; Hartford, Conn.; northern New Jersey; and \n     Hudson River valley; Cincinnati; Akron, Ohio; and Charleston, \n     W.Va.\n       The housing industry has been a chief beneficiary of this \n     coastal craze. The median household wealth of those living in \n     counties that abut the Atlantic and Gulf coasts is 26% higher \n     than the national median--$81,753 a year vs. $64,718. That \n     means more money to buy houses. Developers along the coast \n     say business is the best they have seen in over 30 years.\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\n       The fastest residential growth has been on barrier islands, \n     those exposed bands of sand that lie just offshore. In 1998, \n     more than 50,000 housing units were built on barrier islands \n     from Maine to Texas, double the construction rate of 1992.\n       High-end homes seem most in demand. David Wilgus, a real \n     estate agent in Bethany Beach, Del., says demand has never \n     been higher for homes in the $1 million to $2 million price \n     range, thanks to a tech boom in the nearby Washington area.\n       In Florida last year, during a six-hour ``sale'' of condo \n     units averaging $1 million at a Naples project, 99 people \n     plunked down $25,000 each for apartments that won't be built \n     until at least 2002. ``Staggering,'' says Michael Curtin, \n     vice president of WCI, the development company.\n       And in Folly Beach, S.C., where modest bungalows lined the \n     shore for decades, quarter-acre lots that sold for $50,000 \n     just 10 years ago now fetch as much as $500,000.\n       Less-expensive properties also are in great demand. Sam \n     Greenough, a contractor in North Carolina for 16 years, says \n     he's building $200,000 homes along the Outer Banks faster \n     than ever.\n       While the rush to the shore has been great for developers, \n     it has cost many coastal communities the quaint \n     characteristics that first attracted tourists.\n\n\n                         coping with a new cape\n\n       For decades, permanent Cape Cod residents have gathered on \n     highway overpasses to wave goodbye--and good riddance--to \n     hordes of summer visitors heading home in bumper-to-bumper \n     Labor Day traffic. But those ``bridge'' parties might have to \n     be scrapped because the tourists aren't leaving.\n       What was once a sparsely populated coastal retreat for 10 \n     months of the year has turned into a suburbanized extension \n     of metropolitan Boston.\n       ``It's like living anywhere else--but nicer,'' says Jacquie \n     Newson, 48, a radio station sales manager who has lived on \n     the Cape for 20 years.\n       In just the past five years, the year-round population has \n     increased 12% to 225,000. The Cape and the islands also have \n     eight of the state's 12 fastest-growing school districts. \n     Mashpee's enrollment has tripled the past 20 years.\n       Cape Code Hospital has 50% more doctors than in 1990, and \n     the Cape Cod Mall has just increased its retail space by 25%. \n     The number of radio stations on the Cape has risen from four \n     in 1985 to 13. There is a fledgling high-tech industry, with \n     hopeful talk of a ``Silicon Sandbar.'' There are even the \n     once unthinkable: wintertime traffic jams in Hyannis.\n       And with a third of the Cape's land still available for \n     development, the boom is unlikely to slow anytime soon.\n       The Cape's development is the result of a self-perpetuating \n     cycle: more people move to the area, so more businesses stay \n     open year-round, so more tourists visit all year, so new \n     businesses open, so more jobs are created, so more people \n     live there.\n       Each day, on average, six new homes are built on the Cape. \n     The number of residential building permits issued in 1998 was \n     more than 40% higher than two years earlier. Cozy two-bedroom \n     cottages by the water are being bought, torn down and \n     replaced by 5,000-square-foot mansions. In Truro, a quaint \n     outer-Cape town, the median sale price for an existing \n     single-family home last year was $310,000.\n       To keep up with the affluent newcomers, the Cape Code Mall \n     has brought in higher-end stores. Thirty years ago, almost \n     all the non-anchor stores were locally owned. Today, there is \n     only one, Holiday's Hallmark.\n       ``Last year, we opened 27 new, national brand-name \n     stores,'' says mall manager Leo Fein. ``The people who are \n     moving here have been exposed to upscale shopping in Boston, \n     and they want it here.'' Hence, Ann Taylor, J. Crew, \n     Abercrombie & Fitch.\n       Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis is changing its marketing \n     strategy as well, expanding cardiology and cancer services so \n     patients won't have to go back to Boston. Emergency \n     angioplasty is offered seven days a week, and the hospital it \n     trying to start an open-heart surgery program. ``In most of \n     the country's mind, Cape Cod is still beaches,'' says \n     hospital spokeswoman Deborah Doherty. ``But we've been named \n     one of the top 100 community hospitals in the country for the \n     last three years.''\n       Most people wouldn't think of the Cape as a tech hot spot, \n     either. Yet several thousand high-tech jobs have been created \n     in recent years, according to the Cape Cod Technology \n     Council, which has 300 member businesses.\n       One result of the boom on the beach is what everyone \n     described as the ``changing character'' of the Cape--the \n     fading of a quaint, picturesque backwater that was virtually \n     deserted most of the year. ``New people move in and want it \n     like it was back home,'' says Marilyn Fifield, a researcher \n     at the Cape Cod Commission. ``It's easy to wind up looking \n     like everyplace else.''\n       Provincetown, once the third-biggest whaling port in \n     America, has become ``one big condominium,'' grumbles George \n     Bryant, 62, a longtime resident. ``There are mornings when I \n     feel it's the worst thing ever.'' But Bryant also remembers \n     when there was never enough work to keep local people \n     employed all winter, and when men used to `'die like flies'' \n     whaling and deep-sea fishing.\n       Today, the biggest problem for natives isn't finding a job, \n     but finding affordable housing. Rents and home prices have \n     soared, and property-tax rates in some communities have \n     doubled because new residents have demanded schools and \n     services.\n       ``What good is prosperity if our kids can't afford to stay \n     here?'' asks Marilyn Salisbury of Bourne. Her three adult \n     children live and work on the mainland.\n       Clem Silva, 48, co-owner of Clem & Ursie's restaurant in \n     Provincetown, says there is almost no affordable housing for \n     restaurant workers. He and his sister/partner each have six \n     seasonal workers from Eastern Europe living in their homes. \n     They also have rented a third house for seasonal workers from \n     Jamaica. ``It's an amazing burden,'' he says. ``It really \n     takes the wind out of my sails.''\n       Another problem is water pollution. One cause is an \n     increase in incidents of well-water pollution from septic \n     tanks, which serve 86% of the Cape's homes. Higher levels of \n     contaminated water also are blamed on runoff from roads and \n     parking lots.\n       Some shellfishing areas have been restricted. The Mashpee \n     River, a tidal river, has gotten murkier and smellier because \n     of algae buildup caused by increased run-off from septic \n     systems. Shellfishing in Sulphur Springs, a bay in Chatham \n     off Nantucket Sound, has been restricted because of high \n     coliform counts.\n       The downside of development didn't deter Tom and Barbara \n     Joyce from moving to West Barnstable in June after raising \n     four children (the youngest is now 23) in a Boston suburb. \n     Tom, 65, is a recently retired vice president of a textbook \n     publisher, but Barbara still freelances in publishing and \n     wants to be able to go to the city if and when she needs to.\n       Their four-bedroom home is near a golf course and a \n     conservation area, it's an easy one-hour drive to Boston. \n     ``Cape Cod is a state of mind,'' Barbara says. ``When you're \n     here, you feel like you're on vacation, even if you're living \n     here.''\n       Nevertheless, the Joyces admit that life on the Cape has \n     changed from 30 years ago, when they recall having had \n     trouble finding a restaurant. This year, Barbara says, ``we \n     tried to go to dinner in Hyannis one Saturday night in \n     February and we couldn't even get in, it was so crowded.''\n       The truth is, Tom says, the Cape has become just another \n     suburb. ``The Cape is no longer the place to go for \n     isolation. There's no escape now. There's very little open \n     space that hasn't been developed or bought for development. I \n     guess we've added to that.''\n\n\n                        beaufort's growing pains\n\n       Beaufort County, S.C., is another microcosm of the benefits \n     and the detriments of explosive growth along the coast. \n     Though it's a long distance from Cape Cod in geography and \n     culture, the area has experienced many of the same problems \n     as coastal New England.\n       ``The growth has been astronomical,'' says Beaurfort County \n     Magistrate Charles ``Bubba'' Smith, 55. He says the county's \n     rapid expansion has meant higher wages and job opportunities \n     but also traffic jams, overcrowded schools, higher crime and \n     a shortage of affordable housing.\n       The county had been largely unaffected by the golf-oriented \n     vacation development that began 30 years ago on Hilton Head, \n     the county's southernmost tip. But the county hasn't been the \n     same since 1994, when Del Webb, which developed the Sun City \n     retirement communities in the Southwest, started its first \n     upscale project on the East Coast, 10 miles inland from the \n     Hilton Head Island bridge.\n       So far, Sun City has built 1,600 homes, and it is adding \n     500 more each year. When the mammoth, 5,600-acre project is \n     finished, Sun City will have 16,000 year-round residents.\n       Sun City has spawned other retirement communities, a half-\n     dozen shopping malls, a Super Wal-Mart, a Target, several \n     supermarkets, Lexus and Mercedes car dealerships, and other \n     retail establishments along U.S. Route 278. At the same time, \n     lawyers, accountants, financial planners and health care \n     providers are flocking to offer their services. Route 278, \n     once lined with Spanish oaks and lowland shrubs, is now \n     flanked by retail developments and professional office \n     buildings interspersed with occasional empty lots with signs \n     that read, ``Future home of . . .''\n       The area has attracted transplants from the East Coast, \n     Midwest and Southeast, including New York, New Jersey, \n     Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Georgia and Florida. And its \n     residences appeal to people across the economic spectrum. Sun \n     City homes start at $130,000, although the strongest demand \n     has been for the top-of-the-line models, which sell for \n     $750,000. As a result, the company is breaking ground on an \n     upscale section eight years earlier than planned.\n       Del Webb officials say every house type, even the least \n     expensive, includes a home office. Marketing studies have \n     found that most buyers are still working or intend to work \n     part-time during retirement.\n       Just down the road from Sun City, the exclusive Belfair \n     development is quickly selling out its 770 lots for up to $2 \n     million each. The corporate CEOs and other wealthy buyers \n     also shell out $900,000, on average, to build custom homes on \n     their lots.\n       Belfair's two championship-level golf courses are the \n     ostensible draw, but developer John Reed says the real \n     attraction is the sense of a small town that residents long \n     for. ``They're in their mid-50s and they've lived in four \n     different cities, on average,'' he says. ``They feel they \n     have no roots and are searching for the close-knit community \n     they remember from their youth. That's how they want to spend \n     their final years.''\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\n       The mass migration to the area has been great for \n     developers and other businesses, but it has put enormous \n     strains on the local government.\n       Since 1900, Beaufort County's population has grown 31%. \n     That's three times the national average. The county has had \n     to keep expanding its roads, and in just the past three \n     years, it has built 13 schools, making it one of the fastest-\n     growing school districts in the USA.\n       The boom has been especially traumatic for the little town \n     of Bluffton (population 800), which finds itself suddenly \n     surrounded by explosive growth.\n       Last year, the town had to hire its first full-time city \n     manager to deal with development issues. And the town has \n     annexed 30,000 acres over the past three years to exert more \n     control over land use. That has expanded the town's size from \n     1 square mile to 50.\n       This year, the town is asking residents for permission to \n     double its budget so it can add a planning department, \n     increase existing departments and augment its tiny police \n     force.\n       Although construction is bringing in new property tax \n     revenue, the town laments that it has lost revenue from \n     speeding tickets. Bluffton used to be a well-known speed \n     trap, but the traffic is so bad now, it's hard to exceed the \n     25 mph posted limit.\n       ``Bluffton has become the biggest little town in South \n     Carolina,'' says Town Councilman Hank Johnston, 58, who \n     claims that Johnny Mercer wrote the lyrics to Moon River \n     while sitting on Johnston's porch, which overlooks the May \n     River.\n       The town's transformation is upsetting to the locals, even \n     those who profit from all the tour buses that roar through \n     the town's historic center, disturbing the tranquility \n     Bluffton had known for 100 years.\n       ``People used to come Memorial Day and leave Labor Day. Now \n     they're here to stay,'' sighs Babby Guscio, owner of a \n     general store. ``It's sad. It's the end of an era. Our small \n     town is gone.''\n       As the economic transformation along the shore continues, \n     that refrain is being echoed up and down the coast. But \n     there's no indication that the mass exodus to the beach will \n     slow anytime soon. ``People are seeking out a different \n     lifestyle,'' says urban planner Hill of Cleveland State. \n     ``Quality of life matters.''\n       ``There's no stopping the trend,'' agrees Rutgers professor \n     Baker. ``It's like the primordial urge of sea turtles (to lay \n     their eggs in the exact same spot). The instinct to live near \n     the water is that strong.''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, I will try not to delay my good friend from \nKansas too long. I know he, like others, wishes to leave.\n  I speak only because I am disappointed the Senate has not yet passed \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 that is S. 2413. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee passed this bill unanimously on June 29. All \nMembers, Republicans and Democrats, voted for it. Since then, I have \nchecked with the Democratic caucus. All 45 Democratic Senators support \nthis bill. All 45 are perfectly agreeable to have it either come to an \nimmediate vote or passed by unanimous consent.\n  But it still has not passed the full Senate. This is very \ndisappointing to our nation's law enforcement officers who need life-\nsaving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. Protecting and \nsupporting our law enforcement community should not be a partisan \nissue.\n  Senator Campbell and I worked together closely and successfully with \nthe Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress to pass \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. Senator \nHatch is an original cosponsor this year's bill to reauthorize this \ngrant program. Senators Schumer, Kohl, Thurmond, Reed, Jeffords, Robb, \nReid, Sarbanes, our late colleague, Senator Coverdell, Bingaman, \nAshcroft, Edwards, Bunning, Cleland, Hutchison, and Abraham also \ncosponsored our bipartisan bill.\n  I mention this because I have been receiving calls from a number of \npeople in the law enforcement community asking why it has not passed. I \ndid not know the answer. As I said, I checked and found the 45 \nDemocratic Senators all said they had no objection to it being passed \nby voice vote today, yesterday, whenever--but we have been told a \nRepublican Senator has stopped this bill from passing. He has a hold on \nthe bill, a bill that is intended to provide protection to our Nation's \nlaw enforcement officers.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 \npercent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty \nsince 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. \nIndeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while \nnot wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it.\n  When we introduced the original Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nAct of 1998, President Clinton invited Senator Campbell and me down for \nthe signing of it. Shortly after it was passed into law, we funded \n92,000 new bulletproof vests for our Nation's police officers. You can \nnow make application on web sites. The whole thing has worked extremely \nwell.\n  To better protect our nation's law enforcement officers, Senator \nCampbell and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, \n1998 (Public Law 105-181).\n  The law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program \nwithin the Department of Justice to help state and local law \nenforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001.\n  In its first year of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program funded 92,000 new bulletproof vests for our nation's \npolice officers, including 361 vests for Vermont police officers. \nApplications are now available at the program's web site at http://\nvests.ojp.gov/ for this year's funds.\n  The entire process of submitting applications and obtaining federal \nfunds is completed through this web site.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the \nsuccess of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million \nfor fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by \nguaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive \nthe full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these \nsmaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests \neligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers in close \nquarters in local and county jails.\n  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the \ncountry face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during \nroutine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential \nthe we update this law so that many more of our officers who are \nrisking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 will provide state \nand local law enforcement agencies with more of the assistance they \nneed to protect their officers.\n  Our bipartisan legislation enjoys the endorsement of many law \nenforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and \nthe National Sheriffs' Association.\n  We need to recognize the hard work of those who have sworn to serve \nand protect us. And we should do what we can to protect them, when a \nneed like this one comes to our attention.\n  Our nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the \nline of duty every day. No one knows when danger will appear.\n  Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not \nnecessarily be ``routine.'' Each and every law enforcement officer \nacross the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest.\n  I hope this mysterious ``hold'' on the other side of the aisle will \nsoon disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, S. 2413, to ensure that each and \nevery law enforcement agency in Vermont and across the nation can \nafford basic protection for their officers.\n  I just want to speak a little bit personally about this. I spent the \nfirst 8 years of my public life in law enforcement. I have said many \ntimes on the floor of the Senate that it was in so many ways the most \nrewarding career I had. I got to know the men and women in law \nenforcement who are called upon to go out at 3 o'clock in\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\nthe afternoon or 3 o'clock in the morning and put their lives on the \nline for us.\n\n  I thought this legislation was something that would help. I have \nreceived hundreds of letters and e-mails from police officers across \nthe country who use the Campbell-Leahy law to get themselves \nbulletproof vests. I know Senator Campbell has, too. We joke about it, \nbut we call it the Campbell-Leahy, Colorado-Leahy, Campbell-Vermont \nlaw--police officers know what it is. It is the bulletproof vest law.\n  I was so glad to tell the leaders of law enforcement, the sheriffs, \nthe police officers, and others that we had put together, once again, a \nbipartisan coalition and were moving through the reauthorization in \nwhat has proven to be one of the most successful pieces of law \nenforcement legislation we have had.\n  That is why when they started calling me and asking, ``why hasn't it \npassed; if everybody supports it, why hasn't it passed,'' I had to tell \nthem an anonymous Republican Senator has stopped it from passing. \nWhoever that Senator might be has a right to object to it going forward \nunder our practices, if not under our rules.\n  I ask if that Senator might be willing to put first, and foremost, \nthe needs of our law enforcement officers. If they do not like the \nbill, then let's bring it to a rollcall vote and they can vote against \nit. I suspect it will be a 98-1 vote on this. I know every Democrat is \ngoing to vote for it because they have told me they will. Every single \nRepublican I have talked with said they will vote for it. I suspect the \nvast majority of the Senate will vote for it.\n  I call on that anonymous Senator to step forward and either allow us \nto pass it by a voice vote or let us bring it to a rollcall vote and \nvote it up or down. The President has assured me personally that he \nwill sign this bill. He has no hesitation signing it. He wants to sign \nit.\n  Senator Campbell and I will support it throughout the appropriations \nprocess to get the money. The most conservative, most liberal, and the \nmoderate Senators in this body have all supported it. Let's do the \nright thing. Let's tell the same police officers we ask to go out at 3 \no'clock in the morning to protect us that we will not do the closed-\ndoor withholding of the bulletproof vest legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7436-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7436-S7437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MINORITY JUDICIAL NOMINEES IN 106TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to see the Senate confirming \nJudge Johnnie Rawlinson to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals today. \nShe will be an outstanding member of that Circuit. I thank Senator Reid \nfor all of his hard work on this nomination. I also commend our \nDemocratic Leader for getting Judge Rawlinson and the other nominations \nreported yesterday confirmed by unanimous consent today. No one has \nworked harder than Senator Daschle to try to get the Senate to act on \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees and I thank him for his dedicated \nefforts.\n  On July 13, 2000, President Clinton spoke before the NAACP Convention \nin Baltimore and lamented the fact that the Senate has been slow to act \non his judicial nominees who are women and minorities. He said: ``The \nquality of justice suffers when highly-qualified women and minority \ncandidates, fully vetted, fully supported by the American Bar \nAssociation, are denied the opportunity to serve for partisan political \nreasons.'' He went on to say: ``The face of injustice is not \ncompassion; it is indifference, or worse. For the integrity of the \ncourts and the strength of our Constitution, I ask the Republicans to \ngive these people a vote. Vote them down if you don't want them on.'' I \nwholeheartedly agree with the President.\n  I was encouraged to hear Senator Lott recently and repeatedly say \nthat he continues to urge the Judiciary Committee to make progress on \njudicial nominations. The Majority Leader said: ``There are a number of \nnominations that have had hearings, nominations that are ready for a \nvote and other nominations that have been pending for quite some time \nand that should be considered.'' He went on to note that the groups of \njudges he expects us to report to the Senate will include ``not only \ndistrict judges but circuit judges.''\n  The United States Senate is the scene where some 50 years ago, in \nOctober 1949, the Senate confirmed President Truman's nomination of \nWilliam Henry Hastie to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the \nfirst Senate confirmation of an African American to our federal \ndistrict courts and courts of appeal. This Senate is also where some 30 \nyears ago the Senate confirmed President Johnson's nomination of \nThurgood Marshall to the United States Supreme Court.\n  And this is where last October, the Senate wrongfully rejected \nPresident Clinton's nomination of Justice Ronnie White. That vote made \nme doubt seriously whether this Senate, serving at the end of a half \ncentury of progress, would have voted to confirm Judge Hastie or \nJustice Marshall.\n  On October 5, 1999, the Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to \nreject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the federal court in \nMissouri--a nomination that had been waiting 27 months for a vote. For \nthe first time in almost 50 years a nominee to a federal district court \nwas defeated by the United States Senate. There was no Senate debate \nthat day on the nomination. There was no open discussion--just that \nwhich took place behind the closed doors of the Republican caucus lunch \nthat led to the party-line vote.\n  It is unfortunate that the Republican Senate has on a number of \noccasions delayed consideration of too many women and minority \nnominees. The treatment of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon are \nexamples from earlier this year. Both of these nominees were eventually \nconfirmed this past March by wide margins.\n\n  I have been calling for the Senate to work to ensure that all \nnominees are given fair treatment, including a fair vote for the many \nminority and women candidates who remain pending.\n  The bipartisan Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens for \nIndependent Courts has recommended that the Senate complete its \nconsideration of judicial nominations within 60 days.\n  Governor Bush of Texas recently also proposed that presidential \nnominations be acted upon by the Senate within 60 days.\n  Of the 34 judicial nominations currently pending, 26 have already \nbeen pending for more than 60 days without Senate action. Already this \nCongress 83 nominees, including 56 eventually confirmed, have had to \nwait longer than 60 days for Senate action. I urge the Senate to do \nbetter.\n  The Senate should be moving forward to consider the nominations of \nJudge James Wynn, Jr. and Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit. When \nconfirmed, Judge Wynn and Mr. Gregory will be the first African-\nAmericans to serve on the Fourth Circuit and will each fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy. Fifty years has passed since the confirmation of \nJudge Hastie to the Third Circuit and still there has never been an \nAfrican-American on the Fourth Circuit. The nomination of Judge James \nA. Beaty, Jr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in 1995. \nThat nomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nor the Senate and was returned to President Clinton without action at \nthe end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a qualified \nAfrican-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit. President Clinton spoke \npowerfully about these matters last week. We should respond not be \nmisunderstanding or mischaracterizing what he said, but by taking \naction on this well-qualified nominees.\n  In addition, the Senate should act favorably on the nominations of \nJudge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit, \nBonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, and Enrique Moreno to the Fifth \nCircuit. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the nomination of Jorge Rangel on \nwhich the Senate refused to act last Congress. These are well-qualified \nnominees who will add to the capabilities and diversity of those \ncourts. In fact, the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit declared that a \njudicial emergency exists on that court, caused by the number of \njudicial vacancies, the lack of Senate action on pending nominations, \nand the overwhelming workload.\n  I am sorely disappointed that the Committee has not reported the \nnomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit. She completed the\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\nnomination and hearing process two months ago and is strongly supported \nby Senator Grassley and Senator Harkin from her home state. She will \nmake an outstanding judge.\n  Filling these vacancies with qualified nominees is the concern of all \nAmericans. The Senate should treat minority and women and all nominees \nfairly and proceed to consider them.\n  To reiterate, I commend and congratulate Judge Johnnie Rawlinson from \nNevada who was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. She is \ngoing to do an outstanding job on that circuit. Senator Harry Reid of \nNevada, who worked so hard, deserves special mention as, of course, \ndoes Senator Dick Bryan for joining in support of her nomination.\n  I hope this is a mark that maybe we will do better in the Senate and \nstart moving judges, similar to what a Democratic-controlled Senate did \nin the last year of President George Bush's term in office when we \nmoved judicial nominations right through to practically the last day we \nwere in session.\n  There has been a lot of talk about what should be done or should not \nbe done, what is being held up or should not be held up. Whether it is \nan accident or otherwise, it is a fact that women and minorities take a \ndisproportionate amount of time to go through the system. That does not \nlook well for the Senate.\n  If I could make a recommendation, I would join an unusual ally in \nthat. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas Presidential nominations should be \nacted upon by the Senate within 60 days. He said:\n\n       The Constitution empowers the President to nominate \n     officers of the United States, with the advice and consent of \n     the Senate. That is clear-cut, straightforward language. It \n     does not empower anyone to turn the process into a protracted \n     ordeal of unreasonable delay and unrelenting investigation. \n     Yet somewhere along the way, that is what Senate \n     confirmations became --lengthy, partisan, and unpleasant. It \n     has done enough harm, injured too many good people, and it \n     must not happen again.\n\n  Governor Bush is right. President Clinton has said virtually the same \nthing. I have said the same thing. The fact is, if you do not want \nsomebody to be a judge, then vote them down, but do not do this limbo \nthing where sometimes they wait for years and years. Marsha Berzon \nwaited 2\\1/2\\ years just to get a vote. They were not going to vote on \nthis woman. When she finally came to a vote, she was confirmed \noverwhelmingly.\n  Richard Paez is a distinguished jurist, an outstanding Hispanic \nAmerican. He waited not 1 year, not 2 years, not 3 years, but he waited \n4 years for a vote, and then when his nomination was voted on, it was \noverwhelming.\n  Let us do better. Let's move on some of the names that are here, such \nas Kathleen McCree Lewis, Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, Enrique \nMoreno, and others who have been held up so long. Let's move on them. \nIt can be done.\n  Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Kansas for his \nforbearance. He has now done enough penance for 1 day.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7437-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7437-S7441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last evening, the Senate completed action on \nthe Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies. The bill was passed by a vote of 79 \nto 13. I commend Senator Cochran, Chairman of the Subcommittee, and \nSenator Kohl, the Ranking Member, for crafting this very important \nlegislation.\n  This bill includes many ongoing programs that are vital to the \nAmerican people. It also includes a number of items to deal directly \nwith problems that our farmers and rural residents are facing this year \nas they struggle to recover from natural disasters last year, and are \nnow faced with the reality of continuing drought.\n  Overall, in Division A, the bill provides a total of $75.6 billion in \nnon-emergency spending for fiscal year 2001. Of that amount, a little \nmore than $60 billion is for mandatory programs, such as Food Stamps \nand reimbursements to the Commodity Credit Corporation which funds a \nwide array of commodity, conservation, and international trade \nprograms. The balance of the non-emergency appropriations in this bill, \n$14.8 billion, is directed toward discretionary programs and represents \nan increase of nearly $900 million above last year's level. In addition \nto the $75.6 billion in Division A of the bill, Division B, as passed \nby the Senate, contains approximately $2.2 billion in emergency \nagricultural disaster assistance for the nation's farmers and rural \ncommunities. I will discuss these vital programs in more detail later \nin these remarks.\n  America's farmers have made this nation the breadbasket of the world. \nOur ability to produce plentiful safe, wholesome, and nutritious food \nis one of the basic foundations of economic and national security. The \nterm ``food security'' may be little more than a vague concept to most, \nunfortunately not all, Americans; but in much of the world, it is an \neveryday reminder of the struggle to survive. The prosperity and the \nfate of nations throughout the history of the world are closely tied to \ntheir agricultural production capabilities. When the fields of Carthage \nwere sown with salt by the legions of Rome, that once-great nation of \nnorthern Africa soon disappeared into the sands of the Sahara.\n  This appropriations bill includes many of the tools American farmers \nneed to sustain their historically high levels of production. Research, \nconservation, credit, and many more items important to agriculture \nreceive much-needed funding in this bill. Programs to promote exports \nof U.S. agricultural products throughout the world are included in this \nbill. American producers, and consumers alike, benefit from the work of \nthe Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and we should all join in \nsupporting their efforts.\n  Agriculture exists in every part of the nation, and every Senator \nknows the important contributions farmers make to his or her state. \nWhen one thinks of farming, instant images of broad, flat fields of \nwheat or corn, spreading from horizon to horizon, easily come to mind. \nVisions of combines combing the Great Plains and of massive grain \nelevators reaching to Midwestern skies are a solid part of our national \nconsciousness. But farming does not only exist in the flat plains of \nKansas or the rolling hills of Iowa or in many of the other states most \nfamiliar to Americans as ``Farm Country.'' Agriculture exists in the \ntropics of Hawaii and the bogs of Maine. Agriculture exists in the \norchards of the Pacific Northwest and in the groves of Florida. \nAgriculture even extends to the vegetable fields and reindeer herds of \nmy Chairman's state, Alaska.\n  West Virginia is not famous as an agricultural state, but West \nVirginia agriculture is changing to meet the new demands of consumers. \nThe future of agriculture includes diversification to meet the changing \ndemands of consumers at home and abroad. Farmers in West Virginia, \nthrough the help of the Appalachian Farming Systems Research Center at \nBeaver, West Virginia, and the National Center for Cool and Cold Water \nAquaculture at Leetown, West Virginia, are but two examples of the \ndiversification of agriculture in my state and I am glad this bill \nprovides increased funding for these two facilities.\n  In addition to the regular programs funded in this bill, I would also \nlike to mention a few of the items included to address special problems \nfarmers and rural residents have to face this year. Last year, Congress \nprovided more than $8 billion in emergency funding to help farmers and \nrural areas respond to adverse weather and depressed commodity prices. \nThis year, all indicators point to continuing drought conditions and \nprices for some commodities have fallen more than ever in history.\n  While it is important for Congress to respond to emergencies, it is \nequally, or perhaps more, important to prepare for them. Last year, \nmany livestock producers in West Virginia suffered horrible losses from \ndrought and, in many cases, had to liquidate their herds at depressed \nprices. Congress finally provided assistance to cover the\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\ncosts of feed, but in many cases the assistance was too little and, \nmore tragically, too late.\n  Accordingly, I met with USDA Secretary Dan Glickman this spring and \noutlined for him my plan to put in place a program that will help \nprevent a repeat of some of the losses suffered by West Virginia \nfarmers and farmers all across America last year. The Secretary agreed \nthat action now is proper to provide him the tools necessary to \nmitigate losses that are likely to occur this summer. While it is \nbeyond the power of the Congress to overcome the awesome powers of \nnature, it is within our power, and our responsibility, to provide \nassistance to the American people in the most effective manner \npossible. Where the likelihood of drought is certain, where acts of \nprevention are possible, there lies our responsibility and I want to \nthank my colleagues for supporting an amendment I offered to put these \npreventive tools in place.\n  Pursuant to my amendment, this bill provides $450 million for \nlivestock assistance this year in the event drought conditions continue \nto worsen. These funds will only be available in counties which receive \nan emergency designation by the President or the Secretary. In the \nevent no emergencies are designated, none of these funds will be spent. \nOn the other hand, the ounce of prevention we provide in this bill may \neasily outweigh the costs producers, and possibly taxpayers, will later \nrealize unless we act now to help mitigate losses that are likely to \noccur.\n\n  Drought conditions not only affect production agriculture, they drain \nwater resources necessary for basic community services in rural areas. \nCurrently, drought conditions in part of the nation are so severe that \nrural water systems are at risk from depleted supplies, wells will not \nfunction, and the increased demand for water have compounded this \nproblem to the point of crisis. I am pleased that my amendment also \nprovides $50 million for rural communities that are at-risk due to \nnatural emergencies or due to threats to public health or the \nenvironment. Similar to the livestock provision mentioned above, a \nportion of these funds would be limited to counties which have received \nan emergency designation by the President or the Secretary and for \napplications responding to the specific emergency.\n  In addition to addressing problems related to drought, my amendment, \nas contained in this bill includes a number of other provisions. \nIncluded is $443 million to help dairy farmers recover from the current \ncollapse in market prices. Also, $58 million is provided for \ncompensation to producers from losses due to pests and disease such as \nPlum Pox, the Mexican Fruit Fly, Pierce's Disease, and Citrus Canker.\n  During floor consideration of the bill, a manager's package of some \nfifteen amendments was adopted to provide additional emergency \nagricultural assistance to farmers across the nation. That package of \nmanager's amendments total approximately $1 billion, the largest \nportion of which, $450 million, will provide emergency assistance to \nproducers who have suffered losses from recent natural disasters. This \nassistance will help offset losses from the heavy rains that recently \naffected more than one million acres of farmland in North Dakota, as \nwell as losses in other parts of the country affected by drought. \nAdditionally, $175 million was included to assist apple producers who \nhave suffered from a combination of both market and quality losses; $40 \nmillion was provided to help compensate for losses due to citrus \ncanker; $70 million was provided to fund emergency watershed operations \nin a number of states; an additional $50 million was included for \ncommunity facility needs associated with losses from Hurricane Floyd \nand related storms; and the balance of items in this package will \nassist producers and rural communities across the nation in a variety \nof ways.\n  Overall, this bill strikes a good balance for providing funds to meet \nregular, ongoing needs and to prepare for problems that we are likely \nto experience later this year. I especially thank Senator Stevens and \nSenator Cochran, Chairmen of the Appropriations Committee and the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, respectively, and all members \nof the Appropriations Committee for their support of provisions which I \nauthored that will provide the Secretary of Agriculture the ability to \nmeet the developing drought conditions this summer. By meeting this \nchallenge head on, we will be helping producers avoid a repeat of some \nof the terrible losses incurred last year. I support this bill, and I \nurge all Senators to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     oyster industry in connecticut\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to describe a distressing \nsituation that 23 Connecticut oyster farmers found themselves in \nearlier this summer, and to offer my thanks to Mr. Cochran and Mr. Kohl \nfor helping Mr. Dodd and myself correct an injustice to these \nhardworking individuals. In early June, the United States Department of \nAgriculture (USDA) informed twenty-three Connecticut oyster farmers by \nletter that they must repay approximately $1.5 million total in federal \ndisaster aid payments that were granted due to a federal error. I am \npleased to say that Mr. Dodd's and my amendment to forgive that \nrepayment was included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill.\n  The oyster industry is important to Connecticut's economy--prior to \n1997, Connecticut's annual oyster crop was second only to Louisiana's. \nHowever, between 1997 and 1999, our oyster industry was devastated by a \ndisease known as MSX, resulting in massive losses. The market value \nplummeted from a 1995 high of $60 million to just $10 million.\n  In the face of this severe loss to the oyster industry, the \nConnecticut Farm Service Agency (FSA) approved and distributed modest \ndisaster payments to the oyster farmers in 1999. The payments were made \npursuant to the 1998 Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program (CLDAP), \nwhich is administered by the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance \nProgram (NAP). With this critically needed assistance, the oyster \nfarmers began to rebuild their livelihoods.\n  Earlier this year, long after the funds had been invested and for \npurely technical reasons, USDA determined that the payments were made \nin error because most Connecticut oyster farmers grow their oysters in \nopen beds rather than controlled environments. On June 2, 2000, USDA \nsent each of the 23 farmers a letter stating that they must repay the \ndisaster assistance that they received the previous year. The oyster \nfarmers were understandably frustrated and distressed by the message. I \nnote, Mr. President, that only a small portion of oyster farming \nnationwide is done within controlled environments, and that production \nin a controlled environment was not a prerequisite for disaster \nassistance following damage to Florida and Louisiana oyster farms by \nHurricane Andrew.\n  USDA has acknowledged that it bears responsibility for the error in \ndisaster aid payments. However, USDA strongly believes that it would \nhave ``no legislative authority to waive ineligible disaster aid \npayments'' without specific Congressional direction. Consequently, the \nConnecticut delegation has worked closely with USDA legal counsel to \ndraft legislation exempting the oyster farmers from repaying the \nineligible disaster aid. Earlier this month, the House of \nRepresentatives included such an amendment in the House Agriculture \nAppropriations bill; the Congressional Budget Office scored the \namendment as neutral.\n  Today, I am pleased that the Senate has also recognized the injustice \nof holding hardworking oyster farmers responsible for federal error by \nincluding an amendment to forgive these payments in the Senate \nAgriculture Appropriations bill. Again, I thank Mr. Cochran and Mr. \nKohl and their staffs for assisting Mr. Dodd, myself, and especially \nthe Connecticut oyster farmers in correcting an unfortunate situation.\n\n\n                          disaster assistance\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to today offer my support and \ncosponsorship of the Dorgan amendment providing additional disaster \nassistance to producers hit hard by floods, drought, and other severe \nstorms that have resulted in crop destruction and disease. In \nMinnesota, floods in the northwest and southern portions of the state \nhave devastated many farmers causing some crops to rot in the field.\n  This is yet another hit for the struggling Minnesota farm economy. \nPortions of my state have faced heavy\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\nrains and flooding for several years now, and things aren't getting any \neasier for these hardworking farmers also hit with low prices. In \nnorthwest Minnesota, FSA estimates that nearly 50 percent of the \nacreage has been affected by floods. In nine counties in Minnesota, \nthere have been nearly 1.2 million acres affected. In Mahnomen county, \n100 percent of the acreage has been impacted by floods.\n  FEMA funding and disaster assistance under the Small Business \nAdministration and other programs do not provide these farmers the help \nthey need. If we are willing to help farmers who are suffering from \nfalling prices, as we have already done this year through supplemental \nspending, we should also come to the aid of those suffering from \nnatural disaster, as we do on a routine basis each year as we \nexperience such disasters.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \namendment.\n\n\n               emergency meth lab cleanup funds amendment\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to thank the managers of the FY \n2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill for their cooperation in including \nthe amendment for emergency methamphetamine lab cleanup funds that \nSenator Hutchinson and I had offered as part of the bill's FY 2000 \nsupplemental package.\n  This amendment, also cosponsored by Senator Bingaman, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Nickles and Senator Thomas--provides $5 million in \nemergency lab cleanup funds for state and local law enforcement.\n  A similar provision I had offered was included in the emergency \npackage from June but it was dropped before it was attached to the \nMilitary Construction Appropriations conference, which gained final \npassage with a voice vote. There was strong support for this provision \nfrom both Democrats and Republicans. And it was included in both the \nHouse and Senate supplemental packages.\n  So, it didn't make sense why it was suddenly dropped--especially when \nwe're talking about dangerous chemical sites that are left exposed in \nour local communities.\n  Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas and I last week sent a letter to the \nAppropriations leadership that was signed by 30 Senators, calling for \nthis emergency funding. Our states desperately need this money or they \nwill be forced to take money out of their own tight law enforcement \nbudgets to cover the high cost of meth lab cleanup.\n  Over the years, Iowa and many states in the Midwest, West and \nSouthwest have been working hard to reduce the supply and demand of the \nmethamphetamine epidemic. But meth has brought another unique problem \nto our states-- highly toxic labs that are often abandoned and exposed \nto our communities.\n  The Drug Enforcement Agency has provided in recent years critical \nfinancial assistance to help clean up these dangerous sites, which can \ncost thousands of dollars each.\n  Unfortunately and to everyone's surprise, the DEA in March ran out of \nfunds to provide methamphetamine lab cleanup assistance to state and \nlocal law enforcement. That's because last year, this funding was cut \nin half while the number of meth labs found and confiscated has been \ngrowing.\n  Last month, the Administration shifted $5 million in funds from other \nDepartment of Justice Accounts to pay for emergency meth lab cleanup. \nAnd I believe that will help reimburse these states for the costs they \nhave incurred since the DEA ran out of money. My state of Iowa has \nalready paid some $400,000 out of its own pocket in cleanup costs since \nMarch.\n  But, this is not enough to get our states through the rest of the \nfiscal year.\n  This $5 million provision will ensure that there will be enough money \nto pay for costly meth lab clean-up without forcing states to take \nmoney out of their other tight law enforcement budgets to cover these \nunexpected costs.\n  If we can find the money to fight drugs in Colombia, we should be \nable to find the money to fight drugs in our own backyard. We cannot \nrisk exposing these dangerous meth labs to our communities.\n  Again, I appreciate the managers of this bill, Senator Cochran and \nSenator Kohl for their cooperation on this important provision and I \nlook forward to working with them to making sure it is maintained in \nconference.\n\n\n                       emergency sugarcane relief\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude to \nChairman Thad Cochran, Ranking Member Herb Kohl, and Minority Whip \nHarry Reid for their efforts yesterday in passing Amendment 3976 to \nH.R. 4461, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year \n2001. This amendment, which was offered by my colleague, the Senior \nSenator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, and myself will provide emergency \nrelief to the Hawaii sugarcane industry.\n  Since 1990, the Hawaii sugarcane industry has experienced a dramatic \ndecline in its sugar production, from 55 sugarcane farms operating on \napproximately 162,000 acres to three sugarcane farms operating on \n60,000 acres.\n  Compared to other sugarcane growers in the United States, Hawaii \ngrowers are at a disadvantage due to higher transportation costs \nincurred in shipping raw sugar to California for refining. In addition, \nHawaii growers are precluded from participating in certain relief \nprovisions of the 1996 Farm bill, such as the United States Department \nof Agriculture's sugar loan program, which are available to other U.S. \nsugar growers. Hawaii sugar growers have demonstrated a strong \ncommitment to remain in sugar production.\n  They continue to be on the forefront of sugarcane production and are \nworking to diversify its capabilities by venturing into other \nagricultural commodities such as fiberboard products, energy products, \nseed corn, and low caloric sweeteners. Without emergency funds to help \nHawaii's sugar industry compensate for extraordinary low prices and \nhigh transportation costs, this distressed sector of Hawaii's \nagricultural industry will cease to exist.\n  This amendment will designate $7.2 million as emergency funding for a \ngrant from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the State of Hawaii. It \nwill provide the necessary relief to this distressed sector of Hawaii's \nagriculture industry. This provision will provide compensation for \nextraordinary low prices and high transportation costs incurred by this \nindustry.\n  Again, I wish to thank my colleagues for their support of this \nimportant amendment.\n\n\n    bison meat and more nutritious indian reservation food supplies\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, last night the Senate passed the Fiscal \nYear 2001 appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nand Related Agencies with my support. Today I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank the Manager of the bill, Senator Cochran, for his \nwillingness to accept my amendment to require that funds available in \nthe Food Stamp Program be used for the purchase of bison meat for use \nin the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). This \namendment was cosponsored by Senators Dorgan, Conrad and Domenici.\n  The buffalo has always played an important role in Native American \nculture, religion and history, providing Indian people with clothing, \ntools, and food. Bison meat is extremely healthy, low fat, and high \nprotein meat source that in the past was a staple of nutrition for \nIndian people. However, when our own government decided it was best for \ntribes to be placed on reservations, often far away from their \ntraditional lands, tribes lost this nutritious food source and from \nthis, we are seeing some severe and devastating effects on the health \nof our Native communities.\n  Today, Native Americans suffer from diabetes and heart disease at \nfive times the rate of any other group in the United States. Diabetes \nis a killer and the cure for it is elusive. One of the things we can do \nis to encourage a better diet for Native people. This is awfully hard \nto do when the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations is the \nmain source of food for nearly 125,000 Native Americans and most of the \nmeat that they do receive is canned and high in fat and sodium.\n  Two years ago USDA purchase $2 million in bison, and then another $6 \nmillion in 1999 through a bonus buy purchase and had enormous success\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nwith it. My office has received numerous requests from Tribal Food \nDistribution Program Directors, tribal recipients and buffalo producers \nto help secure additional of bison. I sent a letter to Secretary \nGlickman requesting such purchases and his response is not encouraging.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I offered will direct USDA to use $7.3 \nmillion of the Food Stamp Program to purchase bison meat.\n  The Food Stamp Program, funded at around $21 billion, is expected to \nhave a substantial surplus from lower participation given our healthy \neconomy and low unemployment rate. It only seems reasonable that we \ncould use a very small portion of those funds to help provide a \nhealthier and culturally preferred choice of food for Native Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          explanation on votes\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I regret that I was ill and unable to \nvote on the Senate floor yesterday during consideration of H.R. 4461, \nthe FY01 Agriculture Appropriations Act.\n  Had I been here yesterday, I would have voted in the following \nmanner.\n  On Rollcall Vote Number 218, the Harkin Amendment, I would have vote \n``Aye'' on the motion to table.\n  On Rollcall Vote Number 219, the McCain Amendment, I would have vote \n``Aye'' on the motion to table.\n  On Rollcall Vote Number 220, the Wellstone Amendment, I would have \nvote ``Aye'' on the motion to table.\n  On Rollcall Vote Number 221, the Harkin Amendment, I would have vote \n``No'' on the amendment.\n  On Rollcall Vote Number 222, the Wellstone Amendment, I would have \nvote ``Aye'' on the amendment.\n  On Rollcall Vote Number 223, the Specter Amendment, I would have vote \n``No'' on the amendment.\n  On Rollcall Vote Number 224, on the question of germaneness of the \nAmendment, Number 3980, I would have voted ``no''.\n  On Rollcall Vote Number 225, final passage of the H.R. 4461, the FY01 \nAgriculture Appropriations Act, I would have voted ``Aye''.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                telework\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nis designed to make information technology--IT--jobs a part of diverse, \nsustainable rural economies while helping IT employers find skilled \nworkers. The goal of this bill is to link unemployed and underemployed \nindividuals in rural areas and on Indian reservations with jobs in the \nIT industry through telework.\n  We are in the midst of an information revolution which has the \npotential to be every bit as significant to our society and economy as \nthe industrial revolution two hundred years ago. But in recent months \nthere has been much discussion of the ``digital divide,'' the idea that \none America is not able to take advantage of the promise of new \ntechnologies to change the way we learn, live, and work while the other \nAmerica speeds forward into the 21st Century. As advanced \ntelecommunications and information technology become the new engines of \nour economy, it is critical that no communities are left behind.\n  Many rural communities and Indian reservations are already facing \nsevere unemployment, underemployment, and population loss due to a lack \nof economic opportunities. A study last year by the Center for Rural \nAffairs reports that widespread poverty exists in agriculturally based \ncounties in a six-state region including Minnesota. Over one-third of \nhouseholds in farm counties have annual income less than $15,000 and, \nin every year from 1988 to 1997, earnings in farm counties \nsignificantly trailed other counties. Unemployment on many Indian \nreservations exceeds 50 percent and remote locations make traditional \nindustries uncertain agents for economic development.\n  There are troubles ahead for the new economy as well: the information \ntechnology industry reports that it faces a dramatic shortage of \nskilled workers. The Minnesota Department of Economic Security projects \nthat over the next decade, almost 8,800 workers will be needed each \nyear to fill position openings in specific IT occupations. \nApproximately 1,000 students graduate each year from IT-related post-\nsecondary programs in Minnesota, not anywhere near enough to fill the \ndemand, according to this same state agency. This shortage is reflected \nnation wide, with industry projecting shortfalls of several hundred of \nthousand IT workers per year in coming years.\n  Rural workers need jobs. High tech employers need workers. This \nlegislation would create models of how to bring these communities \ntogether to find a common solution to these separate challenges.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. It would simply add $3 million \nto the very popular and successful Distance Learning and Telemedicine \nProgram operated by USDA's Rural Utility Service for the purpose of \npromoting employment of rural residents through telework.\n  Mr. President, telework is a new term that may be unfamiliar to \ncolleagues so I want to take a moment to explain what it is. According \nto the International Telework Association and Council, telework is \ndefined as using information and communications technologies to perform \nwork away from the traditional work site typically used by the \nemployer. For example, a person who works at home and transmits his or \nher work product back to the office via a modem is a teleworker, also \nknown as a telecommuter; as is someone who works from a telework \ncenter, which is a place where many teleworkers work from--often for \ndifferent companies.\n  The nature of IT jobs allow them to be performed away from a \ntraditional work site. As long as workers have the required training, \nand a means of performing work activities over a distance--through the \nuse of advanced telecommunications--there is no reason that skilled IT \njobs cannot be filled from rural communities.\n\n  Because it essentially allows distance to be erased, telework is a \npromising tool for rural development and for making rural and \nreservation economies sustainable. Very soon, a firm located in another \ncity, another state or even another country need not be viewed as a \ndistant opportunity for rural residents, but as a potential employer \nonly as far away as a home computer or telework center. Likewise, \ntelework arrangements allow employers to draw from a national labor \npool without the hassles and cost associated with relocation.\n  Many businesses and organizations are already using telework or \ntelecommuting as a tool to reduce travel and commuting times and to \naccommodate the needs and schedules of employees. Many metropolitan \ncommunities with high concentrations of IT industries are already \nlooking to telework as a means of addressing urban and suburban ills \nsuch as housing shortages, traffic congestion, and pollution.\n  However, the IT industry does not currently view rural America as a \npotential source of skilled employees. Nor do many rural communities \nknow how to turn IT industries into a viable source of good jobs to \nrevitalize local economies. Moreover, many rural community leaders fear \nthat providing IT job skills to rural residents--when there are no \nopportunities for using those skills in the community--will lead to \nfurther population losses as retrained workers seek opportunities in \nmetropolitan areas. At the same time, management of off-site employees \nrequires new practices to be developed by employers and in some cases, \ndramatic paradigm shifts. Rural areas and Indian reservations are in \ndanger of being left behind by a revolution which actually holds the \nmost promise for those communities which are the most distant. IT \nemployers risk missing a pool of potential employees with a strong work \nethic.\n  Receiving one of the teleworking grants provided for by my amendment \nwill give rural communities access to federal resources to implement a \nlocally designed proposal to employ rural residents in IT jobs through \ntelework relationships, linking prospective employers with rural \nresidents. This amendment will allow these communities to create \nlocally developed and implemented national models for how telework can \nbe used as a tool for rural development.\n  The necessary vision to of how to make telework a reality already \nexists in some employers and in some rural communities. In Sebeka, \nMinnesota--a town with a population of little more\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nthan 600 people--a small firm called Cross Consulting was founded. That \ncompany employs over 20 people through a contract with Northwest \nAirlines to provide programming on Northwest's mainframe computers. \nThese people are rural teleworkers. The new economy is not leaving \nSebeka behind and we need to incubate that kind of innovation in rural \nareas and Indian reservations across this country.\n  On April 13 along with Senators Baucus and Daschle I introduced the \nRural Telework Act of 2000. That legislation is a more comprehensive \nmeans to the same ends as this amendment I am offering today. I mention \nthis legislation because it is broadly supported by private industry, \nrural communities, educational institutions and tribal governments.\n  For many jobs, in many industries, telework may be the future of \nwork. It may also be the future of diverse, sustainable rural \neconomies. This amendment offers an early opportunity to invest in \nlocal innovation to harness this potential and I urge its adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7441-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RESALE OF ARMOR PIERCING BULLETS TO CIVILIANS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the Department \nof Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 which included an \namendment I sponsored to outlaw the resale of military surplus armor \npiercing ammunition, including .50 caliber ammunition, to civilians.\n  This amendment requires the Department of Defense to ensure that \nmilitary surplus armor-piercing ammunition is not sold or transferred \nto anyone except foreign militaries or law enforcement or other \ngovernment agencies. Armor piercing ammunition is extremely lethal and \nis powerful enough to pierce an armored limousine or helicopter. It has \nno legitimate civilian use.\n  Last year, Congress approved legislation which instituted a one-year \nrestriction on the civilian sale of military surplus armor piercing \nammunition; the amendment approved by the Senate last week would put \nthat temporary restriction into permanent law. Before the one-year \nrestriction was enacted, under the Conventional Demilitarization \nProgram, a contractor working with the Department of Defense was paid \n$1 per ton to take possession of its excess armor-piercing ammunition, \nwhich it was free to refurbish and resell to the general public.\n  The Department of Defense should not be a party to making this \nextraordinarily destructive ammunition available to the general public. \nOnce available on the market, this powerful ammunition is subject to \nvirtually no restriction, making it easier for someone to purchase \narmor piercing ammunition capable of piercing an armored car, than it \nis to buy a handgun. These loose restrictions make armor piercing \nammunition highly popular among terrorists, drug traffickers and \nviolent criminals.\n  An investigation by the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that \narmor piercing .50 caliber ammunition is ``among the most destructive \nand powerful ammunition available in the United States'' and the \n``widespread availability'' of the bullets ``poses a threat to public \nsafety.'' In the year ending in March, 1999, more than 113,000 rounds \nof military surplus armor piercing .50 caliber ammunition were sold in \nthe United States.\n  The amendment to prohibit the resale of military surplus armor \npiercing ammunition is a small but important step in keeping our \nstreets safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7441-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7441-S7443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COUNTERING THE THREAT TO MONTENEGRO\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the threat to \nMontenegro, the sole remaining free part of the Yugoslav federation.\n  In the decade of the 1990s, there were four mornings on which my \ncolleagues and I awoke to a recurring headline: new war in the former \nYugoslavia, started by Slobodan Milosevic.\n  First, in Slovenia. Next, in Croatia. Then, in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. Finally, in Kosovo.\n  I do not want to ever read that headline again. I never want to read \nthe headline that says: Milosevic starts new war in Montenegro.\n  So let's say it loud and clear: hands off Montenegro, Mr. Milosevic!\n  What is going on today in the so-called Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, specifically, in the relationship between Serbia and \nMontenegro?\n  Why is it important for us to pay attention?\n  And what should be our stance toward developments there?\n  These are the questions I aim to answer in my remarks today.\n  Most of my colleagues are aware that ``Yugoslavia'' is an invented \nterm. It was not the name with which that nation was born after the \nFirst World War. Rather, the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes \nofficially changed its name in 1929 to the ``Kingdom of Yugoslavia,'' \nmeaning the kingdom of the South Slavs.\n  That was the first Yugoslavia, the one which perished in the course \nof the Second World War. Out of the ashes of World War II, the second \nYugoslavia arose. That was Tito's Yugoslavia. Tito had been dead for a \nless than a decade when his Yugoslavia began to unravel at the start of \nthe 1990s. And now, today, all that remains of Yugoslavia is an \nincreasingly quarrelsome couple: Serbia and Montenegro.\n  Once Yugoslavia was a state of 20 million inhabitants, with five \nconstituent republics plus two semi-autonomous provinces. And today? \nSlovenia, gone. Croatia, gone. Bosnia and Herzegovina, gone. Macedonia, \ngone. Kosovo, for all intents and purposes, gone.\n  The two republics of Serbia and Montenegro are what is left of \nYugoslavia, Mr. President. And the undeniable fact is that many people \nin Montenegro want no more to do with that Yugoslav federation with \nSerbia as it is today.\n  Will Montenegro someday split off to become an independent nation-\nstate, like Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina? \nMaybe.\n  Will Montenegro someday become a partner with Serbia in a revitalized \nand restructured Yugoslavia? Maybe.\n  Will Montenegro wind up as a Serbian puppet-state, ruled from \nBelgrade by the likes of Slobodan Milosevic or some other Serbian \nauthoritarian jingoist? Not if I have anything to say about it, and I \nhope my colleagues and the U.S. Government agree with me.\n  We simply must not take our eye off the ball, Mr. President. There is \nstill a very serious risk that Milosevic will undermine and then \noverthrow the elected government of the Republic of Montenegro.\n  What would be the result of such a development? At a minimum--\nMontenegrins executed or thrown in jail, others forced to flee abroad \nas refugees, Milosevic in charge of new borders with Croatia, Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, Albania, and Kosovo. At a maximum--war with a capital \n``W'', in the Balkans, once again.\n  What is the seriousness of the threat today to Montenegro?\n  Earlier this month Milosevic made his latest move from Belgrade. He \ngot the obedient legislature to approve changes to Yugoslavia's \nconstitution.\n  The first major change was that henceforth the President of \nYugoslavia will be directly elected. Guess who gets to run? Yes, \nMilosevic himself--who otherwise would have been obliged by the \nconstitution to step down next year at his term's end. This means that \nMr. Milosevic has, in effect, extended his legal ``shelf-life'' by as \nmany as eight years.\n  The second major constitutional change was that the upper house of \nYugoslavia's parliament henceforth will be elected proportionally. Mr. \nPresident, that's easy for us to understand. It means that, by \ncomparison, in this Chamber, there would be a heck of a lot more \nSenators from California than from Delaware. In the case of Yugoslavia, \nit isn't hard to figure out the significance: Montenegro has 650,000 \ninhabitants; Serbia has 10 million.\n  This constitutional re-jiggering has fooled absolutely no one.\n  That it was immediately condemned, on July 8, both by Montenegrin \nPresident Milo Djukanovic and by the legislature of the Republic of \nMontenegro. The vote in the Montenegrin legislature was 36 to 18 in \nfavor of a vigorous condemnation of the constitutional changes as \n``illegal and illegitimate.''\n  The changes have also been condemned by the political opposition \nwithin Serbia.\n  The changes have even been condemned by the Russians, who joined in\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\nthe recent G-8 communique statement condemning Milosevic's \nconstitutional fiddling.\n  Milosevic and his cronies are clearly trying to topple the \ndemocratically elected government of President Djukanovic. These \nconstitutional changes are but the latest gambit.\n  In contrast with Milosevic's hopelessly inept long-term strategies, \nmost of his tactics are clever. If these constitutional changes were \nultimately to be accepted by, or forced upon, the Montenegrins, they \nwould facilitate his control of Montenegro through peaceful means. \nGiven, however, that the Montenegrins have rejected the changes, Mr. \nMilosevic now can claim, spuriously, that the Montenegrins are acting \n``unconstitutionally'' or ``illegally'' and that, therefore, Belgrade \nhas some right to ``intervene.''\n  Mr. Milosevic also is trying to provoke the Montenegrin authorities \ninto reacting out of anger and national pride, and going ahead with a \nreferendum on independence.\n  Thankfully, the Montenegrin Government, including both President \nDjukanovic and the legislature, have not fallen for Milosevic's trap. \nOn July 8, the same day that it so roundly condemned Milosevic's \nconstitutional shenanigans, the Montenegrin legislature specifically \nrejected a proposal calling for an immediate referendum on \nindependence.\n  The support for independence in Montenegro is not--at least not yet--\nsufficiently strong to justify holding a referendum. Look again at that \nvote--36 to 18. There clearly are pro-Milosevic politicians in \nMontenegro. Many Montenegrins, especially from the northern part of the \ncountry, either consider themselves Serbs or at least profess greater \nallegiance to Serbia and/or a Yugoslavia which Serbia dominates than to \nMontenegro.\n  Aside from ethnic self-identification, there are many Montenegrins \nwho are not convinced that independence is a better outcome for such a \nsmall country than a democratically reformed federation with Serbia \nwould be. For example, in recent municipal elections in Montenegro, the \ncapital, Podgorica, went for Djukanovic, while another city, Herceg \nNovi, went for the pro-Serbian party.\n  The risk of holding a referendum on Montenegro's independence, in \nsuch a context, would be that the balloting might easily be followed by \ncivil unrest and skirmishes--provoked by Milosevic's henchmen or \nspontaneous--which would be all the provocation that Milosevic would \nneed in order to seize power in the name of preserving law and order \nthrough some combination of paramilitaries and Yugoslav Army units \nalready stationed in Montenegro.\n  In fact, Reuters reported that the Yugoslav Army was poised to \nimplement just such a plan if the Montenegrin legislature had reacted \nmore radically to the changes in the Yugoslav constitution. Our State \nDepartment does not discount these reports as idle speculation.\n  What is our policy in response to Milosevic's constant provocations \nand threats against Montenegro? What have we been doing, what are we \ndoing, what more can we do?\n  First of all, we are providing economic assistance to the Government \nof Montenegro.\n  In Fiscal Year 2000, we have already allocated $60.56 million. \nSecretary of State Albright announced on July 13 that the \nAdministration plans to notify the Congress of its intention to \nreprogram an additional $16.5 million for democratization and economic \nreform in Montenegro.\n  Why does Montenegro need this money?\n  Much of it is for budget-support. As a key part of Milosevic's effort \nat destabilization, he has squeezed Montenegro's economy very hard \nthrough a series of measures.\n  He has had Yugoslavia's central bank print extra money, against the \nwishes of the Montenegrin representatives to the bank, and then spent \nit in Montenegro to cause inflation there.\n  Yugoslavia has refused to grant import and export licenses to \nMontenegrin companies.\n  Serbia has taken virtually all of the revenue from Yugoslavia's \ncustoms collections, leaving none of it for Montenegro.\n  Yugoslavia has stopped payment to Montenegrin pensioners from the \nfederal pension fund.\n  Yugoslavia has denied overflight clearances for aircraft that would \ntransport foreign tourists to Montenegro.\n  And, most significant, Belgrade has cut off Montenegrin purchasers \nfrom food and medicine produced in Serbia, the market which previously \nhad provided 75 percent of Montenegro's purchases of such commodities. \nThink about this--the Milosevic regime, which complains about sanctions \ntargeted at specific individuals and enterprises in Serbia, has placed \nsanctions on its ``brother'' republic of Montenegro. These are \nsanctions that hurt all Montenegrins.\n  It is in large part to combat this kind of economic sabotage that we \nare providing so much assistance to Montenegro.\n  That is merely the economic kind of sabotage.\n  As I just mentioned, the Milosevic regime has been preparing the \nYugoslav Army to be able to move against the Djukanovic government. For \nseveral years, Milosevic has been sending special troops to join \nYugoslav Army units in Montenegro, as well as commanders who would not \nhesitate to obey orders to attack their Montenegrin ``brethren.''\n  Ready to defend the legally elected government are the relatively \nwell-armed police force and Interior Ministry troops of the Republic of \nMontenegro.\n  There have been stand-offs and provocations at border crossings, at \nPodgorica airport, and elsewhere.\n  So far cooler heads have prevailed, but no one should doubt that \nMilosevic has a plan to depose Djukanovic, the most prominent remaining \ndemocrat in Yugoslavia. Milosevic will undoubtedly wait for another \ntarget of opportunity. I have no inside line to Belgrade, but my guess \nis that he may act when we are preoccupied with the U.S. election \ncampaign this fall and when he hopes that partisan political interest \nmay make reaction to foreign aggression more difficult. More about that \nlater.\n  In any event, it is abundantly clear that Montenegro urgently needs \nour assistance because it is threatened by the Serbia of Milosevic, \nthrough economic pressure and military intimidation.\n  Why, however, does Montenegro deserve our assistance?\n  The answer is simple. Because Montenegro, and President Djukanovic's \ngovernment, want to do the right thing.\n  President Djukanovic, though still a young man, has traveled a long \nroad. He has gone from being a Yugoslav Communist committed to the \npreservation of the status quo to being a Western-oriented democrat.\n  I have met with President Djukanovic on several occasions.\n  He is a realist. He knows that the only option for Montenegro is the \nWestern model. That means market economy. That means fair elections and \nmulti-ethnic inclusive politics. That means engagement with the outside \nworld rather than sullen, sulking self-pity.\n  From the beginning, his government has been a coalition of \nMontenegrins, Slavic Muslims, and ethnic Albanians,\n  During the air campaign in Kosovo, President Djukanovic permitted \nrefugees to enter Montenegro from Kosovo, and from Serbia as well. In \nfact, some members of the Serbian opposition were safer during that war \nin Montenegro than in Serbia.\n  Even while Yugoslav Army targets were being bombed in Montenegro, \nPresident Djukanovic kept his cool. He understood that what NATO was \ndoing had to be done.\n  Recently, President Djukanovic did something that I think is \nextraordinary, and ought to be better known.\n  Earlier this summer, he offered an apology. Specifically, on behalf \nof Montenegro, he said to the Croatian people: I'm sorry for the role \nthat some Montenegrins played in the infamous shelling of Dubrovnik \nback in 1991.\n  What is going on here? A Balkan leader actually apologizing for \nethnic-cleansing and war-crimes?\n  The fact that President Djukanovic made that statement, and that it \nwas accepted as an apology by President Mesic and the Government of \nCroatia, is highly significant.\n  That kind of statement and reaction represent the only way out of the \nmorass of ethnic hatred that caused, and\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\ncould still cause, death and destruction in the former Yugoslavia.\n  In terms of economic reform, the government of President Djukanovic \nhas said that it would like to begin a major privatization of state \nassets sometime later this year. The United States, our allies, and the \ninternational financial institutions not only should support this, but \nshould be involved in it. We have learned from hard experience \nthroughout the former communist world, that if outside powers do not \nget involved, it is just too tempting for well-placed individuals to \ncream off the best for themselves, to the disadvantage of the populace \nas a whole.\n  Montenegro deserves our support, because its government wants to \nfollow good models of governance, economics, and politics, despite the \nrisk that its democratic and free-market policies could bring civil \nwar, military coup, sudden exile, or even worse, assassination. Let us \nnot forget that it was in Montenegro that Milosevic's hit-men shot and \nwounded Vuk Draskovic, the Serbian opposition leader. Standing up to \nMilosevic, when you live inside Yugoslavia, takes courage. Standing up \nto Milosevic in the name of a majority of your 650,000 countrymen, as \nPresident Djukanovic is doing, takes quite a bit of courage.\n  It seems clear to me that what we have on our hands in Montenegro is \na case where we have American strategic interest combined with a moral \nimperative.\n  Let us not be caught flat-footed in Montenegro. Let us be vigilant \nand on guard.\n  First, I call upon our government to make clear to President \nMilosevic that the United States will not tolerate the overthrow of the \nlegally elected government of Montenegro.\n  Second, I urge in the strongest terms that the United States \nimmediately take the lead within NATO in drawing up detailed \ncontingency plans for responding affirmatively to any request by the \nDjukanovic government for assistance in repelling aggression by the \nYugoslav Army against Montenegro.\n  Third, in order that this not become a partisan issue in the fall \nelection campaign, I urge the Administration to include representatives \nof both Vice President Gore and Governor Bush in all deliberations on \nthe situation in Montenegro.\n  I hope that all members of Congress, and indeed all Americans, will \nagree that we owe it to ourselves, to our allies, and to our friends in \nMontenegro and in the Balkans, to be prepared. As somebody once \nobserved, ``summoning the will to win is one thing; the more important \nthing is summoning the will to prepare.'' Deterrence is much cheaper \nthan war-fighting. Milosevic must be made to understand that he will \nnot be allowed to get away with his fifth war of aggression in 10 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7443-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7443-S7445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM GRANT SMITH NEAL ON THE 56TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                        AMERICAN LANDING ON GUAM\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, 56 years ago today, the United States \nMarine Corps landed on the island of Guam to liberate its people from \nJapanese occupation. One of the marines involved in that action was \nWilliam Grant Smith Neal who subsequently received the Purple Heart for \nwounds sustained during action on that island the following day. \nWilliam Neal died on July 9, 2000 and one more American veteran of \nWorld War II has been taken from us. To honor Mr. Neal, and all \nveterans who served during that war, I believe it is fitting to outline \nthe life of this man as a tribute to his generation which offered every \nfull measure to keep this country safe.\n  On January 22, 1923, in Utica, Kansas, was born the first child to \nGlenn and Bessie Neal. As evidence of close attachment with family \n(which has become a Neal trademark) Glenn and Bessie wanted to name \ntheir son William Grant Neal after his grandparents, William Neal and \nGrant Smith. In the excitement, the doctor became confused and the name \naffixed to the baby's birth certificate was William Grant Smith Neal. \nHowever, to family and friends, he became known simply as Bill.\n  In fact, it was not until Bill entered the Marine Corps 18 years \nlater that a document search revealed the complete scope of Bill Neal's \nfull name.\n  Bill's father was employed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad and his \njob relocated him and the entire Neal family in the late 1920's to \nHorace, Kansas, a community located nearly on the Colorado border and \nright in the middle of the coming Dust Bowl. As a child, Bill soon \nbecame familiar with athletics and was a member of the Horace \nElementary Basketball Team during the 5th and 6th grade. While playing \nin a double elimination tournament, Bill's team won the final game, but \nwith only three players remaining; all others had fouled out. Just like \nlife in the West Kansas plains during the 1920's and 30's, playing \nbasketball there was tough stuff, and Bill proved he had what it took: \nhe was one of the final three.\n  By the mid-1930's, the Neal family was moving again, this time to \nHoisington, Kansas, where firm roots were put down. At Hoisington High \nSchool, Bill again excelled in sports as the football quarterback and \nin basketball and track. Naturally, his little sisters were very proud \nof him and anytime they would see Bill in downtown Hoisington, they \nwould rush to his side and try to engage him in conversation. Being the \nbig brother, however, Bill's response to such attention was normally \nthe command, ``Go Home!\"\n  Other girls were more successful. On one occasion, a girl in Bill's \nclass appeared at the Neal home, knocked on the door, and asked for \nBill. When Bill stepped outside, she quickly kissed him and ran away.\n  She wasn't taking the chance of being told to go home.\n  After High School, Bill pursued higher education at Wichita \nUniversity, known today as Wichita State University, on a football \nscholarship. But world events were soon to disrupt Bill Neal's formal \neducation for 4 years and, instead, provide him a role in one of the \nmost important events of the 20th Century.\n  The December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor stirred the hearts of many \nyoung Americans intent on protecting our nation's shores and interests \nfrom evil forces then afoot in the world. Bill Neal was no exception.\n  Although not yet of age to enlist without parental consent, Bill \nimmediately sought to join the U.S. Marine Corps and asked his father \nfor approval. However, his father, himself a veteran of the First World \nWar, was not eager to watch his young son march off to what he knew \nawaited on distant battlefields and, instead, sent him back to school \nin Wichita until such time that Bill would otherwise have to sign up \nfor the draft. That time soon came and on July 11, 1942, Bill Neal \nentered the United States Marine Corps and set off from Kansas by rail \nto Marine boot camp in San Diego, California. Bill had never before \nstepped foot outside the state of Kansas, but now he was about to enter \na far and dangerous world.\n  After boot camp, Bill was sent to New Zealand, which was then a \nstaging area for hostile activities in the South Pacific. On his first \nSunday there, Bill attended service at a local Methodist Church where \nhe met the Craig family: Bob, his sons Bruce, Wallace, and Russell and \nAuntie Maggie. Following service, the Craigs invited Bill home for \ndinner and in a short time, he had become their ``adopted son''. Auntie \nMaggie taught him to drink tea in her kitchen and Wallace took him to \nrugby games.\n  The friendship which developed between Bill and the Craigs continued \nthrough the years and Bill and his wife Natalie recently made a trip to \nNew Zealand to renew that friendship. Just last year, Russell Craig and \nhis wife Iris made a trip to America where Bill and Natalie served as \ntheir guide from one coast all the way to the other.\n  But, the South Pacific in the 1940's was no vacation spot. Before \nlong, Bill embarked from New Zealand for less hospitable receptions on \nBouganville and Guadalcanal. The taste of Auntie Maggie's tea was soon \nreplaced with the stench of hot, wet jungles.\n  On July 21, 1944, Bill Neal came ashore at Guam in the second wave \nlanding on Asan Red Beach. One day later, July 22nd, Bill was in a \nfoxhole with four other marines when the direct hit of a Japanese shell \nfell right on their location. Three of Bill's companions were killed \ninstantly. Bill would\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\noftentimes say that every day of his life after that foxhole was a \ngift. It was a gift, to him and to all of us.\n  The wounds Bill suffered on Guam placed him in a Honolulu hospital, \nand after recovering he went home to Hoisington for what was to be an \nextended leave. But meanwhile, the storming of Iwo Jima and its \nresulting high number of casualties forced the military to call \navailable servicemen back into the theater of operations. So ended \nBill's home leave and once again, he was kissing his mother goodby and \nboarding a train for the Pacific and a ship back to Guam where he was \nmade pack-ready to invade Japan.\n  Bill was under no allusion. Everyone knew that an American invasion \nof the Japanese home islands would be very grim work and the chances of \nsurvival not promising. But that was exactly the breach into where Bill \nNeal was about to step when word came of the flight of the Enola Gay, \nthe dropping of two Atomic Bombs, and the surrender of Japan. Bill \noften acknowledged that Harry Truman, in making the momentous decision \nto use atomic weapons, not only ended the war, but also saved his life.\n  With the war's end, Bill returned to the beloved homeland for which \nhe had risked his life, and nearly paid the ultimate sacrifice. He \nreadjusted to civilian life and was by 1946 enrolled at Manhattan, \nKansas, in the Kansas State College, now Kansas State University, with \na major in Agriculture Education and a membership in the Acacia \nFraternity. He was heard to claim that he had returned to his native \nsoil to ``marry a little Kansas farm girl''. He was soon to get his \nwish.\n  One September night in 1946, Bill and a group of his friends drove \nout into the Riley County countryside with the less-than-noble \nintention of appropriating some watermelons from a nearby farm. The car \nin which they were riding was not properly large enough for the task \nand Bill found that someone was going to have to sit on his lap. Not to \nhis dismay, that someone was a little Kansas farm girl from near \nElbing, who, though an accomplice in the affair, was probably far more \ninnocent than anyone else involved. But watermelons aside, Bill Neal \nhad met his ``little Kansas farm girl'' and it is doubtful if any other \nraid has been ever so successful.\n  Two days before Christmas of the following year, Natalie Baker's \nmother put her daughter on a bus in nearby Newton, Kansas, and within a \nnumber of hours, Natalie had arrived in Bill's hometown of Hoisington \nto meet the entire Neal family for the first time, visit the minister's \nhouse, and get married, all in one day. At the wedding there was only \none guest, uninvited at that, by the name of Rex Archer who was one of \nBill's fraternity brothers in Manhattan. After the ceremony, Bill's \nmother prepared a feast and sitting at the table, Rex demanded \nNatalie's attention and told her to take a good look at the man she had \njust married. ``Just look at that,'' he told her, ``just see what your \nkids are going to look like!'' Bill's father thought that was pretty \nfunny. To Natalie it may have been a little sobering, but it was too \nlate to back out, not that she would have anyway.\n  Less than a year later, it was time to test the prediction. On \nSeptember 29, 1948, Bill and Natalie Neal had their first child, Candi, \nborn in Manhattan, Kansas. The following night, Bill's fraternity \nbrothers gathered outside Natalie's room in the hospital to serenade \nher and her infant daughter with the Acacia Sweetheart Song.\n  By January of 1950, Bill had graduated from college, but jobs were \nhard to find and his first post-graduation employment was in the form \nof temporary jobs in eastern Colorado and Salina, Kansas. It was in \nSalina on August 19, 1950, that Bill and Natalie's second child, a son \nnamed Bill, Junior, was born, known to all of us now as Billy. The Neal \nfamily was now complete.\n  Not long afterward, Bill was offered a position as an instructor in \nEllsworth, Kansas, teaching veterans skills related to agriculture. To \nBill, this was a very rewarding experience and one which gave him many \nlong lasting friendships with his students. However, another vocation \nwas calling. In 1953, Bill was offered a job as claims adjuster with \nthe Farm Bureau Insurance Company, which began a career that lasted \nmore than 30 years. After a short training session in Great Bend, Bill \nwas assigned to the Farm Bureau office in Garden City.\n\n  The early 1950's were particularly brutal in western Kansas where \ndry, hot, windy days would kick up dust storms from which it was nearly \nimpossible to escape. One Spring day in 1955, Bill was on the phone to \na Farm Bureau office in eastern Kansas talking about the possibility of \nhim taking a position in that part of the state. Bill asked if the wind \nwas blowing in eastern Kansas that day and was told no, the sun was \nshining, the sky was blue, and the birds were singing.\n  Bill looked out his window in Garden City, couldn't see across the \nstreet for all the dust, and at that moment the decision was made to \nmove the Neal family across the state to settle in Altamont, which has \nremained the Neal home ever since.\n  Always quick to adopt the local community spirit, Bill for a time \ntaught Sunday School at the Altamont Presbyterian Church to high \nschool-age and young adults. He even held briefly the position there as \nAssistant Sunday School Superintendent. One Sunday both the \nSuperintendent and the pianist were gone leaving Bill fully in charge.\n  He arranged for a substitute pianist and all seemed to be going well. \nWhen someone in the class suggested a particular hymn, Bill joined in \nwith enthusiasm, but didn't notice that his hymnal was missing a page \nand he was singing a different song. Not long after that, Bill decided \nto pass on the role of Assistant Superintendent to another.\n  All of us, in our own way, have our own cherished memories and \nstories of Bill Neal. Some of the remembrances of his former coworkers \nand friends include those of Jim Cerne, who described Bill as simply, \n``his mentor''. Also, Paul Schmidt, former Cherokee County Farm Bureau \nAgent, recalls the time his wife was concerned about his health and was \npressing him to get a check-up at a clinic in Ft. Scott. Bill thought \nthe best way to get Paul to see a doctor was to agree to see one as \nwell. He told Paul, if you go, I will go along with you for the same \ntreatment, and it worked. Although they were tempted to sidetrack their \ntrip from Ft. Scott to a Missouri golf course, they did get the check-\nup. However, the results were a little unexpected.\n  Paul got a clear bill of health and Bill ended up getting gall \nbladder surgery.\n  Slick Norris, while the Altamont Grade School Principal, learned of \nBill's former achievements in field and track and one day asked him to \ngive a demonstration to the students on pole vaulting. Young Billy Neal \nwas quite proud when his ``old dad'' was able to top 8 feet in prime \nform at the age of 39.\n  Bill's love of history was well known. Billy and others often noted \nhow Bill always managed to land on ``yellow'' in Trivial Pursuit. But \nbeyond that, Bill was a serious student of history and served well as \nthe family genealogist. In fact, on a recent trip to Illinois and \nIndiana, he uncovered some interesting and long-forgotten tales of his \nmother's ancestors.\n  For others of us there are differing impressions. Grandchildren will \nbe quick to remember their grandpa's booming voice and hearty laughter. \nAnd, it will be easy to imagine Bill still making the rounds at the \nParsons Country Club.\n  Honesty was a standard Bill lived by every day of his life. On a \nrecent tour of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, Bill promptly \nprovided the full suggested donation price posted on a museum table, \neven after a local artist informed him it was just fine to offer only \n50 cents.\n  Similarly, during a tour of a Mexican border town, Bill was walking \ndown the street and came upon a young woman selling tablecloths on a \ndisplay. He asked her the price and she said $7. When he asked her for \na sack to put them in, she misunderstood and said, $6. Anyway, Bill was \nnever one to dicker.\n  But, maybe, it was his never-failing optimism that was Bill Neal's \ngreatest calling card. To him, every morning was a ``glorious good \nmorning'' and every day brought his greeting of a most deliberate \n``rise and shine''!\n  Aside from family and friends, though, it was perhaps the U.S. Marine\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nCorps and his experience during the war years that best shaped the \nqualities and character of Bill Neal. For many veterans, the horrible \nexperiences of war are not the subject of comfortable conversation, and \nsuch was the case with Bill. Not until 1992 would Bill discuss many of \nhis war experiences with even members of his immediate family.\n  In 1992, Bill and Natalie attended the 50th Anniversary of the \nfounding of the 3rd Marine Division in San Diego. That event, coupled \nwith his reunion of old friends and sojourners of harms way, served as \nan invitation for Bill to release many of the memories he had held for \nhalf a century. He began to open up and talk about those years and let \nus all share in the pride of what he and others did for his country and \nfor us.\n  Nearly every year since then, Bill and Natalie attended these annual \nreunions where ``Semper Fidelis'' is demonstrated in a big way. In July \n1994, Bill and Natalie participated in a charter flight where a large \ncontingent of former fellow Marines, and their families, returned to \nGuam for the 50th Anniversary of the American landing on those shores.\n  As they approached the island, the pilot slowly circled the beaches \nbelow where in 1944, Bill and his comrades slogged ashore toward a \nhostile enemy and an uncertain fate. Its not hard to imagine the rush \nof emotions everyone aboard that plane experienced either remembering \nor imagining what it had been like. Once on the ground, the people of \nGuam came out to cheer the return of the liberators who marched onto \ntheir shores all those years ago and where every year since, July 21st \nis celebrated as ``liberation day''.\n  While the image of hero is real, it is not necessarily as a \nliberator, a warrior, or even as the recipient of the Purple Heart that \nwe recall in the person of Bill Neal. Instead, it is of a loving \nhusband and father. The relationship shared by Bill and Natalie for \nmore than 50 years has been more than a model marriage. It is unlikely \nthere has ever been another couple more dedicated to each other, more \nin tune with each other, and more deeply in love with each other than \nBill and Natalie.\n  Bill and Natalie have given us two extremely intelligent and talented \nchildren, 8 grandchildren, and 2 great grandchildren, so far. Other \nsurviors include two brother, Cecil Neal of Oregon, Wisconsin and \nWillis Neal of Overland Park, Kansas; five sisters, Glenna Schneider of \nTribune, Kansas, Twyla Miller of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Sally Hager of \nDighton, Kansas, Phyllis Luerman of Hoisington, Kansas, and Penny \nMcClung of Attica, Kansas. Bill was preceded in death by a sister, \nJessie Kasselman.\n  In many ways, Bill Neal lived the American dream. Rising from humble \norigins in the still untamed plains of western Kansas, he went on to \naccomplish a challenging career, marry a lovely and talented woman, and \nproduce loving and dedicated children. He offered everything, including \nhis very life, in the protection of those things most important. He met \nthe challenge of his generation when foreign oppression threatened our \nvery way of life. He came to adopt and live by the creed of his fellow \nMarines, the one which it is not now too difficult to imagine him using \nto salute those most dear to him.\n  Semper Fi!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7445-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO COL. BRUCE BERWICK, COMMANDER, BALTIMORE DISTRICT, U.S. ARMY \n                           CORPS OF ENGINEERS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nColonel Bruce Berwick, Commander of the Baltimore District, U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers. Col. Berwick is moving on to a new assignment at \nthe Pentagon and I want to express my personal appreciation for the \noutstanding work that he has done.\n  The Baltimore District is one of the Corps' largest districts \nencompassing five States and the District of Columbia. It is \nresponsible for twenty-three military installations, three major \nwatersheds including the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac and Susquehanna \nRivers, 14 dams and reservoirs, numerous navigation projects--large and \nsmall, and the public water supply for the Washington metropolitan \narea, as well as certain overseas activities. Managing the District's \nconsiderable and diverse workload presents a special challenge--a \nchallenge that Col. Berwick met with great success. During his three-\nyear tenure as Commander of the Baltimore District, Col. Berwick has \ndistinguished himself as an exceptional District Engineer and a \ndedicated and tireless advocate for the mission of the U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers. Under his leadership, numerous military construction and \ncivil works projects were initiated or completed including the $1.1 \nbillion Pentagon renovation project, the $147 million Walter Reed Army \nInstitute for Research, phase one of the Poplar Island beneficial use \nof dredged material project and the storm damage restoration work at \nOcean City and the north end of Assateague Island National Seashore, to \nname only a few. The Colonel worked to ensure that these projects \nremained on cost, on schedule and were built to the highest standards. \nSimilarly, he directed and oversaw the successful completion of \nnumerous environmental restoration projects including the fish \npassageway at the Little Falls Dam on the Potomac River, wetland \nrestoration along the Anacostia River, the planning and design for the \nrewatering of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the protection of Smith \nIsland, as well as the Chesapeake Bay oyster recovery effort.\n  I have had the pleasure of working closely with Col. Berwick over the \nlast three years on these and other initiatives throughout Maryland and \nthe mid-Atlantic area. I know first hand the exceptional talent, \ningenuity, and energy which he brought to the Baltimore District and to \nthe Corps of Engineers. One of our most significant cooperative efforts \nand one which, in my view, underscores the exceptional leadership and \ncommitment of Bruce Berwick was the repair of the Korean War Memorial. \nJust three years after the memorial was dedicated it was clear that it \nwas not functioning as originally designed and was plagued by problems: \nthe water in the fountain no longer flowed, the grove of Linden trees \ndied and had to be removed, there were walkway and safety hazards and \nthe lighting for the statues was failing. Col. Berwick made it a \npersonal mission to fix these problems and ensure that the monument was \nrepaired in time for the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War. As a \nresult of his determined efforts, our Korean War Veterans now have a \nmemorial for which they can be proud, one that is a fitting and lasting \ntribute to their service to our nation.\n  In recognition of his outstanding work in the Baltimore District and \nhis other assignments throughout the world, Col. Berwick has been the \nrecipient of numerous awards and decorations including the Legion of \nMerit, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Parachutist \nBadge. Perhaps more significantly however, his efforts and \naccomplishments have earned him the respect and admiration of his \ncolleagues and others with whom he has worked. It is my firm conviction \nthat public service is one of the most honorable callings, one that \ndemands the very best, most dedicated efforts of those who have the \nopportunity to serve their fellow citizens and country. Throughout his \ncareer Bruce Berwick has exemplified a steadfast commitment to meeting \nthis demand.\n  I want to extend my personal congratulations and thanks for his hard \nwork and dedication and to wish him and his family the best of luck in \nhis new assignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7445-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7445-S7447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID MAHONEY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on the first of May of this year \nour nation lost a great friend. David Mahoney's meteoric rise in the \nworld of advertising and business is well-chronicled. But less known \nare the extraordinary contributions he made to the advancement of \nscience--in particular, the vast field of research associated with the \nhuman brain.\n  After an astonishingly successful career at conglomerates such as \nColgate-Palmolive and Norton Simon, David Mahoney spent the last ten \nyears of his life devoted to the work of the Dana Alliance for Brain \nInitiatives. This group has brought together the world's foremost \nneuroscientists who work tirelessly to discover the scientific \nbreakthroughs that will one day provide us with the capability to \nprevent\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\nand effectively treat such disorders as schizophrenia, Parkinson's \ndisease, depression and Alzheimer's disease.\n  David Mahoney was an individual of remarkable accomplishment and \ndedication. Together with his family and enormous circle of friends, we \nshall miss him greatly. We are consoled in part to know that the work \nhe did lives on.\n  The attached notice of David Mahoney's death appeared in the New York \nTimes on Tuesday, May 2, 2000. Of particular interest is the moving \ntribute written by Dr. Max Cowan as published in the Dana Alliance \nnewsletter. I ask that both articles be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The articles follow:\n\n            [From Dana Alliance Member News, Apr./May 2000]\n\n                           Remembering David\n\n                             (By Max Cowan)\n\n       I first met David Mahoney at a week-end retreat for \n     selected CEOs that Jim Watson had organized at the Banbury \n     Conference Center at Cold Spring Harbor. Jim, with \n     characteristic imagination, thought it would be interesting \n     to expose business leaders to recent advances in biology and \n     bio-medical research, and on this occasion focused the \n     retreat on neuroscience. I was one of five or six \n     neuroscientists who were invited to participate and as it \n     happened I was asked to give the first talk on the structure \n     of the brain. It occurred to me that most of the participants \n     had probably never seen a real brain, so I brought a \n     formalin-fixed human brain with me and, on the Friday \n     evening, proceeded to demonstrate and dissect it. Unlike most \n     of my students, who seemed rather blase about seeing and even \n     handling the brain, this group of distinguished businessmen \n     was completely fascinated to learn about and, at one point, \n     to actually touch the brain. As one of them later remarked, \n     ``this was one of the most moving experiences I have had.''\n       I had quite forgotten about this event until one morning, \n     just over ten years ago, I received a phone call from out of \n     the blue by someone who introduced himself with the words: \n     ``Dr. Max, you probably don't remember me. I'm David Mahoney \n     and I want you to know that you changed my life.'' I was so \n     taken aback that the only thing I could say was, `` I trust \n     the change was for the better''! ``Do you recall speaking at \n     a retreat at Cold Spring Harbor almost two years ago''? David \n     asked. ``I was one of the participants and I can still \n     remember vividly your dissecting a brain for us. That weekend \n     had a profound effect on me. I went home afterwards and said \n     to my wife, `Hille, I think I should give up working and \n     spend the rest of my time trying to do something to promote \n     research on the brain and its disorders,' And that's what \n     I've been doing over the past several months, and now I need \n     your help.''\n       It was not until Jim Watson organized yet another meeting \n     at Cold Spring Harbor, this time to discuss ``Funding the \n     Decade of the Brain'' that I had a chance to speak to David \n     directly. At this meeting, which included several leading \n     basic and clinical neuroscientists and representatives of a \n     number of funding agencies--both federal and private--the \n     topic of concern was: Why had the presidential proclamation \n     that the 90s were to be the ``Decade of the Brain'' not led \n     to additional support for brain science?\n       Like most such meetings, the first session, on Friday \n     afternoon, was fairly unproductive. There was a good deal of \n     breast-beating and anecdotes about worthwhile research \n     projects that had gone unfunded, but no real suggestions as \n     to what might be done. At dinner I found myself seated next \n     to David. With that insight and forthrightness that I came to \n     admire so much, David came straight to the point. ``Max,'' he \n     said, ``these people seem more concerned about the support of \n     their own work than for the suffering of people with \n     neurological and psychiatric illnesses. I want you to begin \n     this evening's session by proposing something concrete, \n     something that can be done over the next nine years. And if \n     you guys who are in the business can come up with something \n     that seems worthwhile, it's possible that the Dana Foundation \n     may be able to help to get it off the ground.'' Out of this \n     conversation and the discussions that followed that evening \n     and the next morning was the Dana Alliance for Brain \n     Initiatives (DABI) born. In fact, before the Saturday morning \n     session ended, an agenda that had been outlined, the scope of \n     the organization sketched out, an executive committee \n     selected, and the timetable for several specific activities \n     set.\n       None of us who were present at the meeting could have \n     guessed that within a year DABI would have established itself \n     as the single most important new effort to promote awareness \n     of the magnitude of the problems presented by such disorders \n     as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, \n     depression, schizophrenia, blindness, serious hearing loss, \n     and chronic pain. But then none of us had seen David \n     in action, nor had we been closely associated with someone \n     whose vision and imagination were so closely matched by \n     his energy and determination.\n       Drawing on his experience of a lifetime in business, his \n     wide range of contacts with leaders in so many fields--\n     politics, the media, sports, and academia--David seemed \n     tireless in his efforts to get across the message that brain \n     disorders are among the most serious we have to address. In \n     meeting after meeting, in schools, community centers, in TV \n     studios and the halls of Congress, he kept reminding his \n     audience, whether large or small, that sooner or later nearly \n     all of us will be impacted, either directly or indirectly, by \n     some disorder of the brain. How often he stressed the \n     seriousness of these illnesses, not only for the patients \n     themselves, but also for their families and communities; what \n     an enormous burden they imposed in terms of human suffering, \n     of lost employment, of misunderstanding and even shame and \n     embarrassment. And, he repeatedly pointed out, with the aging \n     of our population these disorders will soon strain to the \n     breaking point our health care system and social services. \n     Only David's family and closest associates were conscious of \n     how he criss-crossed the country with this message; and no \n     one was surprised when the opportunity presented itself, that \n     he quickly extended his efforts across the Atlantic to meet \n     the European DABI.\n       But for many of us, David will always be remembered not \n     just for his energy, enthusiasm, and drive, but for his quite \n     extraordinary capacity for friendship and his ability to \n     encourage others to rise above themselves.\n       Some weeks ago I had occasion to speak at a memorial \n     service for a colleague, Dr. Daniel Nathans, and was moved to \n     quote some lines from the dedication of Tennyson's great \n     poem, ``Idylls of the King.'' These same lines have been \n     running through my mind since hearing of David's death, and \n     they bear repeating here:\n\n     The shadow of his loss drew eclipse,\n     Darkening the world, We have lost him; he is gone.\n     We know him now; all narrow jealousies\n     Are silent, and we see him as he moved,\n     How modest, kindly, all-accomplished, wise,\n     With what sublime repression of himself\n     And in what limits, and how tenderly\n     Not swaying to this faction, or to that;\n     Not making his high place the lawless perch\n     Of wing'd ambitions, nor vantage-ground\n     For pleasure; but through all tract of years\n     Wearing the white flower of a blameless life,\n     Before a thousand peering littlenesses.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 2, 2000]\n\nDavid Mahoney, a Business Executive and Neuroscience Advocate, Dies at \n                                   76\n\n                          (By Eric Nagourney)\n\n       David Mahoney, a business leader who left behind the world \n     of Good Humor, Canada Dry and Avis and threw himself behind a \n     decidedly less conventional marketing campaign, promoting \n     research into the brain, died yesterday at his home in Palm \n     Beach, Fla. He was 76.\n       The cause was heart disease, friends said.\n       Mr. Mahoney, who believed that the study of the brain and \n     its diseases had been shortchanged for far too long, was \n     sometimes described as the foremost lay advocate of \n     neuroscience. As chief executive of the Charles A. Dana \n     Foundation, a medical philanthropic organization based in \n     Manhattan, he prodded brain researchers to join forces, shed \n     their traditional caution and reclusivity and engage the \n     public imagination.\n       To achieve his goals, he brought to bear the power of \n     philanthropy, personal persuasion and the connections he had \n     made at the top of the corporate world.\n       Using his skills as a marketing executive, he worked \n     closely with some of the world's top neuroscientists to teach \n     them how to sell government officials holding the purse \n     strings, as well as the average voter, on the value of their \n     research. He pressed them to make specific public commitments \n     to find treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's \n     and depression, rather than conduct just ``pure'' research.\n       ``People don't buy science solely,'' Mr. Mahoney said this \n     year. ``They buy the results of, and the hope of, science.''\n       In 1992, aided by Dr. James D. Watson, who won the Nobel \n     Prize as a co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, Mr. Mahoney \n     founded the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives, a foundation \n     organization of about 190 neuroscientists, including Dr. \n     Watson and six other Nobel laureates, that works to educate \n     the public about their field.\n       That same year, after taking over the 50-year-old Dana \n     Foundation as chief executive, Mr. Mahoney began shifting it \n     away from its traditional mission of supporting broader \n     health and educational programs, and focused its grants \n     almost exclusively on neuroscience. Since then, the \n     foundation has given some $34 million to scientists working \n     on brain research at more than 45 institutions.\n       Mr. Mahoney also dipped into his own fortune, giving \n     millions of dollars to endow programs in neuroscience at \n     Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. Later this month, \n     the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which traditionally \n     honors the most accomplished researchers, was to give him a \n     newly created award for philanthropy.\n       ``He put his money where his mouth was,'' said Dr. Kay \n     Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins \n     University.\n       Mr. Mahoney's journey from businessman to devotee of one of \n     the most esoteric fields of health was as unusual as it was \n     unexpected.\n       David Joseph Mahoney Jr. was born in the Bronx on May 17, \n     1923, the son of David J. Mahoney, a construction worker, and \n     the former Loretta Cahill.\n       After serving as an infantry captain in the Pacific during \n     World War II, he enrolled at\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\n     the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He studied \n     at night, and during the day he worked 90 miles away in the \n     mail room of a Manhattan advertising agency. Ruthrauff & \n     Ryan. By the time he was 25, he had become a vice president \n     of the agency--by some accounts, the youngest vice president \n     on Madison Avenue at the time.\n       Then in 1951, in a move in keeping with the restlessness \n     that characterized his business career, he left Ruthrauff & \n     Ryan to form his own agency. Four years later, when his \n     business was worth $2 million, he moved on again, selling it \n     to run Good Humor, the ice-cream company that his small \n     agency had managed to snare as a client.\n       Five years later, when Good Humor was sold, Mr. Mahoney \n     became executive vice president of Colgate-Palmolive, then \n     president of Canada Dry, and then, in 1969, president and \n     chief operating officer of Norton Simon, formed from Canada \n     Dry, Hunt Food and McCall's. Under Mr. Mahoney, Norton Simon \n     grew into a $3 billion conglomerate that included Avis Rent A \n     Car, Halston, Max Factor and the United Can Company.\n       Despite his charm, associates said, he had a short temper \n     and an impatient manner that often sent subordinates packing. \n     ``I burn people out,'' he once said in an interview. ``I'm \n     intense, and I think that intensity is sometimes taken for \n     anger.''\n       The public knew him as one of the first chief executives to \n     go in front of the camera to promote his product, in this \n     case, in the early 1980's for Avis rental cars, which Norton \n     Simon had acquired under his tenure.\n       By all accounts, including his own, Mr. Mahoney was living \n     on top of the world. He was one of the nation's top-paid \n     executives, receiving $1.85 million in compensation in 1982--\n     a fact that did not always endear him to some Norton Simon \n     shareholders, who filed lawsuits charging excessive \n     compensation, given that his company's performance did not \n     always keep pace with his raises.\n       Tall and trim, he moved among society's elite and was \n     friends with Henry A. Kissinger, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and \n     Barbara Walters. He was reported to have advised Presidents \n     Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and to have \n     met with Mr. Carter at Camp David.\n       But his fortunes changes late in 1983. True to form, the \n     restless Mr. Mahoney was seeking change, putting into motion \n     a plan to take Norton Simon private. But this time, he \n     stumbled: a rival suitor, the Esmark Corporation, bettered \n     his offer and walked away with his company.\n       Mr. Mahoney was left a lot richer--as much as $40 million \n     or so, by some accounts--but, for the first time in his life, \n     he was out of a job and at loose ends. He described the \n     period as a low point.\n       ``You stop being on the `A' list,'' he said some years \n     later, ``Your calls don't get returned. It's not just less \n     fawning; people could care less about you in some cases. The \n     king is dead. Long live the king.''\n       It took some years for Mr. Mahoney to regain his focus. \n     Gradually, he turned his attention to public health, in which \n     he had already shown some interest. In the 1970's, he had \n     been chairman of the board of Phoenix House, the residential \n     drug-treatment program. By 1977, while still at Norton, he \n     became chairman of the Dana Foundation, a largely advisory \n     position.\n       Mr. Mahoney increasingly devoted his time to the \n     foundation. In 1992, he also became its chief executive, and \n     soon began shifting the organization's focus to the brain. In \n     part, the reason came from his own experience. In an \n     acceptance speech that he had prepared for the Lasker Award, \n     he wrote of having seen firsthand the effects of stress and \n     the mental health needs of people in the business world.\n       But associates recalled, and Mr. Mahoney seemed to say as \n     much in his speech, that he appeared to have arrived at the \n     brain much the way a marketing executive would think up a new \n     product. ``Some of the great minds in the world told me that \n     this generation's greatest action would be in brain science--\n     if only the public would invest the needed resources,'' he \n     wrote.\n       In 1992, Mr. Mahoney and Dr. Watson gathered a group of \n     neuroscientists at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long \n     Island. There, encouraged by Mr. Mahoney, the scientists \n     agreed on 10 research objectives that might be reached by the \n     end of the decade, among them finding the generic basis for \n     manic-depression and identifying chemicals that can block the \n     action of cocaine and other addictive substances.\n       ``We've gotten somewhere on about four of them--but that's \n     life,'' Dr. Watson said recently.\n       In recent years, Mr. Mahoney became convinced that a true \n     understanding of the brain-body connection might also lead to \n     cures for diseases in other parts of the body, like cancer \n     and heart disease.\n       He believed that it would soon be commonplace for people to \n     live to 100. For the quality of life to be high at that age, \n     he believed, people would have to learn to take better care \n     of their brains.\n       In 1998, along with Dr. Richard Restak, a \n     neuropsychiatrist, Mr. Mahoney wrote ``The Longevity \n     Strategy: How to Live to 100: Using the Brain-Body \n     Connection'' (John Wiley & Sons).\n       Mr. Mahoney's first wife, Barbara Ann Moore, died in 1975. \n     He is survived by his wife, the former Hildegarde Merrill, \n     with whom he also had a home in Lausanne, Switzerland; a son, \n     David, of Royal Palm Beach, Fla.; two stepsons, Arthur \n     Merrill of Muttontown, N.Y., and Robert Merrill of Locust \n     Valley, N.Y., and a brother, Robert, of Bridgehampton, N.Y.\n       Associates said Mr. Mahoney's temperament in his second \n     career was not all that different from what it had been in \n     his first. It was not uncommon, said Edward Rover, vice \n     chairman of the Dana Foundation's board of trustees, for his \n     phone to ring late at night, and for Mr. Mahoney to sail into \n     a pointed critique of their latest endeavors.\n       One researcher spoke of his ``kind of charge-up-San-Juan-\n     Hill style.'' Dr. Jamison, of Johns Hopkins, called him \n     ``impatient in the best possible sense of the word.''\n       As in his first career, Mr. Mahoney never lost the good \n     salesman's unwavering belief in his product. ``If you can't \n     sell the brain,'' he told friends, ``then you've got a real \n     problem.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7447-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7447-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:13 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4871.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe child tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   expansion of the child tax credit\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide a $1,000 per child tax credit for America's working families.\n  Mr. President, this legislation builds on the $500 per child tax \ncredit passed in 1997. The passage of the $500 per child tax credit was \nthe culmination of an effort that began in 1994 with a proposal \ncontained in the ``Contract with America.'' A child tax credit \nprovision also was part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which 104th \nCongress passed, but President Clinton vetoed.\n  Even with the $500 per child tax credit in place, today's total tax \nburden on families is still far too high. During this era of budget \nsurpluses, we must remember that these surplus funds are tax \noverpayments that should be returned to the people who overpaid them, \nand not spent on wasteful government programs. American families will \nspend the money better.\n  The child tax credit will help hard working families who pay federal \nincome tax and have children to support. Under this proposal, a working \nfamily with two children will receive $2,000 in the form of a tax \ncredit to help pay their children's health, education and food \nexpenses. Being a parent is not always easy. It becomes even more \ndifficult if a family has trouble paying for necessities such as food, \nclothes, education, and health care for their children. This tax credit \nwill help those families.\n  Mr. President, increasing the child tax credit to $1,000 is a \nstatement by our government and our society that all our families and \nall of our children will not be left behind. Increasing the $500 per \nchild tax credit to $1,000 would provide parents more than 38 million \nchildren, including roughly 1.5 million of my constituents in Michigan.\n  With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nAmerican families by supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text be printed \nin the Record and yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2903\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXPANSION OF CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Increase in Amount Allowed.--Subsection (a) of section \n     24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     allowance of credit) is amended by striking ``$500 ($400 in \n     the case of taxable years beginning in 1998)'' and inserting \n     ``$1,000''.\n       (b) Repeal of Phaseout of Credit.--Section 24 of such Code \n     is amended by striking subsection (b) and redesignating \n     subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), as subsections (b), (c), \n     (d), and (e), respectively.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 32(n)(1)(B)(ii) of such Code is amended by \n     striking ``section 24(d)'' and inserting ``section 24(c)''.\n       (2) Section 501(c)(26) of such Code is amended by striking \n     ``section 24(c)'' and inserting ``section 24(b)''.\n       (3) Section 6213(g)(2)(I) of such Code is amended by \n     striking ``section 24(e)'' and inserting ``section 24(d)''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Byrd, \n        Mr. Bayh, Mr. Levin, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2904. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives to encourage the production and use of efficient energy \nsources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance\n\n\n             the energy security tax and policy act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Daschle, Byrd, Baucus, Bayh, Johnson, \nLevin, and Rockefeller, that offers a comprehensive approach to energy \npolicy. This bill, the Energy Security Tax and Policy Act of 2000, \nincorporates many of the provisions of S. 1833, a comprehensive package \nof broad energy tax incentives introduced by Senator Daschle last year \nthat I cosponsored along with a number of other Democratic Senators. We \nhave updated and modified the bill after having worked closely with \nmany stakeholders, from the auto\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nmanufacturers, to the oil and gas producers, to the energy efficiency \ncommunity.\n  The Energy Security Tax and Policy Act of 2000 addresses a broad \nrange of technologies and industries necessary to meet our energy \nneeds. The bill includes incentives to ensure we maintain production of \nour domestic resources, but the overarching emphasis is on stimulating \nmore efficient use of energy in its many forms. Specific incentives \naddress:\n  Purchase of more efficient appliances, homes, and commercial \nbuildings.\n  Greater use of distributed generation--fuel cells, microturbines, \ncombined heat and power systems and renewables.\n  Purchase of hybrid and alternative fueled vehicles and development of \nthe infrastructure to service those vehicles.\n  Investment in clean coal technologies and generation of electricity \nfrom biomass, including co-firing with coal.\n  Countercyclical tax incentives for production from domestic oil and \ngas marginal wells.\n  Provisions to ensure diverse sources of electric supply are developed \nin the U.S. and to continue our investment in demand side management.\n  In addition, the bill reauthorizes the President's emergency energy \nauthorities, including establishing a northeastern heating oil reserve.\n  We have tried to take a balanced approach, both supply side and \ndemand side. Many of the provisions in this bill have strong bipartisan \nsupport, and I believe would receive the support of the White House as \npart of a comprehensive package.\n  After my 17 years in the Senate and on the Energy Committee, I have \nto note that the same issues have been with us in varying degrees for \nyears. Our current energy situation is the result of the policies and \ndecisions of many Administrations, Congresses, companies and \nindividuals, not to mention the vagaries of the marketplace.\n  Finding solutions will take serious bipartisan effort and long term \ncommitment. While we have the attention of the Congress, the White \nHouse and the public, I hope we can work together in the remaining days \nof this Congress to enact as many of these measures as possible to \nprotect our energy security and our economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2905. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake improvements to the Medicare+Choice program under part C of the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          the medicare+choice program improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today--\nthe Medicare+Choice Improvement Act of 2000--that would correct several \nof the inequities in the complex formula that is used to determine \npayment rates for Medicare+Choice plans. As many of my colleagues know, \nthe passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new optional \nMedicare+Choice managed care program for the aged and disabled \nbeneficiaries of the Medicare program. This new program replaced the \nprevious risk program and established a payment structure that was \ndesigned to reduce the variation across the country by increasing \npayments in areas with traditionally low payments. However, although \npayment variation has been somewhat reduced, substantial payment \ndifferentials remain nationwide. In New Mexico, for example, the \nMedicare+Choice plan payment for 2000 in Albuquerque is $430.44 monthly \nper beneficiary vs. $814.32 for NYC. Because these payments are so low \nin some places it has caused a devastating result--seniors are being \ndropped in large numbers.\n  The bill I am introducing today will correct inequities in the \ncurrent formula that is used to develop payment rates for \nMedicare+Choice managed care plans and keep them as a viable \nalternative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Medicare+Choice \nplans are a popular alternative to traditional Medicare fee-for-service \nhealth care coverage for aged and disabled Americans because they help \ncontain the beneficiary's out-of-pocket expenses, coordinate health \ncare, and increase important benefits.\n  Mr. President, the sad reality is that Medicare+Choice plans are \nsuffering financially under the new payment system and are no longer \nable to maintain enrollment of Medicare+Choice beneficiaries.\n  As you can see from this chart, New Mexico Medicare+Choice plans have \nannounced plans to drop 15,700 beneficiaries from their rolls on \nJanuary 1, 2001.\n  And, as you can see from this chart, nationally, the number of Medi-\ncare+Choice plan beneficiaries that will be dropped on January 1, 2001 \nare expected to be 711,000. Since 1999, 735,000 beneficiaries have been \ndropped. This would mean that as of January 1, 2001, 1,445,000 \nbeneficiaries will have been dropped.\n  This is a terrible situation. Even though beneficiaries that are \ndropped from Medicare+Choice plans will revert to traditional Medicare \nand will be able to purchase Medicare supplemental health insurance \nplans, the high cost associated with the purchase of these plans will \nput an additional financial burden on these aged and disabled Americans \nliving on fixed incomes. Additionally, they will not have the \nadditional health care benefits available to them under Medicare+Choice \nplans, including routine physicals, vision care, and prescription \ndrugs.\n  Because Medicare+Choice plans are offered by private managed care \ncompanies and because of their unique structure, these plans were able \nto limit out of pocket expenses, provide additional benefits to \nbeneficiaries, and control health care costs to the Federal government.\n  As you can see from this chart, Medicare+Choice plans offer a host of \nimportant benefits and options over and above traditional Medicare. \nThese include: prescription drugs, lower cost sharing with a \ncatastrophic cap on expenditures, care coordination, routine physicals, \nhealth education, vision services and, hearing exams/aids.\n  Mr. President, the loss of this important health care coverage option \nfor the aged and disabled will be devastating for some. This situation \nwill probably cause many of those on marginal incomes to lose the \nability to afford normal living expenses that may effectively require \nthem to enroll in Medicaid and state financial assistance programs. If \na beneficiary, who was dropped from a Medicare+Choice plan, has a fall \nand is admitted into the hospital they will be responsible for all \ndeductible expenses and when they are discharged and sent home with a \ndoctor's order for physical therapy, occupational therapy and visiting \nnurse service they would be responsible for all Medicare deductibles. \nThis event could cost the beneficiary several thousand dollars. This \nacute episode could force a beneficiary living on a marginal income to \nbe unable to pay for their deductibles, cease treatment prematurely, or \neven worse, avoid return visits to the doctor until they are in another \nemergency situation. Additionally, they would be forced to enroll on a \nstate Medicaid program for the indigent.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, the formula that was developed for \nMedicare+Choice plans was intended to address geographic variation in \nthe payment rates has gone too far in controlling costs and missed the \nboat with respect to geographic variability. Sure, the goal of managed \ncare is to save money for the taxpayer and coordinate quality care for \nthe beneficiary, but there is a point at which a health plan cannot \nafford financially to operate. This forces the beneficiary onto \ntraditional Medicare with its higher costs for both the taxpayer and \nbeneficiary.\n\n  Mr. President, this point has been reached in New Mexico and other \nareas of the country. We may not be able to have Medicare+Choice plans \ntake back their dropped beneficiaries but, we can prevent more from \nbeing dropped by acting favorably on this bill. The bottom line is \nthis: As a nation, we need to do all we can to provide a viable option \nto traditional fee-for-service Medicare that provides coordinated \nmanaged care at a savings to both the beneficiary and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The bill that I am introducing has provisions to raise the minimum \npayment floor, move to a 50:50 blend rate between local and national \nrates in 2002, set a ten-year phase-in of risk adjustment and allow \nplans to negotiate\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\na rate of payment with HCFA regardless of the county-specific rate, as \nlong as the negotiated rate does not exceed the national average per-\ncapita cost, and delay from July to November 2000 the deadline for \noffering and withdrawing Medicare+Choice plans for 2001.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort and to join me in taking \nan important step toward maintaining Medicare+Choice managed care plans \nas a positive alternative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and \nprevent more enrollees from being dropped while we try to reform \nMedicare. We owe it to our nation to take care of our elderly and aged \ncitizens and not expose them to more hardship.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2905\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto contracts with the city of Loveland, Colorado, to use Colorado-Big \nThompson Project facilities for the impounding, storage, and carriage \nof nonproject water for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other \nbeneficial purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  northern colorado water legislation\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to take a step in addressing \nthe long-term water needs of the northern Colorado citizens whose water \nis provided by the City of Loveland, Colorado. The bill I am \nintroducing today authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto contracts with the City of Loveland to utilize federal facilities \nof the original Colorado-Big Thompson Project for various purposes such \nas the storage and transportation of non-federal water originating on \nthe eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and intended for domestic, \nmunicipal, industrial and other uses.\n  Water supplies for Colorado cities are extremely limited. Whenever \npossible, cities attempt to use their water storage and conveyance \nsystems in the most efficient ways they can. The City of Loveland is \ntrying to use excess capacity in the federally built Colorado-Big \nThompson conveyance facilities to deliver water to an enlarged city \nreservoir, but current law does not allow the City to use excess \ncapacity in an existing Federal water delivery canal for domestic \npurposes.\n  In this case, Loveland intends to convey up to 75 cubic feet per \nsecond of its native river water supply from the Big Thompson River to \ntwo city-owned facilities, Green Ridge Glade Reservoir and Chasteen \nGrove Water Treatment Plant. A contract with the Bureau of Reclamation \nand the Colorado-Big Thompson Project operator, Northern Colorado Water \nConservancy District, will provide an economical and reliable means of \ndelivering Loveland's native\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\nriver water supplies. The City of Loveland simply desires to ``wheel'' \nsome of its drinking water supply through excess capacity in a canal \nserving Colorado-Big Thompson Project, a water project built by the \nBureau of Reclamation from 1938 to 1957. Loveland is prepared to pay \nappropriate charges for the use of this facility. In addition, any \ncontract affecting the Colorado-Big Thompson Project would be conducted \nin full compliance with all applicable environmental requirements. In \nfact, the Final Environmental Assessment on use of C-BT facilities to \nconvey City of Loveland Water Supplies to an expanded Green Ridge Glade \nReservoir has already been completed, and permits have been issued by \nthe Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Allowing Loveland to use the Colorado-Big Thompson Project should be \na simple matter, but it is not. Legislation is required to allow the \nCity to use the Federal water project for carriage of municipal and \nindustrial water. Historically when a party has desired to use \nReclamation project facilities for the storage or conveyance of non-\nproject water, the authority cited was the Act of February 21, 1911, \nknown as the Warren Act. The Warren Act provides for the utilization of \nexcess capacity in Reclamation project facilities to store non-project, \nirrigation water. Based on the current interpretation of Reclamation \nlaw, the Warren Act does not provide authority to enter into long-term \nstorage or conveyance contracts for non-irrigation, non-project water \nin Colorado-Big Thompson Project facilities.\n  Congress in recent years has expanded the scope of the Warren Act to \napply to communities in California and Utah where there existed a need \nfor more water management flexibility. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday is similar to other legislation introduced and passed in the \nrecent Congresses. It will simply extend similar flexibility to the \nColorado-Big Thompson Project and to the City of Loveland. Since there \nis precedent allowing the wheeling of non-federal water through federal \nfacilities, this is a non-controversial piece of legislation. \nTherefore, I hope that Congress will move quickly to pass this \nlegislation and I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee to move it quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 2907. A bill to amend the provisions of titles 5 and 28, United \nStates Code, relating to equal access to justice, award of reasonable \ncosts and fees, taxpayers recovery of costs, fees, and expenses, \nadministrative settlement offers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               equal access to justice reform legislation\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equal \nAccess to Justice Reform Amendments of 2000. This legislation contains \nadjustments to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) that will \nstreamline and improve the process of awarding attorney's fees to \nprivate parties who prevail in litigation against the Federal \ngovernment. This is the third Congress in which I have introduced this \nlegislation. I believe these reforms are an important step in reducing \nthe burden of defending government litigation for many individuals and \nsmall businesses.\n  I am very pleased to be joined in introducing this legislation this \nyear by my friend from Arkansas, Sen. Tim Hutchinson. We hope that by \nworking on a bipartisan basis on this important project we can improve \nthe chances that it can become law.\n  Over the years, and certainly now in this election year, members of \nCongress often speak of ``getting government off the backs of the \nAmerican people.'' Sometimes we disagree about when government is a \nburden and when it is giving a helping hand. But all of us in the \nSenate want to reform government in ways that will improve the lives of \npeople all across this nation. The legislation we are proposing today \ndeals directly with a problem that affects everyday Americans who face \nlegal battles with the federal government and prevail. Even if they win \nin court, they may still lose financially because of the expense of \npaying their attorneys.\n  At the outset, it is important to understand what the Equal Access to \nJustice Act is, and why it exists. The premise of this statute is very \nsimple. EAJA places individuals and small businesses who face the \nUnited States Government in litigation on more equal footing with the \ngovernment by establishing guidelines for the award of attorney's fees \nwhen the individual or small business prevails. Quite simply, EAJA \nacknowledges that the resources available to the federal government in \na legal dispute far outweigh those available to most Americans. This \ndisparity is lessened by requiring the government in certain instances \nto pay the attorneys' fees of successful private parties. By giving \nsuccessful parties the right to seek attorneys' fees from the United \nStates, EAJA seeks to prevent small business owners and individuals \nfrom having to risk their companies or their family savings in order to \nseek justice.\n  My interest in this issue predates my election to the Senate. It \narises from my experience both as a private attorney and a Member of \nthe state Senate in my home state of Wisconsin. While in private \npractice, I became aware of how the ability to recoup attorney's fees \nis a significant factor, and often one of the first considered, when \ndeciding whether or not to seek redress in the courts or to defend a \ncase. Upon entering the Wisconsin State Senate, I authored legislation \nmodeled on the federal law, which had been championed by one of my \npredecessors in this body from Wisconsin, Senator Gaylord Nelson. \nToday, section 814.246 of the Wisconsin statutes contains provisions \nsimilar to the federal EAJA statute.\n\n  It seemed to me then, as it does now, that we should do all that we \ncan to help ease the financial burdens on people who need to have their \nclaims reviewed and decided by impartial decision makers. To this end, \nI have reviewed the existing federal statutes with an eye toward \nimproving them and making them work better. The bill Senator Hutchinson \nand I are introducing today does a number of things to make EAJA more \neffective for individuals and small business men and women all across \nthis country.\n  First and most important, this legislation eliminates the provision \nin current law that allows the government to avoid paying attorneys' \nfees when it loses a suit if it can show that its position was \nsubstantially justified. I believe that this high threshold for \nobtaining attorneys' fees is unfair. If an individual or small business \nbattles the federal government in an adversarial proceeding and \nprevails, the government should simply pay the fees incurred. Imagine \nthe scenario of a small business that spends time and money dueling \nwith the government and wins, only to find out that it must now \nundertake the additional step of litigating the justification of \ngovernment's litigation position. For the government, with its vast \nresources, this second litigation over fees poses little difficulty, \nbut for the citizen or small business it may simply not be financially \nfeasible.\n  Not only is this additional step a financial burden on the private \nlitigant, but a 1992 study also reveals that it is unnecessary and a \nwaste of government resources. University of Virginia Professor Harold \nKrent on behalf of the Administrative Conference of the United States \nfound that only a small percentage of EAJA awards were denied because \nof the substantial justification defense. While it is impossible to \ndetermine the exact cost of litigating the issue of subtantial \njustification, it is Prof. Krent's opinion, based upon review of cases \nin 1989 and 1990, that while the substantial justification defense may \nsave some money, it was not enough to justify the cost of the \nadditional litigation. In short, eliminating this often burdensome \nsecond step is a cost effective step which will streamline recovery \nunder EAJA and may very well save the government money in the long run.\n  The second part of this legislation that will streamline and improve \nEAJA is a provision designed to encourage settlement and avoid costly \nand protracted litigation. Under the bill, the government can make an \noffer of settlement after an application for fees and other expenses \nhas been filed. If the government's offer is rejected and the \nprevailing party seeking recovery ultimately wins a smaller award, that\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\nparty is not entitled to the attorneys' fees and costs incurred after \nthe date of the government's offer. Again, this will encourage \nsettlement, speed the claims process, and thereby reduce the time and \nexpense of the litigation.\n  The final improvement to EAJA included in this legislation is the \nremoval of the carve out of cases where the prevailing party is \neligible to get attorneys fees under section 7430 of the Internal \nRevenue Code. Under current law, EAJA is inapplicable in cases where a \ntaxpayer prevails against the government. I was an original cosponsor \nof a bill that suggested a similar reform introduced by Senator Leahy \nof Vermont in the last Congress. This provision helps to level the \nplaying field between the IRS and everyday citizens. There is no reason \nthat taxpayers should be treated differently than any other party that \nprevails in a case against the government. They deserve to have their \nfees paid if they win.\n  We all know that the American small business owner has a difficult \nroad to make ends meet and that unnecessary or overly burdensome \ngovernment regulation can be a formidable obstacle to doing business. \nIt can be the difference between success or failure. The Equal Access \nto Justice Act was conceived and implemented to help balance the \nformidable power of the federal government. It has already helped many \nAmericans. The legislation we are offering today will make EAJA more \neffective for more Americans while at the same time helping to deter \nthe government from acting in an indefensible and unwarranted manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague \nSenator Feingold, to introduce the Equal Access to Justice, EAJA, \nReform Amendments of 2000. I do so because I firmly believe that small \nbusiness owners and individuals who prevail in court against the \nfederal government should be automatically reimbursed for their legal \nexpenses-- fulfilling the true intent of EAJA when passed in 1980.\n  EAJA's initial premise was to reduce the vast disparity in resources \nand expertise which exists between small business owners or individuals \nand federal agencies and to encourage the government to ensure that the \nclaims it pursues are worthy of its efforts. Twenty years ago, former \nSenator Gaylord Nelson, the author of the original, bipartisan EAJA \nbill, clearly explained EAJA's intent when he stated, ``All I can say \nis the taxpayer is injured, and if the taxpayer was correct, and that \nis the finding, then we ought to make the taxpayer whole.'' I commend \nformer Senator Nelson. His steadfast commitment to our nation's \nbusinesses as Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee is worthy \nof admiration. As\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\na result of a political compromise, however, the final version of EAJA \ndoes not provide for an automatic award of attorneys' fees. Rather, it \nprovides for an award of attorneys' fees only when an agency or a court \ndetermines that the government's position was not ``substantially \njustified'' or that ``special circumstances'' exist which would make an \naward unjust.\n  Agencies and courts have strayed far from the original intent of EAJA \nby repeatedly using these provisions to avoid awarding attorneys' fees \nto small businesses and individuals who have successfully defended \nthemselves. The bill that Senator Feingold and I are introducing today, \nthe Equal Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2000, would amend EAJA \nto provide that a small business owner or individual prevailing against \nthe government will be automatically entitled to recover their \nattorneys' fees and expenses incurred in their defense.\n  Unfortunately, EAJA is not making the taxpayers of this nation whole \nafter they defend themselves against government action. Thus, I ask \nthat my colleagues join Senator Feingold and myself in our effort to \nmake these American taxpayers whole by cosponsoring and supporting the \nEqual Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7453-1", "month": "07",

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution \nwhich would designate November 18, 2000 as ``National Survivors of \nSuicide Day.'' The term ``survivor'' refers to anyone who has lost a \nloved one to suicide. As such, having lost my father to suicide in \n1972, I am viewed as a survivor in the suicide prevention community. \nNationally, more than 30,000 people take their own lives each year. \nSuicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States and \nthe third major cause of death among people aged 15-19.\n  The suicide rate among young people has more than tripled in the last \nfour decades. Today in our country, countless suicide survivors go on \nwith their lives, many of them grieving in a very private way. This is \nbecause there still remains a stigma towards those who take their own \nlife as well as those who are left behind to cope with the suicide of a \nloved one. I can't begin to tell you how many survivors have written me \nexpressing the shame and guilt they feel about their loved one's \nsuicide, many of whom are still unable to deal honestly with the tragic \nconditions which ultimately led to someone they love taking their own \nlife.\n  I am pleased that this resolution passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent last year. Since then, there has been a fervor of activity and \ncollaboration in both the federal and private sectors around suicide \nprevention. Most recently, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education Appropriations Subcommittee dedicated a hearing to \nsuicide awareness and prevention. Among those who testified were \nSurgeon General Dr. David Satcher, National Institute of Mental Health \nDirector Dr. Steve E. Hyman, psychologist and author Dr. Kay Redfield \nJamison, and novelist Danielle Steele.\n  While we have taken some important first steps, we still have a long \nway to go in the area of suicide prevention and awareness. It is my \nintent to recognize the countless survivors who all are at various \nstages of healing in addressing the loss of their loved one to suicide. \nI ask you to support me in turning their grief into hope, a hope that \nwith acceptance and understanding, can lead our nation in effectively \naddressing this very preventable public health challenge.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                               American Foundation\n\n\n                                       For Suicide Prevention,\n\n                                      New York, NY, July 20, 2000.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The American Foundation for Suicide \n     Prevention supports the proposed Senate Resolution \n     designating Saturday, November 18, 2000 as National Survivors \n     of Suicide Day. We believe this resolution will build on the \n     momentum started last year by Senate Resolution 99, which \n     recognized for the first time the unique problems faced by \n     survivors and their important contributions to suicide \n     prevention.\n       Specifically, the proposed Survivors of Suicide Day \n     Resolution will be instrumental in fostering the involvement \n     of people who have lost a loved one to suicide in prevention \n     activities. I will also encourage them to come forward, break \n     the silence and join with other survivors as a way to promote \n     their healing.\n       As you know, our Foundation is actively organizing survivor \n     conferences across the country to be linked by satellite on \n     November 18. Working together with other private \n     organizations and pubic agencies, we will use this resolution \n     to expand the number of local survivor conferences \n     participating in National Survivors of Suicide Day.\n       We appreciate all you are doing to encourage and empower \n     survivors, and are grateful for your willingness to introduce \n     this important resolution. On behalf of millions of survivors \n     who want to prevent others from experiencing a similar loss, \n     as well as people throughout our country concerned about the \n     risk of suicide, thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Robert Gebbia,\n     Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/21/senate-section/article/S7454-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7454-S7455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 340--DESIGNATING DECEMBER 10, 2000, AS ``NATIONAL \n                       CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nCraig, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hollings, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Robb, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. \nVoinovich) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution \nwhich would designate December 10, 2000 as ``National Children's \nMemorial Day.''

The resolution would set aside this day to \nremember all the children who die in the United States each year. While \nI realize the families of these children deal with the grief of their \nloss every day, I would like to commemorate the lives of these children \nwith a special day as well.\n  If passed, this will be the third consecutive year we will have \ndesignated the second Sunday in December as ``National Children's \nMemorial Day.'' I have had many constituents share their heart-\nwrenching stories with me about the death of their son or daughter. I \nhave heard heroic stories of kids battling cancer or diabetes, and \ntragic stories of car accidents and drownings. Each of these families \nhas had their own experience, but they must all continue with their \nlives and deal with the incredible pain of losing a child.\n  The death of a child at any age is a shattering experience for a \nfamily.
