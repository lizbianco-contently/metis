The Senate will resume consideration of the \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Alan Greenspan, of New \nYork, to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem.\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I strongly support Alan Greenspan's \nnomination to a fourth term as Chairman of the Board of Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System. While Congress and the President continue \nto claim credit for our strong economy and projected budget surpluses, \none person truly deserves the nation's gratitude for this unprecedented \neconomic expansion--that is Alan Greenspan. His tenure has been a \nspectacular success.\n  Chairman Greenspan's decisions regarding monetary policy have helped \nlead us to low unemployment, low interest rates and the longest period \nof sustained economic growth in the nation's history. Given his \nremarkable record, it is easy to forget that circumstances have not \nalways been this good for him. Chairman Greenspan has also been tested \nby periods of adversity during his tenure at the Federal Reserve. \nImmediately following the October 1987 crash on Wall Street, Chairman \nGreenspan worked with money center banks to ensure that the brokerage \nfirms continued to have the liquidity necessary to calm both markets \nand investors. Even in times of adversity, his was a steady hand.\n  Last year, during debate on the financial modernization legislation, \nChairman Greenspan served as a crucial advisor to the Members of the \nConference Committee. He added indispensable expertise to enacting \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nthat will help maintain the competitiveness of our financial services \nindustry in a global economy while ensuring the safety and soundness of \nour financial markets.\n  Unfortunately, I will not be present for the full Senate vote on the \nChairman's nomination. I have the responsibility of leading a \nbipartisan congressional delegation to Wehrkunde, the annual world \nsecurity conference in Munich, Germany and to Moscow, where we are to \nmeet with acting Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n  I voted for Chairman Greenspan's nomination during the Banking \nCommittee's markup and would vote for his renomination before the full \nSenate had I been present. I urge all my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I strongly support Alan Greenspan's \nrenomination to Chair the Federal Reserve Board for a fourth term.\n  The United States is currently enjoying the longest period of \neconomic growth in our history, with price stability and record low \nunemployment. Welfare rolls have been dramatically reduced, and we have \nmore Americans in homes of their own and invested in the burgeoning \nstock market than ever before.\n  As Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for the past 12 years, Dr. \nGreenspan deserves no small amount of the credit for this unprecedented \ngrowth and prosperity. Chairman Greenspan has consistently steered \nAmerican monetary policy on a prudent and responsible course. He has \nwon the respect and confidence of policymakers, the financial services \nindustry and the American people. Indeed, we have witnessed that Alan \nGreenspan's words alone have the potential to trigger fluctuations on \nthe global markets. Commendably, Chairman Greenspan has also upheld a \nhigh standard of evenhanded, apolitical management of our nation's \nmoney supply. And last year, Chairman Greenspan played a critical \nleadership role in the passage of the Financial Services Modernization \nLaw to expand the market powers and competitiveness of our financial \ninstitutions, while lowering fees and promoting financial product \ninnovation to the benefit of all Americans.\n  And this strong economy has coincided with fiscal discipline on our \npart, rather than the deficit spending of the past. The Federal budget \nis balanced, and, this year, we will hopefully take continued steps to \nretire more of the $5 trillion national debt. As Chairman Greenspan has \nadvised, retiring the debt is one of the most important steps we can \ntake to promote continued economic growth and plan for the future \nfinancial challenges of the aging of the baby boomer generation. There \nis room for tax cuts. There is room to increase spending on important \ndomestic priorities, but debt reduction should remain a centerpiece of \nour economic agenda.\n  We can be confident that Alan Greenspan will continue providing vital \nleadership of monetary policy toward our common goal of keeping the \neconomy robust. Considering his past record and looking to the future, \nhe deserves reappointment, and I urge my colleagues to support his \nrenomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as Chairman of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\n  Mr. President, our economy has just completed its 107th month of \nexpansion--a record period of growth in peacetime or war in our Nation. \nOur economy is the marvel of the world, and for good reason. The \nunemployment rate is at a record low, and the Gross Domestic Product \ngrew at a rate of almost 6 percent in the second half of 1999.\n  Despite this low unemployment and high growth, factors that can \ntypically bring about strong inflation, inflation has been kept in \ncheck. Part of the reason for this is due to increases in productivity, \nwhich resulted in large part from the pro-growth economic policies of \nthe 1980s as well as stunning technological advances.\n  These technological advances are revolutionizing the way America does \nbusiness and are changing the face of our economy. Some are calling it \na ``new economy,'' because it seems to defy some of the conventional \nforces that shaped the economy in the past. Some are going so far as to \nsuggest that the economic cycle may be dead and that we do not need to \nworry as much about these old forces.\n  Now that the economy has surpassed all previous records of growth, \nthere are signs that it is perhaps overheating. Yesterday, the Federal \nOpen Market Committee and the Federal Reserve, under the leadership of \nChairman Greenspan, raised the federal funds and the discount rates as \na further measure to counter this possible overheating. Some are \ncriticizing these moves, saying they are unnecessary and that the ``new \neconomy'' does not need the same kind of restraint as did the old.\n  But, Mr. President, I would certainly be cautious about second-\nguessing the wisdom of Alan Greenspan. Over the past 13 years, Alan \nGreenspan has been the voice of steady reason and common sense for our \nmonetary policy. His policies have shown prescience, and his \nstewardship has been confident and strong. Chairman Greenspan has been \nthe voice of common sense that the financial markets listen to and \nrespect. I believe we are indeed fortunate to have had the services of \nChairman Greenspan over the past 13 years, and I commend the President \nfor reappointing him to this key post. I am greatly pleased and \nrelieved that he is willing to serve another term. We need his \nexperience. We need his wisdom. And we need his continuing steady hand \nat the helm of our monetary policy.\n  Whether or not we truly have a new economy that will continue to defy \ntraditional forces, I don't know. But I am very pleased that Alan \nGreenspan is here to guide us and I enthusiastically support his \nconfirmation and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm the nomination of \nAlan Greenspan to another term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board \nof Governors. While I continue to have some concerns about some of the \nday-to-day management of the Federal Reserve System, he has helped \nsustain a period of economic growth that few would have predicted a few \nyears ago.\n  Mr. President, when I first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1992, my \nhighest priority was reducing the Federal budget deficit. In 1992, that \ndeficit stood at $340 billion. This past fiscal year, we balanced the \nbudget. That is an enormous achievement, and it was due to the tough \nfiscal policies of Congress, particularly the 1993 deficit reduction \npackage, and Chairman Greenspan stewardship at the Federal Reserve. \nBoth were integral to our economy's growth and to the resulting \nimprovement in our budget picture, and I credit Chairman Greenspan for \nhis part in that effort.\n  I do want to make clear that I have some continuing concerns \nregarding the Federal Reserve, concerns that stem in part from a 1996 \nGeneral Accounting Office report which reviewed the Federal Reserve \nSystem. Noting that there were no strong external forces to minimize \nFederal Reserve costs, the report identified weaknesses in existing \noversight and budgetary processes which resulted in a number of \ntroubling issues. The GAO found a $4 billion cash reserve known as a \nSurplus Account that the Federal Reserve exempted from its policy of \nreturning all its net profits to the Treasury. The report found \nevidence from its policy of returning all its net profits to the \nTreasury. The report found evidence of inefficiencies and excessive \nspending, and specifically identified the construction of a Federal \nReserve Bank as well as overly generous travel, salaries, and employee \nbenefits.\n  The report noted at least one major instance, the construction of the \nDallas Federal Reserve Bank, in which the Federal Reserve missed an \nopportunity to save money, including the purchase of unnecessary land \nat the cost of $7 million.\n  The GAO also reported that some employees had home security systems \ninstalled by the Federal Reserve, costing from $2,500 to $8,000, while \nothers had home-to-work transportation using Federal Reserve vehicles. \nAnd the GAO found Federal Reserve travel expenses had risen by nearly \n67 percent between 1988 and 1994, from $28.5 million in 1988 to $47 \nmillion in 1994, compared to only 26 percent for the Federal \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, it should be noted that the Federal Reserve did \nrespond to the GAO findings by establishing annual audits of their \nReserve banks, and I credit that action.\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\n  Those annual audits have since been codified, along with annual \naudits of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve System by a \nprovision added to the financial modernization bill, the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act. That audit provision was added to the financial \nmodernization bill by the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) and the \nSenator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan). They have been vigilant on this \nmatter, and in fact they were the original requesters of the 1996 GAO \nreport.\n  The Reid-Dorgan audit requirements are an important step, and I am \ngreatly encouraged by it, but we should go further. I feel strongly \nthat we should ask the GAO to update its 1996 report on the Federal \nReserve, and hope Chairman Greenspan will join in such a request.\n  We cannot have a complete understanding of current management \npractices at the Fed until we hear from the GAO again on this matter, \nhowever, I am willing to give Chairman Greenspan the benefit of the \ndoubt. The audit requirements added to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act do \nrepresent an improvement, and I was encouraged by the modest step taken \nby the Fed in response to the 1996 GAO report.\n  Mr. President, I opposed this nomination four years ago, and I very \nmuch look forward to a needed update of the GAO audit of the Federal \nReserve. However, given his remarkable record in helping to sustain the \neconomic growth of the past several years and in the improvement in our \nbudget picture, I will vote to confirm Chairman Greenspan.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, a couple of days ago marked the longest \neconomic expansion in U.S. history: 107 months. Alan Greenspan deserves \ncredit for coordinating closely with the administration foster that \ngrowth.\n  Mr. Greespan has been described as a master of the art of monetary \npolicy. He has certainly learned and grown in office. His renomination \ndeserves our full support.\n  President Clinton renominated Chairman Greenspan for two reasons: Our \nunprecedented record of economic success; and his ability to coordinate \nFed monetary policy with our fiscal policy.\n  Those two reasons are, in fact, inseparable. It is the marriage of \nfiscal and monetary policy that created and has sustained current \neconomic expansion. This successful working partnership has worked \ndespite his being a lifelong Republican--though we would gladly welcome \nhim as a Democrat.\n  The best illustration of Mr. Greenspan's ability to coordinate \nclosely with administration is the 1993 economic plan. Mr. Greenspan \nsignaled that if the new President attacked the deficit aggressively, \nit would produce lower interest rates. The President followed that \nadvice. A Democratic Congress passed that plan.\n  As a result, we have gone from the biggest budget deficits in U.S. \nhistory to the biggest surplus. Largely as a result of the 1993 \neconomic plan, we now have the lowest interest rates since WWII. We \nhave created more than 20 million new jobs. Unemployment is at the \nlowest level in 30 years. The poverty rate is the lowest in two \ndecades. Homeownership is at an all-time high. Real wages have grown \nfaster and longer than at any time in more than two decades.\n  What is most remarkable is that we have achieved all of this while \nkeeping inflation under control: 2.7% inflation last year. It used to \nbe an article of faith among many conservative economists that you had \nto have at least 6% unemployment or you would trigger inflation. \nChairman Greesnpan had the courage to challenge that orthodoxy and \nprove it wrong. The result is millions of people are working today who \nwould not have had jobs under the old rules.\n  He has done so without sacrificing his commitment to taming inflation \nand has succeeded in maintaining record low inflation.\n  We should confirm Chairman Greenspan for a fourth term as Fed \nChairman. We should also continue to uphold our end of the partnership. \nWe have confidence Chairman Greenspan will continue to exercise strong \nmonetary leadership. We should commit ourselves to continuing to \nexercise strong fiscal discipline.\n  People sometimes find Chairman Greenspan's messages a little \ndifficult to decipher. They tend to look for shades of meaning in his \nstatements. But on the question of our national debt, he has been \nabsolutely clear and unequivocal. He has said over and over: We must \npay down the debt. Huge new tax cuts or excessive Government spending \ncould destroy our prosperity. He could not be clearer on that point.\n  We need to listen to Chairman Greenspan. Many inside this Congress--\nand outside--are now seizing on new surplus estimates from the \nCongressional Budget Office to justify massive new tax breaks. Their \nplans stand in direct contradiction to Chairman Greenspan's advice to \nus. Their plans represent a total abdication of the fiscal discipline \nthat has helped get us to this point.\n  Our best first use of the surplus is not to pay for an election-year \ntax cut. It is to pay down the debt. That will enable us to protect \nthis economic recovery today and protect Social Security and Medicare \ntomorrow.\n  We support tax cuts to help working families with real, pressing \nneeds like child care and college tuition. We support tax cuts to help \nworking families care for sick and aging relatives. We support \neliminating the marriage penalty tax.\n  The American people have made it clear that these are the kinds of \ntax cuts we should aim for: tax cuts that expand our prosperity, not \nundermine it; that help all Americans, not just a privileged few. We \nshould listen to them. But we also share Mr. Greenspan's view that the \nbest tax cut for America's families and businesses is to pay down the \ndebt. This year because of the progress we have made since 1993 in \neliminating the deficit and reducing the debt, the average American \nfamily will save: $2,000 on its mortgage; $200 on its car loan; and \n$200 more on student loans.\n  Shortly after it was clear the Asian ``flu''--the Asian monetary \ncrisis--had been successfully contained, Time magazine ran a cover \nstory. The picture on the cover showed Alan Greenspan and, standing \nbehind him, Bob Rubin and Larry Summers. The headline read: ``The \nCommittee that Saved the World: The inside story of how the Three \nMarketeers * * * prevented a global economic meltdown.''\n  That is strong praise and it is deserved. Chairman Greenspan, working \nwith this Administration, has earned our vote of confidence. I am proud \nto cast my vote in support of is renomination.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that this nomination is before us, \nand I am hopeful that we will see an overwhelming vote in favor of Alan \nGreenspan this morning. We have made remarkable progress in this \neconomy and in our country, in large measure because of the marriage \nbetween fiscal and monetary policy.\n  That monetary policy was created because of the leadership of \nChairman Greenspan. He has been a leader not only in creating monetary \npolicy but in setting the tone for this country as we make some \ndifficult choices in our fiscal policy.\n  He has said to all of us we need to be very prudent in making \ndecisions about how we spend our surplus, about how we manage our \nbudget, about the commitments we make to tax cuts we cannot afford, \nabout the importance of paying off the debt and bringing long-lasting \nfiscal responsibility by eliminating the public debt.\n  That kind of advice is advice we all ought to take. It is the kind of \nadvice that has given us the longest economic expansion in history. It \nis an expansion that ought to be continued for years and years to come. \nIt will if we follow the advice of Alan Greenspan. It will if we keep \nthis marriage of fiscal and monetary policy. It will if we pay off the \ndebt and do what we should to ensure the fiscal prudence we have \ndemonstrated in our budgets over the last couple of years.\n  I very enthusiastically endorse this nomination and hope that on a \nbipartisan basis we can provide the kind of vote of confidence this \nChairman deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

I think the Senate has done exactly what it should have \ndone, which is overwhelmingly approve the nomination of the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board. He has been in that position for 13 years \nand has guided our country on a very even keel while going through an \neconomy that could have been volatile but because of his leadership has \nnot been.

Mr. President, today, for the next 30 minutes, we are \ngoing to talk about a subject that I think perhaps is the highest \npriority we have in Congress, and that is to correct a terrible \ninequity in the tax laws of our country--a penalty that we exact on \nmarried couples.\n  You may ask, penalty on married couples? Are you serious? Well, the \nfact is, yes, I am serious. The Tax Code, over the years, has not kept \nup with what has happened in our country demographically, which is that \nover 64 percent of the married couples in this country today have two \nincomes; both spouses work outside the home, in addition to working \ninside the home. The Tax Code has not caught up to treating them fairly \nwhen they get married. In fact, what has happened is that we have not \nincreased the standard deduction to be double for a two-income-earning \ncouple; nor have we expanded the tax brackets for a two-income-earning \ncouple. So if you take the example of a schoolteacher and a sheriff's \ndeputy or a policeman, one of whom makes $27,000 a year, the other of \nwhom makes $31,000 a year, they will pay an extra $717 in taxes just \nbecause they got married.\n  Now, generally, this is a young couple who is getting married, who \nneed the extra money now more than ever. It is a couple who want to buy \ntheir first home, want to have their first child, want to buy the extra \ncar they will need to fulfill their responsibilities. But, in fact, we \ntake money away from their ability to fulfill their hopes and dreams.\n  Americans should not have to choose between love and money and, most \ncertainly, the Government should not encourage this. We need to have \npolicies that encourage marriage, encourage families.\n  I read an interesting article recently pointing out that marriage is \none of the key factors in determining poverty. One in three poor \nfamilies is headed by an unmarried parent. In contrast, 1 in 20 married \ncouples are considered to be in poverty. So being married is one of the \nfactors in people being able to lift themselves out of poverty. So, of \ncourse, knowing this, we should be even more attuned to this inequity.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 21 million married \ncouples are paying this penalty; that is, 42 million Americans are \npaying a higher tax because they are married. This tax hits hardest \nthose couples with two incomes. Two-thirds of those married couples, \nthat have two incomes, will pay a tax penalty simply for being married. \nThese couples are paying an average of $1,400 more; that is $29 billion \nin taxes being sent to Washington--money which our Treasury should not \nbe receiving--$29 billion in money just because people are married and \nnot single.\n  Why are many people working? In many instances, it is because of the \nincredibly high tax burden. We have the highest tax burden since World \nWar II on families in this country. Nearly 40 percent of the income \nfamilies earn goes straight to the tax collector. How can we solve this \nproblem? We can start by increasing the standard deduction for married \ncouples from $7,200 to $8,600. This would make it exactly double what \nis available to single taxpayers.\n  Senator Ashcroft, Senator Brownback, and myself have introduced \nlegislation to do exactly this. That should be our very first step. In \nfact, that is exactly what the Congress passed last year and sent to \nthe President, but he vetoed it. It was part of a balanced tax package \nthat would have put $790 billion back in the pockets of the taxpayers \nof this country. But the President chose to veto that legislation.\n  This same legislation was introduced this week by Congressman Archer, \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee on the House side. His \nlegislation would increase the standard deduction in 2001 for married \ncouples to twice the rate applicable to singles.\n  The second thing we can do is to widen the tax bracket for married \ncouples so that it is twice the size of the corresponding bracket for \nsingles.\n  Let me give you an example.\n  A married couple is taxed at the 15-percent rate up to $43,350 in \nincome. But if two single people make the same salary, they could be \ntaxed at 15 percent on income up to $50,700. That means $7,350 is taxed \njust because people are married.\n  We need to change this policy. Senator Ashcroft, Senator Brownback, \nand myself have introduced a bill that would adjust every bracket so \nthat married couples would not pay a penalty. They would not go into \nhigher tax brackets just because they are married.\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\n If one person makes $20,000 a year, and another makes $55,000 a year, \nthey should pay taxes on what they earned, not putting it together and \npenalizing them by making the entire $20,000 that is earned by one \nspouse to be taxed at the higher 28-percent bracket of the other \nspouse.\n  This week, Congressman Archer introduced legislation that would widen \nthe 15-percent bracket. This is clearly the right direction. But I also \nwant to make sure we don't forget those people in the 28-percent \nbracket. They get hit hard by the marriage penalty as well. The people \nwho move up to the 28-percent bracket when they are earning the 15-\npercent bracket salaries should not pay that penalty. That is what we \nare trying to correct.\n  Senator Ashcroft, Senator Brownback, and I have introduced this \nlegislation for 3 straight years. We have tried to get the President to \nsign tax relief for our married taxpayers.\n  Yesterday, the House Ways and Means Committee reported legislation \nout, and it will be considered on the House floor next week. This is a \ngreat step forward. It is a step in the right direction. I commend \nChairman Archer for acting so quickly.\n  I hope we can pass a balanced tax bill this year. I hope we can make \nthe linchpin of that bill the marriage tax penalty relief.\n  But that is not the only tax relief that our people in this country \ndeserve, and the working families deserve. They also deserve tax \ncredits for education expenses, and tax credits for caring for elderly \nparents, which is becoming a bigger problem--a bigger issue--as our \npopulation is aging.\n  We want to make sure small businesses and farmers and ranches don't \nhave to be broken up because of the inheritance tax.\n  We want to try to make sure we have capital gains tax reductions so \nthat people will be encouraged to invest in our country to help spur \nour economy forward.\n  We have a lot of wage earners who will be coming into our economic \nsystem. We want to make sure we can absorb them. The way we can do this \nis by creating new jobs. The way you create new jobs is to invest in \ncapital.\n  I want a balanced, good tax cut bill. I want to say very clearly that \nwe are not talking about taking the entire surplus and giving it back \nto the taxpayers of our country. We have bifurcated our surplus. We \nhave said that trillion dollar plus in surplus funds that belongs to \nSocial Security is going to stay in Social Security, so that will \nalways be there. It will be part of a trust fund, and Social Security \nwill be safe forever.\n  What we are talking about is an income tax withholding surplus. This \nis the surplus that people have sent to Washington in income taxes--not \nSocial Security taxes. We are talking about taking approximately one-\nthird of the income tax withholding surplus and giving it back to the \npeople who sent it to Washington because it is very clear that if we \ndon't give it back to the people who sent too much, it will sit here \nand it will eventually go away. There is nothing like the creativity of \nthe Federal Government when it comes to spending more money.\n  Mr. President, we want to give people the bonus they have sent to the \nFederal Government back. We want them to make the decisions for their \nchildren about how they are going to spend the money they earned that \nbelongs to them. That is the bonus they deserve.\n  We are going to make marriage tax penalty relief the linchpin of our \nbalanced tax cut plan, and we are going to put in capital gains tax \nrelief and inheritance tax relief and relief for people who are sending \ntheir children to college, or perhaps to a private school that has a \nhuge tuition fee. That is very difficult for the family to absorb.\n  Sometimes when I talk to my friends and people who I meet in airports \nand in cities I visit, the second spouse is working for education \nexpenses for their children, or for the expense of caring for an \nelderly parent. We want to help them.\n  I think we can get a balanced tax cut for the working people of this \ncountry that will give them the relief they deserve because they sent \nmore money to Washington than we need for the services we must cover.\n  I am very proud that I have two cosponsors who have worked so \ndiligently with me to try to keep this issue in the forefront of issues \nthe Senate will address. Senator Ashcroft from Missouri and Senator \nBrownback from Kansas have been cosponsors of my legislation every time \nwe have tried to push it through. Last year, we won. But the President \nsaid no. We are coming back until we win this for the married couples \nof this country so they get the money they earned in their pocketbooks \nto decide what is best for their families--not somebody in Washington, \nDC, they have never met making that decision for them.\n  I am proud Senator Brownback is here to talk about how this affects \nfamilies in Kansas, his home State. And later I am hoping Senator \nAshcroft will be able to also come and talk about the legislation we \nhave tried so hard to push through, and which I hope this year will be \nthe one that we see the victory for the hard-working people of our \ncountry.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison, in this effort yet again. We are going to keep \npushing this ball up the hill until we get it over. I think this is the \nyear we will get that done--to finally do away with this marriage \npenalty that impacts nearly 21 million American families in a very \nadverse and a terrible way--and an awful signal it sends to the married \ncouples: Well, if you are going to get married, that is fine, but we \nare going to tax you for it.\n  I think if there is one thing we ought to try to figure out, it is \nhow not to tax the institution of marriage, which is in so much \ntrouble. And there is so much pressure in this country already. The \nlast thing it needs is more pressure by the taxation system, the Tax \nCode.\n  This is the year for us to be able to get this done.\n  I hope at the end of the day we can put together the marriage penalty \nand the estate tax, which is another family tax--particularly in my \nState with family farmers and small businesses--and pass a family tax \ncut bill of those two items, send it through, pass it by the House, and \nput it on the President's desk and ask him: Mr. President, please sign \nthis on behalf of the working families of this country to be able to \nmaintain these businesses, farms, and these marriages--that all of us \nought to be strongly supporting and working with.\n  It is interesting that the marriage penalty currently affects almost \n50 percent of America's families. Fifty percent of America's families \nare impacted negatively by the marriage penalty today. On average--this \nis an old figure. People have heard this one but it is true, and it is \nso stark--they pay an additional $1,400 in taxes. You have 50 percent \nof married couples in America impacted by this tax and on average \npaying $1,400 a year more for the pleasure and the privilege in America \nto be married. It is a terrible signal and bad policy. This is the year \nto do away with it.\n  It is critically important that during this second session of the \n106th Congress we take the steps finally to eliminate the marriage \npenalty and alleviate its impact on our working families in this \ncountry.\n  I applaud the work of Chairman Archer over in the House in advance of \nhis proposal to double the standard deduction and widen the 15-percent \nbracket and to adjust the earned-income tax credit in order to \nalleviate the impact of the marriage penalty for America's working \nfamilies. His proposal is an important first step in our effort to rid \nour Tax Code of this onerous penalty to our families.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office has announced that the expected on-\nbudget surplus--I want to make this clear; it is the on-budget surplus; \nit is not Social Security--for this fiscal year is $233 billion. \nClearly, we have the funds available on budget to do this tax cut and \nto start it this year. We need to begin by making an investment in \nAmerica's families. Using the on-budget surplus to rid the Tax Code of \nthis unfair tax is one way to make such an investment. We clearly have \nthe funds to do this for both the marriage penalty and the estate tax, \nstarting this year and phasing that out over a period of 5 years.\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\n  The Government should not use the coercive power of the Tax Code to \nerode the foundation of our society--working families. We should quit \nincentivizing that erosion resulting from this taxation. Normally in \nthe Tax Code we try to encourage work; we try to encourage families; we \ntry to encourage good things. Yet these are two areas where we are \ndiscouraging two of our greatest things. One is the creation of \nfamilies--good, strong, healthy families that are absolutely critical \nfor vibrant societies. The second is working families, so they do not \nhave what they labor for stolen from them by the taxation system upon \ndeath, so they can pass it on to their heirs, so they can hold the farm \ntogether.\n  Some years ago I was an extension specialist for Kansas State \nUniversity, and I worked with farm couples who were facing two facts of \nlife at that point in time. One I was hoping we could get rid of. One \nwas that they were all going to die. The second was they were very \nfearful they would have to break the farm up, rather than being able to \npass it on to a son or daughter to farm as an intact unit; they were \ngoing to have to break it up to pay a portion of the estate taxes.\n  These were good, hard-working people who worked all of their lives. \nBecause they were frugal and saved and poured the money back into the \nfarm, bought farmland, bought equipment, didn't go out and live \nluxuriously and take lots of vacations--they stayed there and worked \nand saved, all of which are laudable things for which we should be \napplauding them--here were people I was working with, couple after \ncouple, saying: We just really want to have our son be able to farm, or \nour daughter and son-in-law be able to farm, but if we break this farm \nup they are not going to be able to have an economical-size unit. They \nare going to have to work in town and subsidize the farm because \nfarming is a very capital intensive operation; it takes a lot of \ncapital and there is very little return on the investment. We are \nafraid we will have to break the farm up to pay the estate taxes, so \nour son or daughter will not be able to farm.\n  They worked hard and saved and we are going to tax them so they have \nto break up the farm.\n  I worked with a whole bunch of other family farmers who said they \nwould organize around this estate tax. They would go and work setting \nup a trust, a limited partnership, starting a gifting program here. So \nwe have organized five different units to be able to break the assets \nup so they could get it to the next generation with a minimal amount of \ntax.\n  That is a very uneconomical thing to do. Lawyers make money; \naccountants make money doing that. For farming, it is a bad thing to do \nbecause you are breaking your economical unit up into five and trying \nto figure it out, focusing so much on avoiding taxes rather than the \nprofitability of the farm. It is ridiculous but it is the policy of the \nUnited States.\n\n  We now have people basically paying as much to get around paying \nestate taxes as they pay in estate taxes. But that is only the \napparent, on-the-surface costs. It says nothing about the economic \ncost--what happens to that farm and small business by focusing so much \ntime on tax reduction rather than how do I run this business. How do I \ntry to remain profitable when we have wheat prices the way they are \ntoday? Instead, I am focusing on how do I hold my capital together.\n  It is a very counterproductive tax. We have the opportunity, the \nresources, the wherewithal, and the will this year to do two things: \neliminate the marriage penalty and eliminate the estate tax. We should \nput them together as a family tax cut package and get it done. It sends \ngood signals to our families; they need a good signal. Marriage in \nAmerica has enough difficulty without the penalty from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I wish to give you a statistic from Rutgers University, a study they \ndid about marriage being in the state of decline it is today. From 1960 \nto 1996, the annual number of marriages per 1,000 adult women declined \nby almost 43 percent, a precipitous falloff in the number of people \ngetting married in a period of about 36 years. At the same time that \nfewer adults are getting married, far more young adults are cohabiting. \nIn fact, between 1960 and 1998, virtually the same period, the number \nof unwed cohabiting couples increased by 1,000 percent. We gave them a \ntax subsidy for doing that. We taxed the married people. Is that the \nproper signal for Government to send?\n  When marriage as an institution breaks down, children suffer. The \npast few decades have seen a huge increase in out-of-wedlock births--we \nare at nearly 30 percent of our population born to single mothers--and \ndivorce, the combination of which has substantially undermined the \nwell-being of children in virtually all areas of life: physical and \npsychological health, socialization, academic achievement, and even in \nthe likelihood of suffering physical abuse.\n  That is not to say some single parents do not struggle heroically to \nraise children. They do, and many get it done. It is simply to say it \nis far more difficult, and the numbers are bearing that out for us as a \nsociety that this is a very difficult thing to do, and has an enormous \nsocial cost in the aggregate associated with it.\n  Study after study has shown that children do best when they grow up \nin a stable home, raised by two parents who are committed to each other \nthrough marriage. It should not take studies to tell us that. That is \nbasic common sense and the experience we have. Newlyweds face enough \nchallenges without paying punitive damages in the form of a marriage \ntax. Think of that. It really is basically punitive damages. If you get \nmarried, we are going to sock you with punitive damages in the amount \nof $1,400 a year. The last thing the Federal Government should do is \npenalize the institution that is the foundation of a civil society. We \nmust eliminate the marriage penalty.\n  The surging surplus is a result of nonpayroll tax receipts. In other \nwords, the surplus is really a tax overpayment to the Government--\npersonal income and capital gains taxes. We must give the American \npeople the growth rebate they deserve and return this overpayment in \nthe form of the marriage penalty elimination and the estate tax \nelimination. We can. We should start now. I believe we must do it for a \nhealthy society, for a healthy married society, for a healthy family \nsociety, for a healthy economical society, for small businesses and \nfamily farms. To rid the American people of the marriage tax penalty \nand the estate tax is something we can and we should do this year.\n\n  I am delighted Senator Hutchison from Texas continues this fight; \nthat Senator Ashcroft from Missouri has been one of the leaders in this \nfight. You can start to taste victory. It is going to be a tough fight. \nClearly, there is not an excuse not to do it this year. We are starting \nearly. We have the resources. The American people want us to do this. \nWe need to send this signal to a society which is asking us: Where are \nthe values in society? Where is the morality?\n  We need to rebuild the civil society. These are enormously positive \nmessages and notes we can send by doing this.\n  With that, I call on my colleagues, all, to vote for these proposals. \nDo it together in a family tax cut and eliminate these two taxes.\n  I yield the floor to my good friend and colleague from the State of \nMissouri. He has been a leader for many years on rebuilding civil \nsociety. Here is one more area and effort he is leading, in working for \nthe elimination of this marriage penalty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am delighted to have the opportunity \nto commend the House for beginning to move through its process, \nspecifically the House Ways and Means Committee, the Marriage Tax \nPenalty Relief Act of the year 2000.\n  I am delighted that my colleagues in the Senate, including Senator \nBrownback of Kansas and Senator Hutchison of Texas, have been so \naggressive in talking about what this tax means to America.\n  Almost all of us realize that if you tax something, you get less of \nit, and if you give something a subsidy, you get more of it. It occurs \nto me that we do not need less marriage, less family, and fewer intact \nhouseholds in America. We need strong, durable, lasting families\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\nthat reflect the kind of commitments for which marriage really stands.\n  It is possible for people to be committed to each other without the \nformal institution of marriage, but the data indicates that possibility \ndoes not find its way into reality very often. Marriage is not \nsomething that is against the interests of America. Marriage is \nsomething that is advancing the interests of America because it is in \nour homes and in our durable, lasting, persistent relationships, loving \nrelationships, that we teach the fundamental values so important to \nthis culture--values of responsibility, values of work and, yes, values \nof caring. We learn that we have responsibility and duty to each other. \nIf someone in our family is in trouble, our first turn is not outside \nthe family to get help; we first turn toward each other to help. One of \nthe greatest values any culture can have is learning how to care one \nfor another, and it happens in our families.\n  I plan to talk for a few minutes today about a real problem we have \nin this country, and that is that our Tax Code is at war with some of \nthe fundamental values and attributes and characteristics in our \nculture. I think it is wrong for our Government to be attacking the \nvery institution in society which provides the best support for what we \notherwise achieve governmentally. Someone far more wise than I said it \nfirst when they said the family is the best department of social \nservices, the family is the best department of education, the family is \nthe best department of health and welfare. One would think if the \nfamily were doing this job and doing it well and relieving Government \nof its backstopping responsibility in these places, we would want to \nencourage the family; we would want to support it; we would want to \nsustain it; we would want to provide incentives for it rather than a \npenalty.\n  That is the thing that confounds us--that we are providing a penalty. \nSome great industrialist once said: Your system is perfectly designed \nto give you what you are getting, basically saying if you are not \ngetting what you want, you should change your system.\n  Senator Brownback eloquently cited the data. We are not getting what \nwe want. We are getting fewer marriages instead of more marriages. We \nare getting less durability in these relationships instead of more. \nLook at the reason for the family breakups we have, and almost every \nsociological study says at the heart of it is the financial stress in \nthe family.\n  What is Government doing in regard to marriage and stress that \nfinancially threatens and sometimes disrupts those marriages? It is \nadding to the stress instead of relieving the stress. Forty-two percent \nof all married couples suffer a marriage penalty, meaning the \nGovernment taxes them more for being married than they would be paying \nif they were not married.\n  We have already heard the data, and I do not think it is important to \nhave the data, but it is there: About $1,400 per couple per year on \naverage for the 21 million couples who suffer this $29 billion a year \ndisadvantage imposed by Government against the very institution that \nshould carry us into this next century.\n\n  When the House Ways and Means Committee marked up the Marriage Tax \nPenalty Relief Act, they were simply saying it is time for us to start \npeace negotiations; stop the war between Government and families; let's \nstart having incentives for helping families. At least let us have a \nneutral environment so we do not have a situation where families are \ndiscriminated against by the Tax Code of the United States.\n  In my home State of Missouri, there are 1 million potential marriage \ntax victims because of family standing. According to the Treasury \nDepartment, 42 percent--over 4 out of every 10 married couples--pay a \npenalty for being married. I find that to be a tragedy.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, an American family spends more of \nits family budget on taxes than on health care, food, clothing, and \nshelter combined. When you say this is the kind of tax bite the \nAmerican family is paying--it pays more for Government than health \ncare, food, clothing, and shelter combined --Government is taking a big \nbite. It is taking a big bite from every citizen. Then add to that a \nGovernment penalty, a financial stigma imposed, saying we are going to \ntax you more because you are married than you would pay otherwise. This \nis wrong. It is simply that we have found a way, unfortunately, to get \nadditional resources for Government at the expense of resources to the \nfamily.\n  In some measure, this really calls upon us to ask ourselves where our \nfaith is for the future of America. What do we believe will sustain \nAmerica in the future? Is it going to be big Government or will it be \nstrong families? Will it be a culture that teaches responsibility, \nduty, compassion, and caring, one for another, or will it be a massive \nGovernment? If we really believe families are irrelevant, we should \ntake more and more of their money and pour it into the bureaucracy. But \nI do not believe bureaucracies are the hope of America or of the world \ntomorrow.\n  Responsible citizenship, the kinds of values that are engendered in \nfamilies, these are the elements of America's future. These are the \nbright lights that allow us to believe the best is yet to come, and we \nshould stop eroding the funding for families by giving it all to \nGovernment.\n  If our faith is in families, we should help families. How do we help \nfamilies? The first thing we do is let them keep some of the money they \nearn. Penalizing families is the wrong way to go about that. \nUnfortunately, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers announced on Tuesday \nthat he will advise the President to oppose the House bill, less than 1 \nweek after the President announced his support for marriage penalty tax \nrelief.\n  The marriage penalty may actually contribute to one of society's most \nserious and enduring problems. There are now twice as many single-\nparent households in America as there were when this penalty was first \nenacted. I cannot say it is a cause, but it is hard to believe it is \nnot a contributor. In our Government policies, we should not be \nintensifying the problems; we should be eliminating the problems and \nmitigate the damages they cause.\n  Our Government should uphold the basic values that give strength and \nvitality to our communities and to our culture. Sound families do that, \nand the science which supports that proposition is sound and complete \nand uncontradicted. Marriage and family are a cornerstone of who we are \nand what we stand for as a civilization, but the heavy hand of \nGovernment which imposes a penalty against marriage distorts the system \nand lacks the fairness we want in the tax system, and, frankly, it \nundermines our potential for the kind of future that good families, \nallowed to reserve some of their resources for their own use and \ndevelopment, could provide.\n\n  It is with that in mind that I commend the House for its action, and \nI look forward to the day when we in the Senate can do what we almost \ngot done last year. We did it in the Senate. We had a major tax relief \nfor the American family through the abolition or mitigation of the \nmarriage penalty tax, sponsored by Senator Hutchison of Texas, Senator \nBrownback of Kansas, and I was privileged to be a cosponsor. It went to \nthe President and was vetoed in the overall tax package.\n  This concept the President has endorsed, which I think America \nunderstands, to bring parity to families so they are not discriminated \nagainst, because they are a part of the enduring, lasting, persistent, \nvaluable relationship of marriage, is a concept whose time has come.\n  I am grateful for the action taken by the House and look forward to \nthe opportunity of implementing, otherwise enhancing, that relief for \nAmerican families in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri and the distinguished Senator from Kansas for joining me today \nto talk about this very important issue.\n  The House is getting ready to take action. We have spoken once on \nthis issue. We have taken the lead to give relief to the hard-working \ntaxpayers of our country. We do not think people should have to choose \nbetween having the money they earn to spend for their families or \nsending it to Washington, when it is already in excess because we have \nincome tax withholding surpluses.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senators Ashcroft and Brownback on \nthis\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\nissue. We will not give up. We will not walk away from this issue. \nBefore we leave the Senate, the married people of this country will be \ntreated equally by the IRS Code across the board. It is our \nresponsibility, and we will not walk away from it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I want to talk on the issue of agriculture \nand rural America, and the administration's proposal announced by \nSecretary Glickman yesterday for improving the farm safety net.\n  At the outset, I am pleased that the administration has recognized \nthat the Freedom to Farm bill has failed. The proposal the \nadministration came up with is an impetus for change, and I think it \nwill do a good deal to remedy the shortcomings of the Freedom to Farm \nbill.\n  I think the administration proposals of yesterday are a good step \nforward. I will go through a number of those. However, I want to \nforewarn my colleagues, while I think there is a lot in the \nadministration's proposal that is good and positive and moves us ahead, \nI believe there are some shortcomings in it also.\n  First, on the conservation end, I believe the administration's \nproposal is a good step forward. It has some very positive features. \nThe administration is proposing, for example, that we extend the \nconservation reserve program by 3.6 million acres up to 40 million \nacres. I believe that is a good proposal. That will do a lot to help \nconserve land and water and take some land out of production. It will \nhelp our wildlife. I think this is a good step.\n  There is a proposal for $600 million for the conservation security \nprogram. This is a program that is designed after a bill I authored to \nset up a conservation security program whereby farmers and ranchers \ncould, on a voluntary basis, carry out certain conservation measures on \ntheir land, and then they would receive payments for doing so. This \nprogram would be administered by the Natural Resources Conservation \nService. Again, this is fully voluntary, but it is another means \nwhereby farmers could, by engaging in certain conservation practices, \nshore up their income.\n  The wetland reserve program has a cap right now of 975,000 acres. The \nadministration would enroll an additional 210,000 acres in 2001 and \nanother 250,000 acres in each subsequent year--again, a very positive \nstep forward, to enroll land in the wetland reserve program.\n  There are several other conservation proposals: new funding for the \nfarmland protection program, the wildlife habitat incentives program, \nand the environmental quality incentives program. All of these are \nextremely good measures that will both help conservation but also \nimprove farm income.\n  The risk management provisions are positive. The administration is \nproposing about $640 million for a premium discount program for farmers \nand ranchers who take buy-up levels of crop insurance. That would help \nthem reduce the cost and get better coverage. The administration also \nis proposing $100 million annually to develop a policy that covers \nmultiyear losses. In places such as North Dakota, South Dakota, some \nparts of Minnesota, and others, we have had areas where they have had \n3, 4, 5 years of drought, floods, crop disease or other damaging \nconditions. We need a risk management program that covers those \nmultiyear losses. I am glad to see the administration taking a step to \naddress this problem in the budget.\n  The administration is also proposing to establish a pilot program for \ninsuring livestock. Currently there is no such insurance program. I \nhear a lot from livestock producers in Iowa that there should be some \nform of a risk management program, an insurance program for livestock \nproduction. Half of all our farm receipts come from livestock or \nlivestock products. The administration is proposing a pilot program of \n$100 million annually to provide livestock producers with some form of \nprice protection. I believe that is another good provision in the \nadministration's proposal.\n  There is another area I am very pleased to see the administration \naddressing. That is using $130 million in the next couple of years to \nestablish new cooperative development programs to provide equity \ncapital for new livestock and other processing cooperatives. This \nproposal would address concerns about market concentration by \nencouraging new entrants into the livestock processing market. It would \nalso provide an additional source of income for farmers through the \nownership of value-added processing. This is key. We have to help \nfarmers to form more cooperatives, both for the marketing of their \ngrains and livestock and also to develop value-added processing plants \nand enterprises that would help farmers obtain more of the value added \nto the livestock and crops they produce. Again, this is a good \nproposal.\n\n  The administration is proposing to develop a new bioenergy program to \nencourage greater use of farm products for production of biofuels. \nAgain, by supporting ethanol and other bioenergy feedstocks, we can use \nsome of our land, perhaps even some of our conservation land, to \nproduce energy sources such as switch grass, which can then be used to \ngenerate energy. We have a project ongoing in Iowa right now that will \ndo that so we can use land set aside in the conservation reserve \nprogram. We can grow products such as switch grass. We can cut that \nswitch grass and burn it for energy. So we get conservation, plus the \nfarmer will get some additional income, plus it will cut down on our \nneed for imported energy into this country. I am delighted the \nadministration is moving ahead on that.\n  Lastly, the area I am concerned about with the administration's \nproposal is sort of the heart and soul of it, which is farm income \nsupport. Again, the administration recognizes that we need some kind of \ncountercyclical type of support. That is true. That is what we need. \nThat is what Freedom to Farm does not provide. It does not provide an \nadequate safety net. It does not provide for countercyclical help. \nNevertheless, the administration proposal misses the mark. They are \nproposing that under this program they are going to have supplemental \ngovernment payments, in addition to the AMTA payments under Freedom to \nFarm, to eligible producers if projected gross income for the crop \nfalls below 92 percent\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nof the preceding 5-year average. Gross income would include gross \nmarket revenues for the crop plus government payments, including AMTA \npayments, marketing loans, and loan deficiency payments.\n  That is where I have a problem with the administration's proposal. \nFirst of all, they are going to use a 5-year average. That is fine. But \nwhat are they using? They are using gross income over 5 years. They are \nthrowing into the gross income all of the government payments, loan \ndeficiency payments, marketing loan gains, everything. Farm income \nshould not be looked upon as government payments. Farm income ought to \ncome from the marketplace. That is where the farmer ought to get a \nbetter share of the marketing dollar. If you are going to use gross \nincome for 5 years, what about the farmer's costs? Seed goes up in \nprice; fertilizers go up; fuel costs are sky-rocketing; machinery and \nequipment continue to go up. And, thanks to the Federal Reserve System, \ninterest rates are going up. So if you are just going to take gross \nincome over the last 5 years and not take into account the cost to the \nfarmer, you are already downgrading the net income farmers get.\n  A farmer can tell you--I don't care how much gross income they get--\nthey have to know what their bottom line is. You might say a farmer has \na gross income of $100,000. That sounds great. But you add up all the \ncosts of feed, seed, fertilizer, machinery, fuel, equipment, interest \nrates and the like; if his costs are $92,000, the farmer has made \n$8,000. That is what we are seeing happening out there. To use gross \nincome over 5 years, I think, is inadequate, ineffective, illogical, \nand not in the best interest of trying to get net income up to farmers.\n  That is what I am interested in--net income. I don't care about gross \nincome. I want to know what the net income of farmers is. What are they \ngoing to have left afterward to put away for a rainy day, to help their \nbottom line, to help put their kids through school, to keep a roof \noverhead, to help buy some better machinery in the future, to help \nprovide for their retirement, to pay off their land costs? This is what \nwe ought to be thinking about.\n  I am disappointed that the administration would use gross income over \n5 years and average it out that way. Again, that is better than the \nFreedom to Farm bill, which is fixed and declining payments based upon \nacreages and yields from 20 years ago. That is totally illogical. So is \nthis better than Freedom to Farm? Yes, a little bit, but it still \nshortchanges farmers. Quite frankly, I think we are going to have to \nmodify that. I am disappointed, I must say, in the administration for \nusing gross income figures over 5 years. That is not the right way to \nbase the income support.\n  Again, they have tried to target the payments to family-size farms. I \nam all for that principle, and, quite frankly, the way they have \nfigured it, most of the income support would go to the bulk of the \nfarmers who need the help. I won't get into the mechanics of that, but \nit basically looks that way at this point. The idea of sending the bulk \nof the support to family farms who need the help is good, but they are \nbasing it over income of 5 years--gross income--and farmers would be \ngetting shortchanged.\n  Secondly, the administration, in establishing and sort of outlining \nand coming up with this program, said in their release:\n\n       Rising crop surpluses, continued low prices and declining \n     incomes will contribute to increasing farm financial stress \n     in 2000, indicating a need for further Federal assistance. \n     However, added assistance should not be made in the form of \n     emergency legislation with the bulk of the payments in the \n     form of Agricultural Market Transition Act payments. That \n     approach, taken the past two years, is not in the best \n     interests of farmers and taxpayers, as the assistance is ad \n     hoc and ineffectively targeted.\n\n  Well, that is partially true--certainly about the AMTA payments. \nListen to this again:\n\n       Rising crop surpluses, continued low prices, and declining \n     incomes will contribute to increasing farm financial stress \n     in 2000, indicating a need for further Federal assistance.\n\n  There is nothing in their program--the administration's proposal--\nthat will tend to reduce crop surpluses. A little bit of the land taken \nout for the CRP, or WRP, that is fine. That is mostly marginal land \nanyway. But there is nothing in here that will tend to get our \nsurpluses down and thus, increase the market price, or the price \nfarmers get when they sell their crops. That is the problem.\n  It seems to me that the administration has sort of bought into the \nidea that we are going to plant fence row to fence row, we are going to \ncontinue to produce everything we can produce--the sky is the limit--\nand we are going to come in with some kind of targeted Federal \nassistance. On the one hand, I believe we do need some Federal \nassistance. On the other hand, we need to get out of the mindset we are \nin; we need to have a different mindset, one which says we can shape \nprograms that will help get the surpluses down and thus increase the \nprice at the farm gate.\n  I would hope that we can put some money into a shorter-term reserve \nprogram, something that would be 2 years, or maybe a 3-year program, to \nfacilitate taking some land out of production and putting it into \nconservation use for a while. I am talking about land we will not get \ninto the 10-year CRP. Farmers will not tie up relatively productive \nland by agreeing to take it out for 10 years. You can't pay them enough \nto do it. But I believe they will take some land out in this period of \nvery low commodity prices for maybe 2 years. That should help alleviate \nthe surpluses and improve market prices. I would think we would have a \ntarget of saying we want to enroll a certain number of acres in a \nshort-term program, which would tend to get some of our surpluses down. \nSo I hope we can come up with the funding to attract land into a \nshorter-term reserve or paid set-aside program.\n\n  Lastly, there is nothing in the administration's proposal that will \nprovide farmers the assistance they need to store grain so they can \nmarket their grain in a more orderly fashion. The Farmer Owned Reserve \nwas taken away by the Freedom to Farm bill. It was one of the best \nprograms we ever had. Right now, farmers harvest grain and they can put \nit under loan for a time, but there are no storage payments. And then \nthey have to sell their crops even if the price is very low. Well, we \nneed a program for on-farm storage, where they can store it at the farm \nor in an elevator, but the payments ought to go to the farmers.\n  There is nothing in the administration's proposal that would do that. \nNow, there is a provision--and I haven't looked at it that closely--\nwhich says:\n\n       Using existing authorities to implement a new on-farm \n     storage loan program to facilitate farmers' marketing \n     opportunities.\n\n  Well, I don't know exactly what that is, a loan program. I am talking \nabout storage payments to farmers, which we had before, and not some \nkind of a loan program just for the facilities. So I think while there \nare some good things in their proposal in terms of the conservation \nprograms that are in there, the new amount of money for cooperatives, \nto encourage cooperatives for marketing--I ask unanimous consent for \nanother 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is a good proposal in there on the bioenergy. But \nwhen you get to the heart of it, and what we are going to do to get \naway from this mindset of the Government supplying the income to the \nfarmers--that is the heart of what the problem is--and get to the \nmindset of how do we get the prices up at the farm gate, this is where \nthe administration's proposal falls short. I am hopeful as we move \nahead we can convince the administration to get off of that mindset, to \nprovide for perhaps some increased loan rates for farmers, to provide \nfor storage payments to farmers, and to provide for a shorter-term paid \nset-aside program. Again, as the administration said in their proposal:\n\n       Rising crop surpluses, continued low prices, and declining \n     incomes will contribute to increasing farm financial stress \n     in 2000, indicating a need for further Federal assistance.\n\n  We have to get off of that mindset. We have rising surpluses. Well, \nlet's get them down and provide for the kind of programs that will get \nthe surpluses down. Continued low prices--get those low prices back up \nat the farm gate--that is the mindset we have to get on, and I hope we \ncan take the good things\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nin the proposal, but get to the heart and soul of it, which is getting \nfarm income up--not from Government payments, but from the prices \nfarmers receive for their products. That is what we have to do.\n  I see my friend from Minnesota is here to speak on this. Again, we \nhave talked about this, and we share the same strong feelings that this \nis not adequate, this needs some additional work in the Congress. I \nhope we can get the administration to help us on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Iowa--and I \nsee the Senator from Oregon--I want to come out on the floor next week \nwith some other Senators from farm country, and I think we should talk \nmore about it. As I understand the Senator from Iowa--and he can \ncorrect me if I am wrong--it is that we don't want to wait until 2002 \nfor a new farm bill. We want to reopen this farm bill and give our \nfarmers some leverage so they can get a decent price.\n  What we are doing is essentially saying to these grain companies and \nto these packers: Go ahead. You can get by with not having to worry \nabout paying producers as little as possible because you have all the \npower of the marketplace. Then they will have enough money to support \ntheir families. Then we come in and provide them with some money so \nthey can support their families. We are basically subsidizing these big \ngrain companies and these packers. We are not getting to the root of \nthe problem. If it is a farmer-owned reserve we are talking about, CRP, \nmid-size and family farmers, that is what people want. Zeroing in on \nmid-size farmers is what people want. They want to be able to make a \ndecent price.\n  Isn't that really what the Senator from Iowa was saying?\n  This will be on my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is exactly what we are talking about. I point out that \nin the administration's proposal for their farm support this year, they \nwill use a 5-year average of gross income--gross income. Look, what \nabout the increased price of fuel, machinery, fertilizer, seed, and, \nthanks to the Federal Reserve System, increased interest rates? I said \nbefore and I say to my friend again that the farmer has a $100,000 \ngross income averaged over 5 years. But if his costs are $92,000, what \ndoes that mean? It doesn't mean anything.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Iowa the other thing which \nworries me is we had an estimate the other day by the USDA that net \nfarm income was going to go down 17 percent this year. As I look at \ntheir figure for some sort of income support, it isn't going to be \nenough to provide even a safety net. But the point is it doesn't deal \nwith the root causes.\n  Let's have some fight. Let's say this farm bill is a miserable \nfailure. Let's have some antitrust action. Let's have a level playing \nfield. Let's give our farmers some leverage so they can get a decent \nprice in the marketplace.\n  I think there are a number of us who are going to come out on the \nfloor with just those proposals.\n  Am I correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely correct. I look forward to \nworking with him and others to set forth proposals that will move us in \nthe right direction.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will make one final point, I say to the Senator from \nOregon. It looks to me as if--I think it is going to happen--the \nreligious community, the AFL-CIO, the farm organizations, and the \nenvironmental organizations are all beginning to organize for March 20-\n21. Basically, rural America is coming here to raise the roof. I think \nit will be healthy for all of us.\n  I think the pressure should be put on dealing with the price crisis \nand dealing with other issues that are important to rural America, \nwhich for too long have been out of sight and out of mind. I think we \nhave to get off the dime. We have to make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I want to reinforce what my colleague from Iowa said. \nI think what the President and the administration suggested for family \nfarmers is too timid. Where is the fight? I appreciate getting some \nhelp to people--sort of safety-net help. Getting some income to our \nfamily farmers is not going to be enough. It doesn't deal with the root \nof the problem. We don't want to wait until 2002 to write a farm bill. \nIt is a failed farm bill. It is a failed farm policy. We are \ngrinding family farmers up into pieces. We are driving people off the \nland. It is an economic convulsion, and it calls for bold action.\n\n  I don't know where the fight is. To tell you the truth, I don't see \nthe fight. I say to the Senator from Iowa that we have different \npositions in the Presidential race. This has nothing to do with who we \nare supporting.\n  But where is the fight? Where is the boldness? Where is the \nleadership? We need people--starting with the President--to come out \nand say this ``freedom to fail'' bill has not worked. There is \ntremendous economic pain. Time is not on our side. There is an economic \nconvulsion out there. Family farmers in rural communities want a decent \nprice. We want farmers to get a fair shake in the market. We want \nantitrust action. We want a fair trade policy. We want stable \nagriculture. We want a different farm policy. In all due respect, this \nproposal will only help people somewhat. Thank you. But we have to do a \nlot more.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have to get away from thinking that agriculture is \nsome sort of a minor entity out there, some kind of a sidebar issue. \nAgriculture is still, if I am not mistaken, something like 20 percent \nof our gross national product. I think we are up from 20 percent, if I \nam not mistaken. People still have to eat. Food is one thing we can't \ndo without. Yet we sort of treat agriculture as sort of--well, it is \nsort of a sidebar, sort of a side item. We have to think of agriculture \nas a central, integral part of our entire economic structure in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S314-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S314-S315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SECURITY FOR CAPITOL HILL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE Mr. President, I want to repeat what I said yesterday. \nI am going to come out on the floor every day and spend a few minutes \non this question.\n  Many of us attended the services for Officer Chestnut and Agent \nGibson, the two officers who were slain. I believe we all made a \ncommitment to making sure that we were going to have security for our \npolice officers, much less for the general public.\n  Starting back in October, I realized we have a single-person post. We \nhave posts--I say to my colleague from Oregon, who has always cared \nabout these questions--where you have one officer with lots of people \nstreaming in. This is unconscionable. It puts these officers at great \nrisk. It puts all of us at great risk. You could have one deranged \nperson who could show up at any of these stations with other people \ncoming in, and God knows what would happen.\n  After these two police officers were slain, we passed a supplemental \nappropriations bill that was a little over $1 million. It was to go for \nweapons, investigations, security, and if we needed more overtime so we \ncould staff these stations through overtime. The Sergeant at Arms of \nthe Senate has made it crystal clear we have to change this situation. \nI have talked to him. I told him I was going to speak on the floor. He \nsaid: Please do so.\n  I am not going to point my finger and say this particular person or \nthat particular person is at fault. I am just going to say this: We \nshould be able to do better for these Capitol Hill police officers. \nThey do well for us.\n  We made a commitment that we would not put them in a situation where \nwe did not have real security. We are doing that.\n  We still have single-person posts. I raised this question back in \nOctober before we adjourned. I was told there would be changes. But we \nstill have not put the resources into this. I say to my colleagues if \nthis is an issue of spending and we need to spend more money and we \nneed to have more police officers, then let's do it. If this is some \nsort of an internal issue where we somehow need to figure out how to \nuse overtime pay to staff up, then let's do it.\n  I don't know what the policy answer is. I will leave that up to other \npeople. I am not going to be the one to micromanage. But I will say \nthis as a Senator: Every day I am going to come out on the floor, and \nevery day I am going\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nto say we lost two police officers; that we made a commitment in their \nmemory to make sure we would have security; we made a commitment to \nmake sure that we would not have single-person posts. That was a \npromise we made. We have still not lived up to that promise. We should \ndo better. We should do better for the Capitol Hill police. We should \ndo better for the general public. The sooner we do, the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President and colleagues, I have made it clear my top \npriority for this session of Congress is to make sure that we finally \nadd prescription drug coverage for senior citizens to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Towards that end, I have teamed up for more than a year with Senator \nOlympia Snowe of Maine with a proposal we believe can win bipartisan \nsupport in this Congress and effectively respond to the enormous need \nthat all of us are seeing as we go home to our communities and visit \nwith older people. The Snowe-Wyden prescription drug legislation is \nbipartisan. It is marketplace oriented--we use competitive forces as a \ntool to hold down the prescription drug bills for senior citizens. All \nof us in the Senate can identify with the approach we are using because \nthe Snowe-Wyden legislation is modeled after the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit Plan which all of us in the Congress are fortunate to \nenjoy.\n  As part of our campaign to get this bipartisan legislation enacted, I \nhave made a commitment to come to this floor again and again and urge \nsenior citizens, as this poster says, to send in copies of their \nprescription drug bills. We would like seniors to send in copies of \ntheir bills to each of us in the Senate, Washington, DC, 20510.\n  As part of the effort to win passage of this legislation or a similar \napproach to it, I am going to come to the floor of the Senate again and \nagain and again and read from some of the letters I am receiving from \nolder people.\n  For example, recently I had a chance to hear from an elderly woman \nwho lives in Yoncalla, in southern Oregon. It is a small town. Her \nclosest pharmacy is about 30 miles away. She has diabetes; she has \nosteoporosis. Her Social Security check, the entire source of her \nincome, is $567 a month. She is taking eight different medications for \nher health problems. Her monthly drug costs come to about $400 a month. \nThat leaves this elderly woman in southern Oregon with less than $200 a \nmonth to live on after she is done paying her prescription drug bill. \nThink about that, think about what it is like for an older person in \nthis country having just a couple hundred dollars a month to pay for \nfood and heat or other medical expenses.\n  She told us she has had to basically cut back on buying her drugs on \na monthly basis because she knows, unless she juggles all her bills, \nshe is not going to be able to come close to meeting all of her \nobligations. She has $567 a month, lives in a small town, Yoncalla, \nOregon. The pharmacy is a pretty good distance away; she has diabetes; \nshe has osteoporosis, and when she is done paying her prescription drug \nbill, she has only about $200 a month left to live on. That is a \ndisgrace. That is wrong in a country as rich and good and powerful as \nours.\n  Under the Snowe-Wyden bipartisan prescription drug legislation, with \na modest copayment that woman would be able to get health insurance to \ncover her prescription drug bill. Our legislation would pick up \nessentially completely the prescription drug portion of her health \ninsurance premium.\n  The reality is, a person such as that older woman in Yoncalla is hit \nby a double whammy. Medicare does not cover prescription drugs and \nhasn't since the program began in 1965; and, second, she is in effect \nsubsidizing big buyers, health maintenance organizations, big health \nplans that go out and negotiate discounts. It is no wonder that very \noften we see older people in our communities in this situation. This \nstory is representative. I am getting accounts similar to this \ncontinuously. In every community in this country there are similar \npeople who are walking an economic tightrope, seniors who, every month, \nbalance their food bill against their fuel costs, and fuel costs \nagainst medical expenses. If they have any unexpected expenses at all \nthat month, they fall off the economic tightrope and go further and \nfurther into the hole.\n  Another older couple I heard from recently, this time from my \nhometown in Portland, told me they spend $5,264 a year on medications. \nThis older couple gets Social Security benefits. The husband has a \nveteran's pension. Between the various sources of income they have, \nthey receive just under $12,000 a year. They have to spend over $5,000 \nof it on prescription medicines. I am not going to go into all the \ndetails of this, but they sent me an itemized bill of four pages that \noutlines the prescriptions they are paying for on a regular basis. Mr. \nPresident, $5,000 a year of their $12,000 income goes to pay for these \nmedicines.\n\n  I think we can come up with a bipartisan approach to deal with this \nissue, one that is marketplace oriented. We have a good model in the \nFederal Employees Health Plan. Senator Snowe and I are very proud that \nwhen we brought the funding plan for our legislation to the floor of \nthe Senate as part of the budget last session we got 54 votes. A \nmajority of the Senate is now on record in support of ensuring we fund \nprescription drug coverage for older people.\n  I was very pleased with how the President handled the prescription \ndrug issue at the State of the Union Address. He made it clear he was \nnot interested in scapegoating anybody or saying Republicans were at \nfault or somebody else was at fault for not getting this enacted. He \nmade it clear he wanted to work with the U.S. Congress. He said the \nneed is urgent. He left open the opportunity to work with Republicans \nand Democrats on the particulars. Senator Snowe and I believe our \napproach is one that makes sense. We are proud of the fact we got the \nmajority of the Senate on record voting for a funding approach for it.\n  But our colleagues have lots of other good ideas. We recognize that. \nOur bill is called SPICE, the Seniors Prescription Insurance Coverage \nEquity Act. Other colleagues have other ideas as well. I hope seniors \nacross the country will consider this poster I have up here that says, \n``Send In Your Prescription Drug Bill,'' to each of us in the Senate, \nWashington, DC, 20510.\n  I am going to keep coming to the floor of the Senate, reading from \nthese letters, reading from these accounts. Today you heard about an \nolder person in Yoncalla, an older woman in southern Oregon literally \nwith less than a couple hundred dollars a month left to live on when \nshe is done paying for her prescription drug bill, and an elderly \ncouple in Portland who worked hard all their lives, always played by \nthe rules, who are spending more than half their income on prescription \ndrugs.\n  I will wrap up with this point. We as a nation are just starting to \nhave the debate about whether we can afford to cover prescription \ndrugs. My view is we cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs. If \nthat older woman in Yoncalla cannot get help with her prescriptions \nwhen she has diabetes and osteoporosis and she is taking eight \nmedications, if that couple in Portland cannot afford their \nmedications, all of the gerontological research proves what is going to \nhappen. Those folks are going to get sicker. They are going to land in \nthe hospital where they need much more expensive care under what is \ncalled Part A of the Medicare program.\n  I see my friend from Minnesota. He and I have worked often on these \nissues. The Presiding Officer of the Senate handled the Social Security \nissues in the House. We know what needs to be done. We know it needs to\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nbe done in a bipartisan way. We can only get important issues addressed \nin Washington, DC, if we work in a bipartisan way. That is what I have \nteamed up with Senator Snowe for more than a year to do.\n  I hope, as I bring additional cases to the floor of the Senate and \ntalk about the extraordinary suffering we are seeing among our seniors, \nthat we can come together on a bipartisan basis to deal with this \nissue. I have spoken with Senator Daschle and Senator Lott about it. I \nknow Senator Snowe is doing so as well. This is an issue to which every \nsingle Member of the Senate can point as an achievement if we come \ntogether and address it in a bipartisan way.\n  Towards that end, I intend to keep coming to this floor and \ndescribing these cases. I have believed since the days I was codirector \nof the Oregon Gray Panthers that this was an important issue to \naddress. It becomes even more important by the day as these new drugs \nare key to keeping seniors well and keeping them from landing in the \nhospital and incurring greater expenses.\n  I hope seniors will take heed of this poster and send copies of their \nprescription drug bills to their Senators in Washington, DC, 20510.\n  I will keep coming to the floor of this body again and again urging \nbipartisan support on this issue. It is my top priority for this \nsession, and it ought to be a top priority for every Senator.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to have this issue \naddressed in this session of Congress and give our older people \nmeaningful relief from their prescription drugs bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to address concerns \nabout the direction our country is taking in agriculture policy for our \nNation. It has been very frustrating to me that our Federal dairy \npolicy has been driven by what I can only describe as urban myths about \nthe supposed benefits of dairy compacts in our country. These myths, \njust like stories on the street, have been repeated so many times in \nCongress that they are assumed to be true, despite their total lack of \na factual basis.\n  I would today like to discuss the myth that dairy compacts are \nnecessary to provide an adequate supply of fresh, locally produced milk \nto consumers. As I have said before, I believe this assertion is a \ndeliberate attempt to mislead consumers into believing that if we do \nnot have compacts, there may not be milk in the dairy case the next \ntime they go to the grocery store. Perhaps the statement is not a total \ndeception because it says that the dairy compact is designed to \nguarantee fresh, locally produced milk. But as we enter the 21st \ncentury, we as consumers know that a product in the grocery store does \nnot have to be produced locally to be ``fresh.'' If it is produced \nlocally, all the better, but we regularly go to the grocery store and \nbuy fresh, perishable food that comes from all over the United States, \nincluding fruits, vegetables, meats, poultry, and any of a number of \nother foods. Similarly, fresh milk and dairy products can now be safely \nand rapidly shipped all over the country in refrigerated trucks--there \nis no need to restrict interstate trade in our country to guarantee \nfresh milk to our consumers.\n  One of the reasons that America thrives economically is because we \nallow individuals to produce what they are most skilled at producing. \nAnd this principle extends to geographic regions of the country. As an \nexample, Americans buy most of their citrus products from Florida and \nCalifornia, cotton and rice from the South, and potatoes from the West. \nEconomists call this ``comparative advantage''--regions produce and \nsell whatever they are most efficient at producing, and everyone \nbenefits because trade and efficiency is maximized. Lower price; better \nproducts to the consumer. It all seems very simple, but it is not \nallowed to work that way in our dairy industry.\n  The upper Midwest, due in part to its climate, low feed prices, and \nan abundant water supply happens to have a comparative advantage in \nmilk and dairy products. However, unlike the rest of the country, it is \nnot permitted to freely sell the product that it so efficiently \nproduces. Instead, Congress has chosen to protect entire regions of the \nmilk industry against competition from the upper Midwest through dairy \ncompacts and/or outdated milk marketing orders.\n  Basically, in dairy, the Government is picking winners and losers, \nnot who can produce the best, not who can be competitive, what area of \nthe country it is. But under a Government program, the Government is \nsaying who is a winner and who is a loser when it comes to the dairy \nindustry.\n  Dairy compacts require that processors pay a minimum price for the \nmilk they sell for fluid consumption. Compact proponents will claim \nthat producers outside the compact region are not prevented from \nselling into the region, but for all practical purposes, this is \nexactly what it does. If you have a floor price, it eliminates the \nability of lower cost producers to sell in that region. There is no \nincentive for processors to buy from producers outside the region \nbecause the price they pay is already set. So they are not able to buy \nat the lower price or more competitive supply, but because of the \ncompact setting the price, that is where they buy it.\n\n  It is interesting that the argument that compacts are necessary to \nguarantee a supply of fresh milk to a region was also made to justify \nthe unreasonably high support prices in the 1980s that resulted as you \nwill remember, in massive government purchases of surplus dairy \nproducts. The Federal Government spent $2.6 billion on surplus \npurchases in 1983 alone, more than 12 percent of U.S. milk production. \nCongress consequently had to begin a dairy termination program which \npaid dairy farmers not to produce milk for 5 years.\n  Congress today is perpetuating the same myths as in past years, with \nthe same predictable results of producer surpluses and higher milk \nprices to consumers. Upper Midwest producers could sell cheaper milk to \nconsumers almost nationwide, but instead, not only can they not compete \nfor markets outside the region, but their prices in cheese markets are \ndepressed by the oversupply of production in the compact region that \nflood into the Midwest.\n  Finally, it appears that not only are dairy compacts not necessary to \nguarantee a fresh supply of milk to consumers, but they seem to only \noffer Government protection to dairy farmers within the compact area \nand guarantee decreased consumption by families due to the high milk \nprices. If something costs more, you sell less of it, and milk is no \ndifferent. For example, in 1998, each consumer drank an average of 23.8 \ngallons of fluid milk products. That is compared to 56.1 gallons of \nsoft drinks, 15 gallons of fruit juices, and 14 gallons of bottled \nwater. Moreover, beverage milk consumption declined from 28.6 gallons \nin 1975 to 23.9 gallons in 1997. This is not a trend we can ignore. If \nwe went to encourage milk consumption, we cannot do so by artificially \nraising the price and keeping less expensive, domestically produced \nmilk out of the market.\n  As we begin the second session of the 106th Congress, I ask my \ncolleagues to be truthful in the dairy debate and not perpetuate the \nfalsehood that compacts are necessary to ensure a fresh supply of milk \nto consumers. There are, unfortunately, other dairy myths to be \nexposed, so you can look forward to me returning to the Senate floor to \nmake sure Congress and the American people learn the truth about our \nFederal dairy policy.\n  We need some fairness in our dairy policy.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S316-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S316-S318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have now reached a milestone in our \neconomic history with the report the other day that our economic \nexpansion is now the Nation's longest. We have now enjoyed economic \nexpansion of 107 months. That is the longest economic expansion in our \nNation's history. I thought it might be useful to reflect on some of \nthe policies that have contributed to that success.\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\n  First and foremost is the fiscal policy of the Nation. The policies \nthat determine our economic success are the fiscal policy of the United \nStates and the monetary policy of the United States.\n  The fiscal policy of America is controlled by the President, working \nwith the Congress of the United States. That is the spending policy and \nthe tax policy of America.\n  The monetary policy is controlled by the Federal Reserve Board. Of \ncourse, we had a vote this morning on the question of the continued \nleadership of Chairman Greenspan over the monetary policy of our \ncountry.\n  With respect to the fiscal policy of the country, I thought it would \nbe useful to compare and contrast the records of our last three \nPresidents.\n  Under President Reagan, starting in 1981, we saw a dramatic increase \nin Federal budget deficits. In fact, they nearly tripled from $79 \nbillion a year, when he came into office, to over $200 billion a year. \nThen we saw some improvement in the final 2 years of his \nadministration.\n  Then, with President Bush, we saw a dramatic increase in our Federal \nbudget deficits, going from $153 billion in his first year to $290 \nbillion in his final year in office. At that point, we were advised \nthat we could expect red ink for as far into the future as anybody \ncould project. In fact, they were expecting, at that point, this year \nwe would have budget deficits of over $600 billion if there was failure \nto act.\n  Thank goodness we did not fail to act because in 1993 President \nClinton came into office, put forward an ambitious 5-year plan to \nreduce the budget deficit, and we were able to pass that plan. We were \nable to pass that plan; and for the next 5 years, under that 5-year \nplan, each and every year the budget deficit came down, and came down \nsharply, to $22 billion at the end of that 5-year plan.\n  At that point, we passed, on a bipartisan basis--unlike in 1993, \nwhere nobody on the other side of the aisle in either Chamber supported \nthe 5-year plan put forward by President Clinton--but in 1997, we \njoined hands, on a bipartisan basis, to finish the job.\n  Indeed, we did finish the job, so that in 1998 and 1999 we saw \nunified budget surpluses. In fact, in 1999, we had a surplus of $124 \nbillion, on a unified basis--that means counting all of the accounts of \nthe Federal Government. And even better news; we were able to balance \nthat year without counting Social Security.\n  This year, the year we are currently in, we anticipate a $176 billion \nunified budget surplus, again, without counting Social Security.\n  Those are very dramatic improvements that we have had in the fiscal \npolicy of the United States.\n  I will go to this chart first because it shows the changes that were \nmade in the two key elements in determining whether or not you have a \nbudget deficit. The blue line is the outlays of the Federal Government; \nthat is, the spending. The red line is the revenues. You can see, we \nhad a big gap between the two for many years. That is why we had a \nbudget deficit. We were spending more than we were taking in.\n  In 1997, when we passed that 5-year plan to close the gap, you can \nsee from the chart we reduced expenditures and we raised revenue. That \ncombination has eliminated the budget deficit. That is why we are in \nsurplus today.\n  Let's go back to the chart that shows, on the spending side of the \nledger, how things changed.\n  We are now at the lowest level of Federal spending in 25 years as \nmeasured against our gross domestic product, as measured against our \nnational income, which is the fairest way to measure these things so \nyou see changes over time, so that you are able to put in context the \ntime value of money.\n\n  What you see is, we are now spending 18.7 percent of our national \nincome on the Federal Government. That is, again, the lowest level \nsince 1974, 25 years ago. If we stay on this course, you can see we \nwill continue to see declines down to about 17 percent of our national \nincome going to the Federal Government. That is a dramatic improvement \nover where we were back in 1992, when we were spending over 22 percent \nof our national income on the Federal Government.\n  Some have said: We have the highest taxes in our history.\n  Let me go back to the chart that shows revenue and spending. This, \nagain, is measured against our gross domestic product, our national \nincome.\n  The red line is the revenue line. It is true that the revenue line \nhas gone up, just as the spending line has come down. That is how we \nbalance the budget. We cut spending and we raised revenue so we could \neliminate the deficit.\n  One of the key reasons we have more revenue is because the economy is \ndoing well. It has been revived because we got our fiscal house in \norder in this country. Some say that translates into the highest taxes \nindividuals have paid. That is not the case.\n  The fact is, the tax burden is declining for a family of four. This \nis not the Senator from North Dakota's analysis. This is the respected \naccounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, that compares the tax burden for \na family earning $35,000 a year in 1979 to 1999. This chart shows their \noverall tax burden. This includes payroll taxes, income taxes. It shows \nthat their tax burden has declined. The same is true of a family income \nof $85,000 a year. Their taxes have not gone up. Their taxes have gone \ndown. Their taxes have been reduced.\n  Overall, revenue has increased because the economy is strengthened. \nGoodness knows, anybody who looks around at America's economy \nunderstands we are in the best shape we have been in in anybody's \nmemory.\n  How do we keep this successful economy going? I think it is useful to \nreflect on how very important the successful economic policy we have \nbeen pursuing has been. It has produced the lowest unemployment rate in \n41 years. This chart shows the dramatic improvement in the unemployment \nrate in this country. We have also experienced the lowest inflation \nrate in 33 years.\n  You remember we used to talk about the misery index. We used to \ncombine the unemployment rate and the inflation rate and look at the \nso-called misery index. The misery index would be as favorable as it \nhas been in almost anybody's lifetime because we have seen unemployment \nand the inflation rate come down dramatically.\n  The fact is, this economic policy has been working--a policy of \nbalancing the budget and getting our fiscal house in order.\n  Now the question is, What do we do going forward? We have these \nprojections that say we are going to be experiencing substantial \nsurpluses in the future.\n  Chairman Greenspan, who we voted for overwhelmingly on the floor of \nthe Senate, has given his recommendation. As recently as January 27, he \ntold Congress: ``Pay down the debt first.'' That is what he is urging. \nHe is saying: Continue the policy that we have pursued to eliminate \ndeficits, reduce debt because that lifts an enormous burden off of the \nAmerican economy. We reduce the interest costs; we reduce the \ncompetition for funds; we reduce the Government's call on money that is \navailable in this economy; and there is more money available for the \nprivate sector at lower interest rates. That means higher rates of \ninvestment. That means stronger economic growth. We ought to pay \nattention to what Chairman Greenspan is telling us: ``Pay down the debt \nfirst.''\n  I wish to talk a little about these projections of surpluses we have \nheard about. When the Congressional Budget Office released their \nprojections, they put out three different calculations of what the \nsurpluses might be over the next 10 years.\n  The first one was based on an assumption that we have a so-called \ncapped baseline; that is, we go back to the 1997 agreement. That would \nmean very sharp cuts in spending this year over the spending we had \nlast year. In fact, this baseline assumes that we would cut spending \nthis year by $66 billion over last year's spending.\n  Now, that is not going to happen. We have had a Republican-controlled \nCongress the last 2 years. They have not been reducing spending from \nthe previous year. They have been increasing the spending, even though \nthe caps existed. In fact, we shattered the caps last year. So it is an \nunrealistic expectation to suggest that all of a sudden we are going to \nstart following them this year. In fact, that would require a $66 \nbillion cut in spending to get the projection of a non-Social Security \nsurplus over the next 10 years of $1.9 trillion.\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\n  The second estimate put out by CBO was, if we froze all domestic \nspending for the next 10 years, that would give us a non-Social \nSecurity surplus of $1.8 trillion. Again, how realistic is that? Are we \nreally going to freeze for the next 10 years all the spending on \neducation? Are we going to freeze for the next 10 years all the \nspending on defense? Are we going to freeze for the next 10 years all \nthe spending on law enforcement? Are we going to freeze for the next 10 \nyears all the spending on parks in this country, roads, and highways? \nThat is not a realistic projection. That is not an honest projection.\n  The third estimate put out by the Congressional Budget Office is if \nwe adjusted for inflation each of the years going forward for the next \n10 years. That resulted in a non-Social Security budget surplus of $838 \nbillion. In order to evaluate how reasonable that forecast is, I think \nyou have to look at what has happened the last 2 years. This \nRepublican-controlled Congress has been increasing spending by higher \nthan the rate of inflation, which would reduce this number even \nfurther. That means instead of a $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus \nthat has been bandied about in the press, or a $1.8 trillion surplus \nover the next 10 years that has been discussed in some circles, we are \nmuch more likely to face a surplus over the next 10 years in the non-\nSocial Security accounts of about $800 billion. That is reality, that \nis facing the most likely prospect, instead of the kind of dreamworld \nanticipations we have had in the first two scenarios.\n  In the proposal of Governor Bush and the Republican side over the \nnext 10 years, he is proposing a tax cut of $1.3 trillion, when we only \nlikely will have a non-Social Security surplus of $800 billion. That \nmeans Governor Bush would have to take $500 billion out of Social \nSecurity to pay for his tax cut scheme, a tax cut scheme that gives 60 \npercent of the benefit to the wealthiest 10 percent in this country. \nThat is a dangerous plan for this Nation's economy.\n  Instead of further reducing the debt with this non-Social Security \nsurplus, he would devote every penny of it to a tax cut \ndisproportionately going to the wealthiest 10 percent in this country. \nThat is a dangerous plan.\n  It is especially dangerous in light of what Chairman Greenspan has \ntold us, which is that the highest priority ought to be to pay down the \ndebt--not to have a massive tax cut scheme, not to have a massive new \nspending scheme, but to have our first priority being to pay down the \ndebt. Goodness knows, our generation ran up this debt. We have a \nresponsibility to pay it down. Not only do we have a moral obligation, \nbut it is the best economic policy for this country. It will take \npressure off interest rates. It will mean greater economic growth. It \nwill mean we are preparing for the baby boom generation, which all of \nus know is coming.\n  I am a baby boomer; many of us are. We know there is a huge bulge in \nthe population. When these baby boomers start to retire, they are going \nto put enormous pressure on Social Security spending, on Medicare \nspending, and we ought to get ready for that day. We ought to be \nresponsible. The responsible thing to do is not to engage in some big \nnew spending scheme, not to engage in some massive tax cut scheme, but \nto have a balanced approach, one that puts the priority on paying down \nthis debt, one that puts a priority on strengthening Social Security, \nextending the solvency of Medicare, and also addressing certain high-\npriority domestic needs such as education and defense, which I think \nmany of us in this Chamber believe needs to be strengthened.\n  I come from agriculture country. I come from a farm State. \nAgriculture needs attention. That is a domestic priority for many of \nus.\n  Finally, yes, we can have tax reduction as well, but we certainly \nshouldn't put that as the highest priority. We certainly should not \ntake all of the non-Social Security surplus and devote it to that \npurpose. We absolutely must not take money out of Social Security to \nprovide a tax cut. That is irresponsible. That is dangerous. That \nthreatens our economic security and our economic expansion.\n  Over 5 years, the Bush tax cut plan is even more dramatic in terms of \nits effect on Social Security. I talked about a non-Social Security \nsurplus over 10 years of just over $800 billion. Over 5 years, it is \nabout $150 billion. Yet the Bush tax cut plan over 5 years approaches \n$500 billion. Let me say that again. Over the next 5 years, the most \nrealistic projection of surpluses is just under $150 billion. Yet the \nBush tax cut plan over 5 years is over $480 billion. Where is the \ndifference coming from? It can only come from one place. That is the \nSocial Security surplus. That is profoundly mistaken, profoundly wrong. \nThat is exactly what we should not do in terms of the fiscal policy of \nthis country. The last thing we should do is put this thing back in the \nold ditch of deficits and debt.\n  I end as I began. Chairman Greenspan has advised us that what we \nought to do as the highest priority is pay down this debt--$5.6 \ntrillion of total debt, $3.6 trillion of publicly held debt. Let us \nkeep our eye on the ball. Let us put as our highest priority the paying \ndown of this national debt. Our generation ran it up. We have an \nobligation to pay it down.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nsuch time as I may require as in morning business and that, by \nunanimous consent, Senator Feingold be recognized to speak directly \nfollowing the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S318-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S318-S325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this afternoon Senators will come to \nthe floor to speak about a problem we believe is a very serious one; \nthat is, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. I know the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, will speak, and the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold will speak. I believe others will as well.\n  Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues here this afternoon to \naddress what I consider to be one of the most pressing and important \nnational security and international health issues that we will face in \nthe coming decades: The HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is currently sweeping \nAfrica.\n  I wish to begin by giving my colleagues a sense of the scope and \nscale of this problem.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than \nany other part of the world. Today, 23.3 million adults and children \nare infected with the HIV virus in Africa, which only has about 10 \npercent of the world's population, but nearly 70 percent of the \nworldwide total of infected people.\n  Worldwide, about 5.6 million new infections will occur this year, \nwith an estimated 3.8 million in sub-Saharan Africa--3.8 million people \nwill contract HIV. Every day, 11,000 additional people are infected--1 \nevery 8 seconds.\n  All told, over 34 million people in Africa--the population of my \nState of California--have been infected with HIV since the epidemic \nbegan, and an estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to \nAIDS, including 2.2 million who died in 1998.\n  Each day, AIDS buries 5,500 men, women, and children. We saw a very \ncompelling documentary made by the filmmaker Rory Kennedy, which showed \nthe burials of some of these children as well as the enormous cultural \nproblems that exist in Africa because of HIV/AIDS. By 2005, if policies \ndo not change, the daily death toll will not be 5,500, it will be \n13,000--double what it is now--with nearly 5 million AIDS deaths that \nyear alone, according to the White House Office of AIDS Policy.\n  AIDS has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death in Africa, \nand it kills many times more people on that continent than war.\n  The overall rate of infection among adults is about 8 percent, \ncompared with a 1.1-percent infection rate worldwide. In some countries \nof southern Africa, 20 to 30 percent of the adults are infected.\n  AIDS has cut life expectancy by 4 years in Nigeria, 18 years in \nKenya, and 26 years in Zimbabwe. As these numbers suggest, AIDS is \ndevastating Africa.\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\n  AIDS is swelling infant and child mortality rates, reversing the \ndeclines that had been occurring in many countries during the 1970s and \n1980s. Over 30 percent of all children born to HIV-infected mothers in \nsub-Saharan Africa will themselves become HIV infected. Let me say \nagain, 30 percent of all of the children born to HIV-infected mothers \nwill become HIV infected.\n  There are many explanations for why this epidemic is sweeping across \nsub-Saharan Africa. Certainly the region's poverty, which has deprived \nmuch of Africa from effective systems of health information, health \neducation and health care, bears much of the blame. Cultural and \nbehavioral patterns, which have led to sub-Saharan Africa becoming the \nonly region in which women are infected with HIV at a higher rate than \nmen, may also play a role.\n  HIV/AIDS is becoming a major woman's issue. AIDS has largely impacted \nthe heterosexual community in Africa, and it has established itself in \nsuch a way that it sweeps across and wipes out entire villages.\n  Because of the region's poverty, all too often treatment of AIDS \nsufferers with medicines that can result in long-term survival has not \nbeen widely used in Africa.\n  But I strongly believe that if the international community is to be \nsuccessful, we must make every effort to get appropriate medicine into \nthe hands of those in need.\n  For too many years there were no effective drugs that could be used \nto combat HIV/AIDS, but now, thanks to recent medical research, we do \nhave effective drugs. For example, some recent pilot projects have had \nsuccess in reducing mother-to-child transmission by administering the \nanti-HIV drug AZT, or a less expensive medicine, Nevirapine, during \nbirth and early childhood.\n\n  New studies indicate that Nevirapine can reduce the risk of mother-\nto-child transmission by as much as 80 percent. NVP is given just once \nto the mother during labor, once to the child within 3 days of birth. \nTaking three or four pills can mean that a child is prevented from \nbeing born with HIV. In fact, for $4 a tablet--a little more than the \ncost of a large latte at Starbuck's, which is not a lot here, but a \ngreat deal in Africa--this drug regime has created an unprecedented \nopportunity for international cooperation in the fight against AIDS. I, \nfrankly, believe it is the single most cost-effective thing that can be \ndone. Currently, however, less than 1 percent of HIV-infected pregnant \nwomen have access to interventions to reduce mother-to-child \ntransmission.\n  Administered in a treatment regimen known as HAART--highly active \nantiretroviral therapy--antiretroviral drugs can allow people living \nwith AIDS to live a largely normal life and use of the drugs can lead \nto long-term survival rather than early death. Such treatment is proven \nhighly effective in developed countries, including our very own.\n  My understanding is that most antiretrovirals are relatively \ninexpensive to produce. AIDS Treatment News recently reported:\n\n       AZT in bulk can be purchased for 42 cents for 300 \n     milligrams from the worldwide suppliers; this price reflects \n     profits not only to the manufacturer, but also to the \n     middleman bulk buyer. The same drug retails at my local \n     pharmacy for $5.82 per pill. This ridiculous price bears no \n     relation to the cost of production.\n\n  Unfortunately--and inexplicably, in my view--access for poor Africans \nto costly combinations of AIDS medications, or antiretrovirals, is \nperhaps the most contentious issue surrounding the response to the \nAfrican epidemic.\n  As the U.S. Development Program head, Mark Brown, said at the U.N. \nSecurity Council meeting on AIDS in Africa last month:\n\n       We cannot lapse into a two-tier treatment regime: drugs for \n     the rich, no hope for the poor. While the emphasis must be on \n     prevention, we cannot ignore treatment, despite its costs.\n\n  I agree with that. Although it is true that the cost of combination \ntherapy is beyond the means of most people living with HIV/AIDS and \ngovernments in sub-Saharan Africa--combination therapy in South Africa, \nincidentally, was estimated at $334 a month, or $4,000 per individual \nper year, and UNAIDS reports that Brazil treated 75,000 people with \nantiretrovirals in 1999 at a cost of $300 million--or, again, $4,000 a \nperson.\n  I believe we have a strong moral obligation to try to save lives when \nthe medications for doing so exist. There are several things the United \nStates can do to increase access to lifesaving drugs.\n  First, the U.S. should work with others in the international \ncommunity to provide support to make these drugs affordable and to \nstrengthen African health care systems so that drug therapies can be \neffectively administered. The plan for combating HIV/AIDS in Africa \nrecently put forward by the President and Vice President goes a long \nway towards seeing that the U.S. meets its commitment to this goal.\n  Second, it should be possible for African governments and donor \nagencies to achieve reductions in the cost of antiretrovirals through \nnegotiated agreements with drug manufacturers. The British \npharmaceutical firm Glaxo Wellcome, a major producer of \nantiretrovirals, has already stated that it is committed to \n``differential pricing,'' which would lower the cost of AIDS drugs in \nAfrica.\n  Third, I strongly believe that the United States must work to \nadvocate ``parallel imports'' of drugs and ``compulsory licensing'' by \nAfrican governments to lower the price of patented medications so that \nHIV/AIDS drugs are more affordable, and more people in Africa will be \nable to have access to them.\n  Through parallel importing, patented pharmaceuticals could be \npurchased from the cheapest source, rather than from the manufacturer. \nUnder ``compulsory licensing'' an African government could order a \nlocal firm to produce a drug and pay a negotiated royalty to the patent \nholder.\n  Both parallel imports and compulsory licensing are permitted under \nthe World Trade Organization agreement for countries facing health \nemergencies. There can be little doubt that Africa is facing a health \nemergency of monumental proportions.\n  That is why I, along with my colleague from Wisconsin, introduced an \nAmendment to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act last year to allow \nthe countries of Sub-Saharan Africa to pursue ``compulsory licensing''.\n  Without ``compulsory licensing'', which would allow access to cheaper \ngeneric drugs, more people in Sub-Saharan African will suffer and die.\n  For those of my colleagues who may be concerned that this Amendment \nmay undermine wider Intellectual Property Rights, this Amendment \nacknowledges that the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade \nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) is the presumptive \nlegal standard for intellectual property rights (IPR).\n  The WTO, however, allows countries flexibility in addressing public \nhealth concerns, and the compulsory licensing process under this \nAmendment is consistent with the WTO's approach to balancing the \nprotection of intellectual property with a moral obligation to meet \npublic health emergencies such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n  In other words, this Amendment does not create new policy or a new \napproach on IPR issues under TRIPS, nor does it require IPR rights to \nbe rolled back or weakened. All it asks is that in approaching HIV/AIDS \nin Africa, U.S. policy on compulsory licensing remains consistent with \nwhat is accepted under international trade law.\n  By doing so, this Amendment will allow the countries of Sub-Saharan \nAfrica to continue to determine the availability of HIV/AIDS \npharmaceuticals in their countries, and provide their people with \naffordable HIV/AIDS drugs.\n\n  These drugs exist. We need to get them to where this epidemic is \nreaching monumental proportions.\n  I was pleased to work with the Managers of this bill when the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act was on the floor of the Senate last \nNovember, to modify my Amendment to meet some of their concerns, and to \nhave their support in seeing it included in the final Senate-passed \nversion of this bill.\n  Unfortunately, several pharmaceutical manufacturers are strongly \nopposed to this measure, and, as I understand it, there are efforts to \nhave this Amendment taken out of the final bill that will be reported \nout of Conference.\n  I believe that such efforts are reprehensible, and I am determined \nnot to allow this to happen.\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\n  And if, behind closed doors, this amendment is indeed removed from \nthis bill, I intend to do all I can to--I hope I will be joined by my \ncolleagues--make sure that an African Growth and Opportunity bill \nwithout this provision does not pass this Congress.\n  What good is an African trade bill if Africa is going to get wiped \nout from AIDS?\n  It is clearly in the interest of the United States to prevent the \nfurther spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and I believe that the \n``compulsory licensing'' amendment was a necessary addition to the \nAfrica Growth and Opportunity Act if we are to continue to assist the \ncountries of this region in halting the number of premature deaths from \nAIDS. Antiretroviral drugs can do much to improve quality and length of \nlife. The United States has the power to make these life-saving drugs \nmore affordable and accessible to Africans. We cannot turn our backs on \nAfrica. Our assistance is truly a matter of life and death.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be recognized after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me first thank my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, \nfor her comments and leadership on this issue, and in particular the \nwork we started together last fall and her determination with regard to \nthe amendment that we are quite determined to make sure stays in the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Bill.\n  I also especially thank Senator Durbin, who came back from Africa in \nDecember with a tremendous passion on this issue, for using his \nenormous leadership skills to bring us together on a bipartisan basis \nto try to help fight this problem. I am grateful for his leadership and \nfor his having the idea that we should come together in the Chamber to \nmake some comments.\n  As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa, I have always \nfelt very strongly about the issue of AIDS in Africa. I have raised it \nin the context of the African debate. I have had success in some areas \nbut not in others. I had a chance to raise it in December in personal \nmeetings in their own countries with 10 different African Presidents.\n  I applaud the United Nations Security Council's decision to address \nthe crisis last month. I want to especially mention our Ambassador to \nthe U.N., Richard Holbrooke, whose idea it was to have such a session, \nand I support the administration's call to increase the resources \ndirected at the crisis. I am especially pleased to stand with my \ncolleagues to raise the issue again today.\n  I have heard some of the statistics, but I think they bear \nrepetition.\n  In 1998 alone, AIDS killed 2 million Africans. At least 12 million \nAfricans have been killed by AIDS since the onset of the crisis. Africa \naccounts for over half of the world's cases of HIV. According to World \nBank President James Wolfensohn, the disease has left 10 million \nAfrican children in its wake.\n  In Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, 25 percent of the people \nbetween the ages of 15 and 19 are HIV positive.\n  By 2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people than it \nwould have had if there has been no AIDS epidemic.\n  My recent trip to 10 African countries only renewed my resolve to \naddress this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves.\n  In Namibia, HIV-positive citizens pulled up to a meeting in a van \nwith curtained windows, and they hurried to the safety of the meeting \nroom as soon as they arrived. They feared that their identity would be \nrevealed, and that the stigma still attached to the disease would cause \nthem to lose their jobs and perhaps even to be disowned by their \nfamilies. It was shocking--in a country gripped by the epidemic, people \nare still afraid to acknowledge the crisis.\n  In Zambia I visited an orphanage of sorts, where 500 children, many \nof them orphaned when AIDS killed their parents, gathered by day. At \nnight, there is only room for 50 of them--the rest must make their own \narrangements, and many end up sleeping on the streets, sometimes \nprostituting themselves--thereby risking exposure to HIV in their \nstruggle to survive.\n  In Zimbabwe, life expectancy has dropped from 65 to 39. Let me repeat \nthat: life expectancy in Zimbabwe dropped from 65 to 39. Walking past \nthe Parliament building one day, I asked how old one had to be to \nbecome a legislator there. The answer was 40. That exchange helped me \nto grasp how far-reaching the consequences of this disease really are--\nno society is structured in a way that prepares it to deal with an \nunchecked epidemic like AIDS.\n  In July 1999, the National Institutes of Health released a report on \nthe effectiveness of a drug called nevirapine, the drug Senator \nFeinstein mentioned, in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. \nStudies indicate that this drug can reduce the risk of mother-to-child \ntransmission by as much as 80 percent.\n  As she said, NVP costs $4 per tablet. This relatively simple and \ninexpensive drug regimen has created an unprecedented opportunity \nfor international cooperation in the fight against the vertical \ntransmission of HIV.\n\n  It should be recognized that Uganda is making real headway with \nregard to prevention. Since 1992, the Ugandan government's very frank \nand high-profile public education efforts have helped to reduce the \nincidence of HIV infection by more than 15 percent.\n  But despite these positive signs, there are many fronts on which \nthere has been very little progress. Virtually no one has access to \ndrugs to treat the disease. Prevention is unquestionably the most \nimportant element of the equation, but treatment cannot be ignored. \nPoverty should not be a death sentence--not when the infectious disease \nthat is destroying African society can be treated.\n  Again, because Senator Feinstein and I, and I know Senator Durbin, \nare determined on this, we offered an amendment to the African Growth \nand Opportunity Act that was accepted into the Senate version of that \nlegislation. It prohibits federal money from being used to lobby \ngovernments to change TRIPS-compliant laws allowing access to HIV/AIDS \ndrugs. Basically, it just says that taxpayer money shouldn't be used to \nprevent countries from taking international legal measures in this AIDS \nemergency. I strongly urge the conferees to support that amendment.\n  The AIDS crisis in Africa is just what the TRIPS agreement was meant \nto address. This is a crisis, an emergency on an incomprehensibly vast \nscale. This is the rare and urgent situation that calls for something \nbeyond a dogmatic approach to intellectual property rights.\n  If allowing for a TRIPS-compliant response seems expensive, think how \nexpensive it will be, in the long run, not to do so. Even beyond the \nhuman tragedy, there are vast economic costs to this epidemic. AIDS \naffects the most productive segment of society. It is turning the \nfuture leaders of the region into a generation of orphans.\n  It is simply unconscionable for the U.S. government to fight the \nlegal efforts of African states to save their people from this plague. \nI cannot imagine why any of my colleagues would support such action. \nThose dissatisfied with the TRIPS agreement should focus their efforts \non changing it--not on twisting the arms of countries in crisis who \ncomply with international law.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois and I look forward to all the \nefforts we will take on together on this issue, and I look forward to \nworking with Members of the other party on this as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Feinstein \nand Feingold, for joining me to speak about AIDS today. I might add \nthere are others who were not able to be here because of scheduling \nproblems.\n  I, too, have just returned from a trip to Africa. Let me say at the \noutset there are some who question the value of Congressional travel. I \nwish they would look at it from a different perspective. I think the \nSenators who spoke on the floor on this issue, Senator Feingold \nincluded, have benefited greatly from traveling to Africa, not just \nbecause we have seen firsthand\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nthis epidemic and its devastation, but frankly because it is \nenergizing. Seeing people, real people and their travails, their \nhardships because of this epidemic, causes many of us to dedicate \nourselves to do something.\n  In an epidemic of such Biblical proportions as the AIDS epidemic in \nAfrica, many of us are humbled, as we should be. I came back and met up \nwith Senator Feingold, whom I know had a similar interest, and Senator \nFeinstein, who helped introduce the amendment which was discussed \nearlier, and I spoke with Senator Orrin Hatch, a Senator from Utah, who \nhas a similar passion on this issue. I have spoken to Senator Bill \nFrist, a Senator from Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on African Affairs. I sincerely believe on this issue, \nmore than any other issue, we should put party labels aside. I think we \nare dealing with not merely another political issue, and certainly not \nany political agenda; when we speak of AIDS in Africa we are dealing \nwith a Holocaust without a Hitler. We are dealing with the greatest \nmoral challenge of our time. Those are large statements, I understand. \nBut as you listen to the statistics that have been noted in earlier \ndebate about the epidemic, I do not believe I am overstating it at all.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than \nany other part of the world. Approximately 23 million adults and \nchildren are infected with HIV in that part of the world. They have \nabout 10 percent of the world's population, 70 percent of the world's \nHIV-infected people. Though an estimated 13.7 million Africans have \nalready lost their lives to AIDS, including 2.2 million who died in \n1998, we are going to see these numbers increase dramatically.\n  This was my first trip to Africa. I tried to make an earlier trip \nwith a Congressional delegation 10 years ago, and I was denied a visa \nby the South African Government. Those were the days of apartheid, and \nas a Congressman I had voted consistently against apartheid. They \nobviously had read my voting record and said they wanted me to stay \nhome; they did not want me to visit their country.\n  Things have changed. Apartheid is over. There is majority rule in \nSouth Africa. Under the inspired leadership of Nelson Mandela and now \nPresident Mbeki, this country has a great future. They offered a visa \nand an invitation to come visit, and I did. I visited Kenya and Uganda \nas well.\n  I started out this trip thinking I would focus on issues I am \nfamiliar with such as food aid. I have been involved in agriculture and \nfood assistance for as long as I have been in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. I think these programs are so \nessential, where America takes its bounty and shares it with people who \nare hungry, people who are starving, around the world.\n  I also wanted to focus on microcredit. Ten years ago in Bangladesh, I \nlearned of the Grameen Bank and similar microcredits that were \nproducing miraculous results. These are small loans, $50, $100, $200, \nprimarily to women to give them a chance to buy a cow or some chickens \nor some goats or some tools or to expand their stall at the \nmarketplace. Mr. President, 98 percent of these microcredit loans are \nrepaid. It is a wonderful program, and it elevates people to a much \nhigher level in terms of their living standards.\n  So I went looking for food and microcredit programs, realizing I \nwould be discussing the AIDS issue as part of it. I quickly came to the \nrealization that AIDS is an issue which is overwhelming the continent \nof Africa. Every other issue takes second tier to the AIDS issue. That \nbecame the focal point of the trip.\n  The three countries we visited, South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda, \nrepresent such different attitudes and different approaches when it \ncomes to the AIDS epidemic.\n  South Africa: I have a photo I took and have blown up. This is a \nrural health clinic in Ndwedwe, which is right outside of Durban, South \nAfrica. This was a lovely young mother and her beautiful little boy who \nsat in the front row of this clinic which I visited.\n  Americans help this clinic stay open. Americans help this clinic have \na nurse come in each day and have a doctor come in once a month. These \nvillagers walk sometimes hours to bring their children and members of \ntheir families in for medical care.\n  This beautiful little boy, as you can see--maybe you cannot see on \nthe television--has the traditional Zulu bracelet made out of hair. His \nmother has the scarring on the cheeks, which is part of the ceremony of \nthe Zulu tribes. They invited me to this clinic to meet some of the \npeople being served.\n  There was a lady sitting right behind this mother and child, and she \ncame up to speak. When she stood up, you could tell she was nervous. \nShe had on a T-shirt and, over that, a long-sleeved shirt. This was a \nfew weeks ago, and it was very warm in South Africa at that time.\n  As she came forward, she was clearly nervous about speaking with us. \nShe very calmly buttoned every button on her shirt all the way up to \nher neck. She stood in front of this assembled group, and she was very \nquiet. Then she said in Zulu: Unity, unity, unity, unity; in unity \nthere is strength. Every time she said the word, the crowd answered \nher. Then she summoned her courage and told her story about how 2 years \nago she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and has heart problems and may \nneed surgery and how important this clinic is to her.\n  At the very end of her talk, she said: And I have AIDS, and I don't \nknow what will happen to my children. And she started crying.\n  The man who was the master of ceremonies at this little gathering \nasked her to sit down on a bench next to me as she was crying. I \nreached up and put my arm on her shoulder, and this audience, wide-\neyed, gasped that I would touch her. A doctor who traveled with us \nstood up and said to the people assembled on this porch: Do you see \nthis? Do you see this American politician? He is touching her. You will \nnot get this AIDS epidemic if you just touch someone.\n  That reflects the level of ignorance, the level of denial in South \nAfrica about an epidemic that has reached and touched 4 million people \nout of some 40 million. They do not understand the basics.\n  In 1998 on World AIDS Day, a South African woman stood up and said: I \nhave AIDS. She returned to her village that evening and was beaten to \ndeath because they believed that was how you could end the scourge.\n  The Chicago Tribune did an amazing series about the AIDS epidemic, \none that I took out of the paper recently. They talked about another \ntown in South Africa, Esidubwini, and they told a story about a lady, \nThandiwe Mwandla, who was diagnosed with AIDS, and after the diagnosis, \nno one would buy her sugarcane, her bananas, her peaches. They would \nnot buy anything she touched. She said at one point that her neighbors \nwalked a broad circle around her. She had the stigma of AIDS. She said: \nWe get sick, and we get poor, and we die lying to ourselves.\n  The Tribune wrote in this story what I consider to be a very \ninspiring paragraph:\n\n       Staring into the abyss of an incomprehensibly brutal \n     epidemic, it is plain how the 23 million people who live with \n     HIV in Africa can drift easily into numbing fatalism, or a \n     fierce, hardening shell of denial.\n\n  We saw that shell of denial in South Africa, a country which looks \nmore like Europe than any other part of Africa, a country which \naccounts for 30 percent of the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, a country \nwhere many people are pinning their hopes that they see the rebirth of \nAfrica in the 21st century. Yet, devastated by this disease, it has \nbeen unwilling to face it.\n\n  From there we went to Kenya. In Kenya, there is a different \ncircumstance--some positive, some not so positive. First, this is a \nphoto we took of this little fellow in a slum in Nairobi, Kenya. It is \ncalled Kibera. It is a squatters slum in the middle of the city. People \nfrom the rural countryside who cannot make a living pile into this \nslum. They squat, set up their huts, and try to create a life and \nexistence.\n  I asked how many people live in this slum. They said: Somewhere \nbetween 500,000 and 800,000; we are not sure, it changes so quickly. \nThere is virtually no sanitation, no water. It all has to be brought \nin. And there certainly is no health care.\n  Kenya is ravaged by AIDS as well. Sadly, for a long period of time \nthey denied it. They did little about it. Just\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\nrecently there was an indication that they are going to start admitting \nit and dealing with it. This political denial is part of the problem, \nand we in the United States have to be part of the solution in \nconvincing these governments in Africa that what is at stake is not \njust this little boy but the future of a continent.\n  From Kenya we went to Uganda, and thank God it was the last stop on \nthe trip because what we saw in Uganda suggested to me that there is no \nreason to despair, we should keep our hope alive, there is a chance to \ndeal with this epidemic.\n  The reason Uganda is so far ahead of many other Third World countries \nis an interesting story.\n  About 10 years ago, President Museveni of Uganda sent some of his \nUgandan soldiers to Cuba to be trained to fight rebels in the \ncountryside. After a few weeks, he received a message from the Cuban \nGovernment. They said: We are sending your soldiers home. Of course, \nhis Government asked why. And they said: Because half your soldiers you \nsent to Cuba have HIV.\n  That was 10 years ago. It was stunning for them to realize that what \nthey thought was an isolated disease now infected half of the military.\n  We met some of the soldiers--in fact, some were HIV positive--in each \nof these countries who have now come forward and dealt with this in a \nmore open and forthright way.\n  When those soldiers came back from Cuba to Uganda, at about that same \ntime, one of the more prominent figures in music in Uganda, a man by \nthe name of Philly Lutaaya, announced publicly that he had AIDS. By \ngoing public and talking to the people of Uganda, he achieved, in many \nways, what Magic Johnson achieved in the United States. He suddenly \nraised our eyes from our other life's undertakings to look straight \ninto the eyes of someone whom we knew and admired and thought this \nwould never happen to.\n  Uganda then set out on a program to reduce the incidence of HIV \ninfection, and when they tested the pregnant women of that country, \nthey found that 30 percent of them were HIV positive. They started \npushing for abstinence, faithfulness, and condoms as an effort to \nreduce the incidence of HIV infection. Ten years later, they cut that \ndown from 30 percent of pregnant women to 15 percent--a dramatic \nimprovement. Yet, in this country of 17 million people, there are some \n1.7 million AIDS orphans today.\n  If you travel around Uganda and see how they have dealt with this \nepidemic and the success they have achieved, you come to understand \nhuman nature and the strengths of people who are facing the worst \npossible outcome: an early death from an incurable disease.\n  We went to a clinic called The AIDS Support Organization, TASO. It \nstarted many years ago with a handful of people and has grown into tens \nof thousands of HIV-positive people who come there when they have a \nproblem, when they are fighting off an infection. They do not have the \nAZT cocktail. They can never dream of that. Countries which spend $2, \n$3 per capita annually on public health cannot even imagine spending \n$1,000 to treat AIDS. It is beyond their comprehension.\n  How do they get by? With the basics: With some antibiotics to try to \nget through each infection. They talk about nutrition and improving \ntheir lifestyle, eliminating alcohol and all sorts of things to make \nthem stronger so they can cope with these infections.\n  There is another element that is equally, if not more, important. At \nTASO, there is a choir, a group of about 30, who perform for those who \nvisit. They are all men and women, mothers and fathers, who have AIDS \nthemselves. They sing when you come by.\n\n  In Africa, it is not unusual that when you go to a group, they will \nsing, hello; when you leave, they sing, good-bye. When you are there, \nthey sing about what they are thinking about. It is an African style \nthat really grows on you.\n  But the TASO choir sang some songs they had written. Some of them are \nvery basic--``When We Come Together We Feel Strong.'' This support \ngroup keeps the people going, day in and day out, to know that others \nsuffer from this disease and that they can rely on one another for \nconsoling and for strength. I am proud that the U.S. Government, \nthrough the US Agency for International Development, helps support this \nTASO clinic.\n  As I watched this choir and listened to them sing--and they were very \ngood--I looked into their eyes and thought: There must be some anger or \nresentment about this.\n  There is almost a resignation to this disease, this HIV. One of the \nsongs, which a young lady named Grace had written for the TASO choir is \nentitled ``Why Me?'' It just breaks your heart to hear them sing: ``Why \nme? Why him? Why her? Why you? Why me?\"\n  We went to another project, which I think is a good investment, a \nsupport group called NACWOLA, the National Community of Women Living \nwith AIDS. It is a group that counsels women with AIDS and children. \nThey have a little house in which they come together and meet on a \nregular basis. They talk to one another and try to help one another.\n  They have a special project. It is called the ``Memory Book.'' \nMothers sit down and try to write their life's story in this book, with \nfamily photos, and they talk about where they came from and who their \nparents were and experiences they have had. And they talk about their \nchildren because, you see, they want to leave these books for their \nkids, so that when they are gone--and they know that day is coming--\ntheir children will have this memory book to look at.\n  I sat on the porch there at the NACWOLA house in Kampala, Uganda, as \ntwo of the mothers, Beatrice and Jackie, read to me from their books. I \nrealized then that I was in a nation that had turned into a hospice. \nThese people were not crying. They were not angry. They were doing all \nthey could do. They were trying to get by every day and leave a legacy \nfor the kids who were playing in the yard.\n  The kids gathered around us and started singing. When they started \nsinging, they talked about their future. They know their parents have \nAIDS. They know their lives are uncertain. They said: We hope we don't \nend up with cruel stepparents. We hope we don't end up on the streets. \nAs they were singing, I looked behind me, and there were the mothers \nholding the Memory Books.\n  That is the state of Africa today. Some people ask: Why should we \ncare? It is half a world away. We will never see these people. Of \ncourse, a lot of things have devastated Africa through the generations. \nI think there is more to the story.\n  The AIDS epidemic, most people believe, started in Africa. It is \nquestionable when it started, but most people think it started there. \nIt is now a worldwide epidemic. It is naive to believe that you can \ncontain this kind of health problem and believe that it is not going to \ntravel beyond other countries' borders.\n  Equally important, I think we understand, as Americans, one of the \nthings that makes us different from some other people in the world is \nthat we do care and we do try to make a difference. I think we can make \na significant difference when it comes to this AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n  Let me tell you some of the things we can do and some of the things \nwe are doing.\n  Senator Feingold talked about the medical research going on in \nAfrica. It is not at the same level as medical research in the United \nStates. You do not have drug companies that are inspired by huge \nprofits and think if they can find the cure to AIDS they are going to \nmake billions of dollars. That isn't going to happen. These folks are \nlooking at medical research at a much different level.\n\n  At Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, they have a project underway \nwhere they are testing this drug, Nevirapine. Nevirapine has been \nmentioned on the floor a couple times. A dosage of this drug to a \nmother at the time she goes into labor, and then a dose to the baby, \nbasically cuts in half the transmission of AIDS from mother to child. \nThis is a simple drug, at $4 a dose, which can make a big difference. \nIt is not likely to be a big seller in the United States because no \ndrug company will get rich at $4 a dose. But it works. It appears to \nwork very well.\n  Thank goodness the Centers for Disease Control--part of our \nGovernment--Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and this hospital \nhave come together. They are showing how it can make a difference.\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\n  They are looking for supplements to diet--for example, whether \nadditional vitamin A can mean that a person with HIV can live longer \nand be healthier.\n  They are operating at a lower level because that is all they have to \nwork with. It is a survivalist approach. But it is making life better \nand longer for a lot of people. It is working. We are helping it to \nwork. I am glad the United States is part of that.\n  There is a woman who has become somewhat legendary. Anyone who has \nnot seen this I hope will get a chance to see this Newsweek cover \nstory: ``10 Million Orphans.'' It talks about the AIDS epidemic in \nAfrica. Her name is Bernadette Nakayima, and she lives near Kampala, \nUganda. She had 11 children. Ten of her children died of AIDS. They are \nburied on a hillside by their home. The one surviving daughter lives \nnearby.\n  This 69-year-old grandmother, after her 10 children died, brought in \nthe orphans to her home. She has 35 orphans in her home. How does she \nget by? Well, according to the Newsweek story, at one point she did not \nthink she could. She gathered all the children in a room and said: \nClose the doors and lock them. We're just going to starve to death \nhere. We can't make it. But luckily somebody knocked on the door and \nsaid: Come out. We're going to try to help you. People are trying to \nhelp.\n  As I speak here on the floor today, Sandra Thurman, who is the head \nof the effort to deal with AIDS, is in the gallery. I was in Africa \nwith her. She has visited Bernadette many times. She draws the same \ninspiration, as everyone who goes there, to think of the strength of \nthis woman who, in advancing years, is trying to raise 35 \ngrandchildren, one of whom, incidentally, is HIV positive.\n  How is she getting by? It points to another thing at which we should \nlook; that is the fact that she is part of something called FINCA. \nFINCA is a microcredit program in Africa. Microcredit, as I mentioned \nearlier, is a small loan, primarily to women where they can \ndramatically improve their lives by having a little additional income.\n  Women like Bernadette are able to bring in AIDS orphans and help them \nlead normal lives in a family setting rather than on the streets.\n  One of the meetings I had with a FINCA group was in Lugazi, Uganda. I \nwill not soon forget where we had the meeting. Our meeting of 20 women, \nwho were coming to report on their loans and to seek additional credit \nassistance, took place in a little hut that a few days before had been \na chicken coop. The chickens, who had been moved out of that coop to \nthe adjoining room, squawked during the whole meeting. But these ladies \nwere not going to be deterred by a few angry roasters. They were there \nto get on with the business. The business was borrowing money to \nimprove their lives.\n  I asked one of the ladies: What have these microcredit loans meant to \nyou? She said, through an interpreter: Because of these loans, my knees \nhave gone soft. I had no idea what she was talking about. She \nexplained. She said: Before I had microcredit, before I had more \nincome, I used to have to crawl on my knees to my husband to beg for \nmoney for food for the children and to send the kids to school. Now I \nhave some money. I don't have to crawl. My knees are going soft.\n\n  That story was repeated over and over again by the 20 women gathered \nthere. I said: How many of you who are borrowing this money, by these \nsmall loans that make such a difference, have brought in AIDS orphans \nto your home? Half of them raised their hand--two children here, and \nfour here, and six here. They had the wherewithal to do it.\n  In countries where people survive on 30 cents a day, it does not take \nmuch to dramatically improve the quality of life and keep these \nchildren within the extended family. It can help. It can work.\n  The second thing that is helping is food assistance. We are directing \nfood assistance in areas where we know that we have serious problems \nwith AIDS orphans. We need to do more in this regard.\n  I use these examples so that people who might otherwise want to throw \nup their hands and say: Well, it is a problem we should worry about, \nbut how can we possibly address it if there are so many people \nvictimized by it? There are things we can do, small things for a great \nnation to do, that can make a great difference, small things that can \nsave lives and give families a chance.\n  I am going to introduce legislation today which is entitled: ``The \nAIDS Orphans Relief Act of 2000.'' It addresses microcredit to try to \nincrease it as an effort to help AIDS orphans find homes and to \nincrease food assistance for that same purpose.\n  This is not going to solve the problem, by a long shot. There is so \nmuch we need to do in the areas of research and prevention, creating an \ninfrastructure for distributing the medicines that are available in \nAfrica. I hope this will be one part of an agenda, that we can gather \ntogether and speak, as Senator Feingold and Senator Feinstein did, \nabout the pharmaceutical side of it, address the larger issues that the \nWorld Bank might be able to help us with, through Senator John Kerry's \nbill and Congressman Jim Leach's bill, and invite all of the Members of \nthe Senate to focus on this issue in a bipartisan fashion. I believe \nsincerely we can make a difference.\n\n  It has been said earlier that this devastating disease is lowering \nthe life expectancy of people in Africa. You find, when you go to some \ncountries, such as South Africa, that employers will hire two people \nfor a skilled position because they know one is not going to survive. \nThose are the odds. That is what they are up against. It calls on us to \nfocus on what we can do to help.\n  A little while ago we had a meeting of Democratic Senators not far \nfrom the floor, and Sandy Thurman, our AIDS director, was there, as \nwell as a young woman named Rory Kennedy. She is the daughter of Robert \nKennedy. She has been recognized for her skill as a producer of \ndocumentary films. She presented for us a 12-minute documentary film on \nthe AIDS epidemic in Africa. It is a film she put together when she \nvisited with a group not that long ago. It really does put in human \nterms what I am trying to say in words.\n  You see the faces of those little children. You see the trips to the \ngraveyard to bury babies who have died because of HIV. You go down the \nroad, as you would in Kampala, Uganda, and you notice the stalls of \nproduce. Then at the end, you see the huge sign that says ``coffins.''\n  When I spoke to the Ambassador, Martin Brennan, he told of going to a \nvillage outside of Kampala and seeing in the town square stacks and \nstacks of coffins. It, unfortunately, is a big growth industry in \nAfrica. It calls on us to address this in so many different ways.\n  Let me tell you another way that may not seem obvious that is part of \nthis as well. While we were traveling in Uganda, we went to an \nagricultural research station. This is a station which brought together \nsome ag research which the United States has supported for years. \nCassava is a basic root crop used as a staple for the diet of many \npeople in central and eastern Africa. Not that long ago, there was this \nvirus that affected this crop and dramatically reduced it. People were \ngoing hungry and starving to death. Because of this research at this \nstation they have found ways to end this so-called mosaic virus. People \nare now seeing this cassava grow, and they are once again feeding their \nfamilies.\n  It was a little thing, lost in the budget of the Department of \nAgriculture, which means that millions have a chance to live. Some \npeople will question ag research from time to time, even mock it. Yet \nwe see day to day in Africa and in the United States that it pays off. \nThis is a part of the world that has been ravaged by civil war, ravaged \nby famines as bad as the potato famine, ravaged by epidemic, now as bad \nas the bubonic plague, all of these things are coming down on central \nAfrica like four horsemen of the apocalypse. They are coping with it \nevery single day.\n  We need to do all we can to make sure that our country, working with \nother countries, can try to stop this crisis from getting any worse. \nThe lessons we will learn in Africa will help us save lives there. It \nwill help us take the message to other parts of the world, such as \nIndia and other parts of Asia, that are threatened with this epidemic. \nBut there is something else we will learn. We will learn from the \ncourage and compassion of the people who\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\nlive in this area that there is strength in the darkest hour.\n  I came back from this trip determined to do something. I hope that \nwith this meeting today of several Senators on the floor of the Senate \nwe can start this dialog. I think we cannot only reach across the aisle \nto my friends on the Republican side and share our feelings, but reach \nout beyond this Chamber and beyond this Government. I think we can \nreach out to churches across America.\n  I have written a letter to the Catholic bishops in my home State of \nIllinois. There, as a little boy growing up, I used to give pennies and \nnickels every day to the missions. It was something they did \nautomatically in Catholic schools when you were growing up. I didn't \nknow where that money was going. I barely knew what the missions were. \nBut when I went to Sunday Mass at the basilica in Nairobi, Kenya, and \nsaw 2,000 people, standing room only, I found out where that money \nwent. It converted a lot of people to Catholicism, as the Anglican \nChurch converted a lot of people to their religion. Now we have a \nchance to say to some of these religions, such as Catholicism and \nothers: We made an investment in Africa at a time when they needed our \nhelp, and now they need it again. Can we bring together the religions \nof the United States that have focused on Africa and try to cope with \nthis crisis?\n  The head of the National AIDS Commission in Uganda is a retired \nCatholic bishop. I think that says a lot. It says that they are \ncrossing religious boundaries in an attempt to deal with this epidemic \nand this crisis.\n  When it comes to the security side of this issue, I have spoken about \nthe military in Uganda, and I am afraid it is the case in so many other \ncountries. They, too, are infected, and that is a source of concern for \nall of us. If your military cannot respond to a crisis in the country, \nit fosters instability. It creates security problems which reach far \nbeyond that country, that may even involve the United States, as in the \npast 10 years we have been to Africa on peacekeeping missions, some \nwith tragic results.\n  So if we can work, and I hope we can, through our skills and our \nmilitary to help them cope with this disease in the ranks of the \nmilitaries in Africa, it is good for them and their countries. It is \ngood for our world. I will be working with my colleagues to see if we \ncan achieve that.\n  Let me close by thanking the Chair for this opportunity to speak. I \nhave gone beyond the usual allotment of time. I thank the Chair for his \npatience in that regard. I hope in this session of Congress we can come \ntogether as they do at TASO in Kampala, Uganda, and find the strength \nand support to care for people halfway around the world, people perhaps \nof different color from some of us, but people who are our brothers and \nsisters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, HIV/AIDS in Africa has become a global \nemergency unlike anything that public health has seen in this century. \nAccording to Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, ``AIDS in Africa \nis a plague of biblical proportions. It is a holy war that we must \nwin.''\n  The number of HIV-infected individuals in Africa has now reached 22.5 \nmillion. As a nation, America is all too familiar with the devastation \nthat AIDS causes. Nearly 10 years ago, Senator Hatch and I sponsored \nthe Ryan White CARE act, the legislation that helped begin the long \nbattle to deal with the AIDS epidemic in this country. The situation \nhas steadily improved in the United States, because extensive efforts \nhave been made and needed systems of care have been put in place. The \nCARE Act has helped us make great progress.\n  We began our fight against AIDS in the United States with the \nadvantage of having the world's most advanced health care \ninfrastructure, but the situation in the developing world is much \ndifferent. Resources are scarce, infrastructure is limited, and the \npeople of Africa face a situation that is not improving but is steadily \ngrowing worse.\n  Officials at UNICEF have described the situation that many nations in \nsub-Saharan Africa face as a ``tripod of deprivation'' that involves \npoverty, debt and AIDS. Any of these three crises would be severe on \nits own. Taken together they are devastating. The result for the \nAfrican continent is enormous pain, suffering, and death. Decades of \nprogress on economic growth, infant mortality, and life expectancy are \nall threatened. The AIDS virus is infecting every aspect of life for \nthe people of Africa, from work and family to education and even \nnational stability.\n  The effect on the African workforce is especially ominous. African \nnations have worked hard for the economic development that is emerging. \nBut HIV is striking vast numbers of individuals during their most \nproductive years, and all of this recent progress is being placed in \njeopardy. AIDS directly undermines productivity by increasing \nabsenteeism. It raises the cost of business through increased need for \nbenefits. Costs of recruiting and training employees are rising, as \ncurrent employees die or become disabled. Higher costs also threaten \ninternational investment in Africa, which is essential for future \neconomic development.\n  Over 8 million children have already been orphaned by AIDS in Africa. \nIn the next decade, that number will reach 40 million, a number equal \nto the total number of children in the United States who live east of \nthe Mississippi River. Children are forced to leave their schools in \norder to care for dying parents and put food on the table for \nthemselves and their family. Many of these children are already \nsuffering emotionally from the loss of one or both of their parents, \nand now they are losing the vital educational opportunities they need \nand deserve.\n  HIV infection rates are as high as 80 percent in some African \nmilitary forces, and the disease is threatening the security and \nstability of these nations. Forces that have been weakened by \ndisease are less capable of defending their nations, maintaining order, \nor protecting citizens. The concern is immediate. A 1998 UNAIDS study \nreported that in both Zimbabwe and Cameroon, HIV infection rates were \nthree to four times higher in the military than in the civilian \npopulation.\n\n  While new therapies have begun to offer hope in the fight against \nAIDS in the United States, the cost of these treatments has put them \nout of reach for developing countries, where the epidemic is raging out \nof control. During the past six years, there has been a 300 percent \nincrease in annual cases of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet until \nthis year, U.S. funding for AIDS programs overseas had remained level-\nfunded at $125 million. When inflation is taken into account, level \nfunding means a 25 percent decrease between 1993 and 1999.\n  Last year, many of us in Congress and the administration worked hard \nto obtain an additional $100 million to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic in \nAfrica. This funding was a vital first step towards turning the tide, \nbut it is not nearly enough. This money will be used for prevention \nefforts, counseling and testing, direct medical services, and also to \nassist the millions of children orphaned by AIDS in the region. The \nadditional $100 million that President Clinton has included in his \nFY2001 budget will enable us to reach an even greater proportion of \npeople infected with HIV in Africa.\n  Yesterday I cosponsored the bipartisan legislation introduced by \nSenator Barbara Boxer and Senator Gordon Smith that extends the U.S. \ncommitment to sub-Saharan Africa through 2005. We know that increased \nU.S. aid for Africa is essential. In partnership with other donors, the \nU.S. invested $46 million in HIV prevention and care in Uganda, and \nhelped cut the HIV rates by more than half.\n  Prevention is effective, but it costs money. Treatment and care also \ncost money. Yet the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are among the poorest \nin the world, and they cannot and should not bear this burden alone. \nThe U.S. is the leading donor of development assistance for HIV/AIDS \nprevention and control in the developing world, but our response to \nthis crisis has so far been inadequate. The United States currently \nranks ninth in terms of the percentage of GNP devoted to international \nAIDS programs. This is not the leadership that this country has shown \nin the past, when nations have been torn apart by tragedy.\n  I recently learned about a couple in Senegal who were both stricken \nby HIV. They have a small shop that sells newspapers, candy and other \ngoods,\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\nand are economically well-off in comparison to many of their fellow \ncitizens. Their financial situation allowed them to afford some AIDS \ndrugs, but the cost of basic treatment for one person takes thirty \npercent of their monthly income. They have been forced to choose which \none of them will take these life-saving medications. That is a decision \nthat no couple should have to make.\n  The rate at which AIDS has spread in developing countries should \nalarm all nations and peoples. The world is too small for us to think \nthat a virus which has infected 34 million people and killed 14 million \nis under control and will not continue to infect our own country.\n  This global epidemic has already taken more lives than all but one of \nthe major conflicts of this century. Only World War II surpasses AIDS \nin terms of human devastation in this century. We cannot stand by and \nlet this level of suffering continue.\n  We can and must do more as a nation to fight this growing global \nepidemic. It is estimated that by the year 2005 more than 100 million \npeople worldwide will have become infected with HIV--100 million \npeople. The magnitude of the emergency is immense. What will we tell \nour children and our grandchildren about how we faced the largest human \ntragedy of our time? I hope that we can tell them that we reached \nacross the aisle and then across the ocean to help those caught in this \nrelentless epidemic. This is not about Democrats or Republicans.\n  This is about America, and what we stand for as a nation and as a \nworld leader. I urge my colleagues to do all we can to save lives and \nease this tragic suffering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S325-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S325-S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MICROSOFT AND THE AMICUS BRIEF\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is an appropriate time to bring my \ncolleagues up to speed on the continuing saga that is the Microsoft \nanti-trust trial. Since I last came to the floor to discuss this issue, \nthe industry, of which Microsoft is a part, has once again changed \ndramatically. For instance, American Online recently triggered the \nlargest corporate merger in history with the acquisition of Time-\nWarner. This media giant is now poised to compete vigorously in every \naspect of the Internet, from the wires that connect you, to the content \nyou watch. To meet this challenge, Microsoft and a legion of its \ncompetitors must be allowed to compete vigorously in the ever-changing \nlandscape of the information technology industry.\n  My fellow Senators will soon receive a ``dear colleague'' letter \nendorsing an amicus brief filed on behalf of Microsoft by the \nAssociation for Competitive Technology (ACT). ACT is a nonprofit \nassociation representing more than 9,000 companies in the information \ntechnology industry. ACT's membership is made up mostly of small and \nmedium sized businesses but includes household names such as CompUSA, \nExcite at Home, Intel, Microsoft and Symantec. These members come from \nall walks of the industry, unified by the cause of protecting \ncompetition and innovation in the industry.\n  This brief was prepared by a bi-partisan group of legal heavyweights \nincluding former White House Counsels Lloyd Cutler and C. Boyden Gray \nas well as former Attorneys General Griffin Bell and Nicholas \nKatzenbach. It eloquently reinforces many of the points that I have \nmade on the Senate floor for over a year now. In the end, I think you \nwill agree that this document reveals the glaring weaknesses in the \nDoJ's case against Microsoft.\n  The amicus brief reinforces the point that current antitrust laws \nexpressly allow, and even encourage, the kind of competitive activity \nthat the government seeks to stop; the kind of competition that \ncontinues to benefit not only consumers, but the hundreds of thousands \nof high-tech workers and entrepreneurs in the software and hardware \nindustries as well. It also sounds the familiar refrain that the \ngovernment needs to take a highly pragmatic and cautious approach to \nantitrust enforcement in this dynamic industry.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Jackson found last year that Microsoft's Windows \nholds a lawfully acquired monopoly of the market for ``operating \nsystems'' for Intel-compatible personal computers. Although Microsoft \nmay later challenge this finding, the brief assumes for purposes of \nargument that the finding is correct.\n  The plaintiffs (the federal government and several states) charge \nthat Microsoft, in adding the Internet Explorer browser to Windows and \nmarketing the package, violated antitrust laws. The amicus brief--and \nthe Supreme Court cases on which it relies--demonstrates that the \npurpose of the antitrust laws is to protect consumers and competition--\nnot competitors--and that Microsoft, far from violating the antitrust \nlaws, competed vigorously to the immense benefit of consumers.\n  Vigorous competition, which antitrust laws are designed to protect, \nproduces innovation, better products, more efficient distribution, and \nlower prices. All of these results of competition are to the benefit of \nconsumers. The antitrust laws do not require competing firms to be nice \nto one another, or protect firms against their more powerful rivals. It \nis not wrong for any company to want to take business away from its \nrivals.\n  The antitrust laws encourage a firm that holds a lawfully acquired \nmonopoly to compete hard to keep that monopoly. They also encourage \nsuch a firm to enter other fields where, by competing with better and \ncheaper products, it can benefit consumers.\n  Judge Jackson found that the widespread use of the Windows operating \nsystem has made it is a platform for a vast range of computer \napplications that consumers now enjoy.\n  Judge Jackson also found that when Microsoft added a superior \nInternet browser (Internet Explorer) and offered it to consumers at no \nextra charge, these actions gave consumers better access to the \nInternet and spurred its rival Netscape to improve the quality of its \n``Navigator'' browser and to distribute it at no charge.\n  Microsoft did not drive Netscape's Navigator out of the browser \nmarket. On the contrary, even Judge Jackson found that Netscape's \n``installed base'' has more than doubled since 1995 and will continue \nto grow in the future. Browser competition remains vigorous.\n  Microsoft did successfully break into the browser market and did \nobtain a share of that market for itself. The single most important \nreason, as even Judge Jackson found, is that Microsoft rival AOL itself \nchose and re-chose Internet Explorer over Navigator, even though AOL \nnow owns Netscape. AOL made that choice because Microsoft offered a \nbetter product, better service, and better marketing support than did \nNetscape.\n\n  Microsoft's agreements with PC manufacturers and Internet access \nproviders to distribute Internet Explorer were lawful agreements \ndesigned to help Microsoft break into a browser market in which \nNetscape was the overwhelmingly dominant firm. It was good for \ncompetition and consumers, for Microsoft to introduce competition into \nthat market.\n  The plaintiff's theory is essentially that Microsoft, once it had a \nlawful monopoly in the operating systems market, should not have \naggressively entered the browser market, because Netscape's dominance \nof that market might have led to more competition in operating systems. \nThat theory is bad law. Again, the law protects consumers, not \ncompetitors. Consumers benefit when any firm, including one holding a \nlawful monopoly, competes aggressively to challenge another firm's \nincipient monopoly in a related field.\n  This competition helped usher in the most important change occurring \non earth today. The power of information has been taken from a few \nlarge centralized institutions and put directly into the hands of \npeople in every town and village across our globe via the Internet.\n  Not only is the number of users increasing exponentially, but the \namount of information available to them is also growing at an \nunprecedented rate. The International Data Corporation estimated the \nnumber of web pages on the World Wide Web at 829 million at the end of \n1998, and projects that the number will be 7.7 billion by 2002.\n  The explosive growth of the Internet will eventually have a \nfundamental impact on every aspect of American life, and will introduce \na vastly different landscape in high-technology than exists today. \nUsers will not necessarily\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\nuse stationary personal computers to access information, but instead \nrely on Web phones, palmtop computers and similar technology that is \ndeveloping at an exponential rate. Microsoft must be allowed to compete \nin order to survive this transition.\n  Although Microsoft is a large and powerful company, it faces \naggressive present and future competition in every field it enters, and \nif it wants to maintain its present position it must compete vigorously \non every front, with innovations, improved quality and lower prices. \nThat is exactly what antitrust policy seeks to promote.\n  For a court to enter into this vitally important and rapidly changing \nfield and seek to dictate what products shall be made and sold by which \nfirms would be a tragic mistake. For example, if a few years ago a \ncourt had ordered Microsoft not to add Internet Explorer to Windows, \nthere would today be fewer hardware manufacturers, fewer software \ndevelopers, fewer applications, and a far less developed Internet, and \nthe world would be a poorer place.\n  The best solution for both the administration and the courts is to \nretire from the field and to allow the most dynamic company in the \nhistory of technology to continue its growth in a competitive market, \nfree from government interference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S326-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to design and \nconstruct a warm water fish hatchery at Fort Peck Lake, Montana; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n         the fort peck fish hatchery authorization act of 2000\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fort \nPeck Fish Hatchery Authorization Act of 2000. As you may know, the Fort \nPeck project was built in the 1930s to dam the Upper Missouri River. \nThe original authorization legislation for the Fort Peck project, and \nsubsequent revisions and additions, left a great many promises unmet. A \nvalley was flooded, but originally Montana was promised increased \nirrigation, low-cost power, and economic development. Since the \noriginal legislation, numerous laws have been enacted promising \nincreased recreational activities on the lake, and also that the \nfederal government would do more to support the fish and wildlife \nresources in the area.\n  In this day and age, economic development in rural areas is becoming \nmore and more dependent upon recreation and strong fish and wildlife \nnumbers. The Fort Peck area is faced with a number of realities. First, \nthe area is in dire need of a fish hatchery. The only hatchery in the \nregion to support warm water species is found in Miles City, Montana. \nIt is struggling to meet the needs of the fisheries in the area, yet it \ncontinues to fall short. Additionally, an outbreak of disease or \nfailure in the infrastructure at the Miles City hatchery would leave \nthe entire region reeling with no secondary source to support the \narea's fisheries.\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\n  We are also faced with the reality that despite the promises given, \nthe State of Montana has had to foot the bill for fish hatchery \noperations in the area. Since about 1950 the State has been funding \nthese operations with little to no support from the Corps of Engineers. \nA citizens group spanning the State of Montana finally decided to make \nthe federal government keep its promises.\n  Last year the citizens group organized, and state legislation \nsubsequently passed to authorize the sale of a warm water fishing stamp \nto begin collecting funds for the eventual operation and maintenance of \nthe hatchery. I helped the group work with the Corps of Engineers to \nensure that $125,000 in last year's budget was allocated to a \nfeasibility study for the project, and Montanans kept their end of the \nbargain by finding another $125,000 to match the Corps expenditure. \nClearly, we are putting our money, along with our sweat, where our \nmouth is.\n  Recreation is part of the local economy. But the buzzword today is \ndiversity. Diversify your economy. The Fort Peck area depends \npredominately on agriculture. More irrigated acres probably aren't \ngoing to help the area pull itself up by its boot straps. But a \nstronger recreational and tourism industry sure will help speed things \nup.\n  A lot of effort has already gone into this project. A state bill has \nbeen passed. The Corps has dedicated a project manager to the project. \nCitizens have raised money and jumped over more hurdles than I care to \ncount. But the bottom line is that this is a great project with immense \nsupport. It is a good investment in the area, and it helps the federal \ngovernment fulfill one thing that it ought to--its promises.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge that this legislation is still a \nwork in progress and many of the specifics will change as the Corps \ncompletes its feasibility study on the project. It may cost slightly \nmore. It may cost less. The cost share requirement may need to be \naltered to make the project work, but I feel this legislation must be \nintroduced now to expedite its consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Abraham, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2028. A bill to make permanent the moratorium enacted by the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act as it applies to new, multiple, and \ndiscriminatory taxes on the Internet; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    internet non-discrimination act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Internet Non-\nDiscrimination Act. The central principle of this bill is that our tax \npolicy should not discriminate against the most vibrant part of our \nnation's economy. The legislation would extend indefinitely the \nInternet Tax Freedom's Act's three-year moratorium on discriminatory \ntaxes against the Internet and electronic commerce. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senators Abraham and Leahy.\n  Three years ago, when Congressman Chris Cox and I introduced the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA), we said you can't squeeze the new \neconomy into a set of rules written for smokestack industry. At that \ntime, opponents predicted that retailers would vanish from Main Streets \nacross America. Transcripts from hearings held on the legislation in \nthe summer of 1997 are replete with opponents' predictions that a \nparade of horribles would be visited on every small merchant in every \ntown in the United States. I am pleased to report that none of the \nhorribles has come to pass.\n  In fact, this is what has happened in the 15 months since the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act was passed by the Senate 98-2 and became law.\n\n  States and localities have continued to collect sales and use taxes, \nand state budgets ended fiscal l999 with a $35 billion surplus. In \nCalifornia--one of the most wired states--1999 sales tax collections \nare up 20 percent over 1998.\n  Traditional bricks and mortar retailers had one of their best holiday \nseasons, recording a nearly 8% jump in sales over the previous year.\n  A recent survey of 1,500 Main Street businesses nationwide found that \n74 percent have gone online since l997.\n  E-commerce has become part of the retail landscape, but still \naccounts for only \\3/10\\s of one percent of total retail sales.\n  States with the highest level of Internet use are also those with \nsome of the largest gains in tax revenues.\n  It is clear to me that while state and local tax collectors sat \nwringing their hands, America's merchants were working on web pages. \nMain Street merchants seized the opportunity to expand their sales to \nnew markets by going online. They also recognized the efficiencies of \nconducting their business-to-business transactions online. Rather than \nweaken Main Street merchants, the Internet has strengthened them. \nRather than drain state and local tax coffers, the technological \nneutrality of the Internet Tax Freedom Act allowed online business to \ngrow and state and local authorities to continue to collect lawful, \nnondiscriminatory taxes. The technological neutrality of the ITFA \ncontributed to the rapid transformation of a bricks and mortar economy \ninto a clicks and mortar economy.\n  I want the success of the bricks and clicks economy to continue, but \nconsumers and businesses need some certainty. They need to know they \nwon't have to start paying new taxes targeted specifically at e-\ncommerce when the current moratorium expires in October 2001. That's \nwhy the ban on discriminatory taxes against the Internet and e-commerce \nshould be made permanent.\n  The Internet Non-Discrimination Act we are introducing today will do \njust that. It continues the policy of technological neutrality. It \nallows state and local tax authorities to continue to collect lawful, \nnondiscriminatory sales or use taxes on online sales. It will give the \ngovernors time to see if they can move forward with their technological \nfix for collecting remote sales and use tax--a voluntary plan which \nwill require the cooperation of every business in this nation, from \nBandon, Oregon to Bangor, Maine. And, finally, it extends permanently a \npolicy that has worked well for the last 15 months and under which \nconsumers, businesses and state and local tax collectors have lived--\nand thrived.\n  In about two months the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce \nwill issue its final report. After having talked yesterday with the \nChairman of the Commission, Virginia Governor James Gilmore, I am \nhopeful that the Commission will endorse the approach we are taking in \nthis bill.\n  If Congress does not act this year to extend the technologically \nneutral policy that is at the heart of the Internet Non-Discrimination \nAct, consumers and businesses will face thousands of tax authorities in \nthis country jumping into their pockets when the current moratorium \nexpires in October 2001. Consumers and businesses want certainty that \nthey won't suddenly be facing an onslaught of new, confusing and \ndiscriminatory taxes.\n  A companion bill is being introduced in the House of Representatives \ntoday by Congressman Chris Cox, with whom I've worked on this issue for \nfour years now. I am hopeful that this, our fourth bipartisan Internet \neffort, will be as successful as our previous three. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Nondiscrimination \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPLACEMENT OF MORATORIUM WITH PERMANENT BAN ON NEW, \n                   MULTIPLE, AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXES ON THE \n                   INTERNET.\n\n       Section 1101(a) of title XI of division C of Public Law \n     105-277 is amended by striking ``during the period beginning \n     on October 1, 1998, and ending 3 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act'' and inserting ``on or after October \n     1, 1998.''\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Wyden, in introducing legislation to extend indefinitely the \ncurrent moratorium on new and discriminatory Internet taxes. Once \nagain, Senator Wyden has demonstrated his grasp of the crucial issues \nsurrounding electronic commerce and has moved rapidly to assure that \npotential barriers to the new economy are eliminated before they do any \nharm. I am pleased to join him in his latest effort.\n\n[[Page S330]]\n\n  By now, it is obvious to everyone that e-commerce is the wave of the \nfuture. As a matter of fact, it's safe to say that the future is \nalready here. During the week of December 6 alone, Americans bought \n$1.22 billion of merchandise online. Sales for 1999 should reach $64.8 \nbillion. Beyond shopping, 5.3 million households had access to \nfinancial transactions like electronic banking and stock trading by the \nend of last year.\n  The rate of growth for Internet commerce has been exponential for the \npast several years. Unfortunately, it's also a tempting target for \ntaxation by the Federal Government, States and localities. And that \ncould slow the growth of e-commerce and of our entire economy.\n  We responded to this potential problem by passing Senator Wyden's \nlegislation in 1998, to place a three-year moratorium on new or \ndiscriminatory Internet taxes, fees or charges. That legislation also \nestablished a Commission to explore the issue of Internet taxation and \nto submit to Congress a list of recommendations on how the Federal \nGovernment should legislate in this area.\n  We are only halfway through the moratorium, but already it seems \nthere are only two possible conclusions to the Commission. The first is \nthat the wide differences of opinion within the Commission will make it \nimpossible for the members to muster the majority of support necessary \nto submit a report. This is worrisome, Mr. President, because, unless \naction is taken by this Congress, the moratorium will expire and the \ndoor will be opened to new, discriminatory taxes on the Internet.\n  The other possibility, more recently offered, is that the Commission \nmay actually recommend an extension of the current moratorium. Whatever \nthe conclusion therefore, the role of Congress is clear; the Internet \nTax Moratorium must be extended indefinitely. And because of the \nlimited number of legislative days scheduled in this election year, the \nprocess of doing so should begin now.\n\n  As everyone knows, the current moratorium only precludes new and \ndiscriminatory taxes. It does not address the more difficult question \nof how to apply existing, State sales taxes to Internet transactions. \nThe Supreme Court has spoken to this issue, ruling that States can \nindeed impose taxes on transactions much like Internet sales--namely \ncatalog sales. However, States cannot force a business to collect sales \ntaxes on purchases made to States where they have no physical presence \nor ``nexus.'' This discrepancy in sales taxation between main street \nbusinesses and those that sell goods over the Internet will be \ndifficult to address for the following reasons:\n  First, very soon every business will be an e-business in the sense \nthat they will be using the Internet for sales, supplies, contracting \nand other purposes. We couldn't stop this process if we wanted to, and \nwe shouldn't want to. According to one recent survey, 74 percent of \nbrick and mortar, main street businesses have added ``click and \nmortar'' Internet services to their business.\n  Second, the border less nature of the Internet is going to make it \ndifficult--if not impossible--to determine what constitutes ``nexus.'' \nFor example, what happens when someone in California uses America \nOnline in Virginia to order fudge from the ``shopmackinac'' website in \nMichigan, and ships them to a friend in Rhode Island? Which State \nshould claim ``nexus?''\n  Perhaps a ``destination-based'' Internet sales tax regime would be \nmore effective in terms of collecting State sales taxes. Whatever the \neventual outcome, I believe that in light of the present uncertainty it \nwould not be proper for Congress to intervene on this issue. The States \nmust have every opportunity to debate and possibly even initiate a \nmodel for addressing the current impasse.\n  What is necessary is Congressional action to ensure that new, \ndiscriminatory taxes are not levied on the Internet by States or \nlocalities as a means of substituting perceived lost revenue. Many \nGovernors--including Governor Engler of Michigan--support an extension \nof the current Internet tax moratorium.\n  Access fees and similar Internet taxes, whether imposed by the \nStates, localities, or the Federal government, pose a grave threat to \nthe continued evolution of the Internet. America is experiencing a \nrecord period of growth and prosperity. In my view, the continued \nexpansion of the economy is due primarily to electronic commerce. The \nspirit of entrepreneurship which has energized our nation, the adoption \nof new business models to more fully explore marketing and sales \npossibilities and the dramatic increase in consumer and business \nservices are all largely the product of our new e-economy. Why on earth \nwould anyone, or any government, want to threaten this dynamic medium \nwhen it is still in its infancy by increasing the cost of doing \nbusiness over the Internet? I certainly do not, and I will continue to \nwork to ensure that neither the Federal government nor other units of \ngovernment threaten electronic commerce.\n\n  If we are able to keep the government focused on removing impediments \nto electronic commerce rather than interfering in the development and \nimplementation of new technologies then very soon the e-economy will \nsimply be the economy, and our nation will be more prosperous as a \nresult.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Robb, Ms. Collins, Mr. Helms, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \n        Murray, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 2029. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \ntelemarketers from interfering with the caller identification service \nof any person to whom a telephone solicitation is made, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    THE KNOW YOUR CALLER ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join today with my friend \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Frist, to introduce the Know Your Caller Act of \n2000--a bill that will make a real and immediate difference in the \nlives of all Americans.\n  Not a week goes by that I don't hear from Virginians about the \nintrusion of telemarketers into their homes. Although Congress passed \nthe Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, in 1991, the law is \nwidely abused--telemarketers openly disregard the law, refusing to \nidentify themselves when asked, and ignoring requests to be placed on \n``do not call lists.''\n  In recent years, consumers have turned to caller ID services to help \nthem screen out unwanted calls and report those who violate current law \nto the authorities. Unfortunately, most telemarketers actively block \ntheir number from being displayed on caller ID systems, making it \ndifficult to determine the name and employer of the telemarketer. We \nalready require telemarketers to identify themselves when they call, \nand we should apply this same requirement to their caller ID \ninformation.\n  The Know Your Caller Act of 2000 will prevent companies from blocking \ntheir identities on caller ID. Our legislation will require every phone \nsolicitor to reveal the name of the telemarketer who is making the \ncall, as well as a valid telephone number where that company can be \nreached for purposes of being placed on the do-not-call lists required \nunder current law.\n  It's time that we gave consumers a way to fight back against these \nintrusions into their homes, and this bill is the perfect way to do so: \nby putting an end to caller ID blocks, we can empower the consumer to \ntake action against violators of the TCPA and regain control of their \ntelephones. I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator Frist and me in \nsupporting this important consumer protection bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2032. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \naddress the issue of mother-to-child transmission of human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Africa, Asia, and Latin America; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n               mother-to-child hiv prevention act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, the Mother-to-\nchild HIV Prevention Act, a bill that seeks to address mother-to-child \ntransmission of HIV in developing regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\n  According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), \nnearly 4.5 million children below the age of 15 years have been \ninfected with HIV since the AIDS epidemic began. More than 3 million \nhave already died of AIDS. Children are becoming infected at the rate \nof nearly one child every minute, and the overwhelming majority of \nthese children acquired the infection from their mothers.\n  In July 1999, the National Institutes of Health released a report on \nthe effectiveness of a drug called nevirapine (NVP) in preventing \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV. NVP is given just once to the \nmother during labor and once to the baby within three days after birth. \nIt costs $4 per tablet. The discovery of this relatively simple and \ninexpensive drug regimen--along with others like it--has created an \nunprecedented opportunity for international cooperation in the fight \nagainst the vertical transmission of HIV.\n  USAID is currently engaged in four of the eleven vertical \ntransmission pilot projects in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These \nstudies will be completed within the year, at which point the \nintervention programs can undergo a significant increase in scale. But \nadditional funding is needed.\n  The cost-effectiveness of these programs is clear. New antiretroviral \ndrug strategies can be a force for social change, providing the \nopportunity and impetus needed to address long-standing problems in the \nhealth care system and the profound stigma associated with HIV-\ninfection and the AIDS disease.\n  Naturally, primary prevention strategies should remain the top \npriority in the fight against AIDS, which is why I am requesting these \nfunds in addition to our current efforts. This legislation would give \nthe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) an additional $25 \nmillion every year--for the next five years--to address the growing \ninternational dilemma of child victims of the AIDS epidemic.\n  Mr. President, this bill has the potential to improve the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of children whose lives are marred by this \ndisease. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I urge \nits swift passage into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2034. A bill to establish the Canyons of the Ancients National \nConservation Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the canyons of the ancients national conservation area act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill help ensure that priceless public lands, including the Yellow \nJacket Canyon in the Southwestern corner of my beautiful home state of \nColorado, are preserved and managed in the most farsighted and balanced \nmanner possible.\n  I have developed this legislation with the Department of the Interior \nand the local government bodies. It successfully takes into account the \nconcerns of all interested parties. The lands I hope we can protect \nwere the home to a rich civilization before the existence of this \nhemisphere was known to the western world.\n  It is imperative we protect these lands now in a reasonable manner to \nrecognize the historical, archeological and cultural value they hold. \nBut, I do not believe we should lock these lands from the public. When \npublic lands are suddenly grabbed away by executive decree it creates \nill feelings and distrust.\n  The hardest hit are those people who live near the land, know it the \nbest and whose livelihood is most connected to it. These are almost \nalways hard working families. Elected local and state governments are \nalso losers. Land grabs seriously erode the very tax base that enables \ntowns, counties and states to provide the services the people need, \nincluding schools, law enforcement, and fire protection. Finally, \nparticipatory democracy, our nation's bedrock, also loses when an \nexecutive decree is used to end run the American people and those they \nhave chosen to represent them in Congress.\n  Through close consultation with the acting BLM director, Tom Fry, I \nhave drafted a bill which should take into consideration the views of \ninterested parties. I will submit for the record at the conclusion of \nmy statement a number of letters from local organizations and elected \nofficials who support this effort to designate a National Conservation \nArea. It will allow many of the area's current uses to stay intact \nwhile preserving the ancient treasures found there.\n  I consider the declaration of national monuments by this \nadministration by executive order another example of restricting the \nuse of more public land without working with Congressional delegations, \nlocal officials, and other interested parties, as was the case with the \nGrand Staircase-Escalante Monument designation in Utah.\n  My bill makes sure that the involved parties take part in land \nmanagement decisions in Colorado. I am trying to ensure that all of the \nconcerns of the people who live and work in the area are heard and \naddressed before any designation is made by the administration on these \npublic lands.\n  My bill would require public hearings which would allow everyone \ninvolved from local ranchers, recreational users, and all local elected \nofficials to be involved with preserving this area.\n  As I stated in a letter to Interior Secretary Babbitt on June 8, \n1999, Coloradans do not want to see another Grand Staircase-Escalante \nMonument designation in Colorado. Secretary Babbitt in a letter to Mr. \nEd Zink dated November 9, 1999, declared his intent to designating the \nAnasazi area a national monument by the authority of the Antiquities \nAct of 1906. My bill proposes a compromise to preserve this area with \nlocal input, and avoid the heavy handed action of a monument \ndesignation by the President.\n  My legislation will create a National Conservation Area which will \nallow the historic uses to take place while efforts are made to \nconserve the area. I am introducing this legislation to alert the \npresident and the secretary that the citizens in Southwest Colorado \ndesire protection of the area but oppose an executive action that \nbypasses Congress. This can be accomplished through the legislative \nprocess with a hearing scheduled on my bill early this year during the \nsecond half of the 106th Congress.\n  Some in the administration will say that they are currently trying to \nwork with the local community since they held a series of six scheduled \ntown meetings on the proposed withdrawal. From the input that I have \nreceived, no one seems sold on the idea at the local level that a \nmonument designation is the only option available to protect the \nancient treasures in Southwestern Colorado.\n  The Southwest Resource Advisory Council was formed to bring forth a \nwide variety of issues to take into consideration before the Secretary \nof the Interior moves forward with his intended move to remove the \npublic from the area. The report addresses everything from recreation \nand tourism to oil and gas development in the area which is how these \nsmall communities survive economically. In our efforts to preserve the \nculture of the area, we cannot continue to lock up all of our public \nland which so many small towns in the West depend upon.\n  Our small communities in Southwestern Colorado know how to be good \nstewards of the land and my bill allows everyone from the local \ncitizens, the Department of Interior, and Congress to work in a \ncollective effort to save this area for future generations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. I \nask unanimous consent that the bill and letters of support be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washingon, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: We are writing in support of your \n     efforts to introduce National Conservation Area legislation \n     to address the future of the BLM Anasazi ACEC in Southwest \n     Colorado. Our support is predicated on legislation that \n     addresses the concerns and recommendations outlined in the \n     Working Group Report that was issued by the local ACEC \n     Subcommittee and transmitted by the Southwestern RAC in \n     August of 1999.\n       We are in agreement with the Montezuma County Commission \n     that the Working Group Report provides the local consensus \n     upon which to develop a legislative framework that addresses \n     the protection of archaeological resources in a manner that \n     protects critical multiple uses on BLM land, respects \n     adjacent private property rights, and insures future \n     opportunities for meaningful local involvement. The prospects \n     for a constructive\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\n     and locally acceptable outcome through an open legislative \n     process are far superior to a unilateral National Monument \n     designation, which would be totally unacceptable to the local \n     community.\n       We offer our assistance to you and the coalition that is \n     emerging in support of a responsible and locally acceptable \n     legislative resolution concerning the future of the ACEC in \n     Southwest Colorado.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mark Larson,\n       State Representative.\n     Kay Alexander,\n       State Representative.\n     Jim Dyer,\n       State Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Montezuma County,\n\n\n                                Board of County Commissioners,\n\n                                    Cortez, CO, December 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: We are writing to ask for your \n     leadership in the drafting of National Conservation Area \n     Legislation for the BLM Anasazi ACEC, most of which lies in \n     Western Montezuma County. We ask that the NCA legislation be \n     drafted in keeping with the summary report drafted by the \n     ACEC Working Group.\n       After carefully considering the public input reflected in \n     the Working Group Report, we have spent several months \n     exploring our options. We have concluded that NCA Legislation \n     is the only way to avoid a unilateral National Monument \n     designation which would be totally unacceptable.\n       We are prepared to work with you and the Department of \n     Interior in any way necessary to support the development and \n     adoption of NCA legislation that is in keeping with the goals \n     and concerns outlined in the Working Group Report.\n           Sincerely yours,\n       G. Eugene Story.\n       Glenn E. Wilson, Jr.\n       J.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: Colorado Farm Bureau, the state's \n     largest farming and ranching organization, opposes the \n     designation of the Anasazi Cultural Area of Critical \n     Environmental Concern (ACEC) as a national monument. As an \n     alternative, we encourage you to introduce legislation that \n     would designate the Anasazi Area of Critical Environmental \n     Concern as a National Conservation Area. After reviewing many \n     options with our members, we feel that legislation to \n     designate the area as a National Conservation Area would be \n     in the best interests of farmers and ranchers in southwest \n     Colorado.\n       Farm Bureau policy supports local communities, counties, \n     landowners and cities must be allowed input into any \n     designation of national monuments, national parks or \n     conservation use areas as these designations change the \n     current multiple use of public lands and adversely effect \n     adjacent private property rights.\n       It is our understanding that a National Conservation Area \n     designation would allow continued multiple use on these \n     lands, a Farm Bureau priority. There would also be increased \n     funding to the Bureau of Land Management to protect \n     significant archaeological sites and develop a management \n     plan. A designation would also allow for more local input and \n     avoid a National Monument designation by the administration, \n     which Farm Bureau is opposed to.\n       Colorado Farm Bureau would like to thank you for your \n     continued support of multiple uses on public lands and offers \n     any assistance in developing legislation. If you have any \n     further questions, please contact Bob Frankmore, Director, \n     National Affairs, (303) 749-7508.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ray Christensen,\n     Executive Vice-President.\n                                  ____\n\n         CLUB 20, ``Voice of the Western Slope, Since 1953,''\n                             Grand Junction, CO, January 17, 2000.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: On behalf of the Board of Directors \n     of CLUB 20, I would like to convey our support of legislation \n     designating a National Conservation Area which will encompass \n     the Anasazi ACEC. CLUB 20 has been following the efforts of \n     Montezuma County and the BLM RAC group throughout their study \n     process.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: We are writing concerning the \n     management of the Anasazi Area of Critical Environmental \n     Concern (ACEC) in Southwest Colorado. As you know, Secretary \n     Babbitt convened a working group of local interested parties \n     to gather and compile public input on how the area should be \n     managed so as to protect its plethora of archaeological sites \n     and natural values. The ACEC contains not only the highest \n     concentration of ancient Puebloan sites anywhere in the \n     nation, but pristine wilderness values as well. We have long \n     advocated for the designation of the Cross, Cahone, and \n     Squaw/Papoose Wilderness Study Area (WSA) in the ACEC as \n     wilderness, as the most effective way to protect these unique \n     resources.\n       There are several options for protecting the area's \n     resources that would provide real protection for sensitive \n     sites, and maintain the region's traditional character. \n     First, the Montezuma County Commission has proposed a draft \n     budget for BLM management of the ACEC that significantly \n     increases the funding for research, site preservation, NEPA \n     analysis, and law enforcement. We think that this budget is a \n     good starting point for discussions on how to adequately fund \n     needed management by the BLM.\n       In addition, two protective designations for the area have \n     been discussed: National Monument and National Conservation \n     Area. We believe either of these could provide the needed \n     management for the area if they provide strong protection for \n     archaeological sites from impacts of motorized recreation and \n     oil and gas development. However, in deference to local \n     concerns about increased impacts of tourism with a National \n     Monument, our preference is for the delegation to work \n     together on legislation establishing a National Conservation \n     Area, including the designation of the above-mentioned WSA's \n     as wilderness. We believe this represents the best middle \n     ground mechanism for protecting the area's archaeological \n     resources while also maintaining its rural character.\n       Wilderness designation for Cross, Cahone, and Squaw/Papoose \n     Canyons would give the best protection to their \n     archaeological sites, while allowing the continuance of \n     traditional activities such as the grazing leases currently \n     in effect. There would be little effect on oil and gas \n     development in the area, since there has been no activity in \n     the canyons, and any future development of existing leases \n     could be accommodated with directional drilling from outside \n     the wilderness boundaries.\n       Finally, we support Montezuma County's notion of funding \n     part of BLM's management activities for the area through \n     royalties from oil and gas production. Since oil and gas \n     development represents some of the greatest impacts in the \n     area, it stands to reason that some of the royalty funds \n     should remain in the area and provide for its protection.\n       We urge you to consider these various approaches--\n     increasing funding for management of the area, and \n     designating a National Conservation Area, with wilderness \n     status for the most pristine parts of the ACEC--as a workable \n     solution that addresses local concerns as well as critical \n     protection needs. We look forward to working with you on \n     legislation to address all of these needs.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeff Widen,\n       Colorado Environmental Coalition.\n     Mark Pearson,\n       Sierra Club.\n     Suzanne Jones,\n       The Wilderness Society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S.J. Res. 39. A joint resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of \nthe Korean War and the service by members of the Armed Forces during \nsuch war, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of the korean war\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. This year will mark the 50th anniversary \nof America's effort in Korea to halt the spread of Communist \naggression. Today, I am introducing a bill that is of great importance \nto me and the more than 1.5 million American men and women who so \nvaliantly fought and supported the U.S. effort in Korea.\n  On June 25, 1950, the Communist North Korean military invaded South \nKorea, provoking a swift U.S. response. Two days later, President \nTruman ordered the intervention that eventually involved 22 nations. In \nthe three years that the U.S. led this multinational force, more than \n54,000 Americans gave their lives in the fight to preserve our freedom \nand democratic way of life. As many as 92,000 soldiers were wounded and \nmore than 8,000 were left behind.\n  Despite this struggle and sacrifice, I can clearly remember as a \nyoung man,\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\nreturning home from my years in Korea, feeling as if no one knew that \nwe had ever been gone. It was a harsh, painful conflict that America \nvery quickly wanted to place well behind it. I knew then and understand \nnow why Korea came to be known as ``The Forgotten War.''\n  If you visit the Korean War Memorial at the end of the Mall here in \nWashington, you will see the patrolling squad of 19 weary soldiers \nfrozen in motion, their rustled ponchos and obstacles beneath them a \ntestament to the harsh conditions and terrain that were endured each \nday of ground combat. On the adjacent granite wall, one will see the \nfaint etchings of 2,400 unnamed faces of the men and women who \ncontributed in the effort in so many different ways. Clearly displayed \nbeyond these images is the message that so profoundly reminds us, \n``Freedom is Not Free.''\n  Mr. President, the joint resolution that I introduce today marks the \npassage of these 50 years since the Korean War and recognizes its \nextraordinary significance in our history. Most importantly, it thanks \nand honors the brave men and women who fought so hard to defeat the \nspread of Communism and preserve our freedom and democracy. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to recognize our \nnation's Korean War veterans and mark this historic anniversary.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the joint resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 39\n\n       Whereas on June 25, 1950, Communist North Korea invaded \n     South Korea with approximately 135,000 troops, thereby \n     initiating the Korean War;\n       Whereas on June 27, 1950, President Harry S Truman ordered \n     military intervention in Korea;\n       Whereas approximately 5,720,000 members of the Armed Forces \n     served during the Korean War to defeat the spread of \n     communism in Korea and throughout the world;\n       Whereas casualties of the United States during the Korean \n     War included 54,260 dead (of whom 33,665 were battle deaths), \n     92,134 wounded, and 8,176 listed as missing in action or \n     prisoners of war; and\n       Whereas service by members of the Armed Forces in the \n     Korean War should never be forgotten: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the historic significance of the 50th \n     anniversary of the Korean War;\n       (2) expresses the gratitude of the people of the United \n     States to the members of the Armed Forces who served in the \n     Korean War;\n       (3) honors the memory of service members who paid the \n     ultimate price for the cause of freedom, including those who \n     remain unaccounted for; and\n       (4) calls upon the President to issue a proclamation--\n       (A) recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Korean War and \n     the sacrifices of the members of the Armed Forces who served \n     and fought in Korea to defeat the spread of communism; and\n       (B) calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     such anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n

Mr. President, the federal investment in the \narea of education technology has been and continues to be critical in \nensuring that schools in all of our states not only have technological \ncapacity but are able to effectively integrate technology into the \ncurriculum for the benefit of all children. The federal government has \nshown extraordinary leadership in this area through the funding it \nprovides through the E-rate, the Technology Innovations Challenge Grant \nand Literacy Challenge Fund programs, to name a few. Still, making \ntechnology integral to and effective in the learning process is not \nsomething that can be done by the federal government alone. To be \nsuccessful, it will require creating strong and committed partnerships \nof schools, teachers, institutions of higher education, local and state \ngovernments and of course the business community.\n  There are many businesses that are leading by doing--creating \npartnerships for the educational benefit of kids. They are investing \ntime and resources in our nation's schools to help make technology a \npositive and powerful educational tool. Intel is one such company.\n  The Intel Teach to the Future program brings together expertise and \nresources from leading high-tech companies to improve technology use in \nthe classroom. This comprehensive teacher development initiative has \nbeen designed to address the barriers teachers face in effectively \napplying computer technology to enhance student learning. In spite of \nthe potential for technology to improve education, only 20% of today's \n3.17 million teachers feel prepared to use technology in the classroom. \nBarriers to success include: lack of access to adequate equipment; lack \nof training on specific software tools; lack of training on tools to \nevaluate how, when and where technology should be applied to teach \nspecific subject matter; and finally, lack of an evaluative process \nthat measures success and provides for continuous improvement. Intel \nhas learned from its own and others' experiences and partnered with \nleaders in the computer industry to deliver a program that can tackle \nthese barriers head-on.\n  The Teach to the Future program provides a flexible, modular \ncurriculum delivered by teachers for teachers. The training \nincorporates the use of the Internet, web page design and multimedia \nsoftware. Every participant is guaranteed access in their classrooms to \nthe hardware and software necessary to put their training into \npractice. The training of a cadre of local master teachers ensures the \nknowledge and expertise remains within the school district and provides \nfor ongoing support.\n  Key elements of the Teach to the Future program include hands-on, \nface-to-face learning. The curriculum is based on the award-winning \nIntel ACE Project, authored by the Institute for Computer Technology. \nIt has been delivered to some 3,200 teachers in nine communities over \nthe last two years in cooperation with Microsoft Corporation and \nHewlett-Packard Company. Responses from Intel ACE participants show \nthat 98% of the participants found the training to be valuable; 97% \ndeveloped new skills and knowledge and 94% felt the training would \nbenefit their students. A follow-up study with teachers who \nparticipated in the training in 1998 found that more than 84% felt the \nuse of computers had improved their instruction and more than 80% felt \ntheir students' learning was enhanced. I heard a great deal about the \nprogram that Intel sponsored in Washington, DC and was excited to learn \nof what a positive impact it had on students and teachers there.\n  Intel will develop online communities via its web site to support the \nRegional Training Agencies, Master Teacher and teacher participants. \nSome of the areas will facilitate administration of the program itself \nsuch as registration and evaluation; other services include case \nstudies, a lesson plan database, and chat capability.\n  In its first three years the program will reach 100,000 teachers in \nthe United States. Giving teachers the tools, know-how and confidence \nto apply technology effectively in the classroom will have a big payoff \nin improving educational opportunities for our nation's young people. I \napplaud Intel and its partners as well as all the other businesses for \ntheir commitment to education in the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S336-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REAR ADMIRAL JOAN M. ENGEL\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor Rear Admiral (Upper Half) Joan M. Engel as she retires after more \nthan thirty years of active duty service in the United States Navy. \nRear Admiral Engel culminates her distinguished career as the Assistant \nChief for Operational Medicine and Fleet Support at the Bureau of \nMedicine and Surgery. As the first non-physician officer in medical \ndepartment history appointed to this position, Rear Admiral Engel \nbrought a fresh dedication to improving Navy Medicine's ability to \ndeploy health care worldwide. She formally directed sweeping changes to \nthe missions of her subordinate commands and instituted many \nprogressive initiatives such as: a robust Force Health Protection \nprogram; Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Environment agent \nthreat assessment and education programs; the creation of Forward \nDeployed Preventive Medicine Units; the establishment of the Navy \nOperational Medicine Institute, a new command focused on advanced \noperational aviation, undersea, and surface medicine training; and the \ncomplete restructuring of Navy Medical Research and Development \nlaboratories and programs.\n  Rear Admiral Engel was the first female, and first Nurse Corps \nofficer, to be selected by a board to the rank of a two-star Admiral \nwithin the Navy Medical Department. She served as the Director of the \nNavy Nurse Corps and Assistant Chief for Education, Training, and \nPersonnel at the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. Through collaboration \nwith other military nursing leaders, Rear Admiral Engel ensured that a \nBachelor of Science degree became the minimum level of education for \nentry into practice for military nurses, and championed the \nestablishment of a military nursing constituency within the American \nNurses Association. Rear Admiral Engel was instrumental in advancing \nthe extensive Tri-Service Nursing Research Program which focuses on \nresearch to develop best practices for nursing care. Attuned to issues \nrelated to women in the Navy, her participation in the landmark 1990 \nNavy Women's Study Group was the catalyst for enhancing the delivery of \nculturally competent women's health care and increasing the number of \noperational assignments for Navy nurses. Her contributions are far-\nreaching, and will positively impact military nursing and health care \nfor years to come.\n  Mr. President, more than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a \nmilitary hospital, I began a unique relationship with military nurses. \nRear Admiral Engel embodies what I know military nurses to be--strong, \ndedicated professional leaders, stepping to the forefront to serve \ntheir country and committed to caring for our Sailors, Marines, Airmen, \nSoldiers and family members during peacetime and at war. Rear Admiral \nEngel's many meritorious awards and decorations demonstrate her \ncontributions in a tangible way, but it is the legacy she leaves behind \nfor the Navy Nurse Corps, the United States Navy and the Department of \nDefense for which we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I \ncongratulate Rear Admiral Engel on her outstanding career of exemplary \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S336-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S336-S337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WINNERS OF THE 1999-2000 EIGHTH GRADE YOUTH ESSAY CONTEST\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a group \nof young Indiana students who have shown great educative achievement. I \nwould like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the winners of \nthe 1999-2000 Eighth Grade Youth Essay Contest which I sponsored in \nassociation with the Indiana Farm Bureau and Bank One of Indiana. These \nstudents have displayed strong writing abilities and have proven \nthemselves to be outstanding young Hoosier scholars. I submit their \nnames for the Congressional Record because they demonstrate the \ncapabilities of today's students and are fine representatives of our \nNation.\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\n  This year, Hoosier students wrote on the theme, ``International \nMarket Baskets Begin on Hoosier Farms.'' Considering the importance of \nour expanding global economy, students were asked to imagine themselves \nshopping in an exotic marketplace, anywhere in the world, and then \ndescribe what Hoosier agricultural products they might find there. I \nwould like to submit for the Record the winning essays of Clayton \nOwsley of Washington County and Emily Ripperger of Franklin County. As \nstate winners of the Youth Essay Contest, these two outstanding \nstudents are being recognized on Friday, February 4, 2000 during a \nvisit to our Nation's Capitol.\n  The essays are as follows:\n\n          International Market Baskets Begin on Hoosier Farms\n\n                 (By Clayton Owsley, Washington County)\n\n       Our ship arrived on the Island of Aruba early this morning. \n     Our family had been sailing on the Caribbean all night.\n       Our first stop was to shop in the town of Oranjestad. As we \n     browsed in the marketplace, we saw Aruban art and merchants \n     selling fresh fish off their boats.\n       While we were in the marketplace we picked up some items to \n     take back to the condominium. I forgot to pack my toothpaste, \n     so I purchased a tube of Crest (peppermint flavored). As I \n     was paying for it, I realized the peppermint used in it could \n     have originated in Indiana. Indiana is the 4th leading \n     peppermint exporter in the United States.\n       My dad loves popcorn, so he bought some microwave popcorn \n     to fix in the room. I told dad this popcorn might have come \n     from Indiana, since Indiana is the number one popcorn \n     exporter in the United States.\n       Before we left to go back to our room we ate lunch at a \n     restaurant by the marketplace. The special of the day was \n     roast duckling, which is another export of Indiana. We tried \n     to find many items on the menu that could have originated in \n     Indiana. The vegetable oil and dressings may have come from \n     Indiana soybeans. The soy sauce used to marinate the duckling \n     could also have come from Indiana soybeans.\n       Dad reminded us that the ketchup on the table could also \n     have come from diced tomatoes grown in Indiana. He informed \n     us that 55% of Aruban imports come from the United States. \n     So it is possible these things could have originated in \n     Indiana.\n       We realized that there is a little bit of Indiana all over \n     the world.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          International Market Baskets Begin on Hoosier Farms\n\n                 (By Emily Ripperger, Franklin County)\n\n       Have you ever wondered where Hoosier crops are sent after \n     they are harvested? When I took my first trip to Europe, I \n     found the answers to this question.\n       It began a few years ago, when I visited London, England, \n     and was amazed at what I found. After visiting famous \n     landmarks, I arrived at Portobello Market, which is on the \n     west side of the city. When I got there, I was in awe at the \n     sights and the sounds of this new place. People were walking \n     down the crowded roads, talking in different languages, and \n     there were more booths than imaginable. As I pushed my way \n     through the crowds, I found myself gazing at crates filled \n     with almost every kind of foreign fruit or vegetable that you \n     could think of. Then, something caught my eye. There were \n     boxes of soybeans, corn, tomatoes and other familiar things. \n     Immediately, I recognized this as something from my home \n     state, Indiana. This really came to me as a shock, because \n     being in a foreign country, I had the impression that I would \n     only be seeing foreign objects. I spoke to the merchant, and \n     he told me that although some of these crops were grown \n     locally, most of them, even the peppermint and spearmint, \n     were grown on Indiana farms. This information sparked my \n     interest, so I did some extensive research. It turns out that \n     Native Americans who lived mostly around the Ohio Valley, and \n     the Great Lakes brought many of these crops grown in Indiana, \n     there. When I returned home, I thought about Hoosier farms \n     and the workers who help keep them running, in a new way.\n       Going to Europe made me realize the importance of Indiana \n     farms and crops, and how they are useful, not only in the \n     United States, but all around the world.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    1999-2000 District Essay Winners\n\n     District 1: Wyatt Reidelbach (Pulaski County), Emily Ann \n         Lawrence (Starke County)\n     District 2: Drew Englehart (Noble County), Alyxandra \n         Schlotter (Noble County)\n     District 3: Kent Kohlhagen (Jasper County), Laura Lachmund \n         (White County)\n     District 4: Brad Rogers (Howard County), Jenell Hierholzer \n         (Miami County)\n     District 5: Matthew Fry (Putnam County), Tarrah Bernhardt \n         (Hendricks County)\n     District 6: David Baird (Wayne County), Cassie Bird (Hamilton \n         County)\n     District 7: Shawna Asher (Knox County)\n     District 8: Jonathan Brookbank (Union County), Emily \n         Ripperger (Franklin County)\n     District 9: Drew Baker (Posey County), Amy Moore (Posey \n         County)\n     District 10: Clayton Owsley (Washington County), Paige \n         Roberts (Washington County)\n\n\n                     1999-2000 County Essay Winners\n\n     Cass: Jeff Plummer, Mollie Graybeal\n     Delaware: Jason Perkins, Amanda Pollard\n     Dubois: Dustin Schwartz\n     Fayette: Ashley Steele\n     Franklin: Zackary Reisert, Emily Ripperger\n     Hamilton: Ryan Kunkel, Cassie Bird\n     Hancock: Shelby Gues\n     Hendricks: Nathan Bayliss, Tarrah Bernhardt\n     Henry: Rebecca Robertson\n     Howard: Brad Rodgers\n     Jasper: Kent Kohlhagen, Cristen Liersch\n     Jay: Danielle Look\n     Knox: Shawna Asher\n     Madison: Zamir Wolfe, Jessica Loveall\n     Marion: Mike James, Jessica Davis\n     Miami: Jenell Hierholzer\n     Newton: Curt Schriner, Lacy Padgett\n     Noble: Drew Englehart, Alyxandra Schlotter\n     Orange: Ryan Barwe, Kimberly Kee\n     Posey: Drew Baker, Amy Moore\n     Pulaski: Wyatt Reidelbach\n     Putnam: Matthew Fry\n     St. Joseph: Colin Ethier, Julie Vander Weide\n     Shelby: Amanda Denton\n     Starke: David Jensen, Emily Ann Lawrence\n     Union: Jonathan Brookbank\n     Vermillion: William Ealy, Alyssa Burch\n     Wabash: Greg Martin, Tiffany Livesay\n     Warrick: A.J.

PAUL SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to tell you about St. \nPaul School in my hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. In a country that \ncan only be measured by the well-being of its least-advantaged \ncitizenry, St. Paul has a special story that is too often left untold.\n  St. Paul Church and the adjoining school are landmarks on the \nWilmington skyline, visible from Interstate 95 heading North through \nWilmington. Surrounding it are remnants of a once heavily-populated \nIrish and German immigrant communities and now is in the heart of the \nHispanic section of the city. It sits at the base of the West Side and \nsince the 1800's, has been a safe haven for generations of children and \nfamilies newly arriving to American shores and settling in our \ncommunity.\n  St. Paul School was founded in 1874. Its 125 year history is clear--\nproviding quality education to immigrant and minority children. Yet at \nSt. Paul, there is a much deeper, much more powerful message. While St. \nPaul is a school of 235 kindergarten through eighth graders, 99% of \nwhom are urban children of color from some of Wilmington's most \ndistressed areas, its students are prepared well and consistently \nperform above the national indicators of student achievement.\n  There is no culture of poverty or sense of hopelessness in any child, \nin any classroom in this school. St. Paul's dispels the assumptions and \nmyths about the innate inability of inner-city minority children from \nvery precarious circumstances to succeed academically and socially in \nmainstream society. At St. Paul, parents are properly engaged, teachers \nare supremely dedicated and most important, children come ready to \nlearn. This in a school where more than half the students enter with \nlimited English-speaking ability, most of the families live on the \nmargins of poverty and the teachers and administration work for pay \nwell-below their parochial, public and private counterparts.\n  St. Paul is indeed a special place, but in my view, it is one of so \nmany other stories we need to find out about, embrace and share with \nAmerica. Furthermore, it is the reason that we must continue to invest \nin the education of our children. On February 9, 2000 in Wilmington, \nthere will be a Commemorative Mass benefiting the Saint Paul School \nScholarship Fund. It is a time when St. Paul School will take center \nstage for many in our community. It makes perfect sense because every \nday, education and its importance takes center stage in the lives of \nSt. Paul children.\n  Our community--both now and in future--will be better because of the \nefforts of schools like St. Paul around the country where truly no one \nchild is left behind. We in Wilmington salute St. Paul School.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S338-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S338]]\n                 RECOGNITION OF STEPHEN AND LAURA ERDEL\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, these two have \nserved the community in a variety of roles and on January 22 they were \nthe recipients of the Mexico Area Chamber of Commerce 1999 Community \nService Award.\n  Steve has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the \nHandishop, Inc. the Handi-Shop Endowment Fund, the Mexico Rotary Club, \nThe Mexico Country Club, The Arthur Center Advisory Board, Mexico/\nAudrain County Community Development, Enterprise Development \nCorporation, Audrain Medical Center Charitable Foundation, the Advanced \nTechnology Center Foundation, the Westminister College Board of \nTrustees, Missouri Military Academy, the Alan Woods Scholarship \nFoundation, the Roy Creasey Scholarship Foundation and the Ross D. \nFerris Scholarship.\n  He has served as president of the Mexico Area Chamber of Commerce and \nas vice president of Economic Development. He was also president of the \nfollowing organizations: Handishop, Inc., Mexico Country Club, Arthur \nCenter Advisory Board and as chairman of the Audrain Medical Center \nCharitable Foundation, the Advanced Technology Center Foundation and as \ntheir fund-raising chairman. He is currently on the Westminster College \nExecutive Committee.\n  Mr. President, Laura Erdel also has an outstanding record of \ncommunity service. Laura served as a member of the Mexico Board of \nEducation for 6\\1/2\\ years. In 1996 she was the first woman to be \nelected president of the school board. She was vice president of the \nboard for four years and is certified by the Missouri School Board \nAssociation. For seven years she also served as a weekly volunteer at \nEugene Field School.\n  Laura was co-founder of the A+ for Mexico Education, Inc. and \npresident for two years.

Mr. President, I wish to note the departure from \npublic life of one of our state's most gifted public servants. Michael \nSkinner, who has served for the past six years as U.S. Attorney for the \nWestern District of Louisiana, the largest geographical district in my \nhome state, left office on January 15 and has returned to the private \npractice of law in Lafayette.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that Michael Skinner will be remembered \nas the most effective and successful U.S. Attorney in the history of \nthe Western District of Louisiana. From almost his first day in office, \nhe set about to make it clear to the people of his district that the \nU.S. Attorney's office was their office, administering justice on their \nbehalf and for their benefit. In short order, he threw open the doors \nof his office, demystified the work of the U.S. Attorney and instilled \na renewed sense of confidence and enthusiasm for the administration of \njustice in the Western District of Louisiana. Judges, attorneys, \ncitizens and scores of public officials from Lafayette to Lake Charles \nto Alexandria to Shreveport to Monroe agreed that Michael Skinner's \nappointment was a true breath of fresh air.\n  Mr. Skinner's record as U.S. Attorney is an impressive one. He \nsuccessfully prosecuted scores of cases involving public corruption, \nviolent crime, drugs, health care and other types of program fraud, \nenvironmental crime and civil rights violations. Some of his most \nsuccessful cases included: Food stamp and Medicaid/Medicare indictments \nand convictions that uncovered millions in fraud; a child pornography \ninvestigation that broke a child prostitution ring in South Louisiana; \nan environmental investigation that resulted in the cleanups of several \nsouth Louisiana toxic waste dumps; and the prosecution of literally \nhundreds of drug dealers who admitted or were convicted of selling \ndrugs in Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have recommended Michael Skinner's \nnomination to President Clinton in 1993. In the years since his \nconfirmation by this body, I have watched with a mixture of pride and \nadmiration as he performed the duties of his office with a rare \ncombination of skill, integrity, compassion and determination. Mike \nSkinner represents the best that our country has to offer in its public \nservants and I believe that he will serve as the model for every person \nwho follows him in that office. I know that I speak for the citizens of \nLouisiana and for every member of this body in thanking him for a job \nwell done and in wishing he and his family all the best in this new \nphase of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S338-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S338-S339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF EMILY ANN JORDT\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof an extraordinary and courageous young lady. Emily Ann Jordt, \ndaughter of Bill and Deb Jordt of Hinton, Iowa, passed away on March \n15, 1999, after fighting cancer for three years. My heart is heavy for \nthe Jordt family. No one would disagree that cancer is a devastating \nillness. However, when cancer touches the life of a child, it seems an \nespecially harsh reality. I know from personal experience the \ndifficulties that follow a cancer diagnosis. My wife, Barbara, is a \nbreast cancer survivor and we believe early detection saved her life. I \nhave long supported biomedical research, and Emily's story reminds all \nof us the importance of remaining vigilant in providing funding for \ncancer research. To quote Emily, ``We can do this together.'' It is my \nhope that by sharing Emily's story with my colleagues in the Senate, \nEmily's memory may be truly honored.\n\n             Emily's Story--A Life of Strength and Courage\n\n       Emily was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive \n     childhood cancer, in 1996 when she was only nine years old. \n     While this cancer is usually found in muscle tissue in an \n     extremity, Emily's was in her jaw and neck. Emily was \n     frightened. Her grandfather had died of lung cancer. Emily \n     came to understand that there were many kinds of cancers, and \n     that not everyone dies of this disease. Emily joined her \n     family and doctors in what was to become a three-year fight \n     for her life.\n       Emily had surgery to remove a tumor below her lower right \n     jaw. Her best chance for remission was simultaneous radiation \n     and chemotherapy treatment. Even though interruptions in the \n     harsh protocol were needed for her body to recover, radiation \n     was completed, and chemotherapy resumed.\n       After radiation Emily had difficulty with muscles of her \n     tongue and throat. A feeding tube was surgically implanted \n     and she used a suction machine to clear her throat and \n     airways. She bravely adjusted to this life-style.\n       Emily dearly loved school. She maintained an A-B average \n     throughout her illness. She played trumpet in the school \n     band. When a facial nerve was impaired because of surgery, \n     she switched to percussion and continued on. She served as a \n     customer representative of the Westerner Bank in her school. \n     She was an ardent fundraiser for school projects. Her \n     classmates regarded her as a peacemaker.\n       Emily played soccer in a YMCA league throughout her \n     treatment. She loved the sport. She was back on the soccer \n     field and played most of a full game only 11 days after \n     having major surgery to remove the tumor a second time.\n       Emily planned and presented a writer's workshop entitled \n     ``Getting through the Tough Stuff'' where she encouraged \n     young people her age to use writing as a vehicle to deal with \n     the difficult challenges of life and be sensitive and caring \n     to others.\n       Picture a nine-year-old presenting her concerns about and \n     suggestions for pediatric\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\n     care to the Board of Directors of the hospital where she \n     spent a great deal of time. Emily did it. She believed that \n     one person can make a difference. And Emily did make a \n     difference.\n       Emily was active in 4-H, serving as vice-president of her \n     club. She chose many categories in which to participate, \n     everything from showing her 4-month old filly to playing the \n     piano in Share the Fun. She presented a written and visual \n     display of items used throughout her surgeries and treatment. \n     For this she was awarded an Outstanding Junior Achievement \n     Ribbon.\n       Emily took an active part in Relay for Life in her county. \n     She served as Junior Chairperson, giving a speech the night \n     of the event. She enlisted the help of her classmates and \n     teachers to help publicize events.\n       As only a child can, Emily leaned on her faith to see her \n     through. Church was important to Emily. She took communion \n     instruction, participated in youth group activities, sang and \n     provided special music for worship. She willingly served \n     church dinners. She helped to organize a basketball team and \n     enlisted a neighbor to be their coach. This team won the Good \n     Sportsmanship trophy.\n       Emily maintained a positive and determined attitude. When \n     traditional treatments became ineffective, she willingly \n     tried non-traditional methods. She clung to the hope that she \n     would again be as normal as the other kids. While the disease \n     took her life on March 15, 1999, it could not crush her \n     spirit. It was that very same spirit that caused her to fight \n     to the very end.\n       Emily fought this illness for three long years, showing \n     that with strength, determination, and courage, life is to be \n     lived. Emily strongly believed the scripture verses that say, \n     ``Let the children come to me for such is the kingdom of \n     God,'' and ``A Child Shall Lead.'' Let us capture the essence \n     of Emily's spirit, follow her lead, and make a difference.\n                                  ____\n\n\nIn Memory and Celebration of the Life of Emily Ann Jordt, February 15, \n                          1987-March 15, 1999\n\n       Emily's life is meant to be more than just one more sad \n     account of how a child, a person, died from cancer. It is \n     meant to make us uncomfortable. It is meant to make us weep. \n     Then, it is meant to make us determined to act--to do \n     something.\n       Finding a cure for cancer is a very difficult but not \n     impossible task. What is needed to do that? An open mind. \n     When we keep our minds open, ideas and possibilities can \n     flow. One of Emily's favorite movies as a young child was \n     Cinderella. In that movie we hear the line, ``Impossible \n     things are happening every day.''\n       As lawmakers, do not tie the hands of researchers because \n     dollars are limited. Do not tie the hands of researchers from \n     exploring avenues that may be out of the ordinary.\n       Emily did not care about the insurance companies and the \n     drug companies playing the games that they play to control \n     what happens to people's lives. What she cared about was \n     playing soccer, learning, sharing her talents, having \n     birthday parties, being a friend, all the things that \n     children do best.\n       We must listen to her story with renewed commitment of why \n     most of you were elected, to make a difference.\n       Emily continues to make a difference each time her story is \n     told. Her video continues to play at fundraisers for \n     Children's Miracle Network. Each time ``Em's Environmental \n     Mobile Lab'' (that was purchased through memorials and a \n     grant) is taken on site to provide hands on learning for the \n     students at Akron-Westfield Community School, Emily continues \n     to make a difference. When the CEO of the hospital where \n     Emily spent so much times says, ``I am a different person \n     because of what Emily has taught me and that will make me a \n     better CEO,'' you know that Emily has truly made a \n     difference!\n       Have you made that kind of difference? Emily sacrificed her \n     life so that we, you and I, might see more clearly what our \n     job is.\n       A phrase that Emily and her family adopted as their motto \n     is, ``We can do this together.'' We as her family and friends \n     are making a difference by addressing you as our \n     representatives. Now, It is your chance to make a difference, \n     to vote for additional funding for cancer research, and to \n     clear the way for the impossible to happen.\n       ``Let us capture the essence of Emily's spirit, follow her \n     lead, and make a difference.''\n     Debra L.

SIMMONS\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor Brigadier General Bettye H. Simmons as she retires after twenty-\nnine years of active duty service in the United States Army. General \nSimmons culminates her distinguished career as Chief, Army Nurse Corps \nand Commander, United States Army Center for Health Promotion and \nPreventive Medicine.\n  General Simmons' distinguished career began in 1971 when she entered \nthe Army nurse Corps through the Army Student Nurse Program. Her \nnumerous military assignments have been diverse, including leadership \nroles in clinical services, staff education and development, and Army \nMedical Service administration and policy. As the Chief, Army Nurse \nCorps, General Simmons demanded the highest standards for military \nnursing. With other military nursing leaders, General Simmons ensured \nthat a Bachelor of Science education is the minimum qualification for \nentry on to active duty for any military nurse. She was the driving \nforce behind the multi-million dollar Triservice Nursing Research \nProgram, a program focused on research that develops best practices for \nnursing care. General Simmons initiated a post-deployment program for \ninjured Army Reserve soldiers that determined the appropriate level of \nmedical care before the soldier returns home. This program saved \ncountless dollars in civilian health care costs and honored the \ncommitment to care for our Reserve Forces. As Command Surgeon for \nForces Command, General Simmons improved unit medical readiness by 20 \npercent. She redesigned the battlefield evacuation process, providing a \nlightweight, robust capability to ensure the right medical care is \nprovided to the soldier at the right time and at the right place. Her \ncontributions are far-reaching, and will impact military nursing and \nhealth care for years to come.\n  Mr. President, more than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a \nmilitary hospital, I began to understand the critical role of military \nnurses. General Simmons embodies what I know military nurses to be--\nstrong, professional leaders who are committed to serving their fellow \ncomrades in arms and their country. General Simmons' many meritorious \nawards and decorations demonstrate her contributions in a tangible way, \nbut it is the legacy she leaves behind for the Army Nurse Corps for \nwhich we are most appreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate \nGeneral Simmons on her outstanding career of exemplary service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S339-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF BRENT STANGHELLE\n\n Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, today is the fifth day of the \n26th annual Catholic Schools Week, and tomorrow, we will observe \nNational Appreciation Day for Catholic School Teachers. I want to take \nthis opportunity to recognize the 167,000 teachers in our nation's \nCatholic schools for their valuable contributions to the education of \nmany of America's children.\n  There are over 2 million students enrolled in the nation's 8,217 \nCatholic elementary and secondary schools today. These schools are \nattractive to many parents because they combine an intellectually \nstimulating environment with an emphasis on the spiritual and moral \ndevelopment of their students.\n  Catholic school teachers are widely recognized for offering an \nexcellent scholastic education, which may explain why 41 percent of \nthese schools have a waiting list for admission. According to the \nNational Catholic Educational Association, the student-teacher ratio in \nCatholic schools is 17 to 1, and the graduation rate of Catholic school \nstudents is an extraordinary 95 percent. Only 3 percent of Catholic \nhigh school students drop out of\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\nschool, and 83 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on to \ncollege, the Association has estimated.\n  But Catholic school teachers provide students with more than just a \nsolid academic background. They encourage the spiritual and moral \ndevelopment of their students as well.\n  Catholic school teachers are educating an increasingly diverse group \nof students. Since 1970, the percentage of minorities enrolled in \nCatholic schools has more than doubled to 25 percent. More and more \nnon-Catholic students are enrolling in Catholic schools: today, as many \nas 13 percent of Catholic school students are non-Catholic, according \nto the National Catholic Educational Association (compared to 2.7 \npercent in 1970). In some city schools, a majority of the students are \nnon-Catholic.\n  This week, a delegation of over 100 Catholic school teachers, \nstudents, and parents are in Washington, D.C. to meet with Members of \nCongress. They hand-delivered information about Catholic schools to \nevery congressional office yesterday, which was National Appreciation \nDay for Catholic Schools. I would like to close by welcoming these \nteachers, students, and parents to the Nation's Capitol, and by \ncongratulating the Catholic schools across the country that received \nExcellence in Education Awards from the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S340-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE TENNESSEE TITANS' SEASON\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nTennessee Titans on their outstanding season and tremendous effort in \nSuper Bowl XXXIV.\n  This past Sunday, football fans across America and around the world \nwitnessed the most exciting and hard-fought Super Bowl in recent \nmemory, if not all-time. Trailing by sixteen points in the third \nquarter, the Titans rallied to tie the game. They fell behind once \nagain, but drove down to the St. Louis one-yard-line before time ran \nout.\n  The road to Atlanta was not an easy one for the Tennessee Titans. The \nteam has played in four stadiums in three cities and two states in four \nyears. But, despite this adversity, Titans Coach Jeff Fisher motivated \nhis players, orchestrated comebacks and led a team that fought until \nthe last second, the last yard. Ultimately, they ran out of time.\n  Who will forget Kevin Dyson stretching to reach the goal line when \nthe clock ran out on the most important game of his life? Who could \never forget the Titans' ``Music City Miracle,'' the kick-off return \nthat clinched a play-off victory over the Buffalo Bills, the \noutstanding defensive effort in the win at Indianapolis, the incredible \nsecond half in Jacksonville that propelled the team to the Super Bowl, \nthe indomitable will of Steve McNair or the power and determination of \nEddie George? The Titans came so close to winning it all, and they have \nso much of which they can be proud.\n  The Tennessee Titans can be proud of the way they played with heart \nand introduced the world to a team that many hadn't heard much about. \nThe Titans energized the state of Tennessee and nearly shocked the \nworld. Most important, the Titans gave their young fans an example of \nthe character and sportsmanship to which we should all aspire. And they \ninspired us with their refusal to give up when they were pegged the \nunderdogs.\n  Mr. President, I'd also like to congratulate my good friends from the \nstate of Missouri on the success of the St. Louis Rams. They too \novercame a tough recent history and many nay-sayers to win the most \nexciting Super Bowl in history. Their wide receiver, Isaac Bruce, a \nformer player for my alma mater the University of Memphis, stunned us \nall with his winning 73-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. And the \nSuper Bowl's most valuable player, Kurt Warner, is an inspiration on \nthe football field and in his personal life. I congratulate them both \nand all of their Rams teammates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S340-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 106-20\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I know we are nearing the end of the day, \nand there are no further votes today or tomorrow. I will be reasonably \nbrief.\n  I wanted to come to the floor when my colleague, Senator Durbin, and \nothers were speaking about the crisis dealing with AIDS in Africa. I \nwasn't able to come. I would like to mention that issue for a couple of \nmoments; then I would like to talk about the issue of trade.\n  Today in the Democratic Policy Committee luncheon, we heard from the \nPresident's chief adviser on the subject of AIDS policy, and we also \nheard from Rory Kennedy, who has done a 12-minute documentary film, an \naward-winning film on the issue of AIDS in Africa. I know my colleagues \ncame out to the floor and spoke on that subject following the \nDemocratic Policy Committee luncheon.\n  It is almost unthinkable what has happened, especially in Africa, \nwith respect to the subject of AIDS. AIDS is a scourge, a plague that \nis affecting the entire world. It is the first plague since the bubonic \nplague for which there is no cure, no vaccination, no significant \nremedy. It is devastating to a number of parts of this world, \nespecially the continent of Africa. Twenty million people have died in \nAfrica from AIDS; 14 million people are currently infected with HIV or \nAIDS in the continent of Africa.\n  We can't pretend it doesn't matter to us. AIDS is affecting all of \nthe world, including our country. It has a devastating effect on \nAfrica, a devastating impact on the millions and millions of children \nin Africa who now have no parents, who are left homeless by this \nscourge called AIDS. We must, as a country, gather with others in the \nworld and combat this deadly plague.\n  We are spending substantial resources to try to find a cure for AIDS. \nWe are also joining with others to try to find ways to educate people \nabout how to stop the spread of HIV and AIDS. Some countries in Africa \nhave begun to take emergency steps and have been successful and are \nbeginning to stem the tide of the spread of AIDS, but it is not nearly \nrapid enough. These steps need to be taken with much greater urgency, \nand our country needs to be a part of that with other countries in the \ninternational community.\n  I would first like to compliment Rory Kennedy, who appeared today and \nplayed for us a 12-minute documentary film that almost takes your \nbreath away when you see on film what has happened to the children and \nthe families in Africa with the decimation of so many families as a \nresult of death from AIDS.\n  We must do more. I compliment my colleagues, Senator Durbin, Senator \nBryan, Senator Feinstein, Senator Feingold, and others, many of whom \nhave traveled to Africa in recent months, and my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle as well who are involved in this. We must work \ntogether to address this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/03/senate-section/article/S341-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S341-S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE TRADE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will talk for a moment about the issue of the trade \ndeficit that faces this country. I would like to do so, understanding \nthat this country is full of good economic news. And there is a lot of \nreason for all of us to be optimistic about the future. The good \neconomic news that was described last week--in fact, a week ago this \nevening--by President Clinton in the State of the Union Address tells \nus that unemployment is way down and more people are working than \nvirtually ever before in this country; home ownership is up at record \nlevels; inflation is down, down, way down; income is up; the stock \nmarket is up. There are so many evidences of good news in our country. \nCrime rates are also down. There is evidence all around us that things \nare better in America. All of us feel good about that. We live at a \nwonderful time in a wonderful country. It is quite a remarkable \nopportunity all of us have.\n\n  But we must be vigilant about some storm clouds on the horizon. One \nof those storm clouds for this country's economy is the burgeoning \ntrade deficit, the imbalance between what we buy from other countries \nand what we sell to other countries and the resulting deficit that \ncomes from selling less and buying more.\n  The trade deficit in this country is virtually exploding. We have a \ntrade deficit that is higher than any trade deficit ever experienced \nanywhere on this Earth at any time. Does it matter? Is anybody talking \nabout it? Was it mentioned in the State of the Union Address last week? \nNo. Everyone wants to ignore the fact that we are rolling around pretty \nwell, even though the trade deficit is increasing dramatically, and it \nsomehow doesn't matter. We have wrestled this ``500-pound gorilla'' \ncalled the Federal budget deficit, with great pains, over many years. \nFinally, the scourge called the budget deficit, which was growing like \na tumor--growing forever--is now gone.\n  But the budget deficit, while gone, is being replaced by a trade \ndeficit that is growing at an alarming rate. I want to describe part of \nthat today. Everyone talks about the past 107 months of economic \nexpansion. I want to talk about that, but I also want to talk about the \ntrade deficit that could put an end to that economic expansion if we \ndon't do something to resolve this burgeoning deficit.\n  I will put up a chart that describes what we face for a trade \ndeficit. This chart goes back to 1991. It shows the amount of goods and \nservices we export and the amount we import. The red, of course, \nrepresents the imbalance, the trade deficit. In January, the Commerce \nDepartment announced that the trade deficit had widened to $26.5 \nbillion in November alone, a new monthly record. But a new monthly \nrecord was set in 8 of the last 11 months. Our goods and services trade \ndeficit--that is, all goods and services--in 1999 will be $266 billion. \nThat will exceed the previous year's $164 billion by 62 percent. \nUnderstand that the goods and services trade deficit will have \nratcheted up by 62 percent in 1 year alone.\n  We imported $92 billion worth of goods and exported $59.5 billion in \ngoods in November. Now, if current trends continue, the growth in our \ninternational debt will simply not be sustainable. The foreign debt in \nthis country is projected to be $1.7 trillion in 1999. That is not debt \nwe owe to ourselves as the Federal budget deficit was; that is debt \nowed to foreigners who have a claim to assets in this country--$1.7 \ntrillion. Almost all economists will tell us that is not sustainable \nand we must do something to address it.\n  When we become more dependent on receiving and retaining foreign \ncapital to finance this imbalance, the day will come when foreigners \nlose faith in this economy and begin to pull out of our financial \nmarkets. When that happens, the value of the dollar will fall, interest \nrates will rise, corporate profits and stock prices will decline, and \nthen we will have a slowdown in this economy.\n  Senators Byrd and Stevens and I authored legislation, which is now \nlaw, creating a trade deficit review commission. That commission is now \nimpaneled and underway, looking into the nature, causes, consequences, \nand remedies of this trade deficit. They will report their findings in \nAugust. In the meantime, this trade deficit escalates. This is the \ndeficit in goods alone--what is called the merchandise trade deficit. \nThis shows what happens to your manufacturing base. This is the most \nalarming deficit of all--$343\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\nbillion--and you can see what has happened to this trade deficit since \n1991. It is a dramatic escalation--$343 billion in a single year.\n\n  It would be useful to look at how our bilateral agreements have \ncontributed to our bilateral goods deficit.\n  Between 1998-99, our merchandise trade deficit with Canada went from \n$14 billion to $28 billion. Mexico--incidentally, I might mention that, \nbefore Congress passed NAFTA--without my vote; I didn't vote for it--we \nhad a trade surplus with Mexico and a relatively small deficit with \nCanada. NAFTA turned that into a large deficit with Canada and a very \nlarge deficit with Mexico.\n  The European Union: You can see what happened in the last year with \nrespect to trade deficits with the European Union. They have increased \ndramatically.\n  China and Japan: What happened there is almost unforgivable in terms \nof an economic relationship. China had, in 1999, a merchandise trade \ndeficit of over $60 billion with the United States, up from about $53 \nbillion in the previous year. Japan's is $67 billion. These aren't \ngetting better, they are getting worse.\n  What does all that mean for this country? We just negotiated a trade \nagreement with China. One of the major issues of great controversy in \nthis Chamber in the coming months will be whether China should be \ngranted permanent normal trade relations, the same as we grant other \ncountries. We will debate that sometime soon.\n  That will be the source of great controversy for a number of reasons. \nSome in this Chamber will believe the Chinese have not made progress on \nhuman rights. Others will perhaps believe the Chinese are not abiding \nby fair labor standards that we would consider important in this \ncountry. Still others will believe China hasn't complied with previous \ntrade agreements. So there will be a substantial amount of debate about \nthis issue.\n  I have been interested in the bilateral trade agreement negotiated \nwith China because we have a very large trade deficit with China. I \nwonder, when our negotiators negotiated, did they negotiate with some \nidea that we will bring that into balance? Can we send more goods into \nChina? Can we sell more to China? Or will we simply continue to be a \nsponge for China and watch their goods come here while they still \nretain a relatively closed market to many of our goods?\n  Once when I was in China, I met with the President of that country. I \ntalked to the President of China about trade issues. I said: You must \nbuy more pork from the United States. You must buy more wheat from the \nUnited States. You must buy more from the United States. You ship us \nyour trousers, your shirts, your shoes, your trinkets. Boats come from \nChina loaded with all of the things you produce. Our consumers are \nhappy to buy them. But we are not so lucky when American producers are \ntrying to sell goods into the Chinese economy. We are told: No, you \ncan't sell wheat in these circumstances in China; no, we won't purchase \nyour pork; or, no, we won't purchase this or that. In fact, the things \nwe do have, you want to make copies and violate the intellectual \nproperty rights of our producers. And we are not going to enforce that. \nWe are going to look the other way when your plants press out the CDs \nwith copyrighted music made by American artists.\n  My point is this: I think China is a very big, strong, interesting \ncountry that is going to be a significant part of our lives in the \nfuture. I am not sure what kind of influence they will have on our \nfuture, but it will be significant. I want China to play a constructive \nrole in our future. I want us to play a constructive role in their \nfuture. So I want us to have engagement and opportunity. I want us to \nhave trade relationships that are fair. I want China to move in a more \nsignificant way to improve their record on human rights and to move in \na way that provides more opportunity for their workers to have a fair \nsay in their economy. But having said all of that, I don't have great \nconfidence that the trade agreements we have with countries such as \nChina are intent on ending these kinds of trade circumstances that are \nunfair to our country.\n\n  Two weeks ago, for example, after a bilateral trade negotiation with \nChina was announced as a great success, the Chinese WTO negotiator, \nVice Minister Long Yungtu, went to Kweichow in south China to talk \nabout it. He was quoted in the South Asia Post as saying: You know, the \nagreement we have with the United States, this notion of buying a \ncertain number of millions of tons of wheat doesn't mean we are going \nto buy any wheat in the United States. That is just theory. That is all \ntheoretical. The notion that we will now accept meat from several \nthousand meat-packing plants in the United States doesn't mean we \nintend to have any U.S. meat come into our country. That is all just \ntheoretical.\n  When I read what Minister Long, the man who negotiated the Chinese \nside of the agreement, said, I wrote to him and asked about that. I \nunderstand people get misquoted from time to time. I also asked \nCharlene Barshefsky, our trade ambassador, to find out what this means. \nSo far I have not heard a word from the Chinese negotiator. I have not \nheard a word from the U.S. trade ambassador. I hope to hear from both.\n  I would like to see some progress in these areas. I want us to have a \ngood trading relationship with China, Japan, Europe, Canada, and \nMexico. But a good trading relationship to me is not defined as a \ncircumstance where they plug our market with all of the goods from \ntheir country and then keep their market closed to many of our \nproducers of commodities and goods. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  This country can't allow that to happen any longer. We must insist on \na reciprocal opportunity in foreign markets. A trade relationship with \nanother country must be mutually beneficial to us and to them. We have \nfar too often negotiated trade agreements that are one-way streets with \nforeign goods coming into the U.S. economy, but not a similar \nopportunity for U.S.-produced goods, including agricultural commodities \nand manufactured goods, to go into other economies. That is one of the \nreasons we have this massive trade deficit that is growing at an \nalarming rate.\n  I was going to speak about our situation with Canada and durum. I \nwill reserve that for another time. I know we are nearing the end of \nthe day. Some have other things they want to do. I am going to close \nwith a point about trade enforcement.\n  It is one thing to have trade agreements that are bad agreements. We \nhave had plenty of those. Our trade negotiators have not done well for \nthis country, in my judgment. But it is another thing to have trade \nagreements that are reasonably decent but are unenforceable. That is \nalso, I think, what happens even with those agreements that were decent \nagreements in the first place.\n  In the Department of Commerce where we monitor trade agreements, the \nnumber of people whose job it is to work on enforcement issues with \nrespect to China and our trade agreements with China is 10. We have \nnearly a $65 billion merchandise trade deficit with China. We have all \nkinds of problems getting into the Chinese marketplace with American \ngoods, and we have 10 people whose job it is to work on the issue--10.\n  Or Japan--we have had a trade deficit with Japan of $45 billion to \n$60 billion forever. Do you know how many people work on that issue? \nSixteen.\n  Canada and Mexico together--we turned a surplus with Mexico into a \nbig deficit, and we doubled the deficit with Canada. That is all the \nresult of this wonderful trade agreement called NAFTA for which we had \npeople stand up and brag on the floor of the Senate saying that you \nhave to pass this because if you do we will have more American jobs. It \nwill be better for everybody.\n  I didn't vote for NAFTA. But the Congress passed it. Guess what. All \nof those economists are now unwilling to show their face around here \nbecause they predicted several hundred thousand new American jobs. In \nfact, we lost several hundred thousand opportunities, and a trade \nsurplus with Mexico turned into a huge deficit. And a trade deficit \nwith Canada doubled because this country didn't negotiate a reasonable \ntrade agreement with Canada and Mexico. This country lost. Do you know \nhow many people are working on this issue at the Department of \nCommerce? Ten for two countries, and a combined trade deficit of over \n$50 billion. We have 10 people working on it.\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\n  There was a story not too long ago that said that U.S. officials who \nare responsible for monitoring trade agreements sometimes couldn't even \nlocate the text of the agreements. It is one thing to be incompetent. \nIt is another thing to exercise benign neglect over things that are \nyour responsibility. But it is quite another thing to be in charge of \nsomething and then just lose it.\n  Do those of us who have concerns about this have legitimate concerns? \nYes. We need to negotiate better trade agreements. We need to enforce \ntrade agreements. And we need to make certain that the relationships we \nhave with other countries are mutually beneficial to us and to them. \nThat has not been the case, sadly.\n  At the WTO conference in Seattle, which turned out to be such a \nfiasco with demonstrators in the streets, with some thugs in the \nstreets who defaced buildings, broke windows, and that sort of thing, \none thing happened that was quite remarkable. I want to say, however, \nthere were very few people who I call thugs who used paint cans up and \ndown the streets of Seattle. It was regrettable that they defaced \nbuildings and destroyed property. But the bulk of the people in the \nstreets of Seattle--literally tens of thousands of them--were perfectly \npeaceable. They demonstrated up and down the streets in ways that were \nperfectly peaceable. They were there to demonstrate for legitimate \nreasons. They demonstrated about a range of issues about which they \ncared deeply and passionately.\n  There will never be, in my judgment, a place in the world where there \nare negotiations about trade in which there won't be people showing up \nto ask legitimate questions about labor standards and environmental \nstandards because you can't fight in a country such as ours for 75 \nyears and have people die in the streets demonstrating for the right to \nform unions and then decide, well, we will just pole-vault over all of \nthose things and go and produce our goods in Sri Lanka or some other \ncountry where you do not have to worry about labor unions because they \ndon't allow workers to form unions. We won't pay a livable wage, we \nwon't have safe workplaces, and we won't restrict people from dumping \nchemicals into the streams and into the air. We'll hire kids for 12 \ncents an hour, work them 12 hours a day, and put them in unsafe plants. \nAnd, if you do not like it, tough luck.\n  That is the attitude of some in the rest of the world, and the people \nwho demonstrate in the street are saying that isn't fair because we \nfought 75 years in this country for a minimum wage, for safe labor \nstandards, and for a whole range of issues that are very important to \nwho we are and what we are, and we are not going to allow those to be \ntraded away in trade agreements. They have a legitimate concern. There \nwill always, in my judgment, be Americans in the streets unless they \nare part of the negotiations. That is why the WTO needs to be much more \nopen and much more inclusive. Having secret negotiations and excluding \npeople is not a way to resolve these issues.\n  Globalization, galloping along, must be accompanied by rules that are \nfair and thoughtful dealing with these serious issues of labor \nstandards, environmental standards, and other issues. They must be \naccompanied by thoughtful rules.\n  In Seattle, I met with a group of Parliamentarians from Europe. I and \na number of my Republican and Democrat colleagues went together to the \nWTO meetings in Seattle with great hope, and regrettably those meetings \ndidn't produce much in terms of agreement. They produced a great deal \nof chaos in the streets, and among the negotiators nothing much \nhappened. But during one memorable meeting for me with a group of \nParliamentarians from Europe something happened that was quite \nremarkable. Michel Rocard, who was a former Prime Minister of France \nand is now a member of the European Parliament in Europe, leaned across \nthe table to me and said something interesting. He said:\n\n       We talk about the beef dispute, beef hormones, and the \n     dispute with Roquefort cheese, and all of these issues we \n     have with Europe. They are nettlesome, difficult issues with \n     Europe on the trade disputes.\n\n  As we were talking about the differences between Europe and the \nUnited States, Mr. Rocard, who was the former Prime Minister of France, \nleaned forward to me and he said:\n\n       I want you to understand something, Mr. Senator. We talk \n     about our differences, but I want you to understand something \n     about how I feel about your country. I was a 14-year-old boy \n     standing on the streets of Paris, France, when the U.S. Army \n     came in to kick the Nazis out of our country. A young black \n     American soldier handed me an apple as he walked past. It was \n     the first apple I had seen in several years. I will never \n     forget how a 14-year-old boy felt about this young American \n     soldier walking down the street in Paris, to liberate my \n     country, and this young soldier handing me, this young French \n     boy, an apple.\n\n  It occurred to me that we forget, I think, what this country means, \nwhat it has been to so many others in the world; what we have done and \nwhat we have yet to do in the world. I tell you that story only to say \nthat while we have substantial trade disputes, our country has done a \nlot for a lot of people around the world. We liberated Europe. We beat \nback the forces of fascism. This country was perhaps the only country \nthat was capable of doing that at that time.\n  After the Second World War, for the first 25 years after that, we \nsaid to Europe not only did we kick the Nazis out of France and \nAmerican soldiers moved across Europe and liberated the Europeans and \ndefeated Hitler, not only that, but this country has decided to create \na Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. We rebuilt the economies of Europe.\n  For 25 years, in addition to spending money for the Marshall Plan to \nrebuild Europe and rebuild the economies of Europe, we also said our \ntrade policy will be our foreign policy. We made concessional trade \nagreements with everybody because it was not a problem for us. We were \nbig enough and strong enough so that with one hand tied behind our \nbacks, we could beat almost anybody in the world with international \ntrade. So our trade policy was our foreign policy, and it was to help \nother countries get back on their feet.\n  But things changed. After about a quarter of a century, from the \nSecond World War on, at that point we began to see our allies gaining \nstrength, having better economies, doing a better job. All of a sudden, \nwe had some tough, shrewd economic competitors. And in the second 25 \nyears post-Second World War, our competition has changed. Our \ncompetition has been tougher in international trade. But in this \ncountry, much of our trade policy has remained foreign policy.\n  Instead of our being hard-nosed competitors with a reasonable trade \npolicy that cares about our producers and the economic health of our \nproducers, our trade policy has remained largely focused on foreign \npolicy. That needs to change. We cannot always say it does not matter \nwhat our deficits are with China or Japan. We cannot say it does not \nmatter--of course it matters. This has economic consequences to us. Our \ntrade policy with respect to Japan needs to be a hard-nosed trade \nstrategy that says you have tough competitors. But we need to compete \nwith fair rules, and the rules of trade between the United States and \nJapan are fundamentally unfair. They are fundamentally unfair. I will \ncome some other time to talk about the specifics of that. That was all \nfine, post-Second World War for a quarter of a century, but it is not \nfine anymore, and it is going to begin to injure this country and sap \neconomic strength from this country.\n  No one wants a future of economic growth for this country more than I \ndo. But the way to assure continued months of economic prosperity and \ncontinued years of prosperity will be to deal with problems that exist. \nOne set of problems and storm clouds on this country's horizon is a \nhuge, growing trade deficit that nobody seems to care about and nobody \nseems to want to talk about and no one seems willing to do anything \nabout. I just hope one of these days enough of us in the Senate can say \nto our colleagues, can say to the administration, and can say to our \ntrading partners and our allies, that things are going to have to \nchange. We believe in the global economy. I believe in expanding trade \nopportunities. I do not believe in putting up walls, and I do not \nbelieve in restricting trade. But I believe very much this country \nneeds to say to our trading partners that we insist and demand fair \ntrade rules. We demand it.\n\n  It was fine 40 years ago that we did not have them because we did not \nneed\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\nthem and we were helping other countries get back on their feet. That \nis not the case any longer. With Japan, we need some equilibrium and \nfairness. If you want to ship your products to this country, God bless \nyou. They are welcome, and our consumers will be advantaged by having \nthe ability to buy them. But we demand the same of your consumers. We \ndemand the ability of your consumers to buy that which is produced in \nthis country.\n  When you go to a grocery store in Tokyo and pay $30 or $35 for a \npound of T-bone steak, you do that because they do not have enough \nbeef. They don't have enough beef. That is because we don't get enough \nAmerican beef in, because it is limited. Why? Because we have a trade \nagreement that provides, as we speak, a 40-percent tariff on every \nsingle pound of American beef going into Japan. If we did that on \nanything Japan sends into this country, it would be considered an \noutrage. We would be held up to ridicule, saying how on Earth dare the \nUnited States do this? Yet for every single pound of U.S. beef going \ninto Japan as I speak, today, there is a 40-percent tariff attached to \nit. It is not fair.\n  My point is this country can compete. Its producers can compete \nanywhere in the world any time. But only if we negotiate trade \nagreements and enforce trade agreements that are fair to our country \nand our producers and that are mutually beneficial to us and to our \ntrading partners.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
