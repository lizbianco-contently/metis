You \nhave shown us so clearly what should and should not be done. When the \nfabric of our human relationships is being frayed, it is time to deepen \nour relationship with You. Draw each Senator into healing communion \nwith You that will give physical strength and spiritual assurance of \nYour unqualified love for him or her. Then in the inner heart give Your \npeace and direction. Give each Senator the courage to speak truth as \nshe or he hears it and knows it. When this trial is finished, may none \nfeel the pangs of unspoken convictions.\n  Dear God, we also know there is something we dare not do when good \npeople disagree. You do not condone the impugning of other people's \ncharacters because they hold different convictions. You do not want us \nto break our unity or the bond of sacred friendship. Bless these good \nSenators as they press forward together with love for You, America, and \neach other. In the unity of Your spirit and the bond of peace. Amen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Sergeant at Arms will make the proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial is approved to date.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, in a few moments, the Senate will resume \nthe closed session in order to allow Members to continue to deliberate \nthe two articles of impeachment. Members are reminded that the motion \nadopted yesterday allows for a Record to be printed on the day of the \nvote on the articles which could contain Senators' final statements if \nthey choose to have them printed.\n  Also, Senator Daschle was just noting that while Senators have been \ncareful not to comment on the discussion in closed session, we still \nshould use a lot of discretion in going out and talking to the media \nabout the details of what is happening here. I don't think there have \nbeen any violations, but use a lot of discretion. I would prefer we not \neven talk about which Senator spoke or how many spoke. I think we need \nto be careful in doing that.\n  I expect the Senate will be in session until approximately 6. We will \nconfer with the Senators, the leadership, and the Chief Justice, and \nsee how the discussions are going, and the speeches, how many are being \nmade. Perhaps we would wrap it up before that. It would just depend on \nhow much endurance we have today.\n  We will have a break from 12 until about 1:15, one hour and 15 \nminutes for lunch to allow the Chief Justice some time to return to the \nSupreme Court and then come back.\n  I expect the Senate to convene again tomorrow at 10 a.m. in order to \ntry to conclude the debate and vote on the articles if at all possible \nby 5 o'clock on Thursday. If we are still having speeches, if we can't \ndo it, we would certainly just go over until Friday, but I think we \nneed to talk about that goal of 5 o'clock on Thursday.\n  Mr. REID. Thursday.\n  Mr. LOTT. Also, I know some Senators are still on the way here from \ncommittee meetings. There are only two or three going on today, but we \ndidn't give them much notice that we were going to begin at 10, but we \nare notifying everybody now that we will come in at 10 tomorrow, so \nthat they will go ahead and be able to take action this morning to \ncancel those hearings and be here sharply at 10 o'clock.\n  Again, we will alternate today, across the aisle, with the speakers \ngoing for up to 15 minutes.\n  Senator Inhofe is scheduled to be our first speaker today.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to Senator Coverdell.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent to pose a \npoint of clarification to the majority leader.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. Leader, I am still a little confused about this \nposting of a statement in the Record. Is it possible for a Member of \nthe Senate to submit to the closed session their statement rather than \nspeaking? I think that might be desirable on the part of some.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think the answer to that is yes. You can do that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In other words, if I chose, I could submit the \nstatement in my sequence to the Record, and subsequently, at my choice, \ndecide whether it will be made part of the Congressional Record \nsubsequent to the close?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that is correct.\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, and I would also say they would all appear the \nsame as if they were spoken or not spoken.\n  Mr. LOTT. Correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, and I appreciate the courtesy of my \ngood friend from Mississippi, I notice, as he has, that there are a lot \nof empty seats here in the Chamber. I realize at one time we thought we \nwere coming in at noon, to have committee meetings.\n  If these statements are not made in the Record, the only time we are \ngoing to have a chance to discuss with each other what our thoughts are \nis in this closed session, by being here. I also think, in respect to \nthe Chief Justice, we should be doing that.\n  I am inclined, I would say to my friend from Mississippi, to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum. I am withholding, just for a moment, doing \nthat. But if we are going to be off in committee meetings, I don't \nthink that does service to the intent of this closed door hearing.\n\n  I hope that both leaders--and I have discussed this with the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, too--would urge Members to be here. \nNothing could be more important than this on our agenda today and \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I certainly agree with that. We are \ngoing to have to have a momentary quorum, just to get the doors closed \nand then officially go forward. We will call and make sure all the \ncommittee hearings are being shut down. Actually, I think Members are \ncoming in steadily, and within a moment we are probably going to have \nalmost all the Senators here. But we will take just a couple of minutes \nto notify committees to complete their actions and come on the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might complete then, Mr. Chief Justice, out of \nrespect to my friend from Mississippi, and in courtesy to what he said, \nI will not make that suggestion, knowing that he is going to make a \nsimilar suggestion anyway.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the distinguished majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. Chief Justice, we are eager to get on with the debate. \nWe have a quorum present. The Senator can make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present, but it is obvious to the naked eye that a quorum \nis present.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. Leader, would you yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think it is important, for the record, that it be \nknown there are at least 60 to 70 Members in the Chamber, ready to \nproceed.\n  Mr. LOTT. My count is we have about 70 Members here and I'm sure we \nwill have a full complement here momentarily, so we can lock the doors \nand give a few more Senators a little more time to get here. Would the \nSenator from Alaska like to speak?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I ask for clarification relative to submitting \nstatements in the Record and having them printed? What day would they \nbe printed in the Record, assuming that we finish Thursday? The Friday \nRecord?\n  Mr. LOTT. The day of the vote, which means it would come out, I \nguess, the next day. So if we vote on Thursday--if we vote on Friday, \nthen it would be available, I guess, Saturday morning. If we vote \nThursday night, it would be available in the Record Friday morning.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senators choose.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Would the leader wish we go into closed session \nbefore the quorum call?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and then suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will now resume closed session for \nfinal deliberations on the articles of impeachment.\n\n\n                             Closed Session\n\n  (At 10:16 a.m., the doors of the Chamber were closed. The proceedings \nof the Senate were held in closed session until 6:21 p.m., at which \ntime the following occurred.)\n\n\n                              Open Session\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate return to open session.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Orders for Thursday, February 11, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 10 \na.m. on Thursday, February 11. I further ask that upon reconvening on \nThursday and immediately following the prayer, the majority leader be \nrecognized to make a brief statement with respect to the Senate \nschedule. I further ask unanimous consent that following the majority \nleader's comments, the Senate resume final deliberations in closed \nsession on the articles of impeachment.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. In the absence of objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Program\n\n  Mr. LOTT. We will reconvene tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, and we \nhope to be able to finish tomorrow afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, but we \nhave to make a lot better progress than we did today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/10/senate-section/article/S1411-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to establish a \nmultiagency program in support of the Materials Corridor Partnership \nInitiative to promote energy efficient, environmentally sound economic \ndevelopment along the border with Mexico through the research, \ndevelopment, and use of new materials; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n          NATIONAL MATERIALS CORRIDOR PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nthe ``National Materials Corridor Partnership Act of 1999.'' This bill \nwill establish a comprehensive, multiagency program, led by the \nDepartment of Energy, to promote energy efficient, environmentally \nsound economic development along the US-Mexican border through the \nresearch, development, and use of new materials technology. I am also \npleased to say that I developed this bill with Congressman George \nBrown, the ranking member of the House Science Committee, who will \nintroduce it in the House of Representatives.\n  As many of you are aware, NAFTA and the globalization of our economy \nhave created a surge of economic\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\ngrowth all along the 2000 mile US-Mexican border. The border region has \nbecome a major center for manufacturing and assembly in many \nindustries, such as microelectronics and automobile parts, as well as a \ncenter for many materials industries, such as metals and plastics. \nHowever, with this economic growth have come serious problems. \nPollution, hazardous wastes, and the inefficient use of resources \nthreaten people's health and the prospects for long term economic \ngrowth. For example, there are numerous ``non-attainment'' regions for \ncarbon monoxide and ozone along the border. If you've been down to the \nEl Paso area, where New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico come together, your \neyes and nose will tell you something's not as it should be.\n  However, solutions to some of these problems may lie close at hand--\nin new materials technologies. There are many research institutions \nalong both sides of the border which have expertise in materials \ntechnology. In my state alone, Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs, New \nMexico Tech, and the University of New Mexico, among others, are all \ninvolved in materials research. The importance of materials technology \nis often underappreciated, perhaps because it is so ubiquitous. But in \nmany cases it is the very wellspring of technological revolutions. We \nhave named various epochs of our history after new materials--the Stone \nAge, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age--because of how powerfully they can \nchange our lives. Even today, materials science gave us the transistors \nand fiber optics lines that created the information age, the age of \nSilicon Valley. Materials technology can be a very powerful tool for \nimproving people's standard of living.\n  Of course, the technologies coming out of this program are unlikely \nto create a new age, but they will be extremely helpful. For example, \nthere are many family operated brick factories along the border which \nuse very dirty fuels, like old tires, to fire their kilns. This fuel \nis, as you might guess, extremely polluting. In fact, brick factories \nare the third most significant source of air pollution along the \nborder, after automobiles and road dust. Los Alamos has looked at \nredesigning the kilns, a materials processing technology, to use much \nless fuel and have a lower reject rate. This means less pollution and \nsuggests the possibility of maybe even using natural gas to \neconomically fire the kilns. The end result could be a major reduction \nin one pollution source.\n  Another well known problem is the solvents the microelectronics \nindustry uses to clean its devices during assembly, which also \ncontribute to smog. Los Alamos has developed a way to substitute \nsupercritical carbon dioxide for these solvents within a closed system. \nThis substitution of materials could reduce energy consumption, \nprocessing time, and an important source of industrial pollution.\n  The idea for a US-Mexican program to promote environmentally sound \neconomic growth along the border via materials technology was \noriginally suggested in 1993 by Hans Mark, then of the University of \nTexas, now the Director of Defense Research and Engineering. While \nMexico's economic crisis of the early 90's stalled things, in 1998 the \nMexican government revived the idea, proposing a ``Materials Corridor \nPartnership Initiative'' to the US-Mexican Binational Commission, and \noffering $1 million of funding for it if the United States would do the \nsame. While an informal group with many research organizations, the \n``Materials Corridor Council,'' has organized itself in response, the \nUS government has yet to pick up on the Mexican offer. My legislation \nis meant to kick start the ``Materials Corridor Partnership \nInitiative'' inside the federal government.\n  So, what are the features of the program? It would be an interagency \nprogram led by the Department of Energy (DOE). An interagency program \nis a good way to bring various talents to bear on complex problems. DOE \nis a good choice to lead this program because its energy efficiency and \nnational security missions, including nuclear cleanup, have led it to \ndevelop a large array of materials technologies to improve energy \nefficiency, reduce pollution, or handle hazardous wastes. In fact, in \n1996, DOE was the largest civilian funder of materials research. Under \nDOE's leadership, the State Department, Environmental Protection \nAgency, National Science Foundation, and National Institutes of \nStandards and Technology will bring their complementary capabilities to \nthe program as diplomats, environmental scientists, basic researchers, \nand standards experts.\n  The program will focus on materials technology to improve energy \nefficiency, minimize or eliminate pollution and global climate change \ngases, and use recycled materials as primary materials through three \ntypes of projects. First, there will be applied research projects aimed \nat showing the feasibility of a materials technology in order to hasten \nits adoption by industry. These projects will typically be led by \ncompanies, and to ensure the firms are really interested in the \ntechnology, the federal government will pay no more than 50% of the \ncost of such a project. Second, there will be basic research projects \nto discover new knowledge useful in creating these materials \ntechnologies; these will typically be led by an academic or other \nresearch institutions. Third, there will education and training \nprojects to train border scientists, engineers, and workers in these \nnew technologies. To cover this, the bill authorizes $5 million per \nyear for five years.\n  Finally, this program will be a cooperative program with Mexico. Our \nborder is, by definition, something we share. We share its \nopportunities and its problems, so it makes sense to share the \nsolutions. Pollution needs no passport. Now, perhaps we will still be \nable to pick up Mexico's offer of $1 million for this program, but, in \nany event, the bill calls upon the Secretary of Energy to encourage \nMexican organizations to contribute to it. And, to foster US-Mexican \ncooperation whenever possible, the bill allows US funds to be used by \norganizations located in Mexico provided Mexican organizations \ncontribute significant resources to that particular project. Working \nclosely with the Mexicans to solve our common problems will be much \nmore effective than trying to go it alone.\n  Mr. President, I think the ``National Materials Corridor Partnership \nAct of 1999'' is an idea whose time has finally arrived. I hope my \ncolleagues, particularly from the states along the US-Mexican border, \nwill join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                 S. 397\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of Native American history and culture; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                      The Buffalo Coin Act of 1999\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Buffalo \nNickel Coin Act, a bill based on legislation I introduced in the 105th \nCongress, S. 1112 and Senate Amendment 3013. This bill authorizes the \nminting of a limited-edition commemorative coin, based on the design of \nthe original Buffalo Nickel, which was in circulation from 1913 to \n1938. It also directs the dedication of profits from the sale of the \ncoin to the construction of the Smithsonian's Museum of the Native \nAmerican. This bill is in compliance with USC Title 31, the \nCommemorative Coin Act.\n  In February 1998, I presented the design of the coin to the Mint and \nprovided testimony regarding the history of the nickel and its design. \nFormer Ambassador to Austria and Colorado buffalo rancher, Swanee Hunt, \njoined me at this presentation to share her support.\n  Since then I have been working closely with officials at the Treasury \nand the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The \nrecommendation of the Committee is necessary in order to bring the coin \ninto circulation. In their 1998 annual report, the Committee approved \nthe minting of a half-dollar coin, based on the design of the Buffalo \nNickel, which will go into circulation in 2001. The Committee's \nrecommendation to put the coin into circulation in 2001 will coincide \nwell with the Museum's scheduled opening date of 2002.\n  This legislation reflects the goals of all interested parties, and \nstill maintains the original goal of raising funds for the preservation \nof Native American artifacts in the Museum of the American Indian. I \nurge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Buffalo Coin Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. BUFFALO HALF-DOLLAR.\n\n       Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(n) Buffalo Half-Dollar.--\n       ``(1) Denominations.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, during the 3-year period beginning on January 1, \n     2001, the Secretary shall mint and issue each year not more \n     than 500,000 half-dollar coins, minted in accordance with \n     this title.\n       ``(2) Design requirements.--The design of the half-dollar \n     coins minted under this subsection shall be based on the \n     original 5-cent buffalo nickel designed by James Earle Fraser \n     and minted from 1913 to 1938.

A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n            Indian Gaming Regulatory Improvement Act of 1999\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Improvement Act of 1999, co-sponsored by Senator \nInouye, to address two critical elements related to the federal \ncomponent of Indian gaming regulation.\n  With any legislation affecting Indian gaming, it is important to keep \nin mind the aims of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA): \nensuring that gaming continues to be a tool for Indian economic \ndevelopment, and ensuring that the games conducted are kept free from \ncorrupting forces to maintain the integrity of the industry.\n  First, this bill provides necessary reforms in the area of gaming \nregulation by requiring that the National Indian Gaming Commission and \nthe gaming tribes themselves, develop and implement a system of minimum \ninternal control, background investigation and licensing standards for \nall tribes that operate class II and class III gaming.\n  My intention in proposing these standards is to guarantee that gaming \nis conducted in a safe and fair manner at every tribal gaming facility \nin the United States not only to preserve gaming integrity but to \nprovide certainty and security to the consumers of Indian gaming.\n  Second, this legislation provides that the fees assessed are used \nonly for the regulatory activities of the National Indian Gaming \nCommission (NIGC) by requiring that all fees be paid into a trust fund, \nwhich may only be accessed by the NIGC for purposes approved by \nCongress.\n  The existing federal Indian gaming law was passed by Congress more \nthan ten years ago. At that time, gaming was a small industry, \nconsisting mainly of high stakes bingo operations, termed ``class II'' \ngaming under the statute.\n  In 1988, virtually no one contemplated that gaming would become the \nbillion dollar industry that exists today, providing tribes with much \nneeded capital for development and employment opportunities where none \npreviously existed.\n  Because of gaming, some tribes have been wildly successful, fortunate \nbecause of their geographical location. These tribes employ thousands \nof people, both Indian and non-Indian, and have greatly reduced the \nwelfare rolls in their local area.\n  Though gaming revenues have exploded in the last ten years, the IGRA \nhas been significantly amended only one time. In 1997, I introduced an\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\namendment that would allow the NIGC to assess fees against casino-style \ngaming operations, termed ``class III'' gaming under the statute, and \nto fund its regulatory efforts in Indian Country.\n  Mr. President, these additional fees are necessary to ensure \nmeaningful federal involvement in the regulation of class III gaming. \nAs of January 1, 1998, approximately 77% of NIGC-approved management \ncontracts were for class III operations. In 1997, the NIGC processed \nsome 18,000 fingerprint cards and 21,000 investigative reports. The \nCommission also approved some 241 tribal gaming ordinances and, \nimportantly, took 53 formal enforcement actions. The vast majority of \nthese enforcement actions were issued against class III operations. \nMost striking, before the 1997 amendment was enacted, the NIGC employed \nonly 7 investigators who were responsible for monitoring the entire \nIndian gaming industry.\n  The 1997 amendment has enabled the NIGC to take steps to increase its \nregulation and enforcement efforts. Additionally, the Commission has \nbeen able to hire much-needed field investigators who are personally \nresponsible for monitoring local tribal gaming operations. The \nCommission should be applauded for these activities.\n  What these facts and figures do not reveal, however, is the \nsignificant amount of tribal and joint tribal-state regulatory \nactivities undertaken at the local level. It should be noted that many \nIndian tribes, often working with the states where gaming is located, \nhave developed sophisticated regulatory frameworks for their gaming \noperations.\n  Many of those tribes have put in place standards regarding rules of \nplay for their games, as well as financial and accounting standards for \ntheir operations. They are significant and for many tribes contribute \nthe bulk of regulatory activities under the IGRA.\n  The amendment I propose today would require the NIGC, prior to \nassessing any fee against an Indian gaming operation, to determine the \nnature and level of any such tribal or joint tribal-state regulatory \nactivities and to reduce the fees assessed accordingly.\n  The goals of this provision are two-fold: to provide the NIGC with \nthe resources it needs to carry out its obligations under the IGRA, but \nto recognize the often significant regulatory activities at the local \nlevel.\n  It is important for us to keep these facts, and the goals of the \ngaming statute, in mind. Where gaming exists, it provides a great \nopportunity for tribes to develop other business and development \nprojects. However, it must be our goal, and it is my mission, to assist \nthe tribes in the development of their economies through clean and \nefficient gaming operations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these reasonable and necessary \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide technical corrections to the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, to \nimprove the delivery of housing assistance to Indian tribes in a manner \nthat recognizes the right of tribal self-governance, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n     Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act \n                           Amendments of 1999\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in 1996 Congress enacted historic \nlegislation involving the financing, construction, and maintenance of \nhousing for American Indians and Alaska Natives. With this initiative, \ncalled the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination \nAct (NAHASDA), decisions regarding Indian housing are no longer solely \na matter for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n  Consistent with principles of local autonomy and Indian self-\ndetermination, NAHASDA enables tribes--for the first time--to develop \nand implement housing plans that meet their needs, and in a way that is \nmore efficient. The Act requires that funds for Indian housing be \nprovided to Indian tribes in housing block grants with monitoring and \noversight provided by HUD.\n  I am hopeful that the successes achieved by tribes who participate in \nthe Indian Self-Determination and Education Act and the Tribal Self-\nGovernance Act can now be duplicated in the housing arena with the \nimplementation of NAHASDA. With housing as the anchor for community \ndevelopment, we can turn our attention to other initiatives such as \nbanking, business development, and infrastructure construction.\n  NAHASDA became effective October 1, 1997. In implementing the Act \nboth HUD and the tribes have told us that there are provisions in the \nstatute in need of clarification. I would like to cite two examples.\n  Prior to the passage of NAHASDA, Indian tribes receiving HOME block \ngrant funds could use those funds to leverage low income housing tax \ncredits. Unlike HOME funds, block grants to tribes under the new \nNAHASDA are considered ``federal funds'' and cannot be used to access \nthese tax credits.\n  Therefore, tribes cannot use designated new block grant funds to \naccess a program which they formerly could is an unintended consequence \naffecting housing development in Indian country. This bill would \nrestore tribal eligibility for the low income housing tax credit by \nplacing NAHASDA funds on the same footing as HOME funds, with no change \nto current low income housing tax credit programs.\n  In addition, there are conflicting provisions in the statute with \nregard to the authority of the HUD Secretary to enforce the act against \nnon-compliant entities. This bill clarifies that authority and provides \nclear guidance for the Secretary in such instances.\n  Tribal leaders, Indian housing experts, and federal officials \ntestified at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in \nMarch 1997 about funding and other anticipated problems, including \nachieving the appropriate level of oversight and monitoring. The focus \nof the hearing was constructive and encouraged all parties to work for \na better managed and more efficient Indian housing system.\n  The bill I am introducing today, joined by Senator Inouye, the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act Amendments of \n1999, provides the required clarification and changes that will help \nthe tribes and HUD in achieving a smoother transition from the old \nhousing regime to the new framework of NAHASDA.\n  In the last session, I originally introduced a bill identical to this \nlegislation, S.1280, and I am hopeful that these amendments can be \nenacted this year.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs I am committed to \nensuring that funds for Indian housing are used efficiently, properly \nand within the bounds provided by law. I also want to ensure that, \nconsistent with the federal obligation to Indian tribes, tribal members \nhave safe, decent, and affordable housing. That is the goal of NAHASDA \nand that is the policy of this Congress.\n  I am confident that the implementation of NAHASDA has given tribes \nthe\n\n[[Page S1421]]\n\nability to better design and implement their own housing plans and in \nthe process provide better housing opportunities to their tribal \nmembers. In making the transition from dominating the housing realm to \nmonitoring the activities of the tribes, HUD needs guidance from the \nCommittee as to its proper role and responsibilities under the Act.\n  The Act, and the amendments I am proposing today, will go a long way \nin making sure that the management problems that were associated with \nthe old, HUD-dominated housing system will be eliminated, paving the \nway for more and better housing for American Indians and Alaska \nNatives.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting these reasonable and \nnecessary amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follow:\n\n                                 S. 400\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for business development and trade \npromotion for native Americans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n The Native American Business Development Trade Promotion and Tourism \n                                  Act\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to assist \nIndians and tribal businesses to foster entrepreneurship and healthy \nreservation economies. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Inouye. As \nwe stand ready to enter the next century, Indian tribes and their \nmembers continue to face many challenges--poor health, substandard \nhousing and educational facilities, substance abuse, and a host of \nother social and economic problems.\n  A top priority for the Committee on Indian Affairs and me in the next \ntwo years will be to help tribal governments build stronger and \nhealthier economies to provide jobs and hope to their members.\n  The results of centuries of federal domination of Indian affairs and \nIndian economies is predictable: stagnant reservation economies and the \nabsence of a private sector to create the kind of job opportunities and \nbusiness-creating activities that Indians so desperately need.\n  Despite the popular myth that ``all Indians are rich'' from gambling, \nthe realities of life for the great majority of Native Americans are \nharsh and have shown little sign of improvement in recent years. In the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s, the national unemployment rate was 25 \npercent, and it was a national crisis.\n  In 1999, Indian country has a collective unemployment rate running at \n50% and there are few comments made, little urgency heard, and very \nlittle being done to address the problem. We sympathize, as we should, \nwith Third World countries torn by strife and lack of economic \ndevelopment. We provide loan guarantees, technical assistance, and aid \nand trade.\n  For Indians, the response is usually that ``they should just get a \njob''. The fact is there are few if any job opportunities on most \nIndian lands in this nation.\n  The requirement that people on federal assistance get and keep a job \nis the long-term goal of the 1996 welfare reform laws, and frankly, the \ntribes are behind the curve in preparing for the full implementation of \nthe law. The goal of the legislation I introduce today and other bills \nthis session will be on helping attract capital and value-added \nactivities to Indian lands in such fields as manufacturing, energy, \nagriculture, livestock and fisheries, high technology and electronic \ncommerce, arts and crafts and a host of service industries.\n  This bill aims to make best use of existing programs to provide the \nnecessary tools to tribes to attract and retain capital and employment. \nThe model I am encouraging with this bill has proven highly successful \nin the self governance arena and in the Indian job training program, \nknown as the ``477 program''.\n  By providing for an efficient coordination of existing business \ndevelopment programs in the Commerce Department and maximizing \nresources\n\n[[Page S1423]]\n\navailable to tribes, this bill is a first step toward better \ncooperation between and within agencies across the federal government.\n  Building healthy Indian economies will require efforts by the tribal \nas well as the federal government. The tribes have a responsibility as \nwell. A fundamental principle of Indian self determination requires \nthat the tribes play a greater role in their own affairs. In many areas \nsuch as self governance, the tribes are increasingly administering \nfederal services, programs, and activities in lieu of the federal \ngovernment. This has led to more capable and accountable tribal \ngovernments.\n  A corollary of Indian political self government is a reduction in the \ndependence on the federal bureaucracy and federal funds, through \nassuming a greater role in the tribes funding their own government \nactivities. A number of tribes are achieving some success in reaching \nthis stage, and it should be our policy to assist more tribes in \nachieving this transition from federal to tribal-domination of tribal \naffairs.\n  Under this bill, the Native American Business Development Office \n(NABDO) will coordinate existing programs within the Department of \nCommerce, including those geared to encouraging American businesses in \nthe fields of international trade and tourism.\n  I want to be clear: this bill does not create any new programs but \nwill achieve more efficiency in those that already exist, and within \nexisting budget authority. Because the central aim of the legislation \nis to encourage non-gaming development, the bill also prohibits \nassistance under the act from being used for gaming on Indian lands.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in providing the tools necessary to \nbuild strong and diversified Indian economies so that tribal members \nhave the same job opportunities enjoyed by other Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 401\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Business \n     Development, Trade Promotion, and Tourism Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States \n     Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the \n     United States and Indian tribes;\n       (2) beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon \n     Administration, of the Indian self-determination era of the \n     Federal Government, each President has confirmed the special \n     government-to-government relationship between Indian tribes \n     and the United States;\n       (3) in 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive \n     memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies that \n     obligated all Federal departments and agencies, particularly \n     those that have an impact on economic development, to \n     evaluate the potential impacts of their actions on Indian \n     tribes;\n       (4) consistent with the principles of inherent tribal \n     sovereignty and the special relationship between Indian \n     tribes and the United States, Indian tribes retain the right \n     to enter into contracts and agreements to trade freely, and \n     seek enforcement of treaty and trade rights;\n       (5) Congress has carried out the responsibility of the \n     United States for the protection and preservation of Indian \n     tribes and the resources of Indian tribes through the \n     endorsement of treaties, and the enactment of other laws, \n     including laws that provide for the exercise of \n     administrative authorities;\n       (6) the United States has an obligation to guard and \n     preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster \n     strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency among Indian tribes;\n       (7) the capacity of Indian tribes to build strong tribal \n     governments and vigorous economies is hindered by the \n     inability of Indian tribes to engage communities that \n     surround Indian lands and outside investors in economic \n     activities on Indian lands;\n       (8) despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n     value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives suffer higher rates of \n     unemployment, poverty, poor health, substandard housing, and \n     associated social ills than those of any other group in the \n     United States;\n       (9) the United States has an obligation to assist Indian \n     tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and \n     political conditions with respect to Indian lands to--\n       (A) encourage investment from outside sources that do not \n     originate with the tribes; and\n       (B) facilitate economic ventures with outside entities that \n     are not tribal entities;\n       (10) the economic success and material well-being of \n     American Indian and Alaska Native communities depends on the \n     combined efforts of the Federal Government, tribal \n     governments, the private sector, and individuals;\n       (11) the lack of employment and entrepreneurial \n     opportunities in the communities referred to in paragraph (8) \n     has resulted in a multigenerational dependence on Federal \n     assistance that is--\n       (A) insufficient to address the magnitude of needs;

A bill to prohibit implementation of ``Know Your Customer'' \nregulations by the Federal banking agencies; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     legislation to prohibit implementation of know your customer \n                              regulations\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to help protect the financial privacy of Americans. The so-\ncalled Know Your Customer regulations proposed by Federal banking \nagencies threaten the privacy of our financial transactions. My bill \nwould ensure that those regulations are not enacted, and that Americans \ncan be confident in the privacy of their bank account.\n  Governmental overregulation has invaded nearly every aspect of our \nlives, often at the cost of our privacy. Technology has the potential \nto accelerate the invasion of our privacy.\n  The Know Your Customer regulations have been proposed by the four \nbanking regulators: the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. \nThese regulations may force banks to snoop through customers' bank \naccounts under the guise of looking for ``suspicious activity.'' Banks \nwould have to know the source of funds for all financial transactions. \nSpecifically, the regulations would require banks to develop standards \nof normal and expected transactions for all accounts. The bank then \nwould be required to monitor all account activity to see if it fits the \nnormal and expected activity profile. If a financial transaction takes \nplace that doesn't fit the model, the bank could be forced to file a \nsuspicious activity report with a federal law enforcement agency, such \nas the FBI or DEA.\n  Imagine that you sell an old car and then go to the bank to deposit \nthe money in your account. You explain that you simply sold your car \nand this is the money from the sale. However, you are informed that the \nexplanation is insufficient. The deposit does not fit your usual and \nexpected transaction profile, so you might be reported to law \nenforcement officials. You may now have to prove to the satisfaction of \nthe FBI or other federal agency that you are not a drug dealer or money \nlaunderer. These proposed regulations could force you to prove your \ninnocence before you have even been accused of a crime.\n  Unfortunately, this scenario is one that could be repeated many times \nover. Anytime someone receives a bonus at work, receives an \ninheritance, receives a large gift, sells a large item, or withdraws \nmoney to make a major purchase it could trigger a suspicious activity \nreport and an investigation by law enforcement. The perverse effect of \ncausing law enforcement officials to investigate so much mundane \nfinancial activity merely because it deviates from some profile of \n``normal'' is that resources will be unavailable to combat genuine \nfinancial fraud.\n  Would all this happen? We don't know, but the extremely broad and \nvague wording of the draft regulations could certainly permit it to \nhappen.\n  Furthermore, these regulations are unnecessary because banks already \npartner with law enforcement to fight financial crime without invading \nthe privacy of customers. Banks currently report insider abuse, \nviolations of federal law, and potential money laundering activity. But \nthese are after the fact. Banks are also required to report all cash \ntransactions over $10,000. By contrast, the proposed regulations would \nforce them to snoop through accounts to look for transactions to \nreport, merely because they are deemed ``suspicious.'' Banks are then \ntransformed from an agent monitoring regulatory compliance to an \ninvestigator and enforcer for the government. This creates a \nsignificant unfunded federal mandate for the banking industry.\n\n  Accordingly, the proposed regulations are opposed by major banking \ngroups, including the American Bankers Association and the Independent \nBankers Association of America. They fear a loss of privacy for their \ncustomers that would negatively impact their industry. In addition, \nthese regulations are very selective-credit unions, securities firms, \nand insurance firms would not be subject to the proposed regulations.\n  Obviously, these proposed regulations could be detrimental to the \nmillions of Americans who use a bank for their financial transactions. \nThis legislation would prevent the Federal banking agencies involved \nfrom implementing the proposed Know Your Customer regulations. We must \nprotect the financial privacy of Americans, and prevent the proposed \nregulations from being enacted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 403\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--No regulation or amendment thereto \n     prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or any Federal \n     banking agency under subchapter II or III of chapter 53 of \n     title 31, United States Code, chapter 2 of Public Law 91-508, \n     or any other provision of Federal law, that requires a \n     depository institution or any other private entity to obtain \n     information concerning any person in connection with a \n     financial transaction between such person and the depository \n     institution or other private entity (commonly referred to as \n     ``know your customer'' regulations) may be implemented or \n     otherwise take effect on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Definitions.--The terms ``Federal banking agency'' and \n     ``depository institution'' have the same meanings as in \n     section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Helms, Mr. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 404. A bill to prohibit the return of veterans memorial objects to \nforeign nations without specific authorization in law; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n            Veterans Memorial Physical Integrity Act of 1999\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nintroduce S. 404, a bill to prohibit the return to a foreign country of \nany portion of a memorial to American veterans without the express \nauthorization of Congress. The bill is identical to S. 1903 which I \nintroduced at the end of the last Congress.\n  I would not have thought that a bill like this was necessary, Mr. \nPresident. It would never have occurred to me that an Administration \nwould even briefly consider dismantling part of a memorial to American \nsoldiers who died in the line of duty in order to send a piece of that \nmemorial to a foreign country; but a real possibility of just that \nhappening exists in my state of Wyoming involving what are known as the \n``Bells of Balangiga.''\n  In 1898, the Treaty of Paris brought to a close the Spanish-American \nWar. As part of the treaty, Spain ceded possession of the Philippines \nto the United States. At about the same time, the Filipino people began \nan insurrection in their country. In August 1901, as part of the \nAmerican effort to stem the insurrection, a company of 74 officers and \nmen from the 9th Infantry, Company G, occupied the town of Balangiga\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\non the island of Samar. These men came from Ft. Russell in Cheyenne, \nWyoming--today's F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n  On September 28 of that year, taking advantage of the preoccupation \nof the American troops with a church service for the just-assassinated \nPresident McKinley, a group of Filipino insurgents infiltrated the \ntown. Only three American sentries were on duty that day. As described \nin an article in the November 19, 1997 edition of the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       Officers slept in, and enlisted men didn't bother to carry \n     their rifles as they ambled out of their quarters for \n     breakfast. Balangiga had been a boringly peaceful site since \n     the infantry company arrived a month earlier, according to \n     military accounts and soldiers' statements. The quiet ended \n     abruptly when a 23-year-old U.S. sentry named Adolph Gamlin \n     walked past the local police chief. In one swift move, the \n     Filipino grabbed the slightly built Iowan's rifle and smashed \n     the butt across [Gamlin's] head. As PFC Gamlin crumpled, the \n     bells of Balangiga began to peal.\n       With the signal, hundreds of Filipino fighters swarmed out \n     of the surrounding forest, armed with clubs, picks and \n     machete-like bolo knives. Other poured out of the church; \n     they had arrived the night before, disguised as women \n     mourners and carrying coffins filled with bolos. A sergeant \n     was beheaded in the mess tent and dumped into a vat of \n     steaming wash water. A young bugler was cut down in a nearby \n     stream. The company commander was hacked to death after \n     jumping out a window. Besieged infantrymen defended \n     themselves with kitchen forks, mess kits and baseball bats. \n     Others threw rocks and cans of beans.\n       Though he was also slashed across the back, PFC Gamlin came \n     to and found a rifle. By the time he and the other survivors \n     fought their way to the beach, 38 U.S. soldiers were dead and \n     all but six of the remaining men had been wounded.\n\n  The remaining soldiers escaped in five dug-out canoes. Only three \nboats made it to safety on Leyte. Seven men died of exposure at sea, \nand another eight died of their wounds; only 20 of the company's 74 \nmembers survived.\n  A detachment of 54 volunteers from 9th infantry units stationed at \nLeyte returned to Balangiga and recaptured the village. They were \nreinforced a few days later from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry \nRegiment. When the 11th Infantry was relieved on October 18 by Marines, \nthe 9th Infantry took two of the church bells and an old cannon with \nthem back to Wyoming as memorials to the fallen soldiers.\n  The bells and cannon have been displayed in front of the base \nflagpole on the central parade grounds since that time. The cannon was \nrestored by local volunteers and placed under a glass display case in \n1985 to protect it from the elements. The bells were placed in openings \nin a large specially constructed masonry wall with a plaque dedicating \nthe memorial to the memory of the fallen soldiers.\n  Off and on since 1981, there have been some discussions in various \ncircles in Cheyenne, Washington, and Manila about the future of the \nbells, including the possibility of returning them to the Philippines. \nMost recently, the Philippine government--having run into broad \nopposition to their request to have both bells returned to them--has \nproposed making a copy of both bells, and having both sides keep one \ncopy and one original.\n  Opposition to the proposal from local and national civic and veterans \ngroups has been very strong. Mr. President, I will include in the \nRecord the text of a letter from the national office of the American \nLegion dated April 8, 1998; from the national office of the VFW Dated \nJanuary 6, 1998 from the American Legion's Department of Wyoming dated \nDecember 5, 1997; and from the United Veterans Council of Wyoming dated \nMarch 13, 1998.\n  To head off any move by the Administration to dispose of the bells, I \nand Senator Enzi introduced S. 1903 on April 1. The bill had 18 \ncosponsors, including the distinguished Chairmen of the Committees on \nArmed Services, Foreign Relations, Finance, Energy and Natural \nResources, Rules, Ethics, and Banking; the Chairmen of five \nSubcommittees of the Foreign Relations Committee; and five members of \nthe Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, at this point let me dispose of a canard that was \nforwarded shortly after the time I introduced S. 1903 by those seeking \nthe return of the bells. They asserted that the bill was actually in \ncontravention of the wishes of the people of the State of Wyoming \nbecause the Wyoming Legislature, quoting a letter from the Ambassador \nof the Philippines dated April 3, 1998, ``supports the sharing of the \nbells.'' That statement, however, glosses over the real facts.\n  Wyoming's legislature is not a ``professional'' one--that is, the \nlegislators have other, full-time jobs and the Legislature only sits \nfor forty days at the beginning of each year and twenty days in the \nfall. When the Legislature meets, it is often to process an entire \nyear's worth of legislation in just a few weeks.\n  Like Congress, the Wyoming Legislature has a formal process of \nintroducing, considering, and then voting on bills which become law \nupon the signature of the chief executive--in this case the governor. \nAlso like Congress, the Legislature has a system for expressing its \nnon-binding viewpoint on certain issues through resolutions. But unlike \nCongress, the Legislature also has an informal resolution process to \nexpress the viewpoint of only a given number of legislators, as opposed \nto the entire legislative body, on a given topic; the vehicle for such \na process is called a ``joint resolution.''\n  In this process, a legislator circulates the equivalent of a petition \namong his or her colleagues. Support for the subject matter is \nsignified simply by signing one's name to the petition. Once the \nsponsor has acquired all the signatures he or she can--or wishes to--\nacquire, the joint resolution is simply deposited for the record with \nthe Office of the Governor; it is never--I repeat never--voted on in \neither House of the Legislature, nor is it signed by the governor. As a \nconsequence, it is not considered to be the position of, or the \nexpression of the will of, the Legislature as a whole, but only of \nthose legislators who signed it.\n  Although the Bells are an issue of interest among some circles state-\nwide, the issue is not well-known all over Wyoming. I have heard from \nseveral of the signatories of the joint resolution on the bells that \nthey were not aware of the circumstances surrounding the bells at the \ntime they signed the joint resolution. In this regard, it is important \nto note that the sponsor of the joint resolution did not enlighten them \nabout the role of the bells in the unprovoked killing of 54 American \nsoldiers in Balangiga before they signed the document. Moreover, that \nfact was completely and purposefully left out of the wording of the \njoint resolution itself; the death of these American soldiers was \ncompletely glossed over. The closest the joint resolution gets to \nmentioning the surprise attack and resulting deaths is this, which I \nquote verbatim:\n\n       Whereas, at a point in the relationship, nearly one hundred \n     (100) years ago following the Spanish-American War, armed \n     conflict occurred between the United States and the \n     Philippines; and\n       Whereas, a particularly noteworthy incident occurred on the \n     island of Samar in 1901 during the course of that conflict; \n     and\n       Whereas, that incident involved the ringing of the Church \n     Bells of Balangiga on Samar to signal the outbreak of \n     fighting.\n\n  Imagine. The author of the joint resolution reduced the surprise \nattack and horrible deaths of fifty-four soldiers to a seemingly \ninnocent, benign ``noteworthy incident.'' So while some may rely the \njoint resolution as though it were the ``voice of Wyoming'' in support \nof their position, an examination of the actual facts surrounding it \nproves that reliance to be very misplaced.\n  While time has passed since this issue came to a head last April, Mr. \nPresident, my deep concern that the Administration might still dispose \nof the bells has not. The Administration has not disavowed its earlier \nintent to seek to return the bells--an intent derailed by the \nintroduction of S. 1903 last year. In addition, despite Article IV, \nsection 3, clause 2 of the Constitution, which states that the \n``Congress shall have the power to dispose of . . . Property belonging \nto the United States,'' the Justice Department has issued an informal \nmemorandum stating that the Bells could possibly be disposed of by the \nPresident pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2572.\n  I continue to be amazed, even in these days of political correctness \nand revisionist history, that a U.S. President--our Commander-in-\nChief--would appear to be ready to ignore the wishes of our veterans \nand tear down a memorial to U.S. soldiers who died in the\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nline of duty in order to send part of it back to the country in which \nthey were killed. Amazed, that is, until I recall this President's \nfondness for sweeping apologies and what some might view as flashy P.R. \ngestures. Consequently, Senator Enzi and I have decided to reintroduce \nthe bill in the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, to the veterans of Wyoming, and the United States as a \nwhole, the bells represent a lasting memorial to those fifty-four \nAmerican soldiers killed as a result of an unprovoked insurgent attack \nin Balangiga on September 28, 1901. In their view, which I share, any \nattempt to remove either or both of the bells--and in doing so actually \nphysically dismantling a war memorial--is a desecration of that memory.\n  S. 404 will protect the bells and similar veterans memorials from \nsuch an ignoble fate. The bill is quite simple; it prohibits the \ntransfer of a veterans memorial or any portion thereof to a foreign \ncountry or government unless specifically authorized by law; \nRepresentative Barbara Cubin is introducing similar legislation this \nweek in the House. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Enzi, Helms, \nHagel, Smith of Oregon, Murkowski, Smith of New Hampshire, Roberts, \nSessions, Nickles, and Coverdell as original cosponsors. I trust that \nmy colleagues will support its swift passage.\n  Last year, developments indicated to me that the White House was \nseriously contemplating returning one or both of the bells to the \nPhilippines. The year 1998 marked the 100th anniversary of the Treaty \nof Paris, and a state visit by then-President Fidel Ramos--his last as \nPresident--to the United States. The disposition of the bells was high \non President Ramos' agenda; he has spoken personally to President \nClinton and several Members of Congress about it over the last three \nyears, and made it one of only three agenda items the Filipino \ndelegation brought to the table. Since January 1998, the Filipino press \nhas included almost weekly articles on the bells' supposed return, \nincluding several in the Manila Times in April and May which reported \nthat a new tower to house the bells was being constructed in Borongon, \nSamar, to receive them in May. In addition, there have been a variety \nof reports vilifying me and the veterans in Wyoming for our position on \nthe issue, and others threatening economic boycotts of U.S. products or \nother unspecified acts of retaliation to force capitulation on the \nissue.\n  Moreover, inquiries to me from various agencies of the Administration \nsoliciting the opinion of the Wyoming congressional delegation on the \nissue increased in frequency in the first four months of 1998. I also \nlearned that the Defense Department, perhaps in conjunction with the \nJustice Department, prepared a legal memorandum outlining its opinion \nof who actually controls the disposition of the bells.\n  In response, the Wyoming congressional delegation wrote a letter to \nPresident Clinton on January 9, 1998 to make clear our opposition to \nremoving the bells. In response to that letter, on May 26 I received a \nletter from Sandy Berger of the National Security Council which I think \nis perhaps one of the best indicators of the direction the White House \nwas headed on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and additional \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON THE RETURN OF VETERANS MEMORIAL \n                   OBJECTS TO FOREIGN NATIONS WITHOUT SPECIFIC \n                   AUTHORIZATION IN LAW.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding section 2572 of title 10, \n     United States Code, or any other provision of law, the \n     President may not transfer a veterans memorial object to a \n     foreign country or entity controlled by a foreign government, \n     or otherwise transfer or convey such object to a person or \n     entity for purposes of the ultimate transfer or conveyance of \n     such object to a foreign country or entity controlled by a \n     foreign government, unless specifically authorized by law.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Entity controlled by a foreign government.--The term \n     ``entity controlled by a foreign government'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 2536(c)(1) of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       (2) Veterans memorial object.--The term ``veterans memorial \n     object'' means any object, including a physical structure or \n     portion thereof, that--\n       (A) is located at a cemetery of the National Cemetery \n     System, war memorial, or military installation in the United \n     States;\n       (B) is dedicated to, or otherwise memorializes, the death \n     in combat or combat-related duties of members of the United \n     States Armed Forces; and\n       (C) was brought to the United States from abroad as a \n     memorial of combat abroad.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Craig Thomas,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thomas: The American Legion supports S. 1903, \n     legislation that would prohibit the return of veterans \n     memorial objects without specific authorization in law by the \n     United States Congress.\n       Article IV, Section III of the United States Constitution \n     specifically grants Congress the authority to dispose of \n     property belonging to the United States. The Preamble to the \n     Constitution of The American Legion specifically calls for \n     The American Legion to ``uphold and defend the Constitution \n     of the United States of America'' and ``to preserve the \n     memories and incidents of our associations in the Great \n     Wars.'' The American Legion believes your legislation would \n     help achieve these two important democratic tasks.\n       Once again. The American Legion supports S. 1903, \n     legislation that would prohibit the return of veterans \n     memorial objects without specific authorization in law by the \n     United States Congress. The American Legion appreciates your \n     continued leadership on issues important to veterans, their \n     families and the United States of America.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Steve A. Robertson,\n\n                                                Director, National\n     Legislative Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Veterans of Foreign Wars of\n\n\n                                            the United States,\n\n                                                  January 6, 1998.\n     Re Bells of Balangiga.\n\n     Hon. Douglas K. Bereuter,\n     Chairman, East Asia Subcommittee, Committee on International \n         Relations, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Recently, we learned that Mr. Robert \n     Underwood, U.S. Representative from Guam, has introduced \n     House Resolution 312 urging the President to authorize the \n     transfer of ownership of one of the Bells of Balangiga to the \n     Philippines. In brief, the Bells of Balangiga, which serve as \n     a war memorial to U.S. Army soldiers killed by insurgents in \n     the Philippines in 1901, are located at E.E. Warren Air Force \n     Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The proposal of the Philippine \n     Ambassador to return one of the bells to the Philippines is \n     opposed by veterans and the supporting community in Wyoming.\n       Although the 98th National Convention of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States did not adopt a Resolution \n     on this issue, the VFW does have a position on the Bells of \n     Balangiga. After carefully reviewing the history and \n     background of the issue involving the Bells of Balangiga, the \n     VFW opposes and rejects any compromise or agreement with the \n     government of the Philippines which would result in the \n     return of any of the Bells of Balangiga to the Philippines. \n     The church bells were paid for with American blood in 1901 \n     when they were used to signal an unprovoked attack by \n     insurrectionists against an American Army garrison which \n     resulted in the massacre of 45 American soldiers. The Bells \n     serve is a permanent memorial to the sacrifice of the \n     American soldiers from Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming) who gave \n     their lives for their country while doing their duty. We do \n     not think any of the bells should be given back to the \n     Philippines. To return the bells sends the wrong message to \n     the world. In addition, local Wyoming veterans and other \n     citizens are opposed to dismantling the sacred monument and \n     returning any part of it to the Philippines.\n       In the past, several years, the Philippine Government has \n     made several attempts to get the Bells of Balangiga returned \n     to their country. To date, they have not been successful in \n     any of their attempts to get the bells returned. For the past \n     95 years, two of the bells have been enshrined at Fort \n     Russell/Warren AFB in Wyoming. The third is with the U.S. \n     Army's 9th Infantry in the Republic of Korea.\n       Recently, Philippine President Fidel Ramos ordered his \n     United States Ambassador, Paul Rabe, to step up his effort on \n     the bells hoping to have them returned in time for next \n     summer's celebration of 100 years of Philippine independence. \n     In October 1997, Ambassador Paul Rabe suggested a compromise \n     solution. He suggested returning one of the bells to the \n     Philippines thereby giving both nations an original and the \n     opportunity to make a replica. In fact, the justification for \n     the latest proposal of the Philippine government is fatally \n     flawed. The Bells of Balangiga played no part at all in \n     Admiral Dewey's defeat of the Spanish Navy at Manila Bay in \n     1898. Subsequently, that naval defeat forced the Spanish to \n     relinquish control of the Philippine Islands to the U.S. The \n     soldiers killed were from Fort D.A. Russell and were ordered \n     to the Philippine Islands because a savage guerrilla war had \n     broken\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\n     out after the conclusion of the Spanish-American War of 1896. \n     Therefore, we believe the bells have no significance or \n     connection to the celebration of Philippine independence.\n       Kenneth Weber, Commander of the VFW Department of Wyoming, \n     expressed the feelings of local Wyoming veterans and \n     supporters when he said, ``The members of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States . . . will not stand idle \n     and allow a sacred memorial to those soldiers killed while \n     doing their duty to be dismantled.''\n       We believe the Wyoming veterans are correct on this issue. \n     The bells should stay right where they are--in Wyoming and \n     with the 9th Regiment.\n           Respectfully,\n                                              Kenneth A. Steadman,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                                        Department of Wyoming,\n\n                                   Cheyenne, WY, December 5, 1997.\n     Hon. William Clinton,\n     U.S. President, White House, Washington DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: A copy of House Resolution 312 \n     urging our President to transfer one of the Bells of \n     Balingiga from F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming, \n     to the Philippines has been received by The American Legion, \n     Department of Wyoming Headquarters. On behalf of the Wyoming \n     Legionnaires and other veterans, I urge you to oppose this \n     resolution. Also attached is a Resolution from The American \n     Legion, Department of Wyoming, strongly advocating the \n     retention of both bells at F.E. Warren AFB in Cheyenne. We \n     still feel strongly that to dismantle a memorial to our \n     fallen comrades--even partially--that is almost a hundred \n     years old is a breach of faith with those who gave the \n     ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. The Preamble \n     to the Constitution of The American Legion states ``For God \n     and country, we associate ourselves for the following \n     purposes . . . to preserve the memories and incidents of our \n     association in the great wars: . . .'' We have seen some of \n     the emotions of living veterans at such memorials as the \n     Vietnam Wall and the Korean War Memorial in Washington DC. To \n     remove a memorial from the oldest active military \n     installation in our country would send a very adverse message \n     to those who are serving our country at the present time and \n     in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph G. Sestak,\n     Department Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           United Veterans Council\n\n\n                                                   of Wyoming,\n\n                                     Cheyenne, WY, March 13, 1998.\n     The President of the United States,\n     William Jefferson Clinton,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: I am writing to you concerning an \n     issue which is of great importance to Wyoming's veterans and \n     other citizens of our great state. The United Veterans \n     Council of Wyoming, Inc. is a coalition of veteran's service \n     organizations located throughout Wyoming. Members of the \n     United Veterans Council include the American Legion, the \n     Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of \n     the United States, and eleven smaller, though no less \n     important, veteran's service organizations.\n       As you may know, the Philippine government has attempted \n     since 1980 to have the Bells of Balangiga returned. In brief, \n     the bells serve as a permanent war memorial to U.S. Army \n     soldiers sent from Ft. D.A. Russell, Wyoming to the \n     Philippine Islands following the Spanish-American War of \n     1898. In 1901, soldiers garrisoned in the village of \n     Balangiga to protect the village from Muslim and rebel raids, \n     were killed by insurgents who used the church bells to signal \n     a surprise attack on a quite Sunday morning. The bells now \n     hang from an attractive brick memorial near the parade \n     grounds of Fort Russell, now F.E. Warren AFB, in Cheyenne. \n     Pentagon officials have determined that the United States \n     government has proper title to the bells under international \n     law.\n       Since his posting to Washington in 1993, Philippine \n     Ambassador Paul Rabe has been quietly negotiating the return \n     of the bells with Wyoming church leaders, civic \n     organizations, local businessmen with economic ties to the \n     Philippines and state law-makers.\n       However, after several trips to Wyoming, Ambassador Rabe \n     has yet to meet with veterans or veteran's organizations. It \n     is important to know, that for ninety-five years, U.S. \n     military personnel and Wyoming veterans have kept safe, \n     maintained, and preserved the bells. Veterans were \n     instrumental in establishing the permanent memorial as it now \n     stands, dedicated to the sacrifice of fallen comrades. The \n     memorial is adjacent to the base flag pole and part of the \n     daily retreat ceremony.\n       Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos is visiting Washington \n     in April. I understand he intends to meet with you to \n     discuss, among other things, House Resolution 312 urging the \n     transfer of ownership of one of the bells to the Philippines \n     as a compromise offer. President Ramos is attempting to \n     justify the return of one or more bells for use during a \n     centennial celebration of Philippine independence from Spain.\n       As the VFW and others have continually pointed out, the \n     Bells of Balangiga played no role in Admiral Dewey's defeat \n     of the Spanish Navy at Manila Bay in 1898, three years before \n     the bells were used to signal the massacre of the U.S. \n     soldiers at Balangiga. Following Admiral Dewey's victory, \n     Spain relinquished control of the islands to the United \n     States. The Philippines were granted their independence in \n     1946. We believe the bells have no significance or connection \n     to any celebration of Philippine independence from Spain.\n       The Philippine government even compared the church bells to \n     our Liberty Bell, a comparison which is completely unfounded \n     and quite a stretch. The Liberty Bell was rung on July 8, \n     1776 following the first public reading of the Declaration of \n     Independence. The Bells of Balangiga, as used in 1901, \n     signaled the brutal massacre by Filipino insurrectionists \n     hiding in the church and in the jungle on unsuspecting and \n     unarmed soldiers of Company C, Ninth U.S. Infantry Regiment \n     garrisoned there. Surprised and outnumbered, the soldiers \n     were nearly wiped out in the first terrible minutes of \n     fighting. Of the company's original compliment of seventy-\n     four soldiers, forty-eight were killed or unaccounted for, \n     twenty-two were wounded, and only four escaped unharmed to \n     the American garrison at Basey.\n       After a careful review of the history surrounding the \n     bells, the United Veterans Council of Wyoming, Inc. on behalf \n     of our member veteran's organizations and supporting \n     citizens, opposes any compromise offer. The Council does so \n     without malice towards the people of the Philippines. We \n     simply hold dear, the feelings of mutual respect and a shared \n     memory of fallen comrades who paid the ultimate sacrifice \n     while serving their country.\n       On his last visit to Cheyenne on February 18, 1998, \n     Ambassador Rabe was asked if the bells would be returned to \n     Catholic churches or to be used in a secular setting. The \n     Ambassador replied, ``That is something to be discussed.'' It \n     is an affront to the soldiers who died, and their survivors, \n     to suggest that a permanent memorial be dismantled for no \n     better reasons than are being provided by the Philippine \n     government.\n       Over the years, the United States government has \n     repeatedly, and for all the right reasons, declined to return \n     the Bells of Balangiga to the Philippine government. The \n     church bells were paid for with American blood in 1901 when \n     they were used to signal an attack on U.S. soldiers. The \n     bells should stay right where they are--in Wyoming.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                        Jim Lloyd,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, March 26, 1998.\n     Hon. Craig Thomas,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thomas: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     the bells of Balangiga and the proposed compromise solution \n     for addressing this issue. I am writing on behalf of the \n     President to request that you not oppose the compromise \n     solution. We believe it effectively takes into account the \n     interests and sensitivities of both American veterans and the \n     people of the Philippines.\n       I understand American forces brought the two bells of \n     Balangiga to Wyoming following the Philippine insurrection of \n     1901, and that they currently are on display at F.E. Warren \n     Air Force Base in Cheyenne. As you may know, Philippine \n     President Fidel Ramos is eager to explore the possibility of \n     returning at least one of the bells during this centennial \n     year of the Philippines' declaration of independence from \n     Spain. President Ramos will be the President's guest at the \n     White House on April 10, 1998. The bells of Balangiga will be \n     one of the principal issues on the discussion agenda.\n       I appreciate the importance of the bells to Wyoming \n     veterans who consider them to be symbols of the supreme \n     sacrifice American soldiers, sailors and airmen often have \n     had to make far from home. At the same time, Filipinos see \n     the bells as representative of a struggle for national \n     independence lasting more than five centuries.\n       Our longstanding ties with the Philippines were forged in \n     the intense combat of World War II by tens of thousands of \n     Americans and Filipinos. Growing out of this experience is a \n     relationship, which is closer on a person-to-person level \n     than with any other country in East Asia. The Philippines is \n     a key ally in the Asia Pacific and shares our commitment to \n     democratic and free market principles. Presidential elections \n     in May of this year will re-enforce the democratic traditions \n     and institutions Filipinos have so eagerly embraced.\n       I believe a compromise solution, by which the United States \n     and the Philippines would each retain custody of one of the \n     original bells, offers a unique opportunity to honor both the \n     American soldiers who gave their lives in the town of \n     Balangiga and the centennial celebration of the Philippines' \n     first step toward democracy. I understand the concerns of \n     those who are worried that any alteration of the existing \n     monument might cause present day Americans to forget the \n     sacrifices of past generations. But the historical \n     significance of Balangiga rests on the fact that today the \n     United States and the Philippines are united in a common \n     cause of promoting stability and prosperity throughout the \n     Asia Pacific region. I urge you and your colleagues from the \n     Wyoming Congressional Delegation to reevaluate the compromise \n     approach to resolving the bells of Balangiga question.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from my state of Wyoming, in the effort to safeguard the \nintegrity of the nation's military memorials from the politically \nexpedient demands of foreign governments--in this case the so-called \n``Bells of Balangiga'' war memorial located in Wyoming's capital city \nof Cheyenne. Though a similar bill was introduced during the last \ncongress, it was not voted on before adjournment. Unfortunately, the \nissue this legislation hopes to address is alive and well.\n  Many people contend that church bells are not a fitting subject for a \nwar memorial. The circumstances surrounding these particular bells, \nhowever, are not normal. As the Senior Senator from Wyoming related, \nthose bells were not used by Filipino insurgents to call the faithful \nto prayer that harrowing morning. They were used instead to signal the \nmassacre of Wyoming troops as they sat down, unarmed, to breakfast. Of \nthe 74 officers and men in the garrison, only twenty survived. Eye \nwitness accounts had some of the attackers disguised as women, their \nweapons hidden beneath their dresses. Many others smuggled their \nweapons into the village hidden in the coffins of children. Under those \ncircumstances, one must conclude that the bells in question were used \nto kill. Consequently I feel their use as the subject for a war \nmemorial is wholly appropriate.\n  This is especially true in light of the use for the bells originally \nintended by the Philippine government. As everyone conceded last year, \nthe Philippine government desired the return of these bells in time for \ntheir 100th anniversary of independence. Apparently, these bells do not \nrepresent a religious symbol for the Philippine government either.\n  Most significant of all, however, is the purpose they currently \nserve. Contrary to the assumptions of many, they do not memorialize \nAmerican foreign policies of the time. Nor do they serve as a tribute \nto our political system, America's turn of the century notions of race \nrelations, or the performance of the American troops who served there \nduring that conflict. Rather, these bells memorialize one thing and one \nthing only: The tragic and premature deaths of 54 young men who \nvolunteered to do the bidding of the American people. For this purpose \nI believe these bells serve as a most fitting memorial indeed and I am \nopposed to their dismantlement.\n  It is time to honor our veterans, our war dead, and the principle \nthat in this country, we do not submit to government by Presidential \nfiat. I ask the support of my colleagues for this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 405. A bill to prohibit the operation of civil supersonic \ntransport aircraft to or from airports in the United States under \ncertain circumstances; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n        commercial operation of supersonic transport legislation\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation to \nban the Concorde (flown by British Airways and Air France to the U.S.) \nfrom operating in the U.S. A companion bill is being offered in the \nHouse by Congressman Oberstar. This measure is in direct response to a \npending European Union resolution which places arbitrary design-based \nbarriers on the operation of U.S.-registered, huskitted, aircraft \nmeeting the highest U.S. technological noise standards. The EU, under \nthe guise of an environmental regulation, has essentially declared a \ntrade war. Their regulation, a so-called ``non-addition rule,'' is to \nbe voted on by the EU in mid-February to become effective April 1, \n1999. After that date, no U.S.-registered, stage 3 compliant aircraft \n(the quietest standard) can be operated in Europe. This EU regulation \nnot only violates the Chicago Convention (which sets the framework for \nall bilateral aviation agreements) as it not only refuses to recognize \nU.S. air carriers' air worthiness certificates issued by our \nGovernment, it also holds great economic consequences for U.S. \nmanufacturers and for many airlines. Those which are most vulnerable \nare small airlines and freight operators, which have fleets and \noperations based entirely on these aircraft. In essence, this ruling \ntreats domestic and foreign operations differently in violation of the \nnon-discrimination principle. The United States will not suffer such \ninsidious trade practices lightly. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COMMERCIAL OPERATION OF SUPERSONIC TRANSPORT \n                   CATEGORY AIRCRAFT.\n\n       The Secretary of Transportation shall prohibit the \n     commercial operation of civil supersonic transport category \n     aircraft to or from an airport in the United States--\n       (1) if the Secretary determines that the European Union has \n     adopted Common Position (EC) No. 66/98 as a final regulation, \n     unless\n       (2) the Secretary also determines that such aircraft comply \n     with Stage 3 noise levels.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Inhofe, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 406. A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nmake permanent the demonstration program that allows for direct billing \nof medicare, medicaid, and other third party payors, and to expand the \neligibility under such program to other tribes and tribal \norganizations.\n\n\n   alaska native and american indian direct reimbursement act of 1999\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself \nand the Majority Leader Mr. Lott, Senator Baucus, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Inhofe, Senator Campbell, and Senator Inouye, to introduce \nlegislation to permanently authorize and expand the Medicare and \nMedicaid direct collections demonstration program under section 405 of \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  This Act will end much of the red tape and bureauracy for IHS \nfacilities involved with Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and will \nmean more Medicaid and Medicare dollars to Native health facilities to \nuse for improving health care.\n  Our bill will allow Native hospitals to collect Medicare and Medicaid \nfund directly from the Health Care Financing Administration instead of \nhaving to go through the maze of regulations mandated by IHS.\n  This bill is an expansion of a current demonstration project that \nincludes Bristol Bay Health Corporation of Dillingham, Alaska: the \nSoutheast Alaska Regional Health Corporation of Sitka, Alaska; the \nMississippi Choctaw Health Center of Philadelphia, Mississippi: and the \nChoctaw Tribe of Durant, Oklahoma. All of the participants in the \ndemonstration program--as well as the Department of Health and Human \nService and the Indian Health Services report that the program is a \ngreat success. HHS Secretary Donna Shalala stated in a letter to \nSenator John McCain on July 23, 1996, that the program has:\n  Dramatically increased collections for Medicare and Medicaid \nservices, which in turn has provided badly-needed revenues for Indian \nand Alaska Native health care:\n  Sigificantly reduced the turn-around time between billing and the \nreceipt of payment for Medicare and Medicaid services: and,\n  Increased the administrative efficiency of the participating health \nfacilities by empowering them to track their own Medicare and Medicaid \nbillings and collections.\n  In her letter, Secretary Shalala also mentions that the Southeast \nAlaska Regional Health Corporation has been able to make ``great \nstrides in upgrading the health facilities'' as a result of increased \ncollections brought on by its participation in the demonstration \nprogram.\n  In 1998, when the demonstration program was about to expire, Congress \nextended it through FY 2001. This extension has allowed the \nparticipants to continue their direct billing and collection efforts \nand has provided Congress with additional time to consider whether to \npermanently authorize the program.\n  It is time to recognize the benefits of the demonstration program by \nenacting legislation that would permanently authorize it and expand it \nto other eligible tribal participants.\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Robb, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, and \n        Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 407. A bill a reduce gun trafficking by prohibiting bulk purchases \nof handguns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/10/senate-section/article/S1414-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1430-S1431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE STOP GUN TRAFFICKING ACT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will reduce the murder and mayhem on our streets by making it \nharder for criminals to run guns between states. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senators Torricelli, Schumer, Feinstein, Robb, \nSarbanes, Kennedy, Kerry, and Mikulski.\n  Gun traffickers continue to supply an illegal gun market by buying \nlarge quantities of guns in states with lax gun laws and then reselling \nthem on the streets--often in cities and states with strict gun laws. \nIf these traffickers cannot legally buy a gun themselves, or if they do \nnot want to have their name turn up if the gun is later found at a \ncrime scene, they find others to make the purchases for them. The \ntrafficker pays a straw purchaser, in money or drugs, to buy 25, 50 or \nmore handguns at a time. The trafficker then resells the guns to those \nwho otherwise could not buy them--such as convicted felons, drug \naddicts, or children.\n  The Stop Gun Trafficking Act would prohibit any person from \npurchasing, and any licensed dealer from selling to an individual, more \nthan one handgun a month. This sensible limit on handgun purchases \nshould substantially reduce gun running, while not creating an \nunreasonable obstacle to legitimate sportsmen and collectors. Under the \nlaw, individuals would still be able to purchase up to twelve handguns \nper year and hundreds of weapons during a lifetime. It is hard to \nimagine why anyone would need more handguns.\n  Last year, I introduced similar legislation. In order to make my \ncolleagues more aware of the deadly problem of gun trafficking, I \nsponsored a forum on the issue. The testimony I heard at the forum has \nmade me even more determined to pass this legislation and make it more \ndifficult for gun traffickers to obtain and sell their deadly \nmerchandise on our streets.\n  The witnesses at the forum included: Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell, \nwho is also the chair of the Conference of Mayor's Task Force on Gun \nViolence; James and Sarah Brady; Captain R. Lewis Vass of the Virginia \nState Police, and Captain Thomas Bowers of the Maryland State Police.\n  We also heard from a panel of youth from right here in our nation's \ncapital who live with gun violence every day in their communities. And \nwhat they had to say was terrifying. Guns were an everyday part of \ntheir lives. For these kids, D.C. does not stand for District of \nColumbia. It stands for Dodge City.\n  These young people told us that guns are easy to get in their \nneighborhoods and schools. They call it getting strapped. And if you do \nnot get strapped you might not make it through the day, they said.\n  One young woman put it eloquently: ``It's not fair,'' she said. \n``Other kids get to go to college. We get to go to funerals. These \npeople who sell guns are the real predators. They feed off our pain.''\n  We must shut these predators down.\n  And we can shut these predators down by passing this legislation. We \nknow this approach works because three states--Virginia, Maryland, \nSouth Carolina--have passed one-gun-a month laws and the results have \nbeen dramatic. Gun-trafficking from these states has plunged.\n  At the forum, officers from the Virginia State Police testified that \nafter Virginia passed its one-handgun-a-month limit in 1993, the number \nof crime guns traced back to Virginia from the Northeast dropped by \nnearly 40 percent. Prior to one-gun-a-month, Virginia had been among \nthe leading suppliers of weapons to the so-called ``Iron Pipeline'' \nthat feed the arms race on the streets of Northeastern cities. \nFurthermore, in 1995, the Virginia Crime Commission conducted a \ncomprehensive study of the one-handgun-a-month limit to determine if \nthe law had achieved its purpose. That study found, and I quote, \n``Virginia's one-gun-a-month statute . . . has had its intended effect \nof reducing Virginia's status as a source state for gun trafficking.''\n  Maryland and South Carolina witnessed similar results. In South \nCarolina, according to the same Crime Commission report: ``Prior to the \npassage of the one-gun-a-month law, South Carolina was a leading source \nstate for guns traced to New York City, accounting for 39% of guns \nrecovered in criminal investigations. Following the implementation of \nthe law, South Carolina virtually dropped off of the statistical list \nof source states for firearms trafficked to the northeast.''\n  Maryland--the most recent state to pass a limit on handgun \npurchases-- passed its law in 1996 and has already seen the benefits. \nAccording to testimony from the Maryland State Police: ``In 1991 \nMaryland was nationally ranked second in terms of suppliers of crime \nguns to the City of New York. By 1997, one year after the passage of \nMaryland's one gun a month law, Maryland moved out of the top ten \nsuppliers of crime guns to New York City.''\n  So limits on gun sales are working in some regions. But we need a \nnational law to prevent criminals from simply moving their operations \nfrom state-to-state.\n  Poll after poll shows that Americans, including gun-owning Americans, \nwant tougher controls on guns. A 1996 University of Chicago study found \nthat 80 percent of those polled support legislation limiting handgun \nsales to one a month.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the American people: stop turning a \nblind eye to the daily destruction caused by guns in America. I urge my \ncolleagues to have the will to do something to help the youth of \nAmerica live without the sound of gunshots in their lives. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this common sense approach to keep handguns out \nof the hands of criminals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize qualified organizations to provide \ntechnical assistance and capacity building services to microenterprise \ndevelopment organizations and programs and to disadvantaged \nentrepreneurs using funds from the Community Development Financial \nInstitutions Fund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\nTHE PROGRAM FOR INVESTMENT IN MICRO-ENTREPRENUERS ``PRIME'' ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join with \nSenator Domenici in introducing the PRIME Act--the Program for \nInvestment in Micro-Entrepreneurs. This important idea is part of \nPresident Clinton's budget for Fiscal Year 2000. It deserves bipartisan \nsupport and I look forward to working closely with Senator Domenici to \nachieve its passage early this year.\n  The nation's entrepreneurial spirit is thriving, fueled by the \nrecord-breaking economic growth and prosperity that we currently enjoy. \nBut, many deserving entrepreneurs still face unfair challenges that \nlimit their ability to turn innovative ideas into successful businesses \nthat create new jobs. They need skills and technical training in the \nbusiness basics needed to take their ideas to the next level--starting \ntheir own firms.\n  The PRIME Act will help entrepreneurs close the gap between \nworthwhile ideas and successful businesses. It will provide $105 \nmillion dollars over the next four years to build skills in record \nkeeping, planning, management, marketing, and computer technology, and \nother basic business practices.\n  The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund in the Treasury \nDepartment is now the lead federal agency for micro-enterprise \nactivities across the country, and the PRIME Act will enhance these \nefforts in several specific ways:\n  It will provide grants for micro-enterprise organizations across the \ncountry that assist disadvantaged and low-income entrepreneurs and \nprovide them with essential training and education.\n  It will encourage the development of new micro-enterprise \norganizations, and expand existing ones to reach more entrepreneurs.\n  It will enhance research on innovative and successful ways of \nencouraging these new businesses and enabling them to succeed.\n  Under the Act, between $15 and $35 million in grants will be \navailable each year to organizations that work with entrepreneurs. The \nPresident's fiscal year 2000 budget proposes $15 million for the \nprogram. Local groups will leverage these funds with their own public \nand private resources to increase the overall assistance that will be \navailable.\n  Massachusetts and New Mexico are already leaders in this effort. The \nbusiness communities and local banks in our states have made \nsignificant investments in creating loan capital for micro-\nentrepreneurs to start their own businesses. Non-profit organizations \nworking with micro-entrepreneurs on this effort have worked closely \nwith us on this legislation. We look forward to working with them and \nwith other members of Congress to give micro-entrepreneurs across the \ncountry the greater opportunity they deserve to realize their \npotential.\n  By investing in micro-entrepreneurs, we will be harnessing the spirit \nand ideas of large numbers of Americans and creating new opportunities \nfor self-sufficiency. We'll be creating new small businesses that will \nstrengthen local economies in communities across the country. And that \nin turn will help to keep our national economy strong as well. This is \nworthwhile legislation, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with \nSenator Kennedy and a group of bipartisan cosponsors to introduce the \n``Program for Investment in Micro-Entrepreneurs'' or ``PRIME Act of \n1999.''\n  Starting one's own business long has been viewed as a realization of \nthe American dream. Right now, thousands of creative and hardworking \nmen and women across the country believe that they have a solid idea \nfor building a new business. However, starting a small business takes \nmore than a good idea, hard work, and luck to make it work--many of \nthese men and women need help turning their ideas into a viable \nbusiness enterprise.\n  These would-be small and micro entrepreneurs face overwhelming \nobstacles, due in part to the complexity of local, state, and Federal \nlaws, and the difficulty of finding adequate sources of capital. Often, \nthey have no experience dealing with the intricacies of marketing, \nfeasibility studies, and bookkeeping practices. Entrepreneurs usually \nneed basic technical assistance, training, and mentoring to be \nsuccessful.\n  Under this bill, grants will be available through the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund, matched at least 50 percent in \nnon-Federal funds, to help experienced nonprofit organizations provide \nthe assistance these new businesses so urgently require. Fifty percent \nof these grants will be awarded to applicants serving low-income \nclients and those serving equally both urban and rural areas.\n  From so many case studies and histories of successful businesses, we \nknow that enthusiastic entrepreneurs can build and sustain their \nbusinesses when they have access to critical training and professional \ntechnical assistance at the outset of their endeavor.\n  During the past few years, I have had the pleasure of visiting \ncountless new micro-level businesses in my State of New Mexico. A great \nmajority of these businesses received assistance from the WESST Corp. \norganization, now located in five different sites throughout our State. \nThis organization provides key technical assistance and training, as \nwell as access to low interest revolving loans. But WESST Corp. also \ngoes a step further in providing guidance and information about sound \nbusiness practices to ensure that the creative ideas of micro-\nentrepreneurs become sound business endeavors.\n  Micro and small businesses are absolutely critical components of our \nnational economic growth. They often embody the ingenuity and \ninnovation central to the American spirit. Investment in the ideas of \nthese enterprising Americans has long been recognized as a worthwhile \nendeavor. The Small Business Administration, for example, lends \nexcellent support to entrepreneurs. The PRIME Act will establish a \ncomplementary program which enables intermediary organizations to serve \nmore micro-level entrepreneurs who need specialized and hands-on \nassistance.\n  This is a good investment for the future, and will be rewarded many \ntimes over by the creation of businesses that can contribute to the \ngrowth of family, local and national economies. We all can recall \nsuccess stories about business that began with the inspired idea of a \nsingle person and eventually grew in to a major global corporation. In \nevery story, the basic tenacity of a businessman, woman, or family \nallowed the fledgling business overcome initial obstacles and achieve \ngreat success. We have no way of knowing how many more such success \nstories will be told in the future. It is guaranteed, however, that \nthere are thousands of such extraordinary entrepreneurs willing to \nprovide the ideas and hard labor to make it happen, and with a little \nhelp, they can realize their dreams.\n  Senator Kennedy and I came up with this concept in legislation we \nintroduced during the 105th Congress, and I understand that the \nPresident has made room for it in his budget this year. I am pleased to \njoin Senator Kennedy in cosponsoring the PRIME Act again in this \nCongress. Owning one's own business remains a vital part of the \nAmerican dream. Whatever we can do to continue this legacy and assist \nthose who want to be self-reliant and successful entrepreneurs is an \ninvestment worth making.\n\n

\n ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO PORK PRODUCERS TO ALLEVIATE ECONOMIC \n                   CONDITIONS FACED BY THE PRODUCERS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Kerrey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 8\n\n       Whereas the price for domestic live hogs has declined by 72 \n     percent since July 1997;\n       Whereas on December 12, 1998, the price of domestic live \n     hogs decreased to below $10 per hundredweight for the first \n     time since 1955;\n       Whereas pork producers are losing between $55 and $70 on \n     each hog the producers sell;\n       Whereas, adjusted for inflation, prices paid to pork \n     producers for live hogs have not been this low since the \n     Great Depression;\n       Whereas based on estimates made by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, pork producers are losing approximately \n     $144,000,000 in equity per week and lost more than \n     $2,500,000,000 in equity during 1998;\n       Whereas low prices for hogs are threatening the livelihood \n     of tens of thousands of farm families and the very existence \n     of suppliers, equipment dealers, and main street businesses \n     in rural communities across the United States;\n       Whereas the domestic demand for pork increased by up to 7.1 \n     percent during 1998 despite average retail prices for pork \n     remaining roughly the same;\n       Whereas despite the loss of markets in Asia and Russia, \n     pork exports from the United States during 1998 increased by \n     28 percent;\n       Whereas a primary cause of these increased pork exports is \n     increased pork supply intensified by an increase of pork \n     imports from Canada and a reduction in domestic slaughter \n     capacity for hogs;\n       Whereas the slaughter plant bottleneck for hogs has been \n     exacerbated by approximately 100,000 Canadian hogs being \n     trucked to the United States for slaughter each week; and\n       Whereas a 37 percent increase in the number of Canadian \n     hogs being exported to the United States for slaughter has \n     caused the number of live hogs to exceed the 383,000 daily \n     slaughter capacity of United States plants, depriving \n     domestic pork producers of all leverage in bargaining for a \n     fair price: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. NEED FOR ASSISTANCE FOR PORK PRODUCERS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President and the Secretary of Agriculture are \n     commended on their efforts to assist pork producers in \n     alleviating economic conditions faced by the producers; and\n       (2) additional assistance needs to be provided to pork \n     producers to alleviate the economic conditions.\n\n     SEC. 2. FORMS OF ASSISTANCE FOR PORK PRODUCERS.\n\n       To alleviate the economic conditions that are faced by pork \n     producers, it is the sense of Congress that the President \n     should--\n       (1) immediately request an emergency supplemental \n     appropriation to provide funds for providing--\n       (A) guarantees of farm ownership loans under subtitle A of \n     the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1922 et seq.), and operating loans under subtitle B of that \n     Act (7 U.S.C. 1941 et seq.), made to pork producers; and\n       (B) assistance to pork producers under the interest rate \n     reduction program established under section 351 of the \n     Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1999) \n     and other provisions of that Act that authorize the Secretary \n     of Agriculture to reduce or subsidize the interest rate paid \n     by pork producers;\n       (2) prepare and submit to Congress a report that analyzes \n     the feasibility and cost of implementing, not later than 30 \n     days after enactment, a program to provide disaster \n     assistance to pork producers, including assistance in the \n     form of--\n       (A) economic assistance;\n       (B) an expanded loan and debt restructuring program; and\n       (C) compensation for lost markets as a result of increased \n     pork imports;\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\n       (3) continue to facilitate the donation and distribution of \n     pork and pork products for humanitarian purposes;\n       (4) work with the Canadian Government to address the many \n     problems that contribute to the increased export of pork and \n     pork products into the United States;\n       (5) take appropriate steps to encourage increased use and \n     expansion of the domestic slaughter capacity for hogs;\n       (6) direct the Secretary of Agriculture, the Attorney \n     General, and the Secretary of Commerce to investigate \n     noncompetitive and antitrust practices in the pork industry;\n       (7) direct the Secretary of Agriculture to improve price \n     reporting in the domestic livestock industry to ensure fair, \n     open, and competitive markets; and\n       (8) immediately implement the loan guarantee paperwork \n     reduction regulation of the Secretary of Agriculture that \n     will allow pork producers and lenders to use existing lender \n     documents, rather than creating new documents, when applying \n     for loan guarantees under the Consolidated Farm and Rural \n     Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/10/senate-section/article/S1432-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resourcess\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, the Nation's rural health \ninfrastructure is facing immense pressures. Changes in the private \nmarket, Medicare, Medicaid, and costs of new technologies, treatments \nand education are squeezing many providers out of rural areas. The \nPresident's budget shows a surprising lack of sensitivity to the \ncritical realities in these underserved areas.\n  First, the President would cut reimbursement to hospitals an \nadditional $9 billion over the next five years. This comes before most \nproviders have had time to absorb the full impact of the Balanced \nBudget Act. Rural hospitals have lower patient volumes than urban \nhospitals, and they serve populations with a larger proportion of \nseniors, on average, than urban populations. In addition, nearly 20% of \nrural individuals don't carry health insurance. The burden this imposes \non rural providers is intensified by the President's reduction of bad \ndebt payments to hospitals by 10%.\n  Congress has begun to address these problems, and late last year, we \nprovided $25 million for state implementation of the Rural Hospital \nFlexibility Program. This program creates cost-based reimbursement for \nCritical Access Hospitals. The money will help states develop and \nimplement a rural health plan, develop networks, designate Critical \nAccess Hospitals, and to improve rural emergency medical services.\n  I must point out that people in rural areas don't have many choices \nof health providers. Thirty-seven states have less than 1% enrollment \nin Medicare risk plans. Often one hospital will serve the needs of many \ncommunities interspersed through very large regions. We must take great \ncare to support, rather than destroy, the rural health infrastructure. \nWe may need to reexamine the payment rates to hospitals, but let us do \nso with good data, and an awareness of the special needs of rural \nsafety net providers.\n  In addition, HCFA has not yet adequately educated beneficiaries or \nresolved the regulatory payment issues surrounding Medicare private \nplan opportunities in rural areas. We in Congress must continue to \nmonitor the developments in Medicare+Choice, and make the most of \nopportunities to increase the quality and choice of health care for \nrural Americans.\n  The Administration also ignored calls for an increased investment in \nimportant programs such as the National Health Service Corps, and Rural \nHealth and Telehealth--flatlining their funding. The Office of \nManagement and Budget also refused a request from the rural health \ncaucus to appropriate additional demonstration grant funding for the \ndevelopment of emergency medical services networks.\n  At a time when the U.S. needs to prepare itself for emergency \nresponse to public health threats, including bioterrorism and \nidentifying and tracking emerging threats such as antimicrobial \nresistance, President Clinton proposes to eliminate the health \nprofessions education programs intended to increase the number of \nindividuals in the public health workforce. These programs include \nsupport for retraining existing public health workers, as well as \nincreasing the supply of new practitioners to address priority public \nhealth needs.\n  As Chairman on the Subcommittee on Public Health, I was especially \ndisturbed to find that the President proposes to eliminate programs \ndirected at training primary care physicians and dentists with an \nemphasis of practicing in rural areas. The President signed my bill \nreauthorizing these important programs less than three months ago.\n  Currently $80 million is spent to assist medical and dental schools \nin developing programs to train family physicians, general internists, \nphysician assistants, general dentists and pediatric dentists.\n  There is a demonstrated imbalance between primary care providers and \nspecialists. The key to correcting this imbalance is to provide \nappropriate incentives at the medical school level to introduce more \nstudents to primary care settings during their training. Yet, the \nPresident wants to eliminate it.\n  [Last year's request = $77 million ($80 million appropriated)]\n\n\n                       community-based linkages:\n\n  Today, $54 million is spent to develop and support health \nprofessional training programs that link community providers with \nacademic institutions. President Clinton suggests a $17 million (30%) \nreduction.\n  This funding supports:\n  Area Health Education Centers (AHECs)--support health care in \nunderserved rural and urban areas, including recruitment and support to \nhelp rural communities retain health professionals.\n  Education and Training Relating to Geriatrics--Congress established \nthis program to ensure that our health professionals are trained to \nmeet the needs of seniors. With the aging of the baby boom generation, \nthe number of seniors will double over the next 40 years.\n  Rural Interdisciplinary Training Grants--supports projects to train, \nrecruit and retain health care practitioners in rural areas.\n  [Last year's request = $51 million, $54 million appropriated, fy'00 \nrequest = $37 million]\n  I'm disappointed that such important rural programs failed to receive \nadequate funding under the President's budget proposal. It appears that \nthe Administration would do well to reexamine their commitment to a \nviable rural health infrastructure, and I urge my colleagues to renew \ntheir efforts to protect vulnerable Americans in rural areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/10/senate-section/article/S1433-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1433-S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF PACZKI DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to one of the most eagerly anticipated holidays each year in \nmy home state of Michigan, Paczki Day.\n  The day before Lent is known in other parts of the country as Fat \nTuesday or Mardi Gras, but in Metro Detroit and in other Michigan \ncommunities we celebrate Paczki Day. Paczkis, which are similar to \njelly-filled doughnuts, were introduced to Metro Detroit by new \nimmigrants from Poland who settled in the city of Hamtramck, Michigan. \nToday, thanks to the people of Hamtramck, Michigan is the paczki \ncapital of the United States, with several million dozen paczkis sold \nevery year. The Detroit Free Press reported that in 1993, paczki sales \ntotaled\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\n$7 to $8 million, which, as the Free Press reported, was ``. . .not bad \nfor a one-day holiday with a three-day selling period.''\n  Paczki Day is a little like St. Patrick's Day. It is said that on St. \nPatrick's Day, everyone is a little bit Irish no matter what their \nfamily's background actually is. Well, on Paczki Day in Hamtramck and \nthroughout Metro Detroit, we are all a little bit Polish. I look \nforward to celebrating my own ``Polish heritage'' with the people of \nHamtramck on Paczki Day this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/10/senate-section/article/S1433-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH BIRTHDAY OF ELISE KIRKLAND YARDLEY\n\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mrs. \nElise Kirkland Yardley, a daughter of South Carolina, on the occasion \nof her 100th birthday. I wish her many more happy birthdays.\n  Mrs. Yardley was born in Camden, South Carolina on February 16, 1899, \nin the historic Camden home known as Cool Springs. She was one of nine \nchildren born of Thomas and Fredricka Kirkland, and she is the last \nsurviving member of her immediate family. The Kirkland family has South \nCarolina roots that stretch back to before the Revolutionary War, and \nit has produced many fine public servants and citizens. Notably among \nthem are Lane Kirkland, Mrs. Yardley's nephew and the former President \nof the AFL-CIO.\n  After her childhood in Camden, Mrs. Yardley attended Winthrop College \nin Rock Hill, South Carolina, where she graduated in 1919 with a degree \nin teaching. She moved back to Camden and met Sherborne Yardley, the \nman who would become her husband of more than 50 years. The Yardleys \neventually settled in Birmingham Alabama, where Mr. Yardley worked for \nRepublic Steel and Mrs. Yardley ran the household. Mr. Yardley passed \naway in 1978.\n  The Yardleys have three children: Thomas, an investment banker, John, \na clinical pathologist, and Elizabeth, a homemaker. The family has \ngrown to include eight grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. I am \nassured that Mrs. Yardley continues to serve as the presiding officer \nover the entire brood.\n  Mrs. Yardley still resides in Birmingham, although she returns \nregularly to Camden, where her entire family will gather in a few days \nto celebrate her 100th birthday. When they come together, her family \nwill not only be observing Mrs. Yardley's centennial, but also honoring \na lively, beautiful, and determined woman. They have much to celebrate.\n  As we pause briefly today to celebrate her long life, we do well to \nlook back on what Mrs. Yardley has seen. She grew up in the rural South \nbefore that area had electrification. She has seen Halley's Comet pass \nthis planet twice, watching it the first time in 1910, when her father \ngathered the family on their porch to marvel at the sight. She was \nalive to witness the invention of the airplane, the automobile, the \ncomputer, and space travel. Her husband served in the Navy during the \nFirst World War, and her sons served in the military during the Second \nWorld War. Her grandfather died in the Civil War. She saw the end of \nthe 19th century, the whole of the 20th century, and will doubtlessly \nbe around to experience the new millennium.\n  I am pleased to rise today to honor this charming and accomplished \nwoman. It seems fitting that I do so not only as the senior senator \nfrom her home state, but also as the one Member of this body who \nqualifies as Mrs. Yardley's peer. Mrs. Yardley and I both know the many \nrewards of a long and healthy life. I wish her continued good health \nand prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/10/senate-section/article/S1434-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM AND MEDIAONE\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and \ncongratulate Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. and MediaOne cable \ncompany for sponsoring a special educational event for students in the \nmetropolitan Atlanta area commemorating Black History Month.\n  In recognition of Black History Month, Turner Broadcasting System, \nInc., a Time-Warner company, and MediaOne cable company are hosting a \nspecial educational event on Wednesday, February 10, 1999 at the \n``Magic'' Johnson Theater in Atlanta, Georgia. This event will serve as \na venue to screen Turner Network's Original film, ``Passing Glory,'' \nand engage students in after-viewing discussion.\n  Inspired by a true story about two undefeated high school basketball \nteams in segregation-era Louisiana, ``Passing Glory,'' is a powerful \nstudy about the discovery of mutual respect which crosses racial \nboundaries. Father Joseph Verrett ignites the sparks of the Civil \nRights movement in New Orleans when he organizes a game between his own \nundefeated African American team and an undefeated prep school team \nfrom a white community.

The forum will provide a venue for \nstudents to question civil rights experts and renowned sports figures \nabout the history of segregation and the role that sports has played in \nbridging the racial divide.\n  This type of forum will motivate students to explore the history of \nrace relations in this country and encourage dialogue which will foster \nunderstanding, the identification of common ground and a genuine \ncommitment to afford equal opportunity and civil rights for people of \nall races, religions and ethnic origins.

Mr. President, February 27 is the 150th anniversary \nof the founding of William Jewell College, a small liberal arts college \nin Liberty, Missouri, and one of the oldest four-year colleges west of \nthe Mississippi River.\n  William Jewell's reputation is far larger than its size. Because of \nthe quality of its academic programs and facilities, and the breadth of \nits student and public service activities, Jewell is recognized as a \npreeminent liberal arts college in the Midwest. Jewell is classified \namong the nation's top 162 liberal arts colleges by the Carnegie \nFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Jewell has been recognized \nin the prestigious ``National Liberal Arts'' category in the \n``America's Best Colleges'' edition of U.S. News & World Report.\n  Affiliated with the Baptist church since its founding, the college \nplaces a strong emphasis on Christian values, character development, \nand public service. Jewell is listed regularly in the Templeton \nFoundation's Honor Roll of Character-Building Colleges.\n  The institution has awarded more than 14,000 baccalaureate degrees \nsince its founding. While most of its students are from Missouri, the \nschool attracts students from nearly half of the 50 states and more \nthan a dozen foreign countries.\n  Alumni accomplishments at the highest levels of business, industry, \ngovernment and the professions figure prominently in maintaining \nJewell's reputation as a preeminent liberal arts college. And the \ncollege is frequently referred to as the ``Campus of Achievement'' due \nto the high percentage of Jewell students appearing in annual ``Who's \nWho'' directories.\n  And, on a personal note, Jewell graduates are certainly \noverrepresented on my Senate staff in terms of their percentage of the \nMissouri population!\n  While the school has a right to be proud of its achievements, what \nsets it apart from other colleges are the opportunities it offers all \nof its students, and the larger Kansas City community. William Jewell's \nFine Arts Program, now in its 34th season, is a regional and national \ntreasure, having presented\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nLuciano Pavarotti's American recital debut in 1973. Each year, the Fine \nArts Program brings to Kansas City venues internationally acclaimed \norchestras, ensembles, dance troupes, plays, musicals, and individual \nperformers.\n  International programs in England, Japan, Australia, India and \nEcuador give students the opportunity to travel widely and study at \nsome of the world's great centers of learning. The recently endowed \nPryor Leadership Studies program is a unique curriculum of course work, \nactivities and lectures which actively promote personal, vocational and \ncivic leadership development. And a Service Learning certificate \nprogram, sustained by its own endowment, encourages formal involvement \nin community service activities, along with national and international \noutreach, and mission trips.\n  It is a credit to her faculty, administration, board, alumni, and \nstudents that William Jewell has been able to maintain high academic \nstandards through the years, and to serve so well the Kansas City \ncommunity, the State of Missouri, and the entire nation.\n  I offer the entire William Jewell community a heartfelt \ncongratulations on their first 150 years!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/10/senate-section/article/S1434-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., RECOGNITION ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Day Recognition Act of 1999. This legislation \nwill correct an unfortunate oversight that has left the federal holiday \nrecognizing our great civil rights leader without the full ceremonial \nstatus it deserves. This is an injustice to a great leader and one I \nhope the Senate will act to correct as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, federal holidays celebrating the birthdays of great \nAmericans have traditionally included celebratory signs of respect. In \nparticular, they have been on the list of days on which the American \nflag should be flown nationwide. Yet, across this country, in the \nschools and on the streets that bear the name of Martin Luther King, \nJr., that flag has not been flown to commemorate his holiday.\n  Dr. King, minister, civil rights leader, winner of the Nobel Prize \nfor his nonviolent resistance to segregation, has been recognized \naround the world as a pivotal figure in American history and in the \nglobal struggle for civil rights. He was instrumental in putting an end \nto segregation and to putting issues of racial equality and civil \nrights into the forefront of American public life.\n  As a nation we have recognized the importance of Dr. King's efforts \nand of his achievement by instituting celebration of a federal holiday \nin his honor. It is time to complete that recognition by adding Dr. \nKing's holiday to the list of days on which the American flag should be \nflown nationwide.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/10/senate-section/article/S1435-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1435-S1436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI.
