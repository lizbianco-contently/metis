Mr. President, many people who are watching the business \nof Capitol Hill are curious as to the current state of affairs. We are \nobviously past our deadline of October 1 for a new fiscal year. We were \nsupposed to have passed all of the appropriations or spending bills by \nthat time. Very few Congresses ever achieve that, and this Congress did \nnot. But most Congresses reach a point in the late days of October \nwhere we at least know the end game, we know how it is going to end, \nand we are merely putting paperwork together.\n  Well, we are not quite there yet. In fact, we are in a situation \nwhere there is great doubt about how this session will come to an end, \nand it is a great irony that we would be questioning how it will end in \nlight of all the circumstances that we face. This is an extraordinarily \ngood time for America in terms of the state of our economy, its growth, \nthe creation of jobs, keeping inflation under control, and giving \nbusinesses opportunities to start and expand. All of these things are \ngood signs. In fact, we are generating enough money now in terms of \nrevenues to the Federal Government that we have gone beyond the era of \ndeficits and have now started talking about the era of surpluses.\n  It was a little over 2 years ago that we were fixated in this Chamber \non passing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. There were \nsome Members of the Senate who had literally given up hope that the \nSenate could meet its own responsibility, and they insisted that a \nconstitutional amendment be passed to give the Federal courts the \nauthority to enforce the law and stop Congress from spending. That is \nhow desperate many of these Members of the Senate were in terms of the \ndeficit situation.\n  Well, things have changed dramatically; 2\\1/2\\ years later we now \nseem to be at an impasse over a surplus, not over a deficit. That \namendment did not pass. It lost by one vote. I voted against it and \nwould do it again. Now we are talking about surpluses and what to do \nwith them.\n  The interesting thing about this debate, though, is we are not \nfocusing on individual appropriations bills but really keep returning \nto a subject that has been around since 1935, because it was in 1935 \nthat Franklin Roosevelt showed the vision and the political courage to \ncreate Social Security. In creating the Social Security system, he \nreally said that we were going to do something dramatic to make sure \nour parents and grandparents could live in dignity when they reached \nretirement age. Some people, primarily from the other side of the \naisle, called it socialism. They said, no, we aren't going to go along \nwith ``New Deal'' politics creating these massive government programs. \nThis same Republican voice was\n\n[[Page S13334]]\n\nheard time and again for decades over the creation of Social Security; \nthat it was a bad idea; it was socialism; it was too much government.\n  Yet the program endured. Thank goodness it did because it changed the \nlives of Americans for the better and gave us hope that in our senior \nyears, in our years of retirement, we could be independent and live in \ndignity. Look at what we have today--so many healthy, vibrant seniors \nleading great lives, knowing they have a safety net called Social \nSecurity in which they have invested through all of their work \nexperience. It is not enough to lead a luxurious life by far, but it \ncertainly gives people that safety net, and they are glad they have it.\n  We are debating about what to do with Social Security as we end this \nsession. It is a principal source of retirement income for two-thirds \nof the elderly. Listen to these statistics: In 1959, 40 years ago, the \npoverty rate for senior citizens was 35 percent, one out of three. In \n1998, it was 10.5 percent, the lowest on record. Last year, Social \nSecurity benefits lifted roughly 15 million senior citizens out of \npoverty.\n  That is what it means. It means people who would not be able to make \nit can make it, at least barely make it, if they are relying on Social \nSecurity. It is more than just a retirement program because one out of \nfive people who receive benefits under Social Security are either \ndisabled, mentally or physically, or they are the survivors of those \nwho paid into the system.\n  We on the Democratic side have for years advocated the protection of \nSocial Security. In that debate I mentioned earlier about a balanced \nbudget amendment, we offered an amendment on our side and said we did \nnot want the budget to be balanced by using the Social Security trust \nfund. Well, we offered that amendment and only two Republican Senators \nvoted for it. When we tried to protect the Social Security trust fund \nfrom being raided as part of that constitutional amendment, only two \nRepublican Senators would join us and we were not successful.\n\n  Now we have this whole question about whether or not we are currently \nspending the Social Security trust fund. There have been ads run by \npolitical parties saying this fund should be held sacred and it should \nnot be touched. Yet when we look at the record, the Congressional \nBudget Office tells us, as of a month ago the Republican appropriations \nbills already use $18 billion of the Social Security surplus. This \nestimate assumed appropriations bills already enacted or those in \naccordance with the then-current status in the House of \nRepresentatives. Since September 29, the use of the Social Security \nsurplus has grown.\n  I think that is a challenge to some of the advertising being put on \ntelevision by the other side of the aisle. The facts do not back them \nup. Republicans have talked about protecting Social Security, but, \nfrankly, they have not. They have used $18 billion of the Social \nSecurity trust fund so far.\n  They do not want to talk about a program which a few months ago was \ntheir pride and joy, the so-called Republican tax cut; a $792 billion \ntax cut, the vast bulk of which went to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry. That tax cut idea went over like a lead balloon. People across \nAmerica said: Why in the world do you want to talk about a tax cut when \nwe have a national debt we should be concerned about, when we have the \nfuture of Social Security we should be concerned about, when we have \nMedicare we are concerned about? Why do you want to talk about a tax \ncut primarily for wealthy people?\n  If you remember the Republicans went out in August and said we are \ngoing to take our case to the people. They came back after the August \nrecess and said: We are going to close the books on this case. The \npeople aren't interested. We will talk about it next year.\n  The American people were interested enough to take a look at and \nreject this Republican tax cut, and it is a good thing they did for the \nsake of Social Security. Estimates suggest that some $83 billion would \nhave had to come out of the Social Security trust fund to pay for the \nRepublican tax cut package for wealthy people. That was not going to \nfly. The American people let the Republican leadership know that and \nthey dropped their tax cut plan from their agenda and came back and \nsaid instead we are dedicated to protecting Social Security.\n  Let me tell you, the President has the right idea when it comes to \nthe solvency of the Social Security trust fund. He wants to make sure \nwe lock away that trust fund so it cannot be raided and so we can say \nto future generations: Social Security is not only solvent to the year \n2032 or 2034, but beyond. I think he is on the right track.\n  The President's Social Security lockbox ensures another generation \ncan receive benefits from this important program. It locks away \ninterest savings for Social Security. It transfers interest savings to \nthe Social Security trust fund. It extends the solvency of the Social \nSecurity system to the year 2050.\n  One other point that bears mentioning, we must address the needs of \nthe future of Medicare. Time and again, the debate on this floor has \nignored the Medicare Program. Medicare is the health insurance program \nfor seniors and disabled that, frankly, needs attention at this moment \nmore than any other program. It will be insolvent by the year 2015. Yet \nprecious little is said or done in the debates on Capitol Hill to \naddress the needs of the Medicare system.\n  The Medicare trust fund will go bankrupt in 2015. To make matters \nworse, the strains in the system will continue to increase as the baby \nboom generation retires, with the number of Medicare-eligible seniors \nexpected to double to almost 80 million within a few decades. We have \nproposed, on the Democrat side, to lock away part of our surplus that \nwe see coming in the years ahead to extend the life of Medicare for an \nadditional 12 years. Not only would this extend the solvency of the \nsystem and the program, it would eliminate the need for future \nexcessive cuts in medical care. Medicare is the critical other half of \nthe equation that the Republicans continue to ignore.\n\n  Democrats are determined to make sure that, as Speaker Gingrich once \nsaid, Medicare does not ``wither on the vine.'' We want to make sure \nthis system continues and survives.\n  I see my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, on the floor. \nI will yield to him in morning business and close by saying, as we come \nto the end of this congressional session, families across America have \nthe right and responsibility to hold this Congress accountable; to ask \nus the hard questions. What have we done under our stewardship to make \nlife better in America during the course of this year?\n  Did we pass campaign finance reform to clean up the mess in our \ncampaign election system? I am afraid the answer is no, we did not. It \nbroke down on partisan lines. Even though we had 55 Republican and \nDemocratic Senators who were determined to pass it, 45 Republican \nSenators opposed it and it died.\n  Did we pass Senator Kennedy's minimum wage increase so we go from \n$5.15 an hour to a more livable wage for the 350,000 people in Illinois \nwho get up every morning and go to work for $5.15 an hour? The answer, \nsadly, is no, we did not pass an increase in the minimum wage.\n  What did we do for the people who are concerned about their managed \ncare, their health insurance, when they want their doctors to make the \ndecisions and not the insurance company bureaucrats; when they don't \nwant to turn over a life-or-death decision to somebody at the end of a \ntelephone line who may have a high school diploma and no knowledge of \nmedicine? Did we do something to stand up for patients? Sadly, the \nanswer is no. The special interests, the insurance industry, prevailed \nin this Chamber. They killed the good legislation we were trying to \npass. Sadly, that means the American people have lost out.\n  What have we done for education, to reduce class size? When I visit a \nclassroom in Wheaton, IL, with 16 kids in the first grade and the \nteacher says: Senator, this Federal program works. I can give special \nattention to these kids. If they are falling behind I can help them. If \nthey are gifted, I can give them something extra to do. Keep the class \nsize initiative on track.\n  What have we done? We are in a bitter fight now as to whether we will \neven continue that program.\n  Sadly, as you look at all the issues, whether it is sensible gun \ncontrol in light of the violence in schools such as\n\n[[Page S13335]]\n\nColumbine, or whether you look at minimum wage or campaign finance \nreform or the Patients' Bill of Rights, this Congress is going to go \nhome emptyhanded. We have failed the American people. They should hold \nthe leadership in this Congress accountable for coming here, drawing \ntheir paychecks, punching the clock for their pensions, and going home \nwithout addressing issues that American families care about.\n  So I hope in the closing days of this session we can salvage \nsomething for the time we have spent in Washington. I hope as we start \nthe next session, the next round, the Republican leadership will \nfinally listen to the people across America who want us to act in their \ninterests, not for the special interests. Time and time again, families \nhave lost and special interests have won and that is not what this \nSenate should be about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 10 \na.m. is under the control of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield all remaining time to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nIllinois. I must say, he has summarized the situation as we are drawing \nto the end of this part of the Congress very well. There is still some \ntime for this do nothing Congress to mend its ways--if there were a \ndisposition to make some progress, there is still some time to do so.\n  But I think it is important, as we come to the end of this session, \nto take stock of what has been achieved and has not been achieved. My \nfriend from Illinois has done an excellent job summarizing those \nissues. I would like to provide some additional comments on some of the \nmatters he raised.\n  First of all, as the Senator from Illinois and others have pointed \nout in these last days, we are still failing to meet our \nresponsibilities to those 11 million Americans who earn the minimum \nwage. In many instances these are the hardest-working laborers in our \neconomy, but they are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder--and \nthis, during the most extraordinary prosperity in the history of this \ncountry. There has been an incredible accumulation of wealth that has \ntaken place over the period of the last 5, 6, 7 years. As a direct \nresult of the leadership of President Clinton and the Democratic \nMembers of Congress, and despite the opposition of nearly every single \nRepublican Member, we are in the midst of the greatest economic growth \nin the history of the country. We have even found the will to raise our \nown salaries some $4,600 a year. But the Republicans are now holding a \nminimum wage increase hostage to $35 billion in new tax breaks for the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  All we are asking is that we have at least the opportunity to bring \nthis matter before the Senate and permit a vote on it. It does not take \ntoo much time--Members know this issue. But under the parliamentary \nsituation that we find ourselves in now, the leadership--the Republican \nleadership--is denying us the opportunity to do so. This is the seventh \ntime that technique has been used this year. Do we think the purpose of \nit is to open and broaden debate and discussion on matters before the \nAmerican people? No, it is to narrow and close down the opportunity for \ndebate and discussion.\n  So, when we look where we are as a country, from 1965 up to the year \n2000, this line reflects what the purchasing power of the minimum wage \nwould be with constant dollars of 1998. Here we find back in 1965 all \nthe way up to the early 1980s, we actually found Republicans and \nDemocrats alike working together to make sure that working Americans \ncould earn a livable wage.\n  Then there was a period during the Reagan administration, starting in \n1980 and going right through 1988, when we had a great deal of \nresistance in getting any increase. We had one increase in the minimum \nwage and another spike again in 1995.\n  But if we do not take action by the year 2001, the purchasing power \nof the minimum wage will be at an all-time low. And still we are denied \nan opportunity to bring this matter before the Senate.\n  Eighty-five percent of the American people favor increasing the \nminimum wage, and the opposition refuses to even debate it. The two old \narguments they have used against increasing the minimum wage are that \nit will cause a loss of jobs and that it will add to inflation. Those \ntired old arguments have long since been discredited.\n  We know that when there has been an actual increase, again, in \nOctober 1996 and October 1997, the employment levels have continued to \ngo up. There is absolutely no case that can be made that this will lose \njobs.\n  Our proposal is modest, a one dollar increase in two installments--50 \ncents next January, and 50 cents the following year--to provide a \nlifeline to so many who are working so hard in our country. We know who \nthe workers earning the minimum wage are. They are assistant \nschoolteachers who work in our children's classrooms. They are \nassistants in nursing homes caring for our family members.\n  This is a women's issue because the overwhelming majority of \nindividuals who work at minimum wage are women.\n  This is a children's issue because eighty-five percent of the women \nwho are receiving minimum wage have children.\n  It is a civil rights issue because many of those involved in making \nthe minimum wage are men and women of color.\n  Most of all, it is a fairness issue. How can we justify raising our \nown salaries $4,600 a year and refuse to provide a $1 increase over 2 \nyears for men and women who go out every single day, 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks a year?\n  This is absolutely unfair. Americans understand fairness, they \nunderstand work, they understand fair play, and the Republican \nleadership is denying the American workers fair play on this issue.\n  I want to mention another important issue which we hope to address in \nthe final days of the Senate, and that is the issue of the Patients' \nBill of Rights, a very simple piece of legislation that says doctors--\nnot accountants--ought to be making decisions in matters affecting the \nhealth of our families.\n  The protections contained in the Norwood-Dingell managed care reform \nbill which passed in the House of Representatives three weeks ago by an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority of 275-151, have been recommended by \nthe broad-based and nonpartisan Presidents' Commission. They are \nincluded in the model standards of the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners. These protections are already available under \nMedicare. They are used as voluntary standards by the managed care \ncompanies' own trade associations. They are the rights that ethical \ninsurance companies honor as a matter of course, and that every family \nbelieves it has purchased when it pays its premiums.\n  These protections listed on this chart are the ones we tried to \nguarantee to the consumers of America. That essentially is the \nDemocratic proposal we debated in the Senate. These circles indicate \nwhat the Senate finally did on these protections. My colleagues can see \nthey are zero in most of the cases, and small coloring in other cases, \nwhich means they took a partial fix on some of these protections. And \nmy colleagues can see what the bipartisan Republican and Democratic \nproposal did in the House of Representatives.\n  We are prepared to bring that House bill before the Senate and debate \nit for a few hours, pass it, and provide protections for the American \npeople. We do not need a conference. The President will sign it. Why \ndon't we move ahead on this? This has bipartisan support. This has \nalready been debated and it had the overwhelming support of 68 \nRepublican Members in the House of Representatives.\n\n  Why are we not protecting the American people? Why are we being \ndenied the opportunity to provide protections? If there is some \nquestion as to whether we really are providing protections, look at \nwhat is happening across the country every single day. Every single day \nthe Congress delays the Patients' Bill of Rights means more patients \nare suffering.\n  Each day that Congress delays means that more patients will suffer \nand die. According to a survey by the University of California at \nBerkeley, every day we delay means that 35,000 patients\n\n[[Page S13336]]\n\nwill find their access to needed care delayed. Thirty-one thousand will \nbe forced to change doctors. Eighteen thousand will be forced to forego \nmedications ordered by their doctor. Fifty-nine thousand will endure \nunnecessary pain and suffering as the result of adverse actions by \ntheir health plan. And 11,000 will suffer permanent disability.\n  The health professionals who deal with managed care companies every \nday know that prompt action is critical. According to a survey of \nphysicians by the Harvard University School of Public Health, every \nweek at least 18,000 patients' medical condition worsens because they \nare denied an overnight stay in a hospital. At least twenty-three \nthousand patients are harmed every week because of the denial of \nspecialty care. Each week, at least seventy-nine thousand patients are \nharmed because of denial of needed prescription drugs. The list goes on \nand on.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like the Senator from Massachusetts to help those \nfollowing the debate to understand who lines up on the different sides \nof this debate.\n  The Senator has been here through many of these legislative battles. \nHe knows there are forces at work that want to pass a bipartisan \nPatients' Bill of Rights to help families, and there are forces \nagainst. Will the Senator, for the record, tell us how those forces \nline up?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is an excellent question. As the Senator from \nIllinois understands, these protections did not just come out of thin \nair. They were recommended. Recommended by whom? Virtually every \nmedical society in the country supports our program. During this \ndebate, we challenged the other side to produce one medical society \nthat supported their program. We still have not heard it.\n  Every medical society supports our program. Every nursing society \nsupports our program. Every consumer group supports our program. Every \npatient organization supports our program. Every one of the consumer \ngroups that have been trying to protect children understands the \nimportance of getting specialists for children; not just a \npediatrician, but a pediatrician oncologist to deal with cancer in \nchildren and specialists in these areas. We guarantee these. This \nRepublican program does not.\n  We have the legislative power of this body to pass something which \nthe President will sign to provide the patient protections we are \ntalking about. All the majority leader has to do is call up that \nlegislation. Just call it up. Let us debate it, and let us act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If every medical organization--doctors, nurses, \nspecialists--has come down in favor of this bipartisan approach, who is \non the other side of this? What is the force that is stopping us from \npassing this legislation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator again has asked the important question. It \nis the insurance industry. You have on the one hand, as suggested by \nthe two questions the Senator asked, all of the health professionals, \nall of the men and women who have devoted their lives to taking care of \npatients in this country, the doctors, the nurses, all of the various \nprofessional societies, all the consumer groups, all the children's \norganizations that care about this, all the elderly groups. And on the \nother side you have the insurance industry that is opposed to it. The \nbasic reason for that is that it cuts into their bottom line--even \nthough they have guaranteed the kinds of protections we are talking \nabout.\n  What we are trying to do is make sure the patients are going to get \nthe kind of coverage and the kind of attention for which they had \nsigned up. What happens in so many of these instances is the HMO, the \npolicyholder, just will not give what their patients are guaranteed in \nthese areas. And with all the other complexities in terms of denying \nthe patients the opportunity to sue the HMO, we are denied an \nopportunity for remedy as well.\n  There is rarely a public policy question that is as important as this \none. We know what can be done. We have good legislation, that is almost \nat the door of the Senate, that could be called up. I am sure the \nSenator from Illinois would agree with me, and we could get that done \ntoday. Certainly we could do that, and the minimum wage as well.\n  I see my time has just about expired, but I want to try to go \nthrough, briefly, some of these other areas where we have failed to \ntake action. These are the kind of issues about which people talk to \nus. This is the kind of issue about which families are concerned--the \nminimum wage, a Patients' Bill of Rights. When I was in Methuen this \npast Monday, I must have had four different senior citizens come up to \nme and say: What's happening on that prescription drug proposal that \nthe President is supporting--that so many of us are supporting? Try to \nget that up and get a debate, get that reported out of the Finance \nCommittee and reported out here on the Senate floor. Please do \nsomething about prescription drugs.\n  But we aren't able to get anything done on that. We aren't able to \nget anything done on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have a Republican \nleader who said that ``House-Senate conferences on other legislation \nhave a higher priority'' than consideration of the Patients' Bill of \nRights. So this thing is just being kicked on over to next year. That \nmay be satisfactory to some of the insurance companies. That may be \nsatisfactory to some of the Republican leadership. But it is not \nsatisfactory to the families in this country.\n  In the final few moments, I want to once again mention the areas of \neducation which we would have hopefully had some opportunity to address \nwith greater time.\n  In recent years, too many in Congress have paid lip-service to \neducation--and then failed to act to meet the most basic needs of the \nNation's schools. This Congress faces a major test in the coming days, \nas we seek to guarantee that education receives the funds it deserves \nfor the coming fiscal year. If we want a better and stronger America \ntomorrow, we must invest more in education today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The debate then on the President's proposal for 100,000 \nteachers to reduce classroom size, so that teachers can give more \nattention to the students, really is kind of a parallel to the 100,000 \nCOPS Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed to continue \nfor 3 minutes and it not be charged against the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might, then, say to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nthe President's program for 100,000 cops has given the money directly \nto the police departments and the communities to put more cops on the \nbeat. We have seen the crime rate coming down in America, partially \nbecause of this. Now we have the same debate about the money going \ndirectly to the schools so they can reduce class size. And there is \nresistance, again, from the Republican side of the aisle.\n  Have we not learned any lesson from the 100,000 cops, that if the \nmoney goes directly to the problem, we can get results?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has given an excellent example about \nprograms that have been successful. And we know these programs are \nworking, as the Senator has pointed out.\n  Communities do not understand why, just a year ago, we joined hands \nto help them reduce class size--yet we are on the verge of abandoning \nour commitment now.\n  Research has documented what parents and teachers have always known--\nsmaller classes improve student achievement. In small classes, students \nreceive more individual attention and instruction. Students with \nlearning disabilities have those disabilities identified earlier, and \ntheir needs can be met without placing them in costly special \neducation. In small classes, teachers are better able to maintain \ndiscipline. Parents and teachers can work together more effectively to \nsupport children's education.\n  Project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 schools in Tennessee. \nStudents in small classes performed better than students in large \nclasses in each grade from kindergarten through third grade.\n\n[[Page S13337]]\n\nFollow-up studies show that students from small classes enrolled in \nmore college-bound courses, had higher grade-point averages, had fewer \ndiscipline problems, and were less likely to drop out of school.\n  Because of the Class Size Reduction Act, 1.7 million children are \nbenefiting from smaller classes this year. 29,000 teachers have been \nhired. 1,247 are teaching in the first grade, reducing class sizes from \n23 to 17. 6,670 are teaching in the second grade, reducing class size \nfrom 23 to 18. 6,960 are teaching in the third grade, reducing class \nsize from 24 to 18. 2,900 are in other grades, K-12, 290 special \neducation teachers have been hired.\n  The program is well under way. Abandoning our commitment to help \ncommunities reduce class sizes would break a specific promise made by \nCongress only 1 year ago. It would also be a violation of our \nresponsibility to support a strong Federal-State-local partnership in \neducation. Congress cannot abdicate this responsibility.\n  We must also ensure that teachers get the training they need to come \nto school ready to teach. Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants are an \nimportant step in addressing the critical national need for high-\nquality teachers. It received strong bipartisan support in the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and Congress should fund \nit at the full authorization level of $300 million for next year.\n  Children need and deserve a good education in order to succeed in \nlife. But they cannot obtain that education if school roofs are falling \ndown around them, if sewage is backing up because of faulty plumbing--\nasbestos in flaking off the walls and ceilings--schools lack computers \nand modern technology--and if classrooms are overcrowded.\n  We need to invest more to help States and communities rebuild \ncrumbling schools, modernize decrepit buildings, and expand facilities \nto accommodate reduced class sizes. Sending children to dilapidated, \novercrowded schools sends an unacceptable message to these children. It \ntells them they don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in \nthe board room, and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the \nclassroom. We need to do all we can to ensure that children are \nlearning in safe, modern school buildings.\n  Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. \nFourteen million children in a third of the Nation's schools are \nlearning in substandard buildings. The problem of ailing school \nbuildings is not the problem of the inner city alone. It exists in \nalmost every community, urban, rural, or suburban.\n  In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, \ncommunities need to build new schools in order to keep pace with rising \nenrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school \nenrollment has reached an all-time high again this year of 53 million \nstudents, and will continue to grow.\n  The Department of Education estimates that 2,400 new public schools \nwill be needed by 2003, just to accommodate rising enrollments. The \nGeneral Accounting Office estimates that it will cost communities $112 \nbillion to repair and modernize the Nation's schools. Congress should \nlend a helping hand, and do all we can to help schools and communities \nacross the country meet this challenge.\n  Finally, in June with the support of over 250 groups representing the \ndisability community, health care providers, and the business \ncommunity, the Senate passed landmark legislation 99-0 to open the \nworkplace doors for disabled people in communities across this country. \nLast week, the House of Representatives passed this legislation by a \nvote of 412-9. Once this measure is enacted into law, large numbers of \npeople with disabilities will have the opportunity to fulfill their \nhopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives.\n  But despite the overwhelming bipartisan support for the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act, the House of Representatives has yet to \nappoint conferees to move enactment of this bill forward.\n  A decade ago, when we enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act, we \npromised our disabled fellow citizens a new and better life, in which \ndisability would no longer end the American dream. Too often, for too \nmany Americans, that promise has been unfulfilled. The Work Incentives \nImprovement Act will dramatically strengthen the fulfillment of that \npromise.\n  We know that millions of disabled men and women in this country want \nto work and are able to work. But the Republican Leadership in the \nHouse continues to deny these citizens the opportunity to work be \nrefusing to appoint conferees and move this bill forward. Every day \nthis legislation is delayed is another day the nation is denied the \ntalents and the contributions of disabled Americans.\n  Current laws are an anachronism. Modern medicine and modern \ntechnology are making it easier than ever before for disabled persons \nto have productive lives and careers. Yet current laws are often a \ngreater obstacle to that goal than the disability itself. It's \nridiculous that we punish disable persons who dare to take a job by \npenalizing them financially, by taking away their health insurance \nlifeline, and by placing these unfair obstacles in their path.\n  Eliminating these barriers to work will help disabled Americans to \nachieve self-sufficiency. We are a better and stronger and fairer \ncountry when we open the door of opportunity to all Americans, and \nenable them to be equal partners in the American dream. For millions of \nAmericans with disabilities, this bill is a declaration of independence \nthat can make the American dream come true.\n  For far too long, disabled Americans have been left out and left \nbehind. It is time for Congress to stop stalling this legislation, and \ntake the long overdue action to correct the injustices they are \nunfairly suffering.\n  The issues I have discussed today--a fair wage, health care, \neducation, employment for the disabled, freedom from hate crimes--touch \nthe lives of every American. If this Congress wants to make a \ndifference for our constituents--to improve their lives and to ease \ntheir burdens--these are major issues we must address.\n  I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Maine for her \nindulgence.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, earlier this year the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, undertook an extensive \ninvestigation of the practices of sweepstakes companies. We held \nhearings in March and later in the year to examine the increasingly \ndeceptive and aggressive marketing techniques used by many of the \nsweepstakes companies in this country.\n  At these hearings, I was told repeatedly by these companies that they \ndid not target the elderly, they did not use deceptive techniques to \ntry to induce people to buy products they didn't really need or want, \nand that they were constantly reviewing their promotional language to \nmake sure it was fair. They pledged to further improve their efforts to \nmake sure their mailings were not deceptive.\n  Recently, my constituents have sent me a number of examples of \ndeceptive sweepstakes mailings. I tell my colleagues, they are just as \ndeceptive as ever. I have seen absolutely no voluntary improvement by \nthe sweepstakes industry, despite the extensive attention given to \ntheir deceptive practices.\n  Let me share with the Senate some of the recent examples my \nconstituents have sent me. This example is from Charles M. Sias of \nBangor, ME. Mr. Sias happens to be the head of the local AARP chapter, \nand he recently arranged for me to talk to a group of senior citizens \nin the Bangor area about sweepstakes. We developed a list of tips\n\n[[Page S13338]]\n\nfor them to be able to identify deceptive mailings. It is particularly \nironic that Mr. Sias is himself receiving mailings that are clearly \ndeceptive. He is very aware of what to look out for, so he is not going \nto be deceived by the language of these mailings. But, unfortunately, \nthat is not the case with many other consumers who are inundated with \nmailings of this sort.\n  Take a look at this mailing. It says, in very large print: The judges \nhave decided: Charles M. Sias of Bangor is our $833,337 winner. And \nthen: We will update our official winners list so that it reads--again, \nit lists Mr. Sias' name. Urgent: Mail back your prize number within 5 \ndays. In the corner: This is your exclusive prize claim number--giving \nthe appearance that Mr. Sias has already won.\n  This particular mailing comes from a division of Time, Inc., known as \nGuaranteed & Bonded. It is very similar to the kinds of deceptive \nmailings we have seen during the past year.\n  A representative of Time, Inc., testified at our hearings. She \ntestified that this kind of mailing is fair but assured us they were \ncontinuing to evaluate the copy in their mailings and they were trying \nto improve it so there would be no question.\n  This is a recent solicitation, and it is just as deceptive as \nprevious ones. I think it is very disappointing to once again see the \nuse of very large, bold headlines declaring that one of my constituents \nis the winner of more than $833,000 when obviously his chances of \nwinning are less than his chances of being struck by lightning.\n  Let me give another example provided to me by one of my constituents. \nIn some ways, this letter from Publishers Clearing House, another one \nof the major sweepstakes companies, is even more insidious. It was \npersonally addressed to the woman who sent it to me. It says: These are \nthe certified cash winner documents we alerted you to watch for.\n  The use of the words ``certified cash winner'' creates the image that \nmy constituent has won a great deal of money. But this goes beyond the \nother mailing. The $100,000 figure appears to have been personally \ncrossed out. On the side, it says it is now $200,000 my constituent is \ngoing to win, and it appears a woman named Dorothy, whom we know to be \nan employee of Publishers Clearing House, has written a personal note \nto my constituent, to this woman who lives in Portland, ME, and has \nwritten: ``$200,000--see enclosed urgent notification for details,''--\nonce again, creating the impression that my constituent is going to win \nnot $100,000 but now $200,000. It is her lucky day.\n\n  Again, if we look at the small print, we find that, in fact, the vast \nmajority of people responding to this solicitation will receive just \n$1. It is extremely misleading.\n  To add to the deception, Publishers Clearinghouse includes what \nappears to be a check of some sort. They call it a claim voucher. It is \nmade out to my constituent. I have blocked out her name to protect her \nprivacy. It appears to be personally signed in blue ink by the \ntreasurer and by Dorothy Addeo, and it says: Cash value up to \n$100,000--although we know from Dorothy's helpful little note that it \nactually may be $200,000.\n  My point is that this is clearly intended to deceive the people who \nare receiving these solicitations. The intent is to part people from \ntheir money, to get them to buy merchandise they don't really need or \nwant, in the mistaken belief that somehow making a purchase will either \nguarantee they will be a winner or at least increase the odds of their \nwinning that great prize, those hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  There is another harm that is done beyond the financial waste of \nsenior citizens and others wasting their money buying products they \ndon't really need or want. That is the injury that is done to a senior \ncitizen's dignity when they realize they have been duped by these \nhighly deceptive mailings.\n  I recently received a letter from one of my constituents which I will \nshare with my colleagues. It shows how tragic some of the results are \nof these sweepstakes. We found seniors who have wasted $10,000, \n$20,000, $60,000 on sweepstakes, thinking it would help them win the \ngrand prize. In some cases, they have squandered their Social Security \nchecks and even borrowed money. As I said, there is also the injury to \na person's dignity once they realize they have been fooled.\n  This letter captures that part of the problem. My constituent writes \nto Reader's Digest in this case:\n\n       Several days ago my father received your ``announcement'' \n     that he had been nominated to fill ``your newest position'' \n     on the ``exclusive Winners Advisory Board.'' With its \n     official looking certificates and ``personal'' Internal \n     Selection Record you had him convinced that he was indeed \n     being asked to serve in some official, though honorary \n     capacity. When he realized that this was another sweepstakes \n     gimmick, and that he was no more special to you than the \n     thousands of others who received this same ``special'' \n     announcement, he was devastated.\n       My father shared your ``announcement'' with me because he \n     was proud that he was being recognized by a company he has \n     supported for many, many years. What a cruel game you have \n     played with a man who has truly been a good customer. What a \n     cruel game you play with every person who received this same, \n     or similar letter, and who, like my father, are vulnerable \n     because they believe the best about people.\n\n  I think my constituent has described the problem very eloquently. \nThese kinds of deceptive mailings prey on people who believe what they \nread, who want to trust that they are not being misled.\n  Mr. President, on August 2, the Senate unanimously approved \nlegislation that I, Senator Levin, Senator Cochran, Senator Edwards, \nand many others have worked on, which would curtail these kinds of \ndeceptive sweepstakes mailings.\n  I want to thank the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Postal \nService, Congressman John McHugh, for his excellent work in securing \napproval by the House of a strong measure to prevent these types of \ndeceptive sweepstakes mailings. In addition, Congressman Frank \nLoBiondo, who introduced a strong sweepstakes disclosure measure in the \nHouse, has made a valuable contribution to the effort to curb deceptive \nmailings. Congressman James Rogan and Congressman Bill McCollum have \nalso introduced legislation to address this problem, and have given \ntheir strong support to the effort to reform the current practices. I \nalso appreciate the support and assistance given by Congressman Chaka \nFattah and Congressman Henry Waxman, who have provided both excellent \nideas and leadership during House consideration of legislation to \naddress the problem of deceptive sweepstakes.\n  The Senate bill was passed, as I said, unanimously, and it is now \npending in the House Government Reform Committee. It has been \nunanimously approved by the Postal Subcommittee of the House Government \nReform Committee, and it is my fervent hope that before we adjourn this \nyear we can clear this important legislation and see it signed into \nlaw. It is time to put an end to these deceptive and unfair mailings \nthat prey on the hopes and dreams of our senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and seeing no one seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have had earlier comments about our \ngood friend, John Chafee, but a line I was trying to say was, more than \na balanced budget, what we need in this body is balanced Senators. I \ndon't know anybody better than John. He was the best.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the wonderful \ncolumn by Mary McGrory entitled, ``The Gentleman From Rhode Island.''\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 28, 1999]\n\n                    The Gentleman From Rhode Island\n\n       Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island was a hero on the \n     battlefields of two wars: He fought in World War II and in \n     Korea. He was also a hero on the battlefield of the Senate, \n     fighting valiantly, often for lost causes, working behind \n     enemy lines, defying his party on matters of great import. He \n     was an aristocrat who brought to the Senate a sense\n\n[[Page S13339]]\n\n     of noblesse oblige that is otherwise unknown today. In an \n     institution that calls every male a gentleman, Chafee really \n     was one.\n       He was of a size difficult for his colleagues to manage. A \n     wrestler in college and a former Marine, he hated violence. \n     He was a high-minded patrician of colonial lineage who came \n     to be idolized by his heavily Democratic and ethnically \n     diverse constituents. He served for 23 years in a body that \n     today is renowned for its pettiness and narrow-mindedness and \n     never to the end lost his zest for coalitions and \n     compromises. He was a most clubbable man, jovial and kind. \n     For many in his caucus, vision consists of imagining bringing \n     Bill Clinton to his knees. Chafee doggedly pursued his goals: \n     clean air, clean water, a nation free of guns, a world where \n     nuclear weapons were under control and people negotiated \n     their differences.\n       He worried about foster children who at 18 lose government \n     subsidies; he worried about the ABM treaty. The combination \n     of practical and cosmic concerns and a nature that seemed \n     devoid of malice made him an object of wonder. People who \n     eulogized him on the Senate floor, including those who never \n     voted his way, spoke of him with love and tears.\n       New Hampshire Sen. Robert Smith, now an independent, \n     remembered that in 1991, when the Republican leadership was \n     trying to dump Chafee as conference chairman, Smith, a \n     newcomer, decided against his fellow New Englander. When he \n     told Chafee that he was going to vote for Thad Cochran \n     (Miss.), all Chafee said was ``Oh, dear,'' He lost by one \n     vote.\n       Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D), who served with Chafee on \n     Environment and Public Works, remembers Chafee saying to him \n     the next day, ``There is no place for us liberals on our side \n     any more.'' He was smiling as he said it.\n       ``Liberal'' is now a toxic word. ``Moderate'' is as far as \n     anyone goes to describe someone who is out of step with Trent \n     Lott. Republicans show no mercy to people who, like Chafee, \n     sat down at committee tables and without the slightest nod to \n     partisan sensibilities said, ``Let's get at it.''\n       Time was when Chafee's Wednesday group, a weekly lunch for \n     the like-minded, had a dozen members and some influence. At \n     their most recent meeting, last Wednesday, there were just \n     five, counting Chafee. He was gaunt and feeble after August \n     back surgery. He had weeks ago announced his decision to \n     retire from the Senate, but he was using every last minute to \n     make a difference. Susan Collins, a freshman Republican from \n     Maine who, like several others, regarded Chafee as ``my best \n     friend in the Senate,'' told of Chafee's fervent remarks \n     about foster children set loose at 18 and his hope that she \n     could help in helping them.\n       Chafee, a gentleman of the old school, doubtless deplored \n     what went on in the Oval Office. But he was one of five \n     Republicans who voted against removing Clinton from office. \n     He was one of four Republicans who voted for the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       Chafee took no part in the pre-debate polemics on the test \n     ban. He and Sen. Richard Lugar (Ind.), a pivotal Republican \n     figure in all arms control efforts, were conspicuously \n     absent. He told me a week before the treaty suffered meltdown \n     on the floor that he was concentrating on the ABM treaty. As \n     usual, he was looking down the road to the day when Senate \n     hawks would tear up the treaty on the Senate floor and remove \n     the last obstacle to building a missile defense system, their \n     ultimate pie in the sky.\n       Republicans had been sniping at ABM, calling it ``null and \n     void'' because the Soviet Union, with whom it was negotiated, \n     no longer exists. Clinton will decide next June about going \n     forward with a project about which the only certainty is its \n     astronomical cost. The Russians say they will tolerate no \n     change.\n       In this Senate the notion of unilateral withdrawal is a \n     live option. So is a return to a full-throttle arms race and \n     the Cold War. Chafee did not press colleagues on the test \n     ban. He said he understood and shared their reservations \n     about verification and our stockpile but on balance thought \n     the country and the world would be better off if we ratified \n     the treaty.\n       Those looking for consolation--Chafee always did in a dark \n     hour--can find a little in the prospect that his death has \n     greatly improved his son Lincoln's chances of succeeding him. \n     Rhode Island is a small state that sent a great man to the \n     Senate, and sympathy for his family is unbounded. Chafee, a \n     pragmatist, would be pleased.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13339-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13339-S13342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I come to the floor, after many of my \ncolleagues have already said magnificent things, to say a word about a \nman I revered, worked with, and cherished both in personal and \nprofessional terms. That is, of course, John Chafee. There are so many \nreasons I respected and, in a sense, really loved John Chafee, and do \nto this minute and always will.\n  Many of them had to do with what it was that he didn't say and what \nit was that he didn't find a need to do. There was an interesting \narticle in the Washington Post this morning by Mary McGrory that made \nme think back to the time I was in the Peace Corps. I served with a man \nwho has since died by the name of Marty Grobli. We were working on the \nPhilippines program together. He was an enormous hero of the Battle of \nthe Bulge in World War II. He had done works of heroism which I never \nlearned about because whenever as a young person in my early twenties I \ntried to ask him, because I wanted to learn about it, he said he didn't \nwant to talk about it. I think that is the way of many who have been \nthrough searing emotional and physical experiences of danger, of \npatriotism, of great personal risk--they simply keep it to themselves. \nThere isn't a need to tell others. War is not pleasant. War is \ndestructive; war is carried out in the interests of the Nation or of \nmany nations against one or several others.\n  John Chafee never felt a need. In fact, in all the years I knew him, \nI never heard him talk about serving in two wars, World War II and the \nKorean war, or the fact he was a marine. If one looked at John Chafee, \nparticularly in the latter years, one wouldn't necessarily--unless you \nlooked at that chiseled face--say this was a marine in the sense that \none thinks about it in classical terms. He was not into looking tough, \nacting tough, or being tough--he just was tough. But he was tough on \nbehalf of people he loved, whom he represented in Rhode Island, those \nhe didn't directly represent, although he did as a Senator in the form \nof children and women and the inheritance of whatever quality of \nenvironment we will inherit in our country.\n  He was a steward of all of those things. He was ferocious in the way \nhe fought for them. He never pushed himself forward. It always seemed, \nwatching him on the Finance Committee when he was in a hearing \nconducting questioning, he was searching for truth, not either to show \nknowledge, of which he had a deep, deep repository, or to show special \nseniority. It was always that he was interested in what the witness was \nsaying, reflecting on what the witness was saying, being courteous to \nthe witness, tough on the witness where the witness might be \nwithholding information or not fully disclosing some of the other \narguments that might have been brought through that witness' answers.\n  I loved him for those qualities. I had no idea, I think as no one \ndid, that this was going to be his fate. I didn't look forward to the \nfact he was going to retire, but since he announced he was going to \nretire I looked forward to the fact he would go back to Rhode Island, \nhis beloved Northeast, to prowl his State, to be with the people who \nstood by him in all the years.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina knows, John Chafee was also a \nGovernor. I was a Governor, and I think Governors bring to this body a \nparticular ability and desire to want to reach a compromise to find a \nsolution. The Presiding Officer was a Governor. And Governors often \ncan't allow themselves to tarry because of an ideology. They can't \ntarry on simply a petulant feeling about this situation or that person \nbecause they are the only person in that State, be they man or woman, \nwho can resolve the situation. Therefore, they have to seek a \ncompromise. They have to seek a solution. I love that quality in a \nSenator. It is a quality John Chafee had in just an unparalleled \namount.\n\n  So he never got to go back home. I feel very sad about that. I wanted \nto think about John Chafee at home, enjoying the fact he was looking \nback on all of his years of national service and public service and \nenjoying his grandchildren, his children, Ginny, his beloved State of \nRhode Island, and all of the Northeast. He was a remarkable person.\n  I quote another thing Mary McGrory said which I liked so much:\n\n       In an institution that calls every man a gentleman, he \n     really was one.\n\n  That kind of puts us in our places. But it also very much says \nsomething accurate about John Chafee. I have heard him talk to people \nsharply. But it was always on substance. It was always on issues. It \nwas always on what it was between himself and a resolution to a policy \nproblem that he cared about.\n  In the leader's chair sits the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. He \nand I will remember, because we were both there,\n\n[[Page S13340]]\n\nit was only last week--which is the heartbreaking part of it--that \nSenator John Chafee, as the senior member of the Finance Committee, was \nconducting a hearing on independent living. That is the problem caused \nwhen children are brought up, often abused by their parents or by \nothers, through a foster care system, and then all of a sudden at the \nage of 18 they are declared independent.\n  Our colleague, the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, is also \nvery interested in this problem. John Chafee was quizzing the young \npeople who were there, who had come through the system--many, many \nfoster parents, some of whom had worked, some of whom had not--but they \nhad been, at the age of 18, declared independent. They were just cast \nout. They lost their health insurance. They didn't know how to open a \nbank account, not necessarily even how to operate a washing machine, \nand they said that to us in very clear and compelling ways.\n  I thought it was in situations such as that--I think my friend from \nIowa will agree with me--that John Chafee was at his best. He was in \nhis 70s. Yet he focused so much of what he did heavily on children who \nwere in their fourth and fifth year, or in their teens. It was a burden \nand a passion that never relented.\n  The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and I are working very hard with \nour staff and the Finance Committee staff to try to complete that \nindependent living bill, not simply--because that would embarrass him--\nas a way of honoring John Chafee, but, frankly, because John Chafee \nwould be on us to do it. Knowing he is not here to do it himself, we \nintend to do that and we will do that. We hope it will pass this body \nand the other body and be signed by the President.\n  John Chafee's health is something I have to comment on because I \nalways thought of him, and do think of him, as so strong. I wondered, \nas many of us did in the last several months, what was it that caused \nhim to seem to become so fragile so quickly? But because I knew John \nChafee and had known John Chafee, I always believed it would pass \nbecause John Chafee always came back. He was always there. He was frail \nbecause he had back surgery, but that was not going to lead to \nsomething else. It was simply something he was going to get over and \ncome back and take his place over there, behind where the flowers are \nplaced on his desk, and resume his work.\n\n  That is what John Chafee did. He did not retire when he was in his \nlate 60s. He certainly was financially independent enough to do so, but \nhe didn't retire because he wanted to work. He loved public policy. He \nloved helping children and families. He loved health care.\n  I can remember during the Clinton health care debates, it was classic \nJohn Chafee because we would go on Sunday television shows and he and I \nwould have a wonderful conversation--before. We had different views on \nthe legislation. We would have a very warm conversation before and then \nhe would, during the course of the interview, proceed to shred me \nmercilessly, in good Marine fashion; you know, using good facts and \ngood examples. Then, as soon as it was over, he would go back and we \nwould be amiable.\n  I commented to him on that several times, and he just would sort of \nbrush it off. He was doing his work. He was doing the work he was here \nto do.\n  When we think of children in this country getting health insurance, \nlet us remember John Chafee because it was John Chafee who drove that. \nIt was called the Children's Health Insurance Program--CHIPs. And \nLaurie Rubiner, his staff person, drove that. They were driving this \nindependent living bill. There were so many things he did for people of \nall sorts.\n  I haven't even mentioned, except very briefly at the beginning, the \nenvironment.\n  John Chafee was also a very independent person. I do not say this as \na Democrat; I say this as a Senator. I liked so much the fact that he \nwas so ferociously independent of his own party when he chose to be; of \nhis own party when they applied pressure on him; from his constituents, \npresumably, when they applied pressure on him. He always did what he \nthought was right. In the longer day of life, if you are who you are \nand you stay who you are, people will come in your direction. If you \nbend to other people's wills and people have a sense of that, then \nthere will never be a need for them to come in your direction because \nthey will sense, if they outwait you, they will prevail.\n  You could not do that with John Chafee, whether it was because he was \nthis incredible person from Rhode Island and Northeast, this son of \nearly America; whether it was because he was a marine; whether it was \nbecause of his own particular and unique nature--he never backed away \nfrom anything.\n  John Chafee was a great figure of the Senate. I am not in the \nposition at this point to rate great figures in the Senate over eras. \nBut I certainly start with the idea that John Chafee was and is one of \nthose. I think he was an inspiration. He inspired me. I felt better \nwhen I saw him, when I was in his presence. I felt more motivated. I \nfelt better about everything because he just did that to you, whether \nhe was on his cane, as he was in the last month or so, or whether he \nwas vigorous, as he was always before that. He enriched the lives of so \nmany. He seemed to care very little about his own comforts, but, on the \nother hand, he was so devoted to his family.\n  In closing, I want to think about Ginny; I want to think about his \nchildren; I want to think about his grandchildren; I want to think \nabout his staff, people who must be absolutely devastated now, all of \nthem, each of the categories of people close to him, whom I have \nmentioned. I want them to know they were related to, married to, \nchildren of, grandchildren of, and working for, a really very great \nAmerican.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Monday, as so many others in this body, \nI was shocked to hear the news of the passing of my dear friend and our \ncolleague, Senator John Chafee.\n  I spoke out at that time of the feelings that both my wife Marcelle \nand I have for John and for Ginny and for their family. I would like to \nexpand on that just a little bit further on the floor of the Senate.\n  When I spoke first, it was off the floor. But John and I spent so \nmuch time in this body that I felt it would be only appropriate to say \nsomething here because I feel that it was an incredible privilege to \nhave served with him. I know his presence is going to be missed greatly \nby everyone.\n  It still seems strange to stand on the Senate floor and see his desk \nwith a black shroud on it and the flowers there--something that in my \n25 years I have seen several times for colleagues. You always hope you \nwill not see it because when you see it you know--whichever side of the \naisle it is on--that you will miss a Member of this very special \nfamily. There are only 100 who are privileged to serve, at any one \ntime, in this body representing a quarter of a billion people. We have \nrespect for each other, affection for many.\n  I think in this case, when you hear what has been said by Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, you know the great affection and respect there \nis for John Chafee. And it is only natural. He was a truly \nextraordinary man. He dedicated his life to serving his State of Rhode \nIsland and his country. He did so with a commitment that yielded many \nbenefits to all Americans, way beyond Rhode Island or New England.\n  He had a distinguished military career. He never questioned when duty \ncalled, even when it was at his own personal expense. He left Yale \nUniversity as an undergraduate to serve in World War II. He returned to \nactive duty in Korea shortly after receiving a law degree from Harvard. \nHis contribution to Rhode Island and our country continued as Governor \nof his State, as Secretary of the Navy, and as a Senator.\n  The list of positions he held indicates a man of rare qualities. But \nwhat he did in those positions is what places John amongst the finest \nAmericans to have served in the Senate. He was passionate about issues, \nbut he had the unique ability to search for compromise among otherwise \ndivided colleagues. He never seemed to lose sight of the fact that the \nSenate was working toward a common good, not an individual one.\n\n[[Page S13341]]\n\n  From taking the office of Governor in 1962, in a largely Democratic \nState, to his four terms in the Senate, John Chafee showed the country \nhe was willing to look past party lines and see what was at the heart \nof the issue at hand.\n  He made so many significant, visible and invisible, contributions to \nthe Senate in the 24 years he served in this body. I was privileged to \nserve with him in each of those years. He was a tireless advocate of \nthe environment, becoming the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee in 1994. He was a staunch supporter and advocate of \nmany of the most important environmental protection laws that have been \npassed, including the Clean Air Act of 1990. He was always one of the \nstrongest voices behind the protection of our wetlands, as well as the \nneed to stop global warming from further progression.\n  I remember our latest legislative effort together on the so-called \ntakings legislation, when John and I took to the Senate floor defending \nthe rights of States and local officials to make their own decisions \nabout their communities. I am sure many in the Senate probably grew \ntired as the two of us reminisced about New England character and the \nlandscape we love so much. At times during that debate I thought the \nChambers of Commerce of Rhode Island and Vermont should probably have \nhired us for all the things we were saying, but we made our point.\n\n  In health care, John was an advocate of compromise. His efforts to \nstrengthen Medicare and Medicaid were actually seen as trying to \nappease Republicans and Democrats alike. What he was trying to do was \nto bring us together, because in every bend of the road, John was an \nadvocate of serving his country to the very best of his ability. And he \nwas successful in that every day of his life.\n  I think of arms control issues in the 1980s. John Chafee, John Heinz, \nDale Bumpers--I remember working with them. We were sometimes referred \nto as the ``Gang of Four'' as we worked to bring reason to the nuclear \narms race, even though we spanned the political spectrum among us. But \nas a veteran, as a decorated veteran, as a respected veteran, as a \nrespected former Secretary of the Navy, John was not only an \ninspirational strategist in the ``Gang of Four'' but also an important \nresource of knowledge about the needs of an operationally effective \nnuclear triad.\n  So all of us have lost a beloved friend, one who will be missed \ndearly in the Senate. But the country should know the country suffered \na great loss. Here was a man whose outlook and morals were of the \nhighest standard. That should be something Senators in the present and \nthe future should emulate. He was an anchor of civility for the Senate.\n  It is interesting that both he and my distinguished predecessor, as \nthe senior Senator from Vermont, Bob Stafford, served as chairmen of \nthe Environment Committee--both bringing those New England \ncharacteristics of civility in working for the better good.\n  Marcelle's and my thoughts and prayers are with Ginny and the rest of \nthe Chafee family; and also with John Chafee's staff, who are among the \nfinest people here--his extended family.\n  He will be missed. It was a privilege for the 99 remaining Senators \nto have served with him. And I think all 99 know that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleagues in \npaying tribute to Senator John Chafee. With his passing this week, the \nSenate lost a wise and courageous voice. Anyone who spent any time in \nthe Senate could see that Senator Chafee's reputation for honesty and \nindividual conviction were well-deserved.\n  I want to offer his family my deepest sympathy and my deepest \nappreciation for sharing him with us for so long. He served as a role \nmodel of what a Senator should be.\n  The more I think about Senator Chafee--the more I realize the \nqualities that are rare today, were common in the gentleman from Rhode \nIsland. Rare qualities like courage, independence, and a desire to \nalways do what is right.\n  He often fought alone for what he believed was right. He worked for \nlegislative compromise, but never compromised his own principles.\n  I was proud to join with him on many important initiatives, and his \nmark can be found on many of the landmark environmental protection laws \nenacted in the last twenty years. He was a thoughtful \nenvironmentalist--protecting the health and welfare of people, \nwildlife, and the environment as a whole, while at the same time \nbalancing the needs of the economy. He recognized the fact that the \nWest had a different relationship with its natural resources than the \nEast. His work on clean air, clean water, oil pollution, and endangered \nspecies has benefited the entire nation. The people and the environment \nin my state, 3,000 miles away from Rhode Island, are far better off \ntoday, because a man named John Chafee served 23 years in this body.\n  Senator Chafee was also a consistent and articulate supporter of \ntrade. And on issues like China MFN, he and I worked for the same \ngoals.\n  Senator Chafee was a champion of women's health care long before it \nwas politically correct. Long before anyone had ever heard of ``soccer \nmoms,'' he stood alone many times to fight for women's health, and he \nnever backed down.\n  Senator Chafee was also a strong advocate of a woman's right to \nchoose. He was a voice of reason in an increasingly emotional debate. \nHe protected a woman's right to determine her own fate and to make her \nown health care decisions. He worked to improve access to reproductive \nhealth care services and to improve security at women's health clinics. \nI always took a great deal of comfort knowing he was at the table \nfighting for women.\n  Perhaps his greatest commitment was to children, all children. He \nworked to expand Medicaid to provide health care for milllions of low \nincome children. He fought to protect Medicaid. I know there are \nmilllions of children who are now healthy adults because of the work of \nSenator Chafee. One of my most vivid memories of Senator Chafee was \nfighting on the floor in June 1997 to expand health care security for \nthe 10 million uninsured children. He refused to give up his goal, and \nhe refused to pass an empty promise. His work created the successful, \nbipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) which ultimately \nwill provide health security for five million children. Think of the \nkind of impact he will have on the quality of life for these five \nmilllion children.\n  Mr. President, I believe one of my roles in the Senate is to speak \nfor those that have no voice--children, working families, the \nenvironment, battered women, and the elderly. Those are the same causes \nJohn Chafee served and served so selflessly. I only hope I can measure \nup to the standard he set.\n  When someone like John Chafee--someone with rare personal qualities \nand a legacy found in the millions of people his policies helped--when \nsomeone like that leaves this world, it makes the rest of us reflect on \nhis contribution. Mr. President, this Senate is the poorer for his \npassing.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I join my Senate colleagues, the \npeople of Rhode Island, and the citizens of this great nation in \nbidding a sad farewell to our friend and countryman John Chafee.\n  From the shores of Guadalcanal to his hometown of Providence, RI, to \nthe floor of the United States Senate, John Chafee was a true patriot. \nIn everything he did, he put the best interests of the United States \nfirst.\n  And even when I disagreed with him, I knew that our disagreements \nwere legitimate disagreements about what each of us felt was the best \ninterests of this great country.\n  Descendant of two Governors and a Senator, John liked to joke that \nthe one member of his family who ran for office as a Democrat--Harvard \nprofessor Zechariah Chafee--lost handily. John, knowing the family \nhistory, signed up as a Republican and never looked back.\n  John was a remarkable man coming from a remarkable family. His legacy \ngave him a lot to live up to, and he not only met but exceeded all \nexpectations.\n  John's record of successes began at an early age. In high school, he \nwas the runner up in the 135 pound class in the state wrestling \nchampionships. And let me tell you, nobody wrestles like those 135 \npounders! Not only was it an impressive achievement, but it was good \ntraining for a future career as a Senator.\n\n[[Page S13342]]\n\n  Later, at Yale, he was captain of the undefeated Yale freshman \nwrestling team. We will never know if he would have repeated that \nachievement the following year, because he left Yale in his sophomore \nyear to enlist in the Marines--he didn't have to do that, but because \nhe was an American Patriot, he did.\n  In the Marines, he served at the Battle of Guadalcanal. John was in \nthe first wave of Americans to join in the bloody and important battle \nthere. This country will always owe a great debt to him and the other \nMarines who served so bravely there.\n  After the Marines, John sought to move on with his life. He went to \nHarvard Law School, got married, and began the practice of law in the \nstate he loved so dear. But duty called once again, and he returned to \nthe Marines, to lead a rifle company in our struggle in Korea, and the \nnation's debt to him became even greater.\n  After his service in Korea, John returned to Rhode Island and \nembarked upon a political career. While John had ups and downs in his \ntime, he certainly had more ups than downs. And more importantly, he \nknew how to handle those downs.\n\n  One of the downs came in 1968, when he lost the governorship in a \nsurprising upset. Richard Nixon, recognizing the talent in John, tapped \nhim to be Secretary of the Navy. There he was faced with a difficult \ndecision concerning the chief officers of the Pueblo, a Navy ship that \nhad been taken by the North Koreans. John decided not to court martial \nthe captain and chief intelligence officer of the ship, deeming that \nthey had suffered enough during their internment in a Korean prisoner \nof war camp. It was a difficult decision, but John Chafee has a great \nwisdom in difficult matters and the nation once again benefited from \nJohn's leadership.\n  In 1976, he was elected to the United States Senate, the institution \nto which he would devote the rest of his days. Both John Chafee and I \nwon elections to the Senate in 1994, he for his fourth term and I for \nmy first. Despite the disparity in seniority, we became friends, \nexchanging greetings on his birthday, which was just last Friday. He \nalways appreciated my greetings, and sent the kindest thank you notes \nin response.\n  In my time here, I had the pleasure to work with him on a great \nnumber of issues, but two in particular stand out.\n  The first is ISTEA, the all-important transportation legislation we \npassed here few years ago. I worked closely with John to secure \ndesperately-needed transportation projects in my home State of \nMissouri. John was always willing to work with me and my staff, and the \ncitizens of Missouri must be added to the list of those who owe him a \ndebt of gratitude.\n  The other issue that stands out in my mind when I think of John is \nhis effort to reform the Superfund program. John was always concerned \nabout the environment; back in 1969, the New York Post reported that \nJohn would stop his campaign motorcade and get out of his car to pick \nup a piece of litter. John always understood that we were all \nresponsible for improving the environment, and his efforts to improve \nSuperfund were based on that belief in individual action. As chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was in a position to \nact on his love for the environment, and his work in reforming \nSuperfund is one of his most important achievements.\n  John leaves behind a loving wife, Ginny, 5 children, and 12 \ngrandchildren. My prayers are for them at this time. They will miss \nhim, as will we all.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to remember my friend and \ncolleague, Senator John Chafee.\n  We were both elected to this great body in 1976. But, John was not \nyour average freshman Senator. Whereas I had never held office before, \nJohn came to the Senate with a service record to his State and his \ncountry that was already exemplary.\n  He was a war hero, having fought with the Marines on Guadalcanal. He \nwas a Rhode Island state legislator, Governor, and Secretary of the \nNavy.\n  But here, he was not content to rely upon past achievements, no \nmatter how great those achievements were. He fought diligently for a \ncleaner environment, better health care, and a fair and fiscally sound \nMedicare and Medicaid system. Most recently, we worked together on the \n``Caring for Children Act,'' a bill which would have responsibly taken \nour nation's child care policy into the next century, providing parents \nwith more options and expanding the ability of states to meet the needs \nof low-income working parents.\n  It was my pleasure to serve with John Chafee on the Finance Committee \nand the Select Committee on Intelligence. His leadership and \nunderstanding on these issues will be greatly missed.\n  I secretly admired John in another way as well. I understand that he \ncould play a mean game of squash, which is a game I never learned.\n  Of all of John's titles--Governor, Secretary, Senator--I know that \nhis favorites were ``Dad'' and ``Grandpa.'' I offer my deep condolences \nto John's wife, Virginia, and to their children and grandchildren. I \nknow that spending more time with them and in his beloved Rhode Island \nfollowing his retirement next fall was something that he looked forward \nto. The tragedy of his sudden death is all the worse because he was \ncheated out of this well-earned retirement.\n  John Chafee was a gentleman, a statesman, and a true public servant. \nThere is no higher accolade that I can pay him.\n  Elaine and I send our deepest sympathies to his wonderful family and \nto all Rhode Islanders on this great loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13342-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13342-S13343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CLASS SIZE REDUCTION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of the budget \nprocess, and there were inferences made on the floor yesterday that the \nclass size initiative should not be part of the final budget agreement \nbecause--it has been claimed--the President doesn't have the authority \nto insist that we hire more teachers to reduce class size.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to clarify the \nPresident's important--and authorized role--in fighting for smaller \nclasses. I have also come to the floor to remind my colleagues that \nthis year we have smaller class sizes--where discipline has been \nrestored and kids can learn the basics--because last year Congress made \na bipartisan agreement--and a bipartisan commitment--to hire 100,000 \nnew teachers in order to reduce size in first, second, and third \ngrades.\n  Today, as the budget process winds down, I want to make sure that our \nagreement is not pushed aside.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the President does have the \nauthority in the Constitution to register his opinion on whether or not \nthe budget is acceptable. In fact, the President doesn't just have the \nauthority, but he has the responsibility under Article I, Section 7 to \nreturn bills with his objections that he does not approve of. And I'm \nglad the President has that authority and that he will use it if this \nCongress doesn't guarantee class size reductions. And 38 Senators \nsigned a letter saying we would stand behind his threatened veto \nbecause we agree class size reduction is critical.\n  Mr. President, in trying to reduce the number of students in each \nclassroom, I have followed the process. In March, I was told it wasn't \nthe right time. In the subcommittee, I was told we weren't allowed to \noffer amendments. In full committee, I was told it was too \ncontroversial. Then, when I got the floor, I was told I'd have to wait \nuntil the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was written. If we \nhave to wait until then, we won't be able to tell kids they will have \nsmall classes next year, and we can't tell teachers they will have \ntheir jobs next year.\n  Mr. President, I have followed the process, and I have waited. But I \nam tired of waiting as I sense that this Congress is trying to undo our \nbipartisan commitment. What am I supposed to tell students, ``Congress \nhas to write the ESEA and until then, you have to learn your ABCs in a \nclass with 35 students.'' To me, that is not acceptable. I'm not going \nto tell them that. If this Congress feels so strong that guaranteeing \nsmaller classes is not important, you can give them your excuses.\n  This is about money in the budget that Congress approved last year, \nand it is about us keeping our commitment to improving education by \nreducing class size.\n  The class size reduction effort has been a success in its first year. \nToday, we have kids learning in classrooms\n\n[[Page S13343]]\n\nthat are less crowded--learning to read, learning to write, and \nlearning the basics with fewer discipline problems. They are working \nwith a trained professional. Research shows they are going to have \nhigher graduation rates, higher grade point averages and a higher \nlikelihood of pursuing higher education.\n  They are going to be successful because of the work this Congress did \none year ago. And the President has a right to insist on it. We as \nDemocrats have a right to insist on it, and--as a Senator in this \nbody--I am here to insist on it.\n  Now is the time to keep our commitment. Now is when the decisions are \nbeing made. Now is when we have to stand up for smaller classes. If we \nhave to wait until after all budget deals have been cut, until after \nall the money has been spent, we will have failed those teachers, we \nwill have failed those parents, but most importantly, we will have \nfailed those children.\n  Mr. President, it is a national priority to reduce class size so kids \ncan learn the basics and so discipline can be restored in the \nclassroom. It is a promise we made last year and we need to put the \nmoney behind it, wherever it is appropriate.\n  A few weeks ago, I met with a teacher in Tacoma, WA, named Kris \nPaynter. Last year, there were 30 kids in her first grade class. This \nyear there are 13 because of this program. That makes a huge difference \nfor those kids. I saw a disciplined classroom where kids could learn \nthe basics. Next year, we don't know how many kids will be in Ms. \nPaynter's class. And we can't even guarantee those 29,000 teachers \nhired last year will keep their jobs.\n  Mr. President, putting all of these process questions aside, what \nreally matters at the end of the day is that kids have smaller classes. \nThe teachers and parents in this country care that we do it. Period.\n  The millions of children who are now in smaller classes aren't \nwondering ``has this been authorized?'' or ``is this in the budget?'' \nor ``does the President have the constitutional authority to reduce \nclass sizes?'' What really matters is that we fulfill our promise to \nparents, teachers, and students that we made last year in a bipartisan \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I hate to say it, but at every turn, this Congress has \nput special interests ahead of the interests of real families. This is \nthe last opportunity we will have to do something significant for kids. \nWe didn't address the loopholes that still allow kids and criminals to \nget their hands on guns. We didn't make schools safer after the \nColumbine tragedy. We didn't provide health insurance to more kids. \nThis is the last chance we have in this Congress to do something for \nout kids, fix a problem we know exists. And I am here to say that we \ncannot let this chance pass.\n  We need to keep our commitment to reducing class size. We need to be \nable to tell those teachers they will have jobs next year, and we need \nto be able to tell those kids they will have small classes next year. \nLet's stand behind our commitment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to briefly comment \non a significant development in the fight for campaign finance reform. \nThis morning, a bipartisan group of Senators, led by the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel, announced a new campaign finance reform proposal. \nLet me say that I and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, warmly \nwelcome the heightened participation of this new group of Senators, \nwhich includes the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, who has been, \nfrom the day she came to the Senate, a strong supporter of campaign \nfinance reform. I also note that it includes five Republican Senators \nwho have previously never voted for a campaign finance reform measure \nthat includes limits on soft money.\n  As I predicted last week on the floor, the wall of protection for the \ncurrent system of unlimited soft money contributions to the political \nparties is rapidly crumbling. While I am pleased by this development, I \nam not surprised. The soft money system is indefensible. I think we saw \nthat during our abbreviated debate last week. Opponents of reform \ndidn't defend soft money; they tried to divert our attention from it. \nThey actually questioned whether there is anything corrupting about \nunlimited contributions from corporate and union treasuries to the \npolitical parties.\n  As the chairman of the Global Board of Directors of Deloitte Touche \nTohmatsu wrote in the New York Times when he heard about these comments \non the floor:\n\n       You could almost here the laughter coming from boardrooms \n     and executive suites all over the country when Senate \n     opponents of campaign finance reform expressed dismay that \n     anyone could think big political contributions are corrupting \n     elections and government.\n\n  I think the new initiative, led by the Senator from Nebraska, \nrecognizes the opponents of reform have now retreated to an untenable \nposition. They are defending the indefensible. To say there is nothing \nwrong with unlimited contributions to the political parties, that this \nis somehow the ``American way,'' is to live in a fantasy world the \nAmerican people simply will not accept.\n  The public knows soft money is wrong. The public knows soft money is \ncorrupting. And the business community knows it, too, as the Global \nChairman of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu so well expressed.\n  While the Hagel proposal does not ban soft money completely, which I \nbelieve is an essential element of an acceptable campaign finance \nreform bill, it does limit it significantly. So what you have here is a \nwhole new group of Republican Senators, as well as some Democrats who \nare obviously saying it is not unconstitutional to limit soft money. In \nfact, they are obviously seeing the abuse of $300,000 or $500,000 \ncontributions and they want to do something about it. So I am looking \nforward to working with Senator Hagel and the others to reach common \nground.\n  When campaign finance reform left the floor last week, we had a total \nof 55 Senators who had voted in favor of reform. Now, with this new \ninitiative, there are five more Senators who apparently are prepared to \nvote to change this system. I think that is very significant, as I am \nsure my colleagues know, because what is 55 plus 5? It is 60. If we can \nbring all of these Senators together on a package they can all accept, \nwe can break the filibuster. What we need now is real hard work, \nbipartisan work. We need to bridge our differences. If we can do that, \nwe can defeat the defenders of this corrupt system and give the people \na cleaner and fairer campaign finance system for the new century.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13343-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 434, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 434) to authorize a new trade and investment \n     policy for sub-Sahara Africa.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lott (for Roth/Moynihan) amendment No. 2325, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Lott amendment No. 2332 (to amendment No. 2325), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Lott amendment No. 2333 (to amendment No. 2332), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Lott motion to commit with instructions (to amendment No. \n     2333), of a perfecting nature.\n       Lott amendment No. 2334 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to commit), of a perfecting nature.\n       Lott (for Ashcroft) amendment No. 2340 (to amendment No. \n     2334), to establish a Chief Agricultural Negotiator in the \n     Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the trade bill which is \nbefore us, and to register some disappointment with the path the leader \nhas chosen to pursue because at this point the leader has indicated \nthat he is not going to permit amendments to this trade bill. He has \nbrought the bill to the floor, but he has what we call around here \n``filled the tree.''\n\n[[Page S13344]]\n\n  I am certain people who are listening to this out across the country \nmust wonder what this language we use around here means. Very simply, \nit means the Republican leader has constructed this bill and amendments \nto the bill that preclude other Senators from offering amendments to \nthis legislation. I regret that. I think it is a mistake.\n  One of the reasons we are bogged down around here is because the \nleader keeps doing this and keeps bringing up bills and keeps filling \nthe tree. He keeps filing cloture and doesn't let the Senate legislate. \nI understand from time to time that may be necessary to move business \nin the Senate. But I think it has now happened so frequently that it is \nactually stopping business in the Senate. I believe that is a mistake.\n  Hopefully, this will change and we will be given an opportunity to \noffer amendments. I have several amendments that I believe should be \nconsidered by the body on this legislation. They are directly relevant \nto trade. In fact, I can't think of amendments any more relevant than \nthe amendments I would like to offer.\n  The first amendment I would like considered is one to give direction \nto our trade negotiators as they go into the WTO Round in Seattle next \nmonth. We are just weeks away from our negotiators going into talks \nwith all of the other countries that are involved in these discussions. \nWe have not taken the opportunity to give direction to our trade \nnegotiators on the policies they ought to pursue in these talks.\n  I believe it is very important that we set out what the goals should \nbe. What should we ask our negotiators to have as their negotiating \npriorities?\n  I also would like to offer an amendment that would give trade \nadjustment assistance to farmers because right now they are left out. \nIf they are adversely affected by a trade agreement that we reach, \ntough luck. They are left out. They are not helped. They ought to be \nincluded. Certainly, there ought to be restrictions as to how it would \napply. But trade adjustment assistance ought to be provided for \nfarmers. That is an amendment that I would like to offer to this bill. \nRight now I am precluded from doing so because, as I indicated, the \nRepublican leader is denying other Senators the opportunity to present \namendments.\n  I am willing to live by the will of this body. I am willing to offer \nan amendment and have votes taken. If I win, I win. If I lose, I lose. \nBut I would at least like to have the opportunity to see where the will \nof the Senate lies on these questions. What are the negotiating \ninstructions we give to our delegation to the WTO talks? Should farmers \nbe included in trade adjustment assistance just as every other worker \nin this country is eligible? I believe the answer to those questions is \na firm yes.\n  Let me first indicate that the reason I believe it is so critically \nimportant that we give instructions to our negotiators with respect to \nagriculture and what they do in terms of pursuing an agricultural \npolicy in the WTO talks is because we are getting skunked in these \ndiscussions. We have been getting skunked and skunked repeatedly in \nthese international trade talks.\n\n  Not so long ago I was visiting with the chief negotiator for the \nEuropeans who told me: Senator, we believe we are in a trade war with \nthe United States on agriculture. We believe at some point there will \nbe a cease-fire in this conflict and we want to occupy the high ground. \nThe high ground is world market share. Our European friends have \nengaged in a strategy and a plan to dominate world market share in \nagriculture. They have succeeded brilliantly. They have gone from being \nthe largest importing region in the world to being one of the largest \nexporting regions in 20 years. They have done it the old-fashioned way: \nThey have done it by buying these markets. They have spent, and spent \nprofusely, in order to win this world agricultural trade battle.\n  Over the last 3 years, they have averaged $44 billion a year in \nsupport for producers versus our $6 billion. They have been outspending \nAmerica 7 to 1 in terms of support for producers over the last 3 years. \nThat is part of their strategy. That is part of their plan. They want \nto go out and buy these markets. The way they have done it is very \ninteresting. They have developed a structure of agricultural support \nthat pays their producers more within European boundaries to produce \nthe same crops we produce, and then they take the surplus production \nthat results and sell it for fire sale prices on the international \nmarket, driving prices down for them, driving down prices for us, \ndriving down prices for everyone. That is also part of their strategy \nas they increase their market share--again, with the notion they are \ngoing to be in a position when a cease-fire is declared in this trade \nconflict to extract concessions. Oh, how well that strategy and plan \nhas been working.\n  Their level of support is much higher than ours--3 times as high in \nsome measures, 7 times as high under total support measurement, 60 \ntimes as high looking at world agricultural trade subsidy--and we are \nbeing outgunned. How do we win a fight when we are being outgunned on \nworld agricultural export subsidy by 60 to 1? That is what the latest \nfigures reveal. Europe accounts for almost 84 percent of all world \nagricultural trade subsidy; 84 percent. The United States, 1.4 percent. \nThey are providing 60 times as much to go out and buy these markets as \nwe are doing. Not surprisingly, they are winning.\n  Their trade negotiator said: Senator, we have a higher level of \nsupport than you do. In the last trade talks, instead of closing the \ngap, they were able to get equal percentage reductions from these \nunequal levels of support. Again, that is part of their strategy and \nplan. They don't want to see this gap closed. They don't want to see \nthe United States go up and theirs go down. They don't want to see any \nmovement in this relationship where they are now dominant. Instead, \nthey want to secure equal percentage reductions from these unequal \nlevels.\n  If they are able to do that, they will push us closer and closer to \nthe brink of losing tens of thousands of farm families all across this \ncountry. That is why I believe it is critically important we offer \nnegotiating objectives for agriculture to our delegation that will \nbegin with the WTO Round in November.\n  If I were able to offer the amendment, I would offer the following \nnegotiating objectives. The amendment I have crafted, and it is \ncosponsored by Senator Grassley of Iowa, lays out seven principal \nnegotiating objectives for agriculture:\n  No. 1, we should insist on the immediate elimination of all export \nsubsidy programs worldwide. Export subsidies only depress world market \nprices. I think this is something we could agree on in the Senate. It \nis not in our interests to have world agricultural export subsidies. It \nis certainly not in our interests when the Europeans are outspending \nthe United States in this regard 60 to 1.\n  No. 2, we should insist that the European Union and others adopt \ndomestic farm policies that force their producers to face world prices \nat the margin so they do not produce more than is needed for their \ndomestic markets. Every economist I have spoken to has told me that is \nsomething that makes sense to them, that every country ought to face \nworld market prices at the margin. It is one thing for countries to \nadopt domestic food security policies to ensure they can feed \nthemselves; it is entirely another matter to subsidize excess \nproduction and then dump this surplus on the world market, depressing \nprices for everyone else.\n\n  No. 3, we should insist that the State trading enterprises, such as \nthe Canadian Wheat Board, are disciplined so their actions are \ntransparent and they do not provide de facto export subsidies.\n  No. 4, we should insist on the use of sound science when it comes to \nsanitary and phytosanitary restrictions. Too often these are used as \nhidden protectionist trade barriers. On genetically modified \norganisms--which is a very hot issue in Europe--we should insist that \nforeign markets be open to our products, but we should also recognize \nwe can't force consumers to buy what they don't want. We have to give \nconsumers the ability to make an informed choice on whether they want \nto buy these products without letting inflammatory labels be used as \nhidden trade barriers.\n  No. 5, we should insist that our trading partners immediately reduce \ntheir tariffs on our agricultural exports to\n\n[[Page S13345]]\n\nlevels that are no higher than ours and then further reduce these \nbarriers.\n  No. 6, we should seek cooperative agricultural policies to avoid \nprice-depressing surpluses or food shortages.\n  No. 7, we should strengthen dispute settlement and enforce existing \ncommitments. We honor our commitments. All too often, other countries \nthat are party to these agreements fail to follow what they have \npledged to do.\n  I think these are seven commonsense negotiating objectives we ought \nto lay out for our delegation to the WTO talks. I hope at some point we \nare able to offer that amendment.\n  I have indicated I want to offer an amendment allowing our farmers to \nqualify for trade adjustment assistance. The amendment I want to \noffer--and again, this is cosponsored by Senator Grassley--makes \nfarmers eligible for trade adjustment assistance similar to what is \nprovided to other workers in other industries who suffer as a result of \nunfair imports. When imports cause layoffs in manufacturing industries, \nworkers are eligible for trade adjustment assistance. But when imports \ncause the same kind of problem to farmers, they are not eligible \nbecause the test is job loss.\n  Of course, farmers don't work for a paycheck, they get their living \nby selling the commodities they produce. When they are faced with a \ncircumstance in which they are unfairly impacted by trade imports, they \nlose their income but not their job. So when it comes to trade \nadjustment assistance, they are out of luck. They don't qualify for \ntrade adjustment assistance. Farmers lose their income, and there is \nnothing to help them. In fact, this may be something we do to them \nourselves. We may negotiate away certain sectors of our industry as we \ndid in the so-called Canadian Free Trade Agreement. Yet we come back \nand do absolutely nothing for the sector of our economy that was traded \naway--in this case, farmers.\n  We have a case in my State where certain loopholes were negotiated in \nthe Canadian Free Trade Agreement that allow Canadians to flood our \nmarket with Canadian durum. We can't send a bushel north, and yet there \nis nothing to help our farmers who were basically sold out in that \nnegotiation. There is not one thing to be done to help them. We have \nlost hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and nothing is being done \nto provide assistance to those farmers. The least we could do is \nprovide trade adjustments as we do for every other industry.\n\n  That is why I believe we must act on an amendment such as the one \nSenator Grassley and I have crafted. Trade adjustment assistance for \nfarmers can not only provide badly needed cash assistance to a \ndevastated agricultural economy; it can reignite support for trade \namong many family farmers.\n  The Conrad-Grassley amendment would assist farmers who lost income \nbecause of unfair imports. Farmers would get a payment to compensate \nthem for some, but not all, of the income they lose if increased \nimports affect commodity prices. The maximum any farmer would receive \nin any one year is $10,000, and the maximum cost of this amendment \nwould be $100 million a year.\n  Under our amendment, the Secretary of Agriculture would decide \nwhether the price of a commodity has dropped more than 20 percent and \nwhether imports contributed importantly to this price drop. The \n``imports contributed importantly'' standard is the same standard the \nDepartment of Labor uses to determine whether workers are eligible for \ntrade adjustment assistance when they lose their jobs.\n  In order to be eligible for benefits under this program, farmers \nwould have to demonstrate their net farm income has declined from the \nprevious years. This was a criticism leveled at the amendment in the \nFinance Committee, and we have added this provision to try to respond \nto that criticism.\n  Farmers would also need to meet with the USDA's Extension Service to \nplan how to adjust to the import competition. This adjustment could \ntake the form of improving the efficiency of the operation or switching \nto different crops.\n  Training and employment benefits available to workers under trade \nadjustment assistance would also be available to farmers as an option. \nIn most years, the program would have a very modest cost because very \nfew commodities, if any, would be eligible. But in a year comparable to \nlast year, when hog prices collapsed and wheat prices tumbled, the \nprogram would offer modest support to compensate farmers for the \nharmful effect of imports.\n  These are two amendments that I believe are totally relevant to the \nbill before us. One of these amendments I offered in the Finance \nCommittee to this very bill. Now this legislation is on the floor and \nwe are precluded from offering an amendment here. Again, I hope the \nleader will relent. I hope he will open it up so those of us who have \nserious amendments, amendments that deserve consideration, can at least \nget an up-or-down vote.\n  The second amendment I discussed, dealing with WTO negotiating \nobjectives, I also think is directly relevant. Frankly, we are not \ngoing to have another chance to give instructions to our delegation \nbefore they go to the WTO Round. Before they commence these trade \ntalks, we ought to have an opportunity to give negotiating guidelines \nto our negotiators. That is part of our responsibility, part of our \nrole. If we do not have a chance here, we are not going to have a \nchance.\n  Finally, I have a third amendment on agricultural sanctions that I \nwould hope could be considered.\n  I very much hope before this is done we will have a chance to offer \namendments, amendments that are serious, that are relevant to trade, so \nour colleagues may pass judgment on them, so we may consider and vote \non them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13345-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13345-S13348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NO NEW WAVE OF ISOLATIONISM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to speak in a moment on the \ntrade bill, but first I want to repudiate, or at least take issue with, \nsome of the comments that have been made by the President and those of \nhis National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, when he made comments \nabout the Senate becoming the new isolationists.\n  I looked at his speech he made before the Council on Foreign \nRelations just a couple of days ago. He blasted the Senate, blasted \nRepublicans, or that was the implication. I will quote:\n\n       It's tempting to say the isolationist right in Congress has \n     no foreign policy, that it is driven only by partisanship. \n     But that understates it. I believe there is a coherence to \n     its convictions, a vision of America's role in the world. Let \n     me tell you what I think they are in simple terms; First: any \n     treaty others embrace, we won't join. The new isolationists \n     are convinced that treaties--pretty much all treaties--are a \n     threat to our sovereignty and continued superiority.\n\n  I could go on, but I am very offended by that statement. I am very \noffended the National Security Adviser of this President would make \nsuch a statement about Members of this Senate. He is factually \nincorrect. He is making statements that send bad signals throughout the \nworld that are unfounded, and he should be ashamed, and he should \napologize for this speech he made before the Council on Foreign \nRelations.\n  He implies this new isolationism is against all treaties, and he is \nimplying maybe Republicans don't like treaties. Let me just take issue \nwith that.\n  In 1988, we passed the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty. It passed \nby an overwhelming margin. We passed the START treaty, Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty, START I in 1992, START II in 1996, by overwhelming \nmajorities.\n  We worked and had a bipartisan arms control group that monitored arms \ncontrol. I might mention, that started under President Reagan and \nPresident Bush. It has been discontinued, to my knowledge, under \nPresident Clinton, and maybe that is to his loss. One of the reasons \nthat group was put together was that another arms control treaty, the \nSALT II treaty, the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty proposed by \nPresident Carter, was defeated.\n  I am amazed, when people said the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was \nthe first treaty defeated in the Senate, they don't count SALT II. SALT \nII was defeated. We didn't have an up-or-down vote, but President \nCarter had the treaty withdrawn. He could count votes and he didn't \nhave 67 votes. It was not going to be ratified, so he\n\n[[Page S13346]]\n\nwithdrew the treaty. And he was correct in doing so. That treaty had \nfatal flaws.\n  So subsequent administrations, President Reagan and President Bush, \nsaid let's have a bipartisan arms control group in the Senate that will \nhelp monitor, discuss, give advice and consent. So we had good dialog \non treaties as they evolved, and this Senate was quite successful in \nratifying those treaties. I mentioned the fact we ratified INF, START \nI, START II, Conventional Forces in Europe--we did that in the 1990s--\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I might mention, I did not support the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nbut it still passed by an overwhelming majority. I have my reasons. I \ndon't think it is verifiable. I think somebody can build chemical \nweapons in a closet and no one will ever know. But my point is, that \nhappened just a year or so ago.\n  This Senate also passed NATO expansion. We passed it overwhelmingly.\n  So, again, for the President's National Security Adviser to say we \nare isolationist I think is absolutely wrong. To say we oppose all \ntreaties is absolutely wrong.\n  I might go ahead and mention that if the President submits the Kyoto \ntreaty, the Global Climate Change Protocol negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, \nit will be defeated. This Senate passed a resolution prior to their \nsigning that treaty with 90-some votes saying we will not ratify \nsomething that leaves out major players worldwide, players such as \nChina, Mexico and India, who did not sign the Kyoto Protocol, didn't \nsign the treaty--that we would not sign it. It has several other fatal \nflaws. The President went ahead and signed it anyway. If the President \nsubmits that treaty for ratification, it will go down in defeat.\n\n  Is it our fault the President went ahead and submitted the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty? Didn't he read the Constitution? The \nConstitution says it takes two-thirds to ratify a treaty. He never had \ntwo-thirds. He didn't even have a majority. Was that the Republican \nMembers' fault when we had Members of the Senate, day after day, saying \n``We want a vote on the treaty''? The President said, ``We want a vote \non the treaty.'' We had ranking members, the ranking minority Member of \nthe Senate and several others saying, ``We want to vote on the \ntreaty.'' So we did what we often do around here; we entered into a \nunanimous consent agreement that could have been objected to by any \nSenator and scheduled a vote.\n  Then people wanted to get out of the vote because, oops, we counted \nand we don't have 67 votes. There were not even 50 votes. All it would \nhave taken was a unanimous consent to defer the vote and that attempt \nwas not made. Senator Lott tried to offer the President an escape \nroute, but he wouldn't take it. The President didn't even call Senator \nLott until an hour, maybe 2 hours, before the vote. That is the \nPresident's fault.\n  Let's go back to treaties. Is this Senate willing to ratify and \nconsider treaties?\n  What about the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? That is a treaty we \nhave ratified, but we also know it has not been enforced. We know \nRussia has been selling nuclear weapons and materials to Iran, and this \nadministration has done almost nil about it. The fact is the last \nCongress passed legislation to increase penalties for firms that, \nthrough Russia, are selling to Iran. The President did not want to sign \nit. He eventually signed it.\n  He has been lax in the enforcement of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty with respect to Iran. The administration has been looking the \nother way with China, who has been selling arms, missiles, and \nequipment to Pakistan. China signed that treaty. Russia signed the \ntreaty. Iraq signed the treaty. And the administration turns its back \non Iraq. North Korea signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and \nthey have not complied with it. They have not come close to complying. \nAs a matter of fact, we have uncovered evidence that they are pretty \nactive in their nuclear program.\n  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty says there will be onsite \nvisits. North Korea said: No, there will be no onsite visits; we are \nturning off the cameras. The administration said: We are going to \nreward your noncompliance and build you a couple of nuclear powerplants \nand we will give you millions of dollars of oil every year if you \npromise not to do this anymore.\n  What was North Korea's response? Thank you very much; we will take \nyour money, your powerplants and, incidentally, we will lob missiles \nover South Korea, over Japan, and maybe hit the west coast of the \nUnited States, certainly Alaska.\n  The administration has rewarded noncompliance of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty by North Korea. They have done the same thing with \nIraq. My colleagues might remember we had a war. We had a war in Iraq \nin 1991--actually, in 1990, we had a significant buildup. In 1991, we \nhad a war.\n  At the conclusion of that war, we said: Before we are going to allow \nIraq to sell oil, we are going to have international arms control \ninspectors to make sure they are not building nuclear weapons and that \nthey were not in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--to \nmake sure they are not building chemical weapons, not building \nbiological weapons; so we are going to have an arms control group \nmonitor Iraq to make sure they are not building weapons of mass \ndestruction. Unless they complied with that, we were not going to let \nthem sell oil. That was in 1991. That was after we won the war with \nIraq.\n  Guess what has happened since then. Since this President has been \nelected, gradually over time, we have allowed Iraq to sell more oil \nyear by year. We have zero inspectors in Iraq today. Zero. So they are \nable to build their nuclear weapons, chemicals weapons, and biological \nweapons. We do not have anybody on the ground. We may have satellites \nflying around, but they cannot pick that up. They can be built in small \nrooms.\n  This administration's record on proliferation is poor. Their record \non enforcing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is pathetic. Again, \nto have this administration lecturing Members of the Senate and saying \nwe are new isolationists is totally unfounded.\n  They rewarded Iraq for their noncompliance. They did not comply with \nthe regime imposed on them by the United States and, frankly, the \nentire world--the United Nations. They did not comply with it.\n  What did we do? We rewarded them and said: You can sell all the oil \nyou want. And the administration ratified that by a unanimous vote in \nthe Security Council 3 weeks ago which said to Iraq: You can sell all \nthe oil you want and, incidentally, you do not have to have any arms \ncontrol inspectors whatsoever in Iraq; none, zero.\n  Great. That is a great policy.\n  Speaking of nonproliferation, the whole idea of nonproliferation is \nwe do not want a lot of nuclear weapons primarily, but we also do not \nwant chemical and biological weapons spreading around the world. We do \nnot want them expanding.\n\n  Maybe the administration better give us some answers, including the \nVice President of the United States, when we have evidence turned in by \nthe intelligence agencies--actually, it was done by a Chinese agent--\nthat shows us they have copied or they have multitudes of information \non our nuclear weapons, including our missile designs, our latest \nwarheads, and a whole variety of things. We found out about that.\n  When did the President find out about it? His National Security \nAdviser found out about it in the fall of 1995. Sandy Berger, who is \nAssistant National Security Adviser, at least was briefed about it by \nthe Department of Energy in April of 1996. According to Mr. Berger's \nstatement, he did not brief the President until July of 1997. Mr. \nBerger, why didn't you brief the President?\n  Somehow, I do not believe that. He should resign. If the National \nSecurity Adviser finds out that China has access to our latest \ntechnology or designs on nuclear weapons in April of 1996 and does not \nbrief the President until July of 1997, he should be replaced. These \nare weapons that threaten the security of the United States. These are \nweapons that threaten the security of the world. And he did not find \ntime to brief the President of the United States? I do not believe \nthat.\n  When did the President find out they had stolen these weapons or they \nhave the designs for these weapons? What is our National Security \nAdviser there\n\n[[Page S13347]]\n\nfor? To make partisan speeches in New York calling Republicans new \nisolationists? He does not find time to brief the President, but he has \ntime to sit in on campaign meetings throughout the year and at the same \ntime we have Chinese arms merchants coming to the White House writing \nbig checks? This thing smells. It is despicable. Yet he has time to \nmake partisan speeches that are totally, completely unfounded.\n  I have gone over a few treaties, and I have mentioned several the \nSenate has ratified when Republicans have been in control and when the \nDemocrats have been in control. We had bipartisan ratification for \nevery treaty I mentioned.\n  I mentioned the Kyoto treaty earlier. It has bipartisan opposition, \nand if the President submits it, it will not be ratified.\n  I mentioned the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty about which the \nPresident is so upset. It was not ratified because it is a treaty in \nperpetuity. It is a treaty that says 100 years from now or 40 years \nfrom now, no matter what China does, no matter what Russia does or what \nIraq does or any other country, if we find out they have an aggressive \nnuclear program, we still cannot test because we will abide by the \ntreaty in spite of the fact that other countries may not.\n  The Senate, by a majority vote, said it is not going to ratify a \ntreaty that has zero test limits. Every President in the past has said \nif we have a treaty, it should be temporary, a moratorium, and not a \npermanent ban; it should allow for some small amount of testing. \nFrankly, we think some countries which have signed it are already \ncheating, but we cannot detect it because it is not verifiable.\n  Many think this is not a treaty on which we should bind the United \nStates for the next 40 years. Mr. President, you have to submit a \nbetter treaty. You have to consult with Congress. You have to get some \nadvice and consent. You cannot rail and make partisan statements that \nyou want a vote and you get a vote, but then you say: Wait, I didn't \nknow. I thought we were guaranteed to win. That is not in the \nConstitution. Congress fulfilled its constitutional duty. Maybe the \nPresident should read the Constitution. It takes two-thirds of the \nSenate to ratify a treaty. It is not our fault he did not have the \nvotes. He did not even come close to having the votes.\n  What about this new military isolationism about which Mr. Berger is \ntalking, implying the Republicans do not want to get involved in a \nforeign war? Maybe he is alluding to this Senator.\n  In January of 1991, we voted in the Senate whether to authorize the \nuse of military power in Iraq. And we did. We passed it by a vote of 52 \nto 47. We had some bipartisan support. Vice President Gore supported \nthat resolution.\n\n  Most Democrats opposed it, including the majority leader, including \nsome very respected Senators whom I know and think the world of: \nSenator Nunn, Senator Boren, for example. They were saying let's give \nsanctions a little more of a chance before we initiate the war. I \nrespected that. I didn't agree with it, but I respected it. I did not \nquestion them or call them isolationists. I did not question their \npatriotism. But yet when some of us had some reservations or opposition \nto the bombing campaign in Kosovo, we are now called isolationists. I \ndisagree with that.\n  In the Rambouillet accords, the Secretary of State, Madeleine \nAlbright, basically said: Mr. Milosevic, you need to sign this treaty \nwe have put together or we're going to bomb you. I have made several \nspeeches on the floor that have those transcripts. Those were \nstatements that she made: We're going to bomb if you don't sign.\n  I was opposed to that. I stated at the time I thought it might make \nmatters worse. And, frankly, it did.\n  If you are concerned about the humanitarian loss, things were a lot \nworse after the bombing was initiated. After we pulled out the \nobservers, the monitors, things really got bad. Thousands of people \nlost their lives. Is it unpatriotic to question that action? Does it \nmake you an isolationist because you don't think we have used all the \ndiplomatic tools at our disposal before we start trying to bomb \nsomebody into submission?\n  This administration has bombed four countries in the last 13 months. \nThey have bombed in Serbia; they have bombed in Sudan; they bombed in \nAfghanistan; they bombed in Iraq--most all of which have not been \neffective. In Serbia, particularly Kosovo, for a long time it made \nmatters a much worse.\n  I don't question people's integrity or their patriotism or whether \nthey are new isolationists. I question that policy. The same thing in \nBosnia. I thought we should have given the Bosnians a chance to defend \nthemselves. This administration did not. There was a difference of \nopinion. I met with Bosnian leaders who came in and said: We don't want \nyour troops to be stationed in Bosnia. We want to have arms so we can \ndefend ourselves. I happen to agree with that policy and also said: If \nwe go this route, we are going to be stuck in Bosnia forever. We are. I \nvisited the camps in Bosnia. We are going to have U.S. soldiers there \nfor a long time. Now we are going to have United States soldiers \noccupying Kosovo, probably for decades, at a cost of billions of \ndollars.\n  So my point is, this administration seems quick to bomb, and if you \nquestion their rhetoric or if you question the issue, well, maybe you \nare a new isolationist. I just disagree with that.\n  I don't like name calling and there seems to be a lot of it lately. I \nam personally offended. Somebody made the implication that, well, \nsomebody was a racist because we didn't confirm a judicial nomination. \nI am very offended by that comment. I am upset about that comment and \nthe implication from the President and from a couple Members of this \nbody. That does not add to the debate. That is not right. It is \ninaccurate.\n  In that particular case, the judge was opposed by the National \nSheriffs Organization and opposed by the State chief of police. For \nthat reason, I voted no. It did not have anything to do with his race.\n  I just think name calling--whether you are calling somebody a new \nisolationist or whether you are saying somebody has racial motives--is \nvery offensive.\n  Let me just touch on a couple other issues. Mr. Berger alludes to the \nfact that we are isolationists. We have a trade bill before the Senate \ntoday, the African trade bill. We are trying to pass that. We are \ntrying to include the Caribbean Basin Initiative. We are trying to pass \nthat as well.\n  There are some Members on the Democrat side who are opposing that. \nThey have a right to do it. My guess is, an overwhelming majority of \nthe Senate will vote to pass this. And I do not question the integrity \nof one of my colleagues who is opposing it. He has the right to do \nthat. They are entitled to their opinion. They are entitled to offer \ntheir amendments. They are entitled to have discussion and debate on \nthe issue.\n  But if you look at trade over the last 10 or 15 years, this Congress \npassed NAFTA by a bipartisan vote. We passed GATT. NAFTA, we passed in \n1993; GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1994.\n  This Senate is more than willing to pass fast track. The President \ndid not call for fast track to be reauthorized because he was running \nfor reelection in 1996. Some of the leaders of organized labor did not \nwant it, so he didn't call for it to be done in 1996. He waited until \nafter his reelection and then he sent it to us.\n  He was the first President, going all the way back to President Ford, \nI believe, who didn't have fast-track authority. After he was \nreelected, he said: Hey, Congress, pass this. The Senate wanted to pass \nit, but the House couldn't. A lot of House Democrats said: You didn't \nwant to take a tough vote before the election, so we do not need to do \nit now either. He could hardly get any votes from Democrats in the \nHouse to pass fast track. So he is the first President in decades who \nhas not had that authority. It is not the Republicans' fault. That is \nnot new isolationism.\n  Is the President catering to protectionist forces within his own \nparty and within the organized labor agenda? He could not get it \nthrough the House; but it was not the House Republicans, it was the \nHouse Democrats that presented the problem. And those are just the \nfacts.\n  Another issue at hand is the World Trade Organization. There is going \nto be a meeting of the WTO in Seattle. Most Republicans support the \nidea of\n\n[[Page S13348]]\n\nreducing trade barriers throughout the world. There are negotiations \nwith the People's Republic of China in the WTO. They were so close, and \nthe President would not say yes. A Chinese delegate came to the United \nStates and made a lot of trade concessions. Frankly, it was a pretty \ngood deal. My compliments to the President's Trade Representative, \nCharlene Barshefsky, who negotiated a good deal. And then the President \nwould not say yes.\n  Why? Because maybe a few people in organized labor did not want him \nto say yes. Regardless, he did not say yes. So now he has called, I \nguess, the Chinese Premier and said: Well, we really want to do WTO. He \nhad them here a few months ago, and he said no. Whose fault is that? \nWho is the new isolationist? Most of us realize we need to develop and \nencourage growing markets with China.\n  So I mention a few of those things to just repudiate, in the \nstrongest words I possibly can, Sandy Berger's comments talking about \nthe new isolationist fever that is running through Congress. Maybe \nthere are some people running for President who have that philosophy. \nThey don't represent the Republican Party. As a matter of fact, the \nprimary person espousing that belief left the Republican Party.\n  In the Senate, I serve on the Finance Committee with Senator Roth and \nSenator Moynihan, and others on that committee, who have jurisdiction \nover trade issues, who have jurisdiction over tax issues. There is not \nan isolationist trend coming out of that committee or from the Senate.\n  If the President wants to get treaties ratified, he needs to consult \nwith the Senate. He could have found out from the Senate he had some \nflaws in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and did not have the votes. \nHe could have found that out before asking for the vote and saved \nhimself some embarrassment. Hopefully, he will come to that realization \nwith the Kyoto Treaty.\n  We had a resolution in the Senate with, I believe, 94 votes that said \nKyoto was fatally flawed, don't bring it to the Senate in this form or \nit will not be ratified. So maybe he is taking that as a hint he \ndoesn't have the necessary 67 votes.\n  I hope the President and his National Security Adviser will move away \nfrom this rhetoric of ``new isolationism'' because, frankly, they are \nfomenting something that is not there. It is very much to the \ndisadvantage of our country, our reputation worldwide, and it does not \ndo them service because it is not true.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13348-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13348-S13351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if there is one difficulty we have in \nthis trade debate, it is credibility. If you believe the distinguished \nleaders, the President, the majority, minority leader, the \ndistinguished chairman of our Finance Committee, you are bound to vote \nfor this particular agreement with respect to the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative and the sub-Sahara. Then if you believe this Senator, who is \nin a dreadful minority at this point, you couldn't possibly vote for \nit.\n  Trying to bolster my credibility, because I have spoken throughout \nthe year with respect to the budget, the deficit and whether or not \nthere is a surplus, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this \nmorning's column entitled ``Hill Negotiators Agree to Delay Part of NIH \nResearch Budget.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 28, 1999]\n\n      Hill Negotiators Agree to Delay Part of NIH Research Budget\n\n                            (By Eric Pianin)\n\n       House and Senate negotiators yesterday agreed to delay a \n     big chunk of the research budget to the National Institutes \n     of Health, as they struggled to find new ways to hold down \n     costs and stay within tight spending limits.\n       With concerns rising over their plan to cut programs across \n     the board, Republican leaders are once again turning to \n     creative accounting tactics to make sure their spending bills \n     are lean enough to avoid tapping into Social Security payroll \n     taxes.\n       The last of the 13 spending bills to be considered by \n     Congress, a giant $313 billion measure funding labor, health \n     and human service programs, would provide the NIH with $17.9 \n     billion for fiscal 2000, a 15 percent increase that exceeds \n     the administration request by $2 billion.\n       But the bill, which will be considered by the full Congress \n     today, would require the NIH to wait until the final days of \n     the fiscal year in September to use $7.5 billion of that \n     money. The tactic is aimed at limiting the actual amount of \n     money that the government will spend at NIH in the current \n     fiscal year; the plan would essentially roll over $2 billion \n     of spending to next year.\n       The Clinton administration warned that the move would \n     seriously hamper research efforts and impose significant \n     administrative burdens on NIH, and congressional Democrats \n     complained that it was yet another step eroding GOP \n     credibility on budget matters.\n       But Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens \n     (R-Alaska) said Congress was justified in is use of \n     accounting ``devices'' to cope with emergencies and pressing \n     budget priorities that exceeded what Congress had previously \n     set aside to spend this year.\n       The various devices are crucial to the GOP's campaign to \n     pass all 13 spending bills for the fiscal year that began \n     Oct. 1 without appearing to dip into surplus revenue \n     generated by Social Security taxes. GOP leaders last night \n     put the finishing touches on an unwieldy package that \n     includes both the labor-health-education bill, the District \n     of Columbia spending bill and proposal for a roughly 1 \n     percent across-the-board spending cut.\n       Democrats maintain the ``mindless'' across-the-board cuts \n     would ``devastate'' some agencies, hurt programs for mothers \n     and children, and trigger large layoffs in the armed \n     services. But House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) said \n     accusations the cuts would hurt defense were ``nothing but \n     hogwash.'' He said the criticism was coming from ``the same \n     officials who have sat by idly as the president has hollowed \n     out the armed forces.''\n       President Clinton has vowed to veto the huge package, as he \n     has three other bills, and there is no way the two sides can \n     reach agreement before a midnight Friday deadline. With \n     neither side willing to provoke a government shutdown, the \n     administration and Congress will agree on a third, short-term \n     continuing resolution to keep all the agencies afloat while \n     they continue negotiations.\n       While the Republicans and the White House are relatively \n     close in negotiating overall spending levels, there are \n     serious differences over how to spend money to reduce class \n     sizes, hire additional police officers and meet a financial \n     obligation to the United Nations as well as disputes over \n     environmental provisions in the bills.\n       Meanwhile, figures out yesterday showed that the federal \n     government ran a surplus of $122.7 billion in fiscal 1999 \n     (which ended Sept. 30), the first time the government has \n     recorded back-to-back surpluses since the Eisenhower \n     administration in 1956-57.\n       The 1999 surplus was almost double the 1998 surplus of \n     $69.2 billion, which was the first since 1969. Whil the 1999 \n     surplus was the largest in the nation's history in strict \n     dollar terms, it was the biggest since 1951 when measured as \n     a percentage of the economy, a gauge that tends to factor out \n     the effects of inflation.\n       All of the surplus came from the excess payroll taxes being \n     collected to provide for Social Security benefits in the next \n     century. Contrary to an earlier estimate by the Congressional \n     Budget Office, the non-Social Security side of the federal \n     government ran a deficit of $1 billion, money that was made \n     up from the Social Security surplus.\n       The drafting of the labor-health-education spending measure \n     dominated the action behind the scenes on Capitol Hill \n     yesterday. The House has been unable to pass its own version, \n     so House and Senate negotiators worked out a final compromise \n     in conference.\n       The $313 billion compromise exceeds last year's spending by \n     $11.3 billion and includes more money for education, Pell \n     Grants for college students, NIH, federal impact aid for \n     local communities, the Ryan White AIDS research program and \n     community services block grants than the administration had \n     requested.\n       While the bill provides $1.2 billion for class size \n     reduction, the Republicans insist local school districts be \n     given the option for using the money for other purposes while \n     the White House would mandate the money for hiring additional \n     teachers.\n       Republicans also were claiming $877 million in savings by \n     using a computer data-base of newly hired workers to track \n     down people who defaulted on student loans. The nonpartisan \n     CBO said the idea would only save $130 million, but \n     Republicans are using a more generous estimate used by \n     Clinton's White House budget office.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right in the middle is the headline: The Government has \nrecorded its first back-to-back surpluses since 1956-57. Within the \ntext, reaffirming that:\n\n       Meanwhile, figures out yesterday showed that the federal \n     government ran a surplus of $122.7 billion in fiscal 1999 \n     (which ended Sept. 30), the first time the government has \n     recorded back-to-back surpluses since the Eisenhower \n     administration in 1956-57.\n\n\n[[Page S13349]]\n\n\n  That is totally false. Mark Twain said it best: The truth is such a \nprecious thing, it should be used very sparingly. That has been the \ncredo around the Government in Washington, particularly with respect to \nour fiscal condition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record table 6 \non page 20 of the U.S. Treasury Report, issued yesterday.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  TABLE 6.--MEANS OF FINANCING THE DEFICIT OR DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, SEPTEMBER 1999 AND\n                                                  OTHER PERIODS\n                                              [Dollars in millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Net transactions (-) denotes net        Account balances current fiscal year\n                               reduction of either liability or asset  -----------------------------------------\n   Assets and liabilities                     accounts                         Beginning of\n directly related to budget  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     off-budget activity                        Fiscal year to date                                   Close of\n                               This month  ----------------------------   This year    This month    this month\n                                              This year    Prior year\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLiability accounts:\n  Borrowing from the public:\n    Public debt securities,\n     issued under general\n     Financing authorities:\n      Obligations of the\n       United States, issued\n       by:\n        United States              -16,115       130,078       113,047     5,511,193     5,657,386     5,641,271\n         Treasury...........\n        Federal Financing     ............  ............  ............        15,000        15,000        15,000\n         Bank...............\n                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Total, public debt       -16,115       130,078       113,047     5,526,193     5,672,386     5,656,271\n           securities.......\n                             ===================================================================================\n            Plus premium on            -16          -200           648         2,202         2,018         2,002\n             public debt\n             securities.....\n            Less discount on           534         1,648           864        79,051        80,165        80,698\n             public debt\n             securities.....\n                             ===================================================================================\n              Total public         -16,665       128,230       112,831     5,449,345     5,594,241     5,577,575\n               debt\n               securities\n               net of\n               Premium and\n               discount.....\n                             ===================================================================================\nAgency securities, issued              283          -449        -3,814    \\1\\ 29,359        28,627        28,910\n under special financing\n authorities (see Schedule\n B.

2000 Economic and Budget\n  Outlook.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will show we agree that at the beginning of the year \nwe have exactly that figure, 5 trillion 478 billion 7-some-odd-million \ndollars. Now, referring to U.S. Treasury Report table, you will find, \nunder the column Close of This Month, the figure $5,606,486,000,000. So \nthe table itself, according to the figures issued yesterday, showed the \nFederal Government ran a surplus. Absolutely false. This reporter ought \nto do his work. This crowd never has asked for or kept up with or \nchecked the facts. Eric Planin--all he has to do is not spread rumors \nor get into the political message. Both Democrats and Republicans are \nall running this year and next and saying surplus, surplus. Look what \nwe have done.\n  It is false. The actual figures show that from the beginning of the \nfiscal year until now we had to borrow $127,800,000,000.\n  That is increasing the national debt. That is the deficit, $127 \nbillion. I checked this with the Congressional Budget Office. They \nhaven't done their interpolation of the various records. I had been \nreporting, as you will find on the table inserted, a $103 billion \ndeficit for this fiscal year, as of the CBO June 30 figure. I said: \nWait a minute, it is way more than what we thought, if it is 127 rather \nthan 103. They said there were some unaccounted balances carried \nforward, some $16 billion. So it might be, instead of 103, 112. \nConscientiously, we are trying to give the truth to the American \npeople.\n  We have those figures in this particular table. We can enlarge it for \nthe viewing Senators here. That is exactly what I have said. We have a \n$5,487,700,000,000 debt. Now it has gone up. Instead of \n$5,582,000,000,000, it has gone to $5,606,000,000,000. So you can see, \nwhen we got to the end of the fiscal year, not the projections, not the \nguesses, or whatever else--we had a deficit of $127.8 billion. That is \ngoing up, up and away, because if you look at the previous year, we did \nbetter. Well, we didn't do better in 1997, the previous year, but I \nshould say the deficits have been coming down. And they had projected, \nfor example, next year, a $82 billion deficit coming down from the \n127.8 billion. I should say 103 billion, as is shown on this particular \nchart.\n  Now, if instead of $103 billion deficit, it is going to $127.8 \nbillion, you can see at a glance it is going to be another $100 billion \ndeficit next year. Looking at the facts, you can find the editorial in \nthe Washington Post to show we have already spent 30 billion of the \nSocial Security monies. We are all running around in a circle saying, \n``I don't want to touch it. No, I will not touch it.'' They have \nalready touched it to the tune of 30 billion bucks, this Congress, the \nHouse and Senate, Republicans and Democrats, all of us.\n  We have to get the truth out. Even then, to create a surplus, they \nare\n\n[[Page S13351]]\n\nusing these particular figures--we are discussing in another conference \nongoing right at the minute--the airport trust fund. We have all kinds \nof dangers with respect to the airports. It is getting unsafe to fly. \nWe need better radar. We need more runways. We need more airports. We \nneed better controls, better control towers, everything else of that \nkind. We are being taxed for it. We all fly, and we pay the taxes as \nairline travelers. But $11 billion has been spent on any and everything \nother than airports. It shows that it is going up, under the budget, to \n$23 billion in 2004. We have the money, but we don't spend it on the \nairports or the highways. Reporters across this country have been \nwriting these editorials to the effect that it doesn't make any \ndifference whether we borrowed from it or not; these are just IOUs.\n\n  I don't want to be around here in the year 2012 when we don't bring \nin enough to cover our costs and we are going to have to raise taxes in \norder to make payments. That crowd in New York working the market, they \ncould care less. They think in quarterly amounts, in the quarter of \neach year. If you don't do it by the third quarter, out you go. That is \nthe CEO/Wall Street mentality. Ours should be the long-range. You have \nin the desk drawer right now $1.859 trillion in IOUs not only in \nMedicare but in military retirement, civilian retirement, and you don't \nwant to talk Social Security. I don't want to touch the military \nretirement fund or borrow from the unemployment compensation fund, the \nhighways, and the airports.\n  So we just bring that up for a moment of truth in the Senate. I want \nto show you this because there is another headline story in the paper \nabout a one percent cut across the board, or 1.5 percent. They are \nlooking for a way to cut $5 billion. Now we have the House, the Senate, \nthe leadership, the White House, and we are trying to get out of here \nin the next 10 days--if we can only agree on how we are going to find \n$5 billion--either cut $5 billion in spending, or raise $5 billion in \ntaxes, or do whatever we have to do to find a cut across the board. \nThat is $5 billion.\n  Here is what happens. Right now the estimated interest cost is $356 \nbillion. I don't have an updated figure on that. I know since we have \nhad two interest rate increases by Mr. Greenspan this year, it is going \nto be more than that $356 billion. But going back to when we last \nbalanced the budget, we had a surplus under President Johnson. They \ndon't have to go back to Eisenhower when they kept a different set of \nbooks. Under President Johnson, when we were here and we had a surplus, \nthe interest cost on the national debt was only $16 billion. Here, the \ninterest cost on the national debt is $356 billion. If we just held the \nline and paid for what we got, we would have had, and would have this \nmorning, not $5 billion, we would have $340 billion to increase the \nairports, to increase Medicare, to save Social Security, to increase \ndefense. We could have a tax cut and we could pay down the debt if we \nhad the $340 billion.\n  The headline ought to read: Last year we increased taxes. Why? We \nincreased the interest costs because we increased the debt. When you \nincrease the debt some $127 billion, you increase your interest costs, \nwhich are running right now at a billion dollars a day. You have to pay \nit. Worse than the regular taxes, such as sales taxes, for which you \ncan get a school, or gasoline tax, for which you can get a highway--we \nget absolutely nothing for it.\n  Last year, this Government increased taxes, and they are determined \nto increase taxes today, this year, in the next two weeks--all the time \ntalking about surpluses and about cutting spending, and all the time \ntalking about cutting taxes.\n  Now, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13351-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13351-S13363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the very \nimportant trade package that the Senate is currently considering. At a \ntime when our global marketplace is expanding faster than ever, we need \nto ensure that the poorest countries around the world are not left \nbehind.\n  This comprehensive package uses trade to promote economic self-\nsufficiency, at the same time allowing for broader access to American \ngoods and services to these markets. While many believe the economic \nand financial answer for these underdeveloped countries may lie in \ndirect financial assistance, I believe the answer is found by \nfacilitating direct private investment.\n  I want to share with colleagues the plight of one of these countries \nwhich I experienced firsthand this past weekend. I spent 2 days in \nHaiti meeting with political, business, and humanitarian groups.\n  By far, the most dramatic portion of my trip was witnessing the \nextreme poverty and despair that grips that Nation. I saw the face of \nan economy suffering from 17-percent inflation and unemployment of \nbetween 60 and 80 percent.\n  Let me tell the story of one little boy I met. Only through a \nhumanitarian organization and through the support of private donations \nis this 9-year-old boy able to obtain an education. As a tool to \neconomic and democratic stabilization, aid is simply not enough. Many \nchildren just aren't able to stay in school. They are required to work \nin order to contribute to their families' survival.\n  Again, I make the point that for a good number of the people in \nHaiti, their per capita income is around $50 a year. A straight \ncalculation of the per capita income is about $500. But if you look at \nthe makeup of that distribution, you can see easily that there are \nliterally millions of people in Haiti who live with a per capita income \nof around $50.\n  If these children are to have a future, revitalization and expansion \nof economic opportunities are needed to reach the goal of economic \nself-sufficiency. By creating a framework for using trade and \ninvestment as a development tool, the United States will be fostering \nreform at the economic base of these countries, taking direct aim at \nlowering unemployment and high inflation rates.\n  This legislation creates this framework by extending enhanced trade \nbenefits to the countries of the Caribbean Basin. Since the passage of \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. imports from Caribbean \ncountries have been at a distinct disadvantage. The measure would build \non the existing Caribbean Basin Initiative program, often referred to \nas CBI, by providing additional trade benefits to Caribbean countries \nsimilar to that which Mexico and Canada currently enjoy.\n  Since its inception, CBI has had a significant positive economic \nimpact on both the United States and the Caribbean countries, helping \nto promote regional security and stability of our Caribbean neighbors. \nOpening this market even further, particularly following the recent \ndevastation inflicted by hurricanes, will help to stimulate job growth \nby increasing exports and expanding market access to these countries \nfor U.S. businesses.\n  Another important component of this trade package establishes U.S. \nsupport for economic self-reliance in sub-Saharan Africa. The United \nStates stands to benefit a great deal from a strong and prosperous \nAfrica. By fostering growth-oriented economic policies, we will help \nsupport broader access to African markets for American goods and \nservices. Sub-Saharan Africa makes up a market of more than 700 million \npeople and is potentially one of the largest markets in the world. As \neconomic reforms and market-opening measures spur growth in Africa, it \nwill create new and bigger markets for U.S. exporters.\n  A particularly sensitive, albeit important, provision included in \nboth the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin \nTrade Enhancement Act deals with textiles. The textile and apparel \nindustries have historically provided the first step toward \nindustrialization in many countries. This is because production is \nfairly simple, can be done on a small scale, and often uses locally \nabundant raw material.\n  In seeking to address the concerns raised by the U.S. textile \nindustry, this legislation has sought compromise by restricting \npreferential treatment to apparel produced by U.S. fabric and yarns.\n  Additionally, this legislation provides strong protections against \nillegal transshipment of goods through Africa\n\n[[Page S13352]]\n\nor eligible CBI countries. We need to ensure that these countries do \nnot become stop-over points for products from countries not eligible \nfor preferential treatment under the legislation.\n  International trade has been an important part of the growth we have \nenjoyed in the United States. Since 1994, international trade has \ncreated more than 11 million American jobs, and accounts for 30 percent \nof our Nation's gross domestic product. Imports have helped to hold \ndown inflation, lower the cost of production, provide greater choice to \nconsumers, and have given incentives to raise productivity.\n\n  As emerging markets seek to grow, it is important that the United \nStates take the lead in offering these countries incentives to continue \ntheir economic reforms. By doing so, we will be providing the citizens \nof these emerging countries with more jobs, more opportunities and \ngenuine hope. I believe a strong trade relationship is the best form of \n``foreign assistance'' we can offer another country.\n  I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to address some of the statements \nmade about the process unfolding, allegations that the majority leader \nhas tied up the process.\n  The truth is, we have strong bipartisan support for this legislation. \nThe majority leader has tried to protect the 80 or 90 Senators who \nsupport the bill to make sure we focus on the merits of the bill and \nnot on extraneous issues that are calculated to block progress.\n  My friend and Finance Committee colleague, Senator Conrad, indicated, \nfor example, he wants to raise some amendments on agriculture \nnegotiating objectives and trade adjustment assistance, and these \namendments are relevant and should be debated. They could be, if our \nfriends on both sides reach agreement to work together to table \nnontrade amendments. That is what we should be about.\n  Let's work together on this and begin to focus on our efforts on the \nbill. Let's not concede the debate to the opponents because of their \nprocedural tactics. Let's focus on getting this bill acted upon, which \nis good for America as well as the CBI.\n  Time is running out. I think it is critically important that we bring \nabout a process where we can move forward on this most critical piece \nof legislation. What concerns me is it is time sensitive.\n  For example, GSP has already expired. That not only works against the \ninterests of the Third World developing countries we are trying to \nhelp, but it works against the best interests of American companies \nthat depend on this source of supply for their material.\n  Yesterday, the distinguished ranking minority leader of the Senate \nFinance Committee made a very eloquent statement about the importance \nof trade adjustment to the workers who are dependent upon it. Let me \nemphasize, these are American workers--about 200,000.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 200,000 this year, up from 150,000 last \nyear. This is not a diminishing program. As trade grows, this number \ngrows.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask the distinguished Senator what will happen if we do \nnot act on this legislation with respect to these American workers?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We will have broken our word to them, that by accepting \nopen trade policies in the aftermath of which there would be \ndislocations, the economy at large and the society would make \narrangements for them to transfer to other work with other skills. \nThere is no reason to think that won't happen, but without assistance \nit won't, and we will have broken our word which we gave 37 years ago. \nPresident after President after President has reaffirmed this, as the \nSenator has in this bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me say to my distinguished friend, many years ago when \nthe legendary Russell Long was chairman of our committee, the TAA was \nabout to expire and no one was trying to save it. The chairman was \nabout to rap the gavel to move on to other things. I said: Just a \nminute, sir. We have a commitment.\n  That is exactly what the Senator is claiming now. I am proud and \npleased to say the legislation was continued.\n  It is a matter of significant concern to thousands of American \nworkers and their families who are depending upon it. The purpose of \nthis program, of course, is to enable these workers to be trained for \nnew jobs, for new opportunities. We have an economy where there are, \nindeed, many jobs available. It behooves all to work to expedite action \non this important piece of legislation.\n  The other point I want to underscore and emphasize, and it has been \naddressed eloquently by the distinguished Senator from New York, who \nbrings so much historical background into this picture, if we don't act \non this legislation, it is a denial of liberal trade policies of the \npast how many years--35 years?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, I go back to Cordell Hull and the Reciprocal Trade \nAgreements Act of 1934 which put in place the present system. As the \nSenator knows--I know our friend from South Carolina doesn't agree--the \nSmoot-Hawley tariff was a catastrophe. We have not had a tariff bill on \nthe Senate floor since.\n  We now are in a difficult situation with every President, Republican \nor Democrat, reaffirming. A legitimate point is made that President \nClinton didn't send up a request for fast-track authority in 1995; it \nhas been delayed and we haven't gotten it. If we haven't gotten the \nCBI, which President Reagan promised, if we haven't gotten the African \nagreements, we haven't gotten trade adjustment assistance, what do we \ntake to Seattle for the conference of the World Trade Organization?\n  We go as if we had thought there never should have been such an \norganization and didn't want it around. Why is it meeting in the United \nStates?\n  Ten years ago one would not have imagined this moment.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is absolutely correct.\n  The distinguished Senator raises a most important point, going back \nto the need for action being taken now. The meeting of the WTO to be \nheld in Seattle is an extraordinarily important event. It can bring \nabout some very significant progress for this changing world where we \nare increasingly involved in a global economy.\n\n  It is incomprehensible that on this legislation, which has broad \nbipartisan support on both sides of the aisle, and has the support of \nthe President of the United States, no action will be taken, thus \ngiving the wrong signal to our friends, allies, and trading partners \naround the world as to our seriousness about moving ahead on trade \npolicy. It looks as if we cannot take action.\n  Regarding fast track--and I appreciate the support Senator Moynihan \nhas given in committee--we have certainly tried to push fast track. We \nbelieved it was critically important this President, as every other \nPresident, have that authority. Unfortunately, it never happened.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The floor not being exactly teeming with Senators \nwishing to join, Mr. President, this is the point: We are at a critical \nmoment; where is the Senate?\n  In the absence of the Senate, let me offer some statistics about the \ncentrality of trade. The crash of 1929 is part of American myth, \ntradition, history. One does not know much about American history if \none does not know about that. In the aftermath, in 1930--the crash of \n1929 came in October--our GDP dropped 9 percent. That is a pretty hefty \ndrop, but stock markets go up and then they go down. When they are up, \nthere are bargains made by selling; when they are down, there are \nbargains made by buying. It tends to be cyclical and does not \nnecessarily change that much in the real world. I say again, in 1930, \nGDP dropped 9 percent; in 1931, it dropped another 6.4 percent. Again, \nthat is a drop, but it is leveling off.\n  It was before we understood the business cycle very well, before \njust-in-time delivery, before countercyclical financing. The American \nworld had never heard of John Maynard Keynes. There was learning going \non, but it hadn't gotten to us. The Federal Reserve Board responded to \nthe crash by tightening credit. They would never do that today, and \nthey know why; they will show why in numbers.\n  Then came the impact of Smoot-Hawley in 1932 and the gross domestic \nproduct dropped another staggering\n\n[[Page S13353]]\n\n13.3 percent. That is when it really hit. At the same time the British \nhad created the idea of free trade by long argumentation, good \nargument--reeling from Smoot-Hawley, went onto Empire Preference. They \ndrew in and they would deal with Canada and India and New Zealand but \nnot with Europe, not with Germany. Recall it was the Economist \nmagazine, which I understand now has a larger circulation in the United \nStates than it does in Britain but comparably the same readership, was \nfounded to advocate free trade as an economic principle that worked. It \ndid work. Great theorists such as Albert Imlah demonstrated that in the \naftermath.\n\n  The Japanese, having the market here closed to them, they went to a \nGreater Far Eastern Coprosperity Sphere, which is a long way of saying \na Japanese empire; and they invaded Manchuria, which is another way of \nsaying China, and they began that process which ended in Hiroshima.\n  In 1933, the same 1933 the year after GDP here dropped 13.3 percent, \nunemployment was so high and social stability so weakened that a \nfrightened German middle class elected Adolph Hitler to be Chancellor. \nHe was chosen in the Reichstag. The rest is history.\n  I joined the Navy in 1943, at age 17, and a lot of other people \naround here did. Maybe not enough people around here did. They don't \nremember.\n  Mr. ROTH. I was one of them, I might say.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. You joined on, yes, sir. It was our generation.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is right.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is what we were there for, to fight wars that \nneedn't have happened had the world been wiser. Not just about trade, \nof course not, but don't underestimate trade. We are not just talking \nabout profits.\n  Mr. ROTH. Could I ask a question of the distinguished professor? We \nare enjoying, today, one of the greatest periods of prosperity, 8, 9 \nyears or so, this country has undergone. Unemployment is lower than \nanyone would ever have predicted a few years ago. The future of this \ncountry is bright. It was only about 10 years ago everybody was \npredicting the United States was going down the drain and Japan was \nbecoming No. 1. But the contrary has happened. In this period of time, \nwe have enjoyed the liberal trade practices that began many, many years \nago--what was the year?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. In 1934.\n  Mr. ROTH. In 1934. How can you explain the prosperity of this \ncountry, which has the most open markets of any, if not put it on the \nbasis that a liberal trade policy does work? Unfortunately, there are \nsome industries and some workers who do suffer. That is the reason we \nhave TAA, to help them make the adjustment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Right.\n  Mr. ROTH. But overall, our country has never had a longer period of \ngrowth and prosperity than we are enjoying and have enjoyed. It has \nbeen enjoyed under two Presidents.\n  Isn't it ironic we are here debating whether or not we should extend \nthese policies that have worked so well to a few countries that are in \nneed of some support and help? It will not only work in their \ninterests, but again it will work in our interest, as I think the \nSenator pointed out, starting with the growers of cotton, people who \nmake the fabrics, the apparel, the wholesalers, the retailers, and the \nconsumers. It seems to me it is almost unbelievable anyone would argue \nto the contrary, that we should not continue on this path of a liberal \ntrade policy.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. Chairman, we have now reached the point where you \nand I are alone on the Senate floor as one of the epic decisions of \nthis decade is about to be made. One asks Senators who might be \nlistening: Where are you?\n  But the answer to your question, sir, is our learning has truly \nexpanded. We know more about this. I mentioned 1933. In that year, John \nMaynard Keynes published a book in the United States called ``Essays In \nPersuasion.'' It appeared the previous year in Britain. He already had \na pretty good record. He wrote that great essay, ``The Economic \nConsequences of the Peace''--of Versailles. He was on the British \ndelegation as an adviser, and he said: It is going to be awful. Germany \nis not going to get over this.\n\n  That is a very famous essay--and it is sort of a joke. Winston \nChurchill became Chancellor of the Exchequer around 1926 and went back, \ntook Britain back on the gold standard. He wrote an essay called ``The \nEconomic Consequences Of Mr. Churchill,'' which he thought were pretty \ngrim. And they were.\n  But, in 1933, in this book, ``Essays In Persuasion,'' he had an \nintroduction. It is really essays over the years. He said: The economic \nproblem is just a giant muddle. He said: We will figure it out. We will \nget through it. He said: I estimate by about the year 2030, we will \nhave it pretty well under control and we can go on to other issues in \nlife.\n  The Senator mentioned the existing expansion, the period of \nexpansion. In February of the coming year, that will be in about 4 \nmonths, we will completed a period of sustained growth of 107 months, \nthe longest in history--unless we start killing it, which is what we \nseem intent on doing. Of course there are dislocations brought about by \ntrade. Joseph Schumpeter--had it not been for the Great Depression it \nis generally thought Schumpeter would be regarded as the greatest \neconomist of the 20th century. He is an Austrian, ended up a professor \nat Harvard. In his book ``Capitalism, Socialism & Democracy,'' he \nspeaks a phrase now in wide use, of the ``creative destruction of \ncapitalism.'' Sure, there comes a time when shipping the cotton to \nmills in New England no longer makes sense. They want to have mills in \nSouth Carolina. ``Bring the mills to the cotton,'' as the phrase was. \nIt did make sense. The next thing you know you had empty mills all up \nand down the river in Lowell, MA, and, I might say, in Gloversville, \nNY, and such like.\n  Yes, but did that put an end to life in Massachusetts? No. The next \nthing you know, Route 128 is creating enormous economic growth spurred \non by computer companies. That destruction is creative because it \nbrings better uses of resources into play. You get more than you had. \nTrying to keep just what you had is a formula for ruin--well, not for \nruin, but for stagnation. I speak with some temerity. I was once our \nAmbassador to India, and I saw it happen. Tariffs you could not get \nthrough, government purchasing. The Soviet Union----\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Soviet Union, sir, what was that? Oh, yes, that was \nthe place that was going to take over the world.\n  I remember a meeting in Bucharest of world trade advocates at the \ntime. It was an international conference about the developing world. \nThe Soviet delegate absolutely swept the conference with an \nannouncement that, as of this moment, as a gesture of solidarity with \nour friends in Africa, in Latin America, in Southeast Asia, the Soviet \nUnion is abolishing all tariffs of imports from those countries.\n  The conference went wild, but no one stopped to think: But, wait a \nminute, the Soviet Union doesn't have tariffs. Everything is bought by \nthe government and put through collective enterprises, all of which \nwere in ruins and eventually collapsed. This was 20 years before the \nwhole system imploded.\n  We are talking for democracy, talking for vitality, talking for \nexpansion, talking for a tradition. As Jerry Ford said yesterday in the \nRotunda, he came to Congress as a social moderate, a fiscal \nconservative, and a determined internationalist. He was right. Can it \nbe we have forgotten all that?\n  I say, again, before I yield the floor, at a critical moment in our \neconomic history--a critical moment--we are hours away from ruinous \nindecision. There are three Senators on the floor. It happens we are \nall friends, perhaps have gotten to be more friends because we have \nbeen on the floor together for 2 days now. It is hard to understand.\n  Mr. ROTH. Can I make one further observation and get the Senator's \nreaction to it? The irony of what is before us is, if we enact this \nlegislation, it will help the very industries about which we are \nconcerned.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sure.\n  Mr. ROTH. It is, as we have said before, a win-win situation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It gives them a different mix of costs and profits, and \nthat turns out to make them viable again.\n  Mr. ROTH. I point out it is projected by the industry itself that \nadoption of this legislation will create in the next\n\n[[Page S13354]]\n\n5 years approximately 121,000 jobs, that it will result in markets \nexceeding roughly $8.8 billion. The purpose of this legislation is not \nonly to enable the textile industry, for example, to compete better at \nhome but also to be in a better position to compete abroad in other \nmarkets. If we do nothing, as has happened in the past, we see, for \nexample, the Chinese exports increasing.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Right.\n  Mr. ROTH. What we are trying to do is make us more competitive in the \nindustry so that it not only helps the economy but, most important, \ncreates jobs within the industry.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the chairman is doing this for the \nAmerican worker. If you think otherwise, think back to opposite \npolicies and what they brought the American worker in the 1930s. Don't \nthink we cannot make those mistakes again. We knew enough not to do it \nthen. We did not know exactly why. But 1,000 economists wrote President \nHoover, who was a sensitive and an intelligent man. Nothing quite like \nthat happened before; nowadays we get 1,000 a day. They said: Don't \nsign that tariff bill, Smoot-Hawley. Don't sign it, they said. Well, he \ndid. It cost him the Presidency, but that is the least of it. I thank \nthe Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday, I began making some comments in \nanswer to critics of the proposed legislation, and I want to take a few \nminutes to continue to answer those negative comments.\n  One of the questions that has been asked is: Won't this legislation \nresult in the further erosion of America's manufacturing sector?\n  None of my colleagues who have risen in opposition to this bill have \naddressed its specifics. The reason is that, unlike the House-passed \nAfrica bill, the Finance Committee measures are drafted in a way that \nensures a benefit to the American industry as well as our African, \nCaribbean, and Central American trading partners.\n  I made passing reference just now to the specifics and how it would \nimpact on the industry and the American worker. What my colleagues who \noppose the bill have done is raise several general arguments against \ntrade that I thought might still be helpful to address.\n  One of the arguments that falls in that category is the argument that \ntrade has led to an irreversible decline in U.S. manufacturing, and \nthat any trade measure, even this one, would simply worsen that \ndecline. Let me take that head on.\n  America is not losing its manufacturing sector. By any measure, it is \ndoing a lot better than some of my distinguished colleagues seem to \nthink. There is no question that manufacturing has declined as a \npercentage of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing, as a portion of GDP, has \ndeclined steadily since 1960, from 27 percent of GDP to 17 percent of \nGDP by 1996. But does that mean the United States is losing in the \ninternational arena? The answer is no.\n  According to the International Trade Commission, all industrial \ncountries have faced a similar percentage decrease in manufacturing as \na share of GDP from about 28 percent in 1970 to about 18 percent in \n1994.\n  Does the decline in manufacturing as a percentage of GDP mean that \nAmerican industry is in decline and output is falling?\n  Again, the answer is no. In fact, America's industrial output \nexpanded 62 percent for the period from 1977 through 1996. Let me \nrepeat. The fact is, America's industrial output expanded 62 percent \nfrom 1977 through 1996, a period that critics of our trade policy think \nof as the worst stages of our industrial decline.\n  American manufacturing added a net figure of 4.4 million new jobs \nduring that same period, or an increase of 31 percent in employment in \nthe manufacturing sector.\n  These are very important statistics, I believe. It bears out what the \ndistinguished Senator from New York was just pointing out.\n  Are we being beaten in this measure of international competition? \nAgain, the answer is no. According to a most recent edition of the \nEconomist, which I think is one of the best periodicals available \ntoday, American industrial production is up by 35 percent over 1990.\n  During that same period, Japanese industrial growth fell by 5 \npercent. What a contrast. Ours grew by 35 percent; Japan's fell by 5 \npercent. This was the world where our country was going to be down and \nJapan was going to take over.\n  Industrial output in Germany has remained a sluggish 4 percent over \nthe same 10 years, while French and British industrial production grew \nby only 8 and 9 percent, respectively.\n  Is there employment available for those workers who have lost their \njobs due to an increase in productivity? As Senator Moynihan and I were \ncommenting earlier, the answer is yes. We have never seen such low \nunemployment as this country is enjoying today.\n  The American economy currently enjoys the lowest unemployment in \nhistory and rising wages across the board, even for the unskilled who \nhave dropped out of school rather than finishing their education.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would my friend allow me to make a comment in the form \nof a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Please proceed.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. In terms of how we are progressing and what we are \nlearning, the Senator mentioned we have the lowest unemployment rates \nin 30 years, and for the longest time we also have had the lowest \ninflation rates.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Twenty years ago, statistics proved that was not \npossible. There were something called the ``Phillips Curve'' that said: \nThere is a tradeoff; the lower your unemployment rate goes, the higher \nyour inflation rate goes. And everyone said, oh, God, we can't get the \nunemployment rate down too much because that will spark inflation.\n  If I can just be reminiscent and tell war stories in this crowded \nChamber, where I see we are back to three Members--well, the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois is presiding; and it is an honor to \nhave him in the Chair--in 1963, the Council of Economic Advisers, then \nchaired by Dr. Walter Heller of the Kennedy administration, was putting \ntogether the economic report. This report was created by the Employment \nAct of 1946 which gave us the institutionalized, countercyclical \neconomic notions.\n  They said: We should have a goal; we should set as a goal for the \ncountry an unemployment rate of 4 percent. Now, it won't be easy, but \nwe should be bold.\n  In the Labor Department we were sort of distressed because we had \ndreams of unemployment below 4 percent. So we got them to change the \ntext and make it an interim goal of 4 percent--again, a dream.\n  Sir, we now are routinely close to 4 percent, have been for almost a \nyear. Thirty years ago, it was something you could not imagine. In a \nrousing economic report--if there is such a thing--you could say, let's \ndo things that are unimaginable. Now we do not even notice when they \nare reported every month. It is working. Why put it in jeopardy?\n  Mr. ROTH. I could not agree more with what the Senator just said. I \nthink this is one of the brightest periods in history with respect to \nour country. I think there is enough credit for everyone to claim.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sure.\n  Mr. ROTH. But I think the----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. But, sir, would you allow me? If we let this calamitous \nevent take place of bringing down this trade bill there will be plenty \nof blame to go around, too.\n  Mr. ROTH. I agree with you.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. To go around and around and around.\n  Mr. ROTH. As you and I have pointed out, a majority of the Senators \non both sides of the aisle are supportive of this legislation.\n  I do wish some of those who are supportive would come down and give \ntheir reasons why it is so important that we move ahead with this \nlegislation. It would be a shame if we lost this opportunity to take a \nstep forward. Because, if I might say so, we are not only losing the \nopportunity to act on this legislation, which in and of itself is so \nimportant, but it helps give what I think is the mistaken message to \nthe world that we are no longer interested in liberal trade policy, \nparticularly in view of the fact that we will be going, hopefully, out \nto Seattle in a few weeks to take the next step forward in\n\n[[Page S13355]]\n\nbroadening and liberalizing markets, making them more accessible to \neveryone, which, of course, is particularly in our interest because the \nUnited States has the lowest tariffs, the most open markets. It is \nimportant that we move ahead and begin to negotiate access to other \nmarkets.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I inquire, will you say that again and again and \nagain? The United States has the lowest tariffs of any major economy in \nthe world.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The only outcome of having negotiating power and a \nnegotiating round is to reduce the tariffs of other people.\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And it is in our interest to do it.\n  We have heard talk about the subsidies of the European Union, and so \nforth. You do not get anywhere with subsidies.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is right.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. You get elected 1 year, and so forth. But the economy \ndoesn't.\n  Mr. Chairman, thank God, you are where you are. But where, sir, are \nthe others?\n  I see our distinguished friend is in the Chamber. We have reached a \ncritical mass. There are five Senators in the Chamber--six. Yes, six. \nPerhaps the word is getting around that something of great consequence \nis going to happen today--or not.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. ROTH. Thank you, I say to Senator Moynihan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  I come to the floor today to add my voice in support of this very \nimportant piece of legislation in the hope that, as we continue to talk \nabout the great strengths and characteristics that make this a good \nbill and the importance of continuing this open trade, we can build \nenough support to pass it, to get over whatever procedural hurdles are \npresent.\n  I thank the Senator from New York and the Senator from Delaware for \ntheir bipartisan leadership. With all due respect to the opponents, let \nme make a few points about this African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  When the United States can do something that extends opportunity to \ncountries that need our assistance while at the same time benefiting \nAmerican workers and industry, I believe we should take that step. We \ncan, by voting for this bill, elevate the commercial exchange between \nAfrica, the Caribbean, and Central America--hopefully, if that piece \ncan be added--and the United States. That is what this bill attempts to \ndo.\n  My State, Louisiana, is smart and blessed to have positioned itself \nat the mouth of the Mississippi River. It is how our State began. It is \nhow the city of New Orleans and communities began hundreds of years ago \nand developed into a State.\n  It is impossible to overstate the river's importance to the economy \nof our Nation, but the Mississippi River is more than just a way to \nmove goods within the United States. It is also the primary artery for \nnorth-south trade among the United States, Canada, and developing \ncountries to the south. And therein lies so much potential for them and \nfor us. At this time, much of America's trade flows in an east-to-west \ndirection, between Europe and the east coast or Asia and the west \ncoast. We have all benefited, some to a greater degree than others, and \nthere have most certainly been changes, but we have all benefited from \nthat flow. While Louisiana benefits and participates, it does not make \nuse of Louisiana's national geographic advantage.\n  We will continue to benefit in an even greater way by increasing the \nnorth-south flow. For this reason, when the United States has the \nopportunity to increase trade on the north-south axis, I can be \nconfident we will increase those benefits to our State and the Nation.\n  Although it has come under some criticism, the best example for \nLouisiana is NAFTA. By promoting trade among Mexico, the United States, \nand Canada, NAFTA moves goods along a north-south corridor that \nnaturally produces growth for our State. The results have been quite \ndramatic.\n  In 5 years since NAFTA was enacted, Louisiana's trade with our \npartners has increased 134 percent. Louisiana's exports to Mexico alone \nwere up 34 percent last year. This trade increase supports over 10,000 \njobs in my State and is growing every month. Thus, from the standpoint \nof enlightened self-interest, the majority of people in Louisiana \nsupport the expansion of trade between our other southern trading \npartners in Latin America, the Caribbean, and, yes, Africa.\n  This bill is also about the United States paying more attention, \nserious attention, to a continent we have in many ways ignored. Such an \neffort is too long in coming. Until now, United States policy in Africa \nhas really operated in two modes: benign neglect and cold war \ngamesmanship.\n\n  Our Government poured aid into Africa when it was an active \nbattleground in the ideological struggle of the cold war. We made many \nmistakes in our efforts to be helpful. We supported governments that \npaid only lip service to democratic principles and cared little about \nthe infrastructure necessary for a modern market economy. Much of our \naid was wasted--I am sure some of it went to very good use--and the \nseries of wars and human tragedies have left the American people \nsomewhat jaded about the prospects for real reform in Africa.\n  Our neglect of this continent, with some exceptions, obviously, is \nstarkly pointed out by our trade and investment statistics. Only 1 \npercent of all United States foreign direct investment goes to Africa. \nOf that 1 percent, half of it is in the petroleum sector, which \nobviously we, in Louisiana, know something about. The majority was \nconcentrated in only five countries. That leaves 43 other nations in \nAfrica with virtually no contact with the American system of free \nenterprise.\n  I believe the American people understand this is a continent we \ncannot afford to leave behind and we cannot afford to develop a society \nin this world of haves and have-nots. The stresses that such \ndisparities produce inherently rip at the fabric of our society, cause \nupheaval, and ultimately can, as we have seen on occasion after \noccasion, decade after decade, century after century, turn to severe \nviolence and war.\n  The disparity between the United States and nations such as Tanzania \nor Malawi makes the difference between the rich and poor within our own \ncountry seem laughable. Yet we wonder where rogue nations come from. We \nwonder what prompts them to act in violent and, in our idea, \nirresponsible ways. When people in our country are not vested in the \ndevelopment of our society, when they believe they have nothing at \nstake in the community, crime and violence result. The international \ncommunity is no different.\n  Would the Sudan be a rogue state if it had a serious trade \nrelationship with the United States and Europe? I do not believe so. \nUnfortunately, much of Africa finds itself ignored and divested from \nthe world community. Again, the figures paint a stark picture. For 20 \nyears, the gap between the level of economic development in Africa and \nthe rest of the world has not closed; it has widened. Declining \ncommodity prices cost Africa $50 billion in export earnings. This is \ntwice as much as they received in foreign aid between 1986 and 1990. \nFifty percent of all Africans live below the poverty line; 40 percent \nlive on less than $1 a day. And debt service claims over 80 percent of \nAfrica's foreign exchange earnings.\n  It is no wonder that, given this bleak picture, trade relations with \nAfrica need a jump start, not only for Africa's benefit but for our \nbenefit, for South America, for the Caribbean, and for every State in \nthe Union, particularly those that have the infrastructure to offer for \nnorth-south trade.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act would open up American markets \nto apparel and other goods produced in Africa, but with the right \npercentages and the right mechanisms and methods for much of those \ngoods and services to also have value added here, which would preserve \njobs.\n  As the amazing growth of East Asia has demonstrated, apparel is a \nnatural entry point into manufacturing and a natural source for more \nrobust trading relations with the United States and Africa.\n\n[[Page S13356]]\n\n  The Senate version of this bill ensures the benefits of this \nrelationship will not be one-sided but will be mutual, as only apparel \nutilizing American-produced textiles will receive the GSP benefits. \nThus, a steady two-way traffic can develop between the United States \nand Africa. Such a system of mutually beneficial trade can only enhance \nprospects of further American investment and interest in the African \nmarket, creating jobs both there and here.\n  For my home State of Louisiana, this is a very good deal. My friend \nand colleague in the House of Representatives, Bill Jefferson, has been \none of the principal advocates for this legislation because he \nunderstands the mutual benefit for our State and many States in this \nNation and this continent. Furthermore, as home to one of the most \nsignificant ports in the world, trade in either direction translates \ninto highway jobs for citizens of Louisiana.\n  With regard to the criticisms of some of my colleagues relating to \nthe dangers of labor standards and environmental degradation, I take \nthese critiques and critics very seriously. I, for one, most certainly \ndon't want to be a part of any trade relationship that does not promote \ngood and progressive environmental policies and labor policies. The \nonly long-term answer to both of these problems is economic growth. No \ncountry will address labor relations when 50 percent of its people live \nin poverty. No country can protect its environment when people are \nstruggling to be kept alive. Poaching, deforestation, slash-and-burn \nagriculture, these are all the results of too little trade, too little \ninvestment, and too little exchange with more developed countries.\n  This is not to say we should abandon American standards and \nprinciple--to the contrary--but, rather, we should look at what has \nhappened in Southeast Asia. As those economies have grown, so have \nwages and so has concern for the environment. Engagement is required \nbecause the status quo is even less likely to produce the kind of \nenvironmental goals we want to achieve and to address the rights of \nworkers everywhere.\n  I am saddened to know that despite the importance of the African \nGrowth and Opportunities Act, it is unlikely to receive a vote on final \npassage. The vast majority of this Senate, I believe, want this bill \nenacted. I understand that we are late in the year and procedural \ndifficulties could absorb the little time we have remaining. However, I \nmust say that when it comes to the question of world leadership, the \nSenate should make time for these kinds of discussions. The Senate \nfloor has seen many items debated that have not enjoyed the broad-based \nsupport this legislation does. So I remain hopeful our differences can \nbe worked out because this and other trade bills and provisions are so \nimportant to help us maintain the upward mobility we are experiencing \nin America, the tremendous growth of opportunities in jobs and wage \nimprovements that can only help if these agreements are done in the \nright way in countries around the world and particularly throughout the \nSouthern Hemisphere.\n  I just want to end briefly with a statement about the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative portion of this bill. I had the opportunity to visit Central \nAmerica in the wake of the hurricane in Honduras and Nicaragua. They \nwere devastated, set back over a decade or two, according to some \nanalysts who spoke about the devastation that hurricane wrought. It was \na terrible time for it to hit, just when they were coming into a \ndemocracy and when the economies were expanding. When I visited--as \nmany Republicans and Democrats did--with the Presidents of these \nnations, yes, they asked for us to help repair their highways, and they \nasked for our military to engage, particularly our Reserves, which we \nwere proud to send down to help them dig out and rebuild. The one thing \nthey asked for more than anything was the Caribbean Basin Trade \nInitiative so that they could work themselves up, so that they could \nhelp produce new jobs, not only in the Caribbean, not only in South \nAmerica and Central America, but here in the United States of America.\n  So let us learn from the past. Let us look confidently toward the \nfuture. Let us not cower back because the rules may be different and \nbecause globalization is upon us. Let us be brave and go forward, \nrecognizing that global trade brings wealth and opportunity, and not \nonly more to our Nation, but it is the only thing that is going to help \nclose the tremendous gap of wealth in this world, which, if we don't \nclose, will produce nothing but unrest, violence, and war in the \nfuture.\n  So for all those reasons--primarily for economic development but also \nfor world peace--let us be about the business of trade. That is what \ntoday is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the critics of an open and forward-looking \ntrade policy would prefer to avoid a debate about the actual facts \nregarding the United States economy. Let me give you some examples.\n  According to the International Trade Commission, from 1970 to 1997, \nthe percentage of U.S. GDP involved in international trade more than \ndoubled--from 11 percent of GDP to 25 percent of GDP. If the opponents \nof this bill were right in their criticism of U.S. trade policy, the \nUnited States should be facing a precipitous economic decline. In fact, \nthe United States' GDP roughly quadrupled over the same time period \nfrom $2 trillion to $8.2 trillion.\n  If the opponents of this bill were correct in their criticisms of our \ntrade policy, we should have seen a dramatic rise in unemployment along \nwith the predicted decline in output. In fact, from 1970 to 1997, the \nAmerican economy produced a net increase of 33.5 million jobs.\n  To put that in context, the American economy produced more than three \ntimes the number of new jobs than the entire G-7 industrial countries \ncombined. Rather than facing the double-digit unemployment that Germany \nfaces, U.S. unemployment stood near 4 percent.\n  The opponents of this bill often finger our trade policy as the \nculprit in a decline in real wages from 1978 to 1997, because trade as \na percentage of our economy doubled while real wages fell. In fact, \nwhile wages fell, the overall benefits of the entire package of \ncompensation and benefits offered to workers actually increased by 2 \npercent.\n  That is not to deny that there is a growing gap between the pay of \nour highest paid workers and our lowest. There is little doubt that \nthis gap has grown.\n  But, we owe it our to ask three basic questions? First, is the gap, \nin and of itself, a problem if everyone is better off? Second, is the \ngap attributable to trade as the critics complain? Third, is slowing \nthe pace of trade liberalization, or, worse yet, the imposition of \nactual restraints on trade, the right policy to remedy the inequality \nin wages?\n  As to the first point, the growing gap in wages is not necessarily a \nproblem if everyone is better off at the end of the day. As noted \nabove, while wages fell at the low end, the overall package of benefits \nincreased over the past two decades. Furthermore, real wages are once \nagain on the rise, including at the low end.\n  But, even if wages were, in fact, stagnant, trade would help. Trade \nmakes a broader range of higher quality goods and services available to \nall wage earners in the economy. In other words, trade helps ensure \nthat even the lowest paid sectors of the economy can get higher value \nfor their dollars than would be the case without the competition trade \nbrings.\n  As for the second question, whether trade is the culprit in wages in \nequality, the answer is that trade has some impact, but not as much as \nthe disparity in income between different levels of education.\n  Education also gives you the tools to remain flexible as the \nconditions of your current employment changes or as employment changes \ngenerally. That is why the economy pays a premium to those who made the \nsacrifices it takes to succeed in getting a high school education, a \ncollege education, and post-graduate education as well.\n\n[[Page S13357]]\n\n  Our economy rewards academic achievement. There is no doubt about \nthat. But, should we change that? Should we eliminate any incentive to \nachieve a higher education as a way of eliminating the wage gap? Few \npeople would suggest that that is an appropriate response.\n  But, that really focuses our attention on the third question--whether \nslowing the process of trade liberalization or imposing trade \nrestraints is the right answer to address the wage gap. The answer is \nno!\n  Imposing restraints on trade would, at best, be an indirect, \ninefficient, costly, fourth-best option. If the disparity in wages \nrelates to academic achievement, trade restraints will not address the \nproblem, much less solve it.\n  Indeed, if the problem is one of encouraging improvements in our \neducational system and encouraging our youth to remain in school, \nimposing restraints on trade is simply self-defeating. Trade restraints \nwill do nothing to improve educational standards or improve school \nattendance or achievement. It will simply impose higher costs on \nconsumers.\n  And, on whose shoulders will those higher costs fall? Those higher \ncosts will fall disproportionately on the lowest economic sectors in \nour society. In other words, the burden of trade restraints will fall \non precisely on those groups that the critics of trade purport to want \nto help because of what they perceive as an inequitable gap in wages.\n  Why is that so? The reason is that trade restraints like tariffs and \nquotas are hugely regressive. Our highest tariffs fall on staples such \nas food and clothing.\n  That is an inconvenient fact that the critics of trade would prefer \nnot to publicize. What that means is that those workers that now \nreceive relatively lower wages would pay the cost for any increase in \ntrade restraints, which would exacerbate the inequality between the \nhigh and low end of the pay scale, rather than reduce it.\n  If we actually want to do something about wage inequality, we should \navoid using the gap in wages from the high end to the low end as an \nexcuse to provide protection for certain industries in this country and \nimpose higher costs on consumers. Rather, we should be concentrating on \nimproving our primary, secondary, and post-secondary education.\n  That is but one of the appropriate responses to the rising wage gap. \nBut I understand the arguments that you can't take a former textile \nworker and retrain him to be a computer programmer.\n  That is why we should also pursue policies that will increase the \namount of capital flowing within and into the United States.\n  This helps those at the bottom in two ways. If the amount of capital \nincreases relative to labor, it will demand more labor to fully employ \nitself and appreciate in value.\n  It also raises the productivity of those at the bottom, making them \nmore valuable, and they will be rewarded for such productivity \naccordingly. This can summed up succinctly by one question--which high-\nschool level worker gets paid the most to dig a hole, the one who uses \na spoon, a shovel, or an excavator? The answer is obvious, and the \ndifference between the three is not education, but the capital that \nthey employ to produce.\n  Ultimately, all economic growth is the result of risk-taking on new \nideas that increase our productivity--thereby increasing our standard \nof living. When we lower the government barriers to risking capital, \nlike we did in the Taxpayer Relief of 1997, which included a large cut \nin the capital gains tax, the creation of the Roth IRA, and cuts in the \nestate tax, capital becomes more abundant, fueling the real wage \nincreases, stock market increases, and economic growth we have seen in \nrecent years.\n  The stability of the dollar in the past two decades, as opposed to \nthe turmoil of the 1970's, has also greatly contributed to capital \nformation, not only because the tax on capital is unindexed for \ninflation, but also because currency instability increases the risk \nassociated with all economic activity.\n  When we lower these barriers and risks, those with capital will risk \nit on those without capital, but who possess a surplus of time, energy, \ntalent, or ideas.\n  These ideas, anything from a better mousetrap to the personal \ncomputer, allow us to produce more out of less--raising living \nstandards of all sectors of the wage base.\n  These are the most direct responses to the rising wage gap, and also \nthe most efficient, least costly, and potentially successful answer to \nwage and income inequality. Calling for an end to trade liberalization \nwill not help. Nor will opposing this bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a little difficult to have \ncoherence with respect to this debate. I had hoped we would avoid \ngetting back to Smoot-Hawley and even Hitler. I know Pat Buchanan--one \nof the enthusiasts for competitive trade--and I think he is right on \ntrade. Unfortunately, he has suggested in his recent book we ought to \nbe more considerate of Hitler. A notion that is pure nonsense.\n  On this issue, the Senator from New York cited Smoot-Hawley, the \nDepression, and Hitler. If you listen to the gentleman and are not \nfully aware of all the facts, one would think this is a bill to avoid a \ndepression and avoid ``Hitlerism'' or some other possibility.\n  With respect to Smoot-Hawley, we had a good debate some 15 or more \nyears ago. I will never forget it. The late Senator from Pennsylvania, \nJohn Heinz, and myself had to correct that record. We got the Don \nBedell Associates study of Smoot-Hawley.\n  The crash occurred in October of 1929. That is when we all went \nbroke. That could easily happen with what is going on right now, if \nsome of the signs we are reading on the horizon come to bear. Not being \nan alarmist and being a realist, let's look at Smoot-Hawley.\n  First, it occurred some 8 months after the October 29 crash, in June \nof 1930. It did not cause the crash, Hitler, the Depression, or any of \nthe other disasters of the thirties. On the contrary, it did not affect \ntrade to any extent. The tariffs in question affected only one-third of \nour trade; two-thirds were unaffected--causing no impact whatsoever \nwith respect to trade.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, continuing with respect to the amount of \ntrade affected, it was just at a third or a little less. Trade itself \nwas somewhere around 1.5 percent. There was some argument about it \nbeing 3 percent of the GNP. Now it is 25 percent.\n  I am trying to give a comparison so you get a feel of the exact \nimpact upon the economy.\n  The tariffs in question affected only $231 million worth of products \nin the second half of 1930--less than 1 percent of the world trade. So \nit did not have any real effect on world trade.\n  In 1930 to 1932, duty-free imports into the United States dropped at \nvirtually the same percentage as dutiable imports.\n  So what you do is you look at the effect of Smoot-Hawley, and look \nhow unaffected free trade really was mostly due to the worldwide \ndepression. But namely, talking about cause and effect, we are both \ndiscussing the effect, but not the cause; because the cause was not \nSmoot-Hawley.\n  When taken into account, Smoot-Hawley only affected a fraction of the \ntrade. Only 33 percent of the $1.5 billion of U.S. imports was in the \ndutiable category. The entire impact of Smoot-Hawley has to be focused \non the $1.5 billion number which was barely 1.5 percent of our GNP.\n  I have a better authority than any, I think, with respect to Smoot-\nHawley. Paul Krugman, in ``The Age of Diminished Expectations,''--I \nfinally found\n\n[[Page S13358]]\n\nhis quote--and I am quoting from page 64:\n\n       Although protectionism is usually a bad thing, it is worth \n     pointing out that it isn't as bad as all that. Protectionism \n     does not cost our economy jobs any more than the trade \n     deficit does: U.S. employment is essentially determined by \n     supply, not demand. The claim that protectionism caused the \n     depression is nonsense; the claim that future protectionism \n     will lead to a repeat performance is equally nonsensical.\n\n  Mr. President, there you are. Any time they get in trouble and they \ndo not have the facts with them, then they go off and try to get you \ninto a miasma of history and how we have had bad times, and now we have \ngood times--the best of times--and how we are going to create all of \nthese jobs. The group that says it is going to create jobs is the same \ngroup mentioned in 1993 in Capital City's Media Women's Daily, where \nthe article from November 16 states:\n\n       That was the battle cry Monday by directors of the American \n     Textile Manufacturers Institute, who in a last-ditch effort \n     to solidify congressional support for NAFTA, pledged not to \n     move any jobs to Mexico in the pact as passed. The ATMI \n     Board, made up of firms representing every facet of the \n     textile industry, voted in favor of the resolution which said \n     their companies would not move jobs, plants, or facilities \n     from the United States to Mexico as a result of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  What are the facts? Dan River is about to build an integrated apparel \nfabrics manufacturing plant in Mexico. Tarrant Apparel purchased a \ndenim mill in Puebla, Mexico; DuPont and Alpek are going to build a \nplant in Altimira, Mexico and form a joint venture with Teijin; \nGuilford and Cone Mills are to create a Mexican industrial park known \nas ``textile city''; Burlington Industries is going to build a new \nMexican plant to produce wool products.\n  I hear about the 127,000 jobs that the industry says it is going to \ncreate. I heard that NAFTA was going to create 200,000 jobs.\n  I know categorically from the Department of Labor that we have lost \n420,000 textile jobs since NAFTA was introduced. We have lost exactly \n31,700 jobs in South Carolina alone. You only have to turn to the \narticles by Kurt Salmon Associates--and I quote from August of this \nyear:\n\n       More textile mills are funneling plants and investment into \n     Mexico to be closer to the cut-and-sew apparel factories that \n     have already migrated south of the border, according to a new \n     analysis. A flood of low-priced fabric and fiber imports from \n     Asia has pressured domestic manufacturers to respond by \n     seeking ways to cut their own costs.\n\n  The Kurt Salmon Associates report continues:\n\n       Since NAFTA's passage in 1994, Georgia has lost 28,000, \n     plus two textile--30,000 apparel and textile jobs.\n\n  So we have lost 31,700 jobs. They have lost 30,000. That makes, as \nyou go over through the other States and the other communities, some \n420,000 in just textile jobs alone.\n  Rather than a balance of trade that they are talking about--a win-win \nsituation, that the industry is for this, everybody is for it. We heard \nthat cry before, too. It was going to create a positive balance of \ntrade. We were at $5 billion at the time we passed NAFTA, a $5 billion-\nplus balance of trade. Now we have a negative $17 billion balance of \ntrade with Mexico.\n  So the proof of the pudding is in the eating. As I said before, there \nis no education in the second kick of a mule. This NAFTA proposition \nthat they are trying to spread to the CBI and the sub-Sahara at the \nsame time, it reminds me of an insurance policy contest that they had \nfor a company down in South Carolina years back. The winning slogan for \nthe particular company was: The Capital Life will surely pay, if the \nsmall print on the back don't take it away.\n  Here we extend this to the CBI and then to the sub-Sahara; or to the \nsub-Sahara and then to CBI--either way. I think it is really going to \nthe CBI; and it is going to be kept there and then taken away from the \nsub-Sahara. They are not going to invest all the way over into Africa \nwhen they all just pell-mell are going down there hand over fist to \ncome into the Caribbean production.\n\n  I was just referring to Mr. Farley and Fruit of the Loom and how they \nhave already eliminated 17,000 jobs in the Presiding Officer's State of \nKentucky. They eliminated another 7,000 jobs in Louisiana. They have \nmoved to the Cayman Islands. So they are foreign companies. It is \ngetting to be where we have to sort of sober up and understand what the \nreal facts are.\n  Trade, reciprocity--that is exactly what he called it--reciprocal \ntrade policy of Cordell Hull back in the 1930s. We had reciprocity. We \nhad a modicum of it even in NAFTA, even though it didn't work. But we \nhad the side agreements on the environment. We had the side agreements \nfor labor. We had reciprocity. We go down the list, and we find out now \nwe are going to do away with all of the particular tariffs with respect \nto the United States for the CBI, sub-Sahara.\n  Let's see what the CBI--Dominican Republic has a 43-percent tariff; \nEl Salvador--some of these include VAT, a value added tax--El Salvador, \n37.5 percent; Honduras, 35 percent--this is all on textiles--Guatemala, \n40 percent; Costa Rica, 39 percent; Haiti, 29 percent; Jamaica, 40 \npercent; Nicaragua, 35 percent; Trinidad and Tobago, 40 percent--the \nUnited States is already giving it the store. We have already lowered \nours to 10 percent. There is a 5-year phaseout. We have had a 10-year \nphaseout of the Multifiber Arrangement. Now we are going into the fifth \nor sixth year, so we only have another 5 years. And the real impacts, \nthe heavy reductions on the good traded articles--we do trade some in \ntextiles--is going right on out of the window. So, yes, you have some \nfabric boys calling us and saying: Wait a minute, Senator, we are for \nthis bill. That is shortsighted. It is just like all the apparel jobs--\nabout gone.\n  What is happening, as Kurt Salmon Associates says, they want to \nlocate the fabric plants near where the sewing is and where the apparel \nis. It is just an economy of production, an increase in productivity. \nSo they are moving down there more and more. So the fabric boys are \ncalling on the phone. Give them another 5 years, I can tell you here \nand now; they will be gone.\n  I know this: Any good businessman in textiles looking at this \nsituation says, with 5 years--wait a minute--to put in this new \nmachinery, this new spindle or otherwise--says: I can't get my money \nback in 5 years. It is going to take me 9 to 10 years to get my money \nback. I just don't buy it. I don't get productivity. And then the \npoliticians will run around on the floor of the National Government \nhollering: They have to be more productive; they have to be more \nproductive. And who has cut off the productivity? We have.\n  What about tariffs in Africa? Central African Republic, 30 percent; \nCameroon, 30 percent; Chad, 30 percent; Congo, 30 percent; Ethiopia, 80 \npercent; Gabon, 30 percent; Ghana, 25 percent; Kenya, 80 percent; \nMauritius, 88 percent; Nigeria, 55 percent; Tanzania, 40 percent; \nZimbabwe, 200 percent. There they are.\n  What is really going to happen, from practical experience, is \ntransshipments. Let me say a word about the transshipment problem. I \nwill never forget. It was 1984; this Senator got 500 additional customs \nagents into the Treasury-Post Office appropriations bill, and they \ndidn't hire them. We kept on pleading, and by the end of the 1980s, we \nfinally got President Bush, and he put on some extra ones. But we \nhaven't gotten any extra ones since that time.\n  We go to the customs agents, and they say yes, it is still at least 5 \nbillion in transshipments, but they say: Senator, you want us to stop \nT-shirts or drugs? And you look them in the face and say: Well, of \ncourse you have to stop the drugs. They say: That is all we have got.\n  Now they are talking all over the Halls in both Chambers of a 1\\1/2\\ \npercent cut. And now we have just been educated by CBO that 1\\1/2\\ \nwon't work, it will take at least 5.8 percent. And then if you don't, \nif you are going to exclude, say, defense and others, emergency ones, \nit is going to take an 11.8-percent across-the-board cut. So they are \ndebating over on the House side right now is this so-called cut bill. \nBut what they are debating is a cut in customs agents and a cut in \nenforcement.\n\n  Our African friends, I know they changed their vote with respect to \nhuman rights in the United Nations some 4 years ago or 5 years ago. We \nhad passed a resolution in the general assembly, and we will set up the \nhearings. We never have had the hearings.\n  Our Chinese friends went down into Africa. They have made all kinds \nof\n\n[[Page S13359]]\n\nfriends there over the years. I will never forget over 25 years ago \nwhen I was in Zaire, it was the Chinese building the railroad from the \nhinterland out to the coast, down the Congo. They have had all kinds of \ncontacts down there with Nelson Mandela and many others. They will get \ntheir plants and transshipments, and they will be coming through \nAfrica. And our folks will be working still at customs looking for \ndrugs coming up from Colombia and South America and little inspecting \nwill done concerning transshipments in the area of African trade.\n  In reality, you are really fattening the competition in the Pacific \nrim all under the auspices and the gist of free trade. Let's say we are \ngoing to allow our textile boys to compete with the Pacific rim \nindustries. That is why I put in that book.\n  Do we have the book of all the fabric manufacturers? I don't want to \nput the entire book in, but we included just those entities that had \ninvested already down in Mexico--referring, of course, to Davidson's \nTextile Blue Book. You can see here the fabric resource list. We will \ninclude all of these pages--not the book, but pages 345 through--well, \njust the fabric--well, we can include the yarns, too, natural fibers; \nthey have yarn forward on 807, 809.\n  That is too much to include in the Congressional Record. Just on the \nfabrics, not just the yarns forward, would be 11 pages.\n  As I related on yesterday, all you need do is go from southern \nCalifornia into Tijuana, and you can see that you think you are going \ninto Mexico, but it looks as if you are going into Seoul, Korea. There \nis nothing but Korean plants all over it. I have been there. I have \ntraveled to other parts of Mexico. I think we ought to say a word, \nthough, with respect to the wonderful economy we have. Do we have that \narticle?\n  I was talking earlier about the economy and the devastating effect \nthis would have on the economic strength, the security, of the United \nStates upon a three-legged stool: One leg of values as a nation is \nunquestioned; the second leg, that of military and the only superpower \nleft; the third leg of the economics has been fractured. They used the \n17-percent figure, but the most recent figure I had of workforce and \nmanufacturing had gone from 26 percent 10 years ago down to 13 percent. \nWhat happens is, since we are not saving here, I had the article where \nwe are actually consuming more than our increase in productivity. If \nyou can find that in here--I am not sure that is the same article I was \nlooking at. It was three weeks ago in Newsweek where they pointed that \nout. Last week, Mort Zuckerman, in U.S. News and World Report, talked \nabout the two levels of society and the split we have there.\n\n  We see signs on the horizon now of trouble. We are not pessimists, \nand we are not necessarily optimists; we are realists. As I pointed out \nearlier, the deficit at the end of last month for the fiscal year 1999 \nwas $127 billion. It is not a surplus--not as they reported in a \nWashington Post story that was added earlier today to the Record--that \nsaid for the first time since the Eisenhower days we had back-to-back \nsurpluses. That is absolutely false. It is a $127 billion deficit, \naccording to Treasury figures. They could be interpolated by the CBO \nabout funds carried forward. And it says there might be about $16 \nbillion.\n  When my distinguished friend from New Mexico put this balanced budget \nlaw through in 1997, I said: If the budget is balanced under your act, \nI will jump off the Capitol dome. We knew it would not be. We know now \nit isn't. When you are still spending $100 billion more than you take \nin and you are increasing your deficit from last year, as we are going \nto do already this year, we just go pell-mell down the road. Your \ninterest debt increases, your interest cost increases, and so your \nspending increases. And they want to give all kinds of tax cuts and \nspending.\n  I know I am on pretty solid ground. So when the President said--I \nwish I had that article of yesterday from the Washington Post. It was \non page 3 or 4. I want to give some credibility to what I am saying. It \nis difficult when you are the only one saying there is a deficit. The \nnewspapers say surplus, the President says surplus, the majority leader \nsays surplus, the minority leader says surplus, the Democrats say \nsurplus, the Republicans say surplus; and you come along and say there \nis a deficit. You have to have support for what you are doing. So I put \nin this sheet of paper earlier with respect to the Treasury figures. I \nam glad to put it in again, if I can find a copy of it. I will ask the \nstaff to get a copy of that sheet from the Treasury Department we were \ninserting into the Record so we can see exactly--I am not just saying \nit is a deficit, it is the Treasury Department saying it is a deficit. \nSo we will find that.\n  Right here in this morning's paper it says we are not spending more \nmoney than we are taking in. It is as usual. As Tennessee Ernie said, \n``another day older and deeper in debt.''\n  Can we get Thursday's Washington Post, which is easily had, and the \nsheet of paper from the Treasury Department? I know they made a copy. \nHere it is. ``Hill Negotiators Agree to Delay Part of NIH Research \nBudget.'' The subheadline is ``The government has recorded its first \nback-to-back surpluses since 1956-57.''\n  Mr. President, this says:\n\n       Meanwhile, figures out yesterday showed that the federal \n     government ran a surplus of $122.7 billion in fiscal 1999 . . \n     . the first time the government has recorded back-to-back \n     surpluses since the Eisenhower administration in 1956-57.\n\n  Absolutely false. There isn't any question about it.\n  I will retain this floor. I know others like to talk about different \nsubjects, but I have had a difficult time this morning trying to get a \nword in edgewise about this particular trade bill.\n  If we find the Treasury sheet that was issued yesterday, it is a \nwhole report--I didn't want to put the entire report in the Record, but \nif we can find that sheet, we will include it. It is page 20.\n  I have my hand on another copy right here. This is page 20 of the \nDepartment of the Treasury report, table 6: ``Means of financing the \ndeficit or disposition of surplus by the U.S. Government, September \n1999, and other periods.''\n  Then you will see the account balances column, current fiscal year of \ntotal Federal securities. In other words, how much did we have to \nborrow? We have the figure here at the beginning of the year; it is \n$5,478,704,000,000. Then you look at the close of the fiscal year, and \nit is $5,606,486,000,000--a deficit, not a surplus, of $127.8 billion. \nThat is as of yesterday. But if you read the headline in the paper, \nthey have ``back-to-back surpluses,'' and we have another deficit in \nexcess of over $100 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 28, 1999]\n\n      Hill Negotiators Agree to Delay Part of NIH Research Budget\n\n                            (By Eric Pianin)\n\n       House and Senate negotiators yesterday agreed to delay a \n     big chunk of the research budget of the National Institutes \n     of Health, as they struggled to find new ways to hold down \n     costs and stay within tight spending limits.\n       With concerns rising over their plan to cut programs across \n     the board, Republicans leaders are once again turning to \n     creative accounting tactics to make sure their spending bills \n     are lean enough to avoid tapping into Social Security payroll \n     taxes.\n       The last of the 13 spending bills to be considered by \n     Congress, a giant $313 billion measure funding labor, health \n     and human service programs, would provide the NIH with $17.9 \n     billion for fiscal 2000, a 15 percent increase that exceeds \n     the administration request by $2 billion.\n       But the bill, which will be considered by the full Congress \n     today, would require the NIH to wait until the final days of \n     the fiscal year in September to use $7.5 billion of that \n     money. The tactic is aimed at limiting the actual amount of \n     money that the government will spend at NIH in the current \n     fiscal year; the plan would essentially roll over $2 billion \n     of spending to next year.\n       The Clinton administration warned that the move would \n     seriously hamper research efforts and impose significant \n     administrative burdens on NIH, and congressional Democrats \n     complained that it was yet another step eroding GOP \n     credibility on budget matters.\n       But Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens \n     (R-Alaska) said Congress was justified in its use of \n     accounting ``devices'' to cope with emergencies and pressing \n     budget priorities that exceeded what Congress had previously \n     set aside to spend this year.\n       The various devices are crucial to the GOP's campaign to \n     pass all 13 spending bills\n\n[[Page S13360]]\n\n     for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 without appearing to \n     dip into surplus revenue generated by Social Security taxes. \n     GOP leaders last night put the finishing touches on an \n     unwieldy package that includes both the labor-health-\n     education bill, the District of Columbia spending bill and \n     proposal for a roughly 1 percent across-the-board spending \n     cut.\n       Democrats maintain the ``mindless'' across-the-board cuts \n     would ``devastate'' some agencies, hurt programs for mothers \n     and children, and trigger large layoffs in the armed \n     services. But House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) said \n     accusations the cuts would hurt defense were ``nothing but \n     hogwash.'' He said the criticism was coming from ``the same \n     officials who have sat by idly as the president has hollowed \n     out the armed forces.''\n       President Clinton has vowed to veto the huge package, as he \n     has three other bills, and there is no way the two sides can \n     reach agreement before a midnight Friday deadline. With \n     neither side willing to provoke a government shutdown, the \n     administration and Congress will agree on a third, short-term \n     continuing resolution to keep all the agencies afloat while \n     they continue negotiations.\n       While the Republicans and the White House are relatively \n     close in negotiating overall spending levels, there are \n     serious differences over how to spend money to reduce \n     class sizes, hire additional police officers and meet a \n     financial obligation to the United Nations, as well as \n     disputes over environmental provisions in the bills.\n       Meanwhile, figures out yesterday showed that the federal \n     government ran a surplus of $122.7 billion in fiscal 1999 \n     (which ended Sept. 30), the first time the government has \n     recorded back-to-back surpluses since the Eisenhower \n     administration in 1956-57.\n       The 1999 surplus was almost double the 1998 surplus of \n     $69.2 billion, which was the first since 1969. While the 1999 \n     surplus was the largest in the nation's history in strict \n     dollar terms, it was the biggest since 1951 when measured as \n     a percentage of the economy, a gauge that tends to factor out \n     the effects of inflation.\n       All of the surplus came from the excess payroll taxes being \n     collected to provide for Social Security benefits in the next \n     century. Contrary to an earlier estimate by the Congressional \n     Budget Office, the non-Social Security side of the federal \n     government ran a deficit of $1 billion, money that was made \n     up from the Social Security surplus.\n       The drafting of the labor-health-education spending measure \n     dominated the action behind the scenes on Capitol Hill \n     yesterday. The House has been unable to pass its own version, \n     so House and Senate negotiators worked out a final compromise \n     in conference.\n       The $313 billion compromise exceeds last year's spending by \n     $11.3 billion and includes more money for education, Pell \n     Grants for college students, NIH, federal impact aid for \n     local communities, the Ryan White AIDS research program and \n     community services block grants than the administration had \n     requested.\n       While the bill provides $1.2 billion for class size \n     reduction, the Republicans insist local school districts be \n     given the option for using the money for other purposes while \n     the White House would mandate the money for hiring additional \n     teachers.\n       Republicans also were claiming $877 million in savings by \n     using a computer database of newly hired workers to track \n     down people who defaulted on student loans. The nonpartisan \n     CBC said the idea would only save $130 million, but \n     Republicans are using a more generous estimate used by \n     Clinton's White House budget office.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, having gotten the record made, the point \nis that it is not as easy as my distinguished colleagues from New York \nand Delaware, the leaders on this particular measure, have painted it. \nWhen you see that you are running deficits now of $127 billion, when \nyou see that the trade deficit is widening, when you see that, \naccording to an article, we were consuming faster than we were \nproducing, then you can see trouble on the horizon.\n  I refer to this morning's Financial Times, page 4: ``Widening Trade \nGap Raises Fear For Dollar.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Widening Trade Gap Raises Fears For Dollar\n\n                         (By Christopher Swann)\n\n       Fears of a slide in the US dollar have haunted global \n     currency markets for several months now. The dollar was \n     granted a reprieve last week following better than expected \n     August trade figures. But many observers believe it is only a \n     matter of time before the dollar succumbs to mounting trade \n     imbalances.\n       As the US current account deficit has increased, concerns \n     have intensified that international appetite for dollar \n     assets will soon be exhausted, leaving the US unable to fund \n     its trade shortfall with the rest of the globe and \n     precipitating a sharp drop in the currency. That could \n     imperil the US economy's run of rapid non-inflationary \n     growth.\n       However, some economists point out that the high level of \n     long-term foreign direct investment should spend the dollar \n     from the threat posed by the current account deficit, \n     expected to reach $320bn in 1999.\n       Optimists argue that the growing importance of foreign \n     direct investment, as US companies become the target of \n     foreign takeovers, means much of the capital now flowing into \n     the US may be relatively slow to leave.\n       Foreign direct investment (FDI), into the US is booming, \n     with BP's take-over of Amoco, Daimler's take-over of Chrysler \n     and Vodafone's takeover of AirTouch the most high profile \n     examples.\n       New inflows of FDI reached $60.5bn in 1998, a record sum \n     which covered about a third of the US current account \n     deficit. And this year, net FDI has already eclipsed last \n     year's figure, with $83.5bn pouring into the US in the second \n     quarter alone. In the fourth quarter of 1998 and the \n     second quarter of 1999, net FDI flows were stronger than \n     shorter-term portfolio inflows and indeed exceeded the \n     entire current account deficit. The long-term nature of \n     these flows reduces the prospect of a sudden balance of \n     payments crisis, says Ian Morris, US economist for HSBC in \n     New York.\n       ``If a current account problem develops there is a \n     breathing space for the authorities to correct the imbalances \n     rather than have financial markets force it on them in an \n     abrupt and possibly catastrophic manner,'' he argues.\n       The big question for the dollar is whether this surge in \n     foreign direct investment can be maintained.\n       Paul Meggyesi, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Bank \n     in London, thinks it can. The deep-seated structural \n     advantages enjoyed by the US in areas such as technology and \n     labour market regulation, he argues, should ensure that FDI \n     continues at a healthy rate.\n       ``This is particularly true in the technology field, with \n     the US accounting for 74 of the top 100 information \n     technology companies, compared to only 5 per cent in Europe. \n     It would not be surprising if European companies try to close \n     the gap by taking over or merging with US businesses,'' he \n     says.\n       But the bare facts are alarming. The current account \n     deficit, expanding at about 50 per cent a year over the past \n     two years, is now at its highest level since at least the end \n     of the civil war as a proportion of GDP. And the family \n     silver can only be sold once. Few believe that the US economy \n     can rely indefinitely on the sale of assets to cover the \n     current account shortfall.\n       Mr. Morris calculates that funding the expected $375bn \n     deficit in 1999 from FDI alone would mean selling the \n     equivalent of Intel, the third largest company in the \n     Standard and Poors 500 index.\n       And if present trends continue until 2001, assets equal in \n     value to Microsoft, the largest company in the US, would have \n     to be sold to cover the deficit.\n       In reality, over the medium term FDI is unlikely to be \n     anywhere near 100 percent of the current account shortfall, \n     leaving much to come from more fickle portfolio flows. \n     ``While the high proportion of long-term capital flows \n     provides some comfort for the dollar, it is likely to prove \n     inadequate,'' argues Avinash Persaud, head of global research \n     at State Street.\n       When US shares offered an unrivalled 20 percent annual \n     returns it seemed the US would have no trouble attracting \n     sufficient portfolio inflows. With US share prices falling \n     and returns picking up in the economies of Japan, the euro-\n     zone and the UK, competition for international capital is \n     becoming more intense.\n       ``The safe haven portfolio flows which entered the US \n     during the global crisis at the end of 1998 now have other \n     alternative homes. It will prove much more difficult for the \n     US to finance its deficit in 1999 than it was in 1998,'' says \n     Mr. Persaud.\n       Most agree that this will cause the dollar to grind lower, \n     removing one of the main ingredients in the US's high rate of \n     non-inflationary growth. Higher interest rates and weaker \n     stocks may well be the consequence.\n       Some analysts believe that the dollar's 16 percent fall \n     against the yen since this year's peak in May merely marks \n     the start of a period of general weakness in the US currency.\n       But the dollar has so far proved relatively resilient \n     against other currencies and may well keep the market on \n     tenterhooks for some time yet.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there it says:\n\n       A slide on the U.S. dollar has haunted global currency \n     markets for several months now.\n\n  It says:\n\n       The dollar was granted a reprieve last week following \n     better-than-expected August trade figures. But many observers \n     believe it is only a matter of time before the dollar \n     succumbs to mounting trade imbalances.\n\n  It is going up over $300 billion.\n\n       As the U.S. current account deficit has increased, concerns \n     have testified that international appetite for dollar assets \n     will soon be exhausted, leaving the U.S. unable to fund its \n     trade shortfall with the rest of the globe and precipitating \n     a sharp drop in the currency. That could imperil the U.S. \n     economy's run of rapid inflationary growth.\n\n  It goes on to say how we have had foreign direct investment with, of\n\n[[Page S13361]]\n\ncourse, the BP takeover of Amoco, Daimler-Mercedes takeover of \nChrysler, and Vodafone's takeover of AirTouch.\n  It says:\n\n       The big question for the dollar is whether this surge in \n     foreign, direct investment can be maintained.\n       But the bare facts are alarming. The current account \n     deficit, expanding at over 50 percent a year over the past \n     two years, is now at its highest level since at least the end \n     of the Civil War as a proportion of GDP. And the family \n     silver can only be sold once. Few believe that the U.S. \n     economy can rely indefinitely on the sale of assets to cover \n     the current account shortfall.\n\n  Some analysts believe that the dollar's 16 percent fall against the \nyen since this year's peak in May merely marks the start of a period of \ngeneral weakness in the U.S. currency.\n  What are we doing about this? We are taking away the productivity. It \nis not an increase in jobs. It isn't any increase at all. They are \nrunning and spending it fast in the fabric plants. But forget about the \npeople working by the sweat of their brow in the apparel industry--such \nas the mother trying to keep food on the table and get her children \nthrough college.\n  We will pass all kinds of protections for high tech companies. We \neven repealed the State tort laws for something that can't happen until \nthe first of next year. They want to do away with the immigration laws \nfor high tech companies--the estate taxes, the capital gains tax, and \neverything else of that kind. They have all kinds of benefits. I even \nsaw an article about creating a subsidy for boat manufacturers, so we \ncan get more pleasure yachts.\n  We have to increase the productivity. We are losing the industrial \nbackbone of the United States of America.\n  What we are hearing is that this Senator and others do not understand \nthat the high-tech community is the engine of this wonderful \nglobalization, the engine of this economic giant, the United States of \nAmerica. Not so at all.\n  There is a book called ``In Praise of Hard Industries'' by Eamonn \nFingleton. We don't put the book, of course, in the Record.\n\n       But surely the United States has scored some real successes \n     in high-tech manufacturing in the 1990s? Yes--but far fewer \n     than even most experts realize. Perhaps the strongest \n     remaining American high-tech manufacturer is Boeing. But even \n     Boeing is doing less well than it used to. Quite apart from \n     facing increasing competition from the European Airbus \n     consortium, Boeing has been under considerable pressure from \n     foreign governments to transfer jobs abroad, and it has duly \n     done so. As William Greider has pointed out in his book One \n     World, Ready or Not, 30 percent of the components used in \n     Boeing's 777 jet are made abroad. By comparison in the 1960s, \n     Boeing imported only 2 percent of its components. Thus, \n     Boeing, like other erstwhile world-beating American \n     manufacturers, is rapidly becoming a ``virtual corporation'' \n     ever more dependent on suppliers in Japan and elsewhere \n     abroad for its most advanced manufacturing needs.\n\n  I divert for a minute to say that was the trouble we had in the gulf \nwar. We had to get panel displays from Japan in order to get the \nweapons in order to fight that war. We weren't making them anymore. \nEvery time I put a ``buy America'' provision into the defense bill--I \nserve on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--I get no, you are a \nfruitcake. That is what Mike Kelly calls those who are trying to \nprotect trade.\n  Now I hear this morning that I am going to start a depression and \neverything else of that kind. You can't talk sense on this particular \nsubject. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating.\n  Let me quote again.\n\n       Meanwhile, despite all the talk of a renaissance in the \n     American semiconductor industry, there is acturally only one \n     truly strong American semiconductor manufacturer left: Intel. \n     Moreover. Intel's success says little if anything about its \n     manufacturing prowess. In fact, the company's twenty-four-\n     fold growth in the fifteen years to 1997 has been driven not \n     by any fundamental efficiency edge in production engineering \n     but rather by the company's near-monopolistic franchise in \n     producing microprocessors for the dominant ``Wintel'' \n     standard in personal computers.\n       In any case, Intel is just one company--and judged by the \n     all-important criterion of jobs, not a particularly large \n     one. At last count it employed sixty-seven thousand people \n     worldwide--little more than one-sixth of IBM's peak workforce \n     in the mid-1980s before its domination of the computer \n     industry collapsed under pressure from the rising Wintel \n     standard. Moreover, Intel is not as advanced as it appears. \n     In fact, its Wintel chips are based on an aging technology \n     known as CISC (complex instruction set computing). In the \n     last decade, CISC has been superseded by a technology called \n     RISC (reduced instruction set computing). RISC chips, which \n     are noted for their use in such high-performance computers as \n     Sun Microsystems' network servers, are made mainly in Japan.\n       Intel apart, there are few other semiconductor \n     manufacturers left in the United States. This may seem \n     surprising in view of the fact that, according to such \n     prophets of America's purported industrial renaissance as \n     Jerry Jasinowski, the United States has now recovered strong \n     leadership in semiconductors. He has reported that American \n     semiconductor makers boosted their global market share from \n     40 percent in 1988 to 44 percent in 1993, and this supposedly \n     has put the United States back in the ``top spot'' in the \n     industry. After the big decline in America's share in the \n     first half of the 1980s, all this seems like convincing \n     evidence of a comeback. But the truth is that his 44 percent \n     figure is bogus. It is based on highly misleading statistical \n     procedures that categorize most chips outsourced by American \n     companies from factories in East Asia and elsewhere as \n     ``American''! The only justification for this bizarre \n     statistical treatment is that most such chips are made to \n     American designs and bear American brand names. But that \n     hardly means they are made in America. Even Dataquest, an \n     information-industry consulting firm that is the ultimate \n     source of data on world semiconductor production, compiles \n     its statistics on this basis.\n       Given the prevalence of such misleading statistics, how do \n     we gauge the true state of American competitiveness? Again, \n     there is no substitute for international trade figures. These \n     indicate that the United States ran a deficit of more than $3 \n     billion with Japan alone in semiconductors in 1997. Given \n     Japan's higher wage levels, therefore, it is clear that the \n     idea that the United States has recovered world leadership in \n     semiconductors is just another myth.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to yield in a minute so other colleagues can \naddress the Senate. But I will come back because what you have is a \nsituation where that sandwich board they put up with all of these \nindustries, they are all for the American worker. No; they are all for \nmoney, profit. That is all that those companies are for.\n  Let me quote page 32.\n\n       Since American labor is not represented in American \n     boardrooms, the real losers from technological globalism have \n     no say in the matter. Moreover, workers' interests count for \n     so little these days that American corporate executives \n     openly proclaim their commitment to utopian globalism without \n     the slightest fear of embarrassment. The pattern was \n     memorably exemplified a few years ago by a Colgate-Palmolive \n     executive who told the New York Times: ``The United States \n     does not have an automatic call on our resources. There is no \n     mindset that puts this country first.'' A similarly outspoken \n     disregard for the interests of American labor was apparent in \n     a remark by NCR's president, Gilbert Williamson, some years \n     ago when he said: ``I was asked the other day about the \n     United States' competitiveness, and I replied that I don't \n     think about it at all. We at NCR think of ourselves as a \n     globally competitive company that happens to be incorporated \n     in the United States.''\n\n  That is the situation with Farley and Fruit of the Loom, exactly what \nwas brought in issue fortuitously by Time magazine when they put in the \narticle ``The Fruit of Its Labor--The Politics of Underwear.'' Fruit of \nthe Loom eliminated 17,000 jobs in Kentucky, 7,000 in Louisiana, moved \nto the Cayman Islands and I should put them on one of those sandwich \nboards. Whoopee, they are for this bill so that they can make more \nmoney.\n  Who is looking at the welfare of the American worker? Who is looking \nat the industrial strength of the United States? Who is looking at the \neconomic progress and security of the United States of America?\n  One could not be for this particular bill if one knew how it has been \ndrawn up. It does not even compare with NAFTA. We cannot put an \namendment up because the tree is filled. They put in what you might \ncall fast track, no amendments, and then they give their friends the \nfruit of the tree. Senator Wellstone, the Democrat, comes in with an \nagricultural amendment that is not to be allowed. But take the Senator \nfrom Missouri. When he comes with a particular amendment on \nagriculture, the leader comes down and finds that is relevant. We stop \nthe whole process and pluck the amendment from the tree and put in your \nfriend's amendment and they call that ``procedure'' in the world's most \ndeliberative body. It is the most undemocratic procedure, \nunparliamentary kind of procedure that could possibly be contemplated. \nThey ought to be embarrassed handling a measure this way.\n  However, there is no embarrassment with this group. They know they \ncan pass this bill easily because they can\n\n[[Page S13362]]\n\nbreeze through the committee and everybody on the floor saying mollify, \nunite. It used to be the ILGWU working the floor. I have been in it too \nlong; I understand the competition.\n  As a southern Governor, I don't blame the foreigners for saying we \ngive this benefit and give that benefit. That is exactly what we did in \nSouth Carolina. The Senator from Delaware says they can get new jobs by \nlearning new skills. We do that in South Carolina. We have brought in \nHoffman-LaRouche and BMW. They told me the only reason they have come \nis because of the technical training system I instituted 30 years ago. \nI know about skills, training, getting new jobs and new industry. But \nwe have had a net loss, in the last 4 years since NAFTA, of 12,000 jobs \nin South Carolina.\n  In the campaign last year in the Governor's race, they were talking \nabout new jobs. I said: Add and subtract. You are not announcing those \nthat are leaving and going down to Mexico. We had United Technologies, \nthe textile plants and others take off down to Mexico. We saw it \nstarting then and it is mushrooming now.\n  We are being derided on the floor talking about Smoot-Hawley and \nputting up the bankers' sandwich board and saying: This is for the good \nof America.\n  We are going to have to discuss this a little bit longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this morning Senator Conrad offered an \namendment which I cosponsor. I ask my colleagues to consider voting for \nthis amendment that will make the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \navailable for farmers as well as industrial workers.\n  This program, trade assistance, is being reauthorized in this \nlegislation. This amendment would expand it just a little bit.\n\n  President Clinton, about a month ago in an address spoke about one-\nthird of the jobs that have been created during his administration have \ncome as a result of opening foreign trade and all the economic activity \nthat takes place because of foreign trade.\n  If we can have millions of jobs created during this administration \nbecause we have had a 50-year history of breaking down trade barriers \nbetween countries, we have to conclude that the liberalization of trade \nis good for American workers and good for our economy.\n  Free trade has produced many winners in our economy. This has been \ntrue since 1947 when the United States and just 22 other countries \ncreated the regime for liberalized trade we have been under since 1947 \ncalled the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n  Since 1987, we have had eight series--sometimes they are called \nrounds--of multilateral trade negotiations to break down these \nbarriers. These multilateral trade negotiations have liberalized trade \nin many sectors. Tens of thousands of tariffs have been scrapped. Many \nnontariff trade barriers have been eliminated. Others have been sharply \nreduced.\n  The result of 50 years of trade liberalization has meant the creation \nof enormous wealth and prosperity and, as I have said, millions of new \njobs, one-third of the new jobs created just in this decade. But \nwhenever you have a free market economy, probably even when you have a \nregimented economy, as the socialist countries have had, there is \nalways some adjustment in the economy. There are some winners and some \nlosers; that is true in our economy, and it is true in the foreign \ntrade part of our economy.\n  For this reason, more than 35 years ago President Kennedy and the \n87th Congress thought it was only fair to transfer some of the net gain \nfrom free trade to injured workers or firms or industries or even \nentire communities. The first U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nwas designed by President Kennedy and authorized by the Trade Expansion \nAct of 1962 to help workers dislocated as a result of a Federal policy \nto reduce barriers to foreign trade.\n  It is very important for the purposes of our amendment and also the \nspirit of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act to hear what President \nKennedy, its author, had to say about its intent and scope:\n\n       I am recommending as an essential part of the new trade \n     program that companies, farmers, and workers who suffer \n     damage from increased foreign import competition be assisted \n     in their efforts to adjust to that competition. When \n     considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid \n     higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not \n     be required to bear the brunt of the impact. Rather, the \n     burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  What President Kennedy said was so important, and I emphasize, once \nagain, a small part of it:\n\n       Trade adjustment assistance should be available for \n     companies, farmers, and workers.\n\n  In spite of President Kennedy's belief that farmers should be able to \nget relief from trade adjustment assistance, just like others who \nsuffer from trade-related job losses, the reality is, few, if any, \nindividual family farmers are ever able to qualify for this program. \nHence the amendment by Senator Conrad and myself that is offered today \nto address this inequity.\n\n  Senator Conrad and I think it is only fair that not only farmers be \nincluded but fishermen be added to this group as well. They are \nworkers, they help put food on our tables, and they have the same \nproblems under the current program as farmers.\n  Our program will create a limited new trade adjustment assistance for \nfarmers program. It will provide cash assistance to farmers and \nfishermen when the price of a commodity falls sharply as a result of \nimports and causes a farm's net income to drop. The formula ensures \nfarmers will recover a portion, but not all, of the income lost due to \nimport competition.\n  This is not an open-ended program. Assistance is capped at $10,000 \nper farmer and a total of $100 million per year, and, of course, as \nmust be under the Budget Act, this Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nis paid for. In order to qualify for this limited Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program, farmers will have to consult with the USDA's \nExtension Service to develop a plan for adjusting to the import \ncompetition.\n  In about 5 weeks, the United States will launch a new round of global \ntrade talks with 133 other WTO--World Trade Organization--member \ncountries. That is an extension of the organization that started out \nwith 22 countries in 1947 for this regime of liberalizing trade. In 5 \nweeks, these talks start.\n  Farmers have always been among the strongest supporters of free trade \nbecause so much of what they produce is sold in overseas markets. In \nfact, there is an absolute necessity of selling overseas because, even \nin normal production, we produce a third more than can be domestically \nconsumed. Profitability and farming must come by selling the surplus \noverseas.\n  The income our farm families earn in these foreign markets sustains \nour economy and contributes greatly to our national well-being. Farm \nsupport for free trade cannot and should not be taken for granted by \nthe rest of the people in this country who benefit from free trade.\n  We are in the worst farm crisis since the Depression of the thirties. \nLow commodity prices are not caused exclusively by import competition, \nand I do not mean to imply that. In fact, it is just the opposite. It \nis caused because a lot of our markets overseas have been hurt by the \nfinancial crisis that started 2 1/2 years ago in the Far East. But, of \ncourse, in our complex economy, even in our complex agricultural \neconomy, trade might be a contributing factor to these historically low \nprices.\n  Through trade adjustment assistance, we look after Americans who are \nharmed by import competition but not farmers. Through trade adjustment \nassistance, we have looked after communities harmed by import \ncompetition but not farm communities. Between 1979 and 1996, 12 trade \nadjustment assistance centers in the United States assisted about 6,130 \nfirms with petitions for trade adjustment assistance. During this same \n17-year period, these centers assisted only 200 food growers and \nprocessors, 200 firms in 17 years that were nonindustrial. But these \nfirms were not individual family farms. I am concerned that if we lose \nfarm support for free trade, it will be very hard, and perhaps \nimpossible, to win congressional approval for new trade deals when \nthese negotiations conclude among these 133 countries.\n\n[[Page S13363]]\n\n  Fairness, equity, common sense, and, most importantly, the original \nintent of President Kennedy's program, all tell us that farmers and \nfishermen should and must be a part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram.\n  So as Senator Conrad did this morning, I strongly urge my colleagues \nto support this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13363-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13363-S13365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ACROSS-THE-BOARD SPENDING CUTS: IRRESPONSIBLE BUDGETING\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are almost a month into the new fiscal \nyear and Congress still has not passed an appropriations bill for the \nDepartments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services. The \nwork of these Departments touches the lives of nearly every American, \nyet the Republican leadership has been unable to work out an acceptable \nbudget for them which will enable them to carry out their \nresponsibilities fully and effectively.\n  The majority has used an extraordinary array of gimmicks, such as \nbogus emergency spending designations, and an unprecedented level of \nadvance fundings. But even those budgetary slights of hand were \ninsufficient to do the job.\n  They considered reneging on Congress' commitment to provide TANF \nmoneys to the States but backed off under pressure from the Republican \nGovernors.\n  They proposed increasing taxes on the working poor by changing the \nreimbursement rules for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Even the leading \nRepublican Presidential candidate denounced that as ``balancing the \nbudget on the backs of the poor.'' Again, the Republican leadership was \nforced to retreat from an outrageous proposal. The fact that these cuts \nwere even considered shows how out of control the budget process is.\n  In desperation, the Republicans have now proposed that we \nindiscriminately cut all Government programs by 1 percent across the \nboard. In other words, they would treat essential health and education \nprograms no differently than special interest pork barrel projects. \nThey ignore the reality that some of the programs are far more \nimportant than others. This type of mindless cut is an admission of \ntotal budgetary failure.\n  They pretend such a cut will not have any impact on the programs, but \nthey are terribly wrong. The human cost of such an across-the-board cut \nwould be very high. It would hurt many of our most vulnerable people:\n  Some 5,000 fewer preschoolers in Head Start;\n  2,800 fewer children in the child care programs;\n  74,000 fewer babies receiving nutritional supplements;\n  2,775,000 fewer meals brought to the elderly and disabled;\n  120,000 fewer disadvantaged students helped;\n  6,000 fewer job opportunities for youth;\n  10,000 fewer work-study grants for college students;\n  10,000 fewer children helped to read;\n  3,000 fewer children immunized;\n  20,000 fewer homes for low-income families.\n  Each one of these is an unacceptable price to pay for the \nRepublicans' inability to produce a fair and fiscally sound budget.\n  That was with a 1% cut. Now CBO has made available to us a letter \nthat was sent to the Honorable John Spratt, who is the ranking \nDemocratic member of the Committee on the Budget in the House, with \ncopies also to Mr. Kasich and Mr. Domenici.\n  The conclusion of these letters is that the 0.97% cut that will be \nincluded in the conference report, which perhaps we will consider \nlater, is going to be insufficient, according to the \nlatest calculations of CBO, to avoid tapping social security funds this \nfiscal year. Their estimate is, it would have to be not 0.97 percent \nbut a total of 5.8 percent. If you were to eliminate defense, military \nconstruction, veterans programs, it would be in excess of 11 percent.\n\n  So here on this chart are the cuts with 1 percent. And the CBO says, \nif you are going to do the job and follow the pathway that is being \nrecommended by the Republican leadership, it will have to be a 5.8 \npercent cut.\n  So you can multiply all of the cuts to programs needed by our most \nvulnerable citizens by 5.8, which yields a much more devastating \nimpact. Those are the circumstances we are in.\n  The fact is that the President and the ranking Democrats on the \nvarious committees say: Why don't you go back and cut out the pork you \nput in and cut out the excesses you have added, and send us something \nthat is responsible? Then we can have true negotiations.\n  But that isn't the way the Republican leadership is moving. They are \njust favoring across-the-board cuts, which will cut valuable, helpful \nprograms that are indispensable to needy people, for infants and for \nchildren, for education, and for health--the same amount as the pork \nprograms that have been added by the Republicans.\n  These consequences are all the more deplorable because they are \nunnecessary. President Clinton and the Democrats here in Congress have \nproposed fiscally responsible measures to keep our hands entirely off \nSocial Security money even while we make the critical investments \nneeded to strengthen our Nation in the coming year.\n  But the Republicans repeatedly said ``no.'' ``No'' to a cigarette tax \nthat would prevent teen smoking while paying for children's health \ninitiatives; ``no'' to making oil companies pay royalties they owe the \nFederal Government; ``no'' to reducing corporate welfare; ``no'' even \nto military officers when they ask to defer or delay programs the \nRepublicans want in their districts.\n  By consistently declining opportunities to reduce a balanced budget, \nRepublicans are on a course to raid Social Security, regardless of this \nproposed 1 percent cut.\n  Why have Republicans proposed this latest gimmick? To avoid using \nthis year's Social Security surplus to pay for this year's Government \nspending, they tell us. But what Republicans don't say is that the \ngimmicks they have already voted for guarantee that the Social Security \nmoney will be used in the budget this year. That is what the latest CBO \nreport that has been given to the leaders today has indicated.\n  I have but one simple question for anyone who would disagree: Where \nwill the money come from to pay for the census, which Republicans have \nsuddenly declared to be an emergency? This money must be paid to \ncontractors and staff this budget year, yet it cannot be found anywhere \nexcept in the Social Security trust fund.\n  By simply calling a $4 billion entirely foreseeable program an \n``emergency,'' Republicans cannot escape the fact that they will \ncertainly spend Social Security surpluses this year, regardless of \nwhether there is an across-the-board cut. The census gimmick is but one \nof many instances in which Social Security funds have already been \nspent by Republicans this budget year. When all the smoke and mirrors \nproduced by the Republicans are removed, we can see that the true goal \nof their 1-percent cut is not to preserve Social Security surpluses but \nto gut Government spending on core education, health, and criminal \njustice programs. Republicans in this Congress are returning to the \ntime of Speaker Gingrich when they proposed abolishing the Department \nof Education, only now they are dismantling it piece by piece.\n  Today's Republicans have proposed a $288 million cut for the \nDepartment of Education--continuing their longstanding assault on our \nchildren's futures. Let's not forget that when Republicans first \nassumed the control of Congress in 1995, their top agenda item was to \nrescind $1.7 billion in education funding that had already been enacted \ninto law by the Democratic Congress. Then, in the first full funding \ncycle subject to Republican control, their appropriators in the House \nsocked the Department of Education with a $3.9 billion proposed cut--\nalmost 20 percent. They tried again in the budget year 1997 when Senate \nappropriators sought a $3.1 billion cut to the President's request for \neducation programs.\n\n  Democrats in the Congress, together with President Clinton, \nsuccessfully resisted each one of these Republican cuts in education.\n  So since 1997, Republicans have sought more modest education cuts of\n\n[[Page S13364]]\n\n$200 million or more below the President. Today's proposed $288 million \ncut is consistent with the Republicans' longstanding goal of decreasing \nsupport for education. It is wrong. It is shortsighted. It is not what \nthe American people want or deserve.\n  Of course, Senator Nickles and Representative DeLay want us to \nbelieve their 1-percent cut won't hurt a bit. It might not hurt the oil \ncompanies they want to protect from paying full royalties to the \nGovernment this year, but it will hurt the real people I described when \nI listed some effects of their proposed cut. The cut might not affect \nthe tobacco companies, now that the Republicans have rejected President \nClinton's plan to raise cigarette taxes, but it will hurt those who \nrely on the programs Republicans want to cut.\n  In conclusion, I want to just point out--on this other chart--what \nthe current situation is with regard to the Head Start Program.\n  Today, we have, for the Early Head Start Program, only 1 in 100 \neligible children who are actually enrolled. This is what the Carnegie \nCommission and virtually all recent studies show is probably the wisest \ninvestment of funds of any other Government program because these are \nthe earliest years of confidence building among children. And as all of \nthe research has demonstrated, the earliest intervention in these \nyears, in the first, second, third, and fourth years of life, has \nenormous consequences in the child's cognitive development and future \neducation. Only 1 in 100 eligible children are presently enrolled in \nEarly Head Start. In the Head Start Program, which has been tried and \ntested, evaluated and strengthened and improved, only 2 in 5 eligible \nchildren are enrolled now; 3 out of 5 are financially eligible, and \ncannot enroll in the program.\n  The Child Care Development Block Grant program only assists 1 in 10 \neligible children. Education for the disabled, only 1 in 4 eligible \nchildren are assisted. This is the current situation. It is against \nthat background we are going to see tens of millions, hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in reduction in those programs because the \nRepublican leadership, over the course of the year, have added a lot of \nboondoggle programs of their own in these other appropriations.\n  I indicated what those reductions would be if they were going to be 1 \npercent. Now we know it is going to be 5.8 percent, according to the \nCBO.\n  The proposed cut is wrong. It is an abdication of their duty to state \nwhat they believe the nation's priorities should be. It is \nirresponsible. I hope our colleagues would vote in the negative on \nthis.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from Massachusetts, is he aware, in \naddition to this latest scheme--that is what I call it--this across-\nthe-board cut, in this one-a-week program the Republicans have come up \nwith, they also wanted to do a number of other things, such as extend \nthe year a month? Are you familiar with that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am.\n  Mr. REID. That didn't sell very well. Are you aware it was determined \neven by the very conservative Wall Street Journal they had two sets of \nbooks they were trying to keep in an effort to hide the spending of \nSocial Security moneys? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I remember the discussion on the floor, an article by \nMr. Rogers, I think. It was an excellent article and a very accurate \none. It was included in the Record. I hope our colleagues will read \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. In addition to having two sets of books, in addition to \nextending the year another month, as my friend from Illinois has said--\nthat is great, because in doing that, we will never have a Y2K problem; \nwe just keep adding months to the year--are you aware also that the \nearned-income tax credit, the program Ronald Reagan said was the best \nantiwelfare program in the history of this country, they tried, as one \nof their schemes, to take that money away from the working poor in \nAmerica so they could balance their so-called budget? Is the Senator \naware of that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was aware of it. The particular need for that program \nis to provide help and assistance for low-income working families who \nhave children. This is basically the children. That program benefits \nthe children of working poor, to try to give some assurance they will \nat least have some measure of quality of life. That was the program \ntargeted by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives \nto be undermined, that program and the resources in that program, in \norder to offset the other benefits they had given to their special \nprojects.\n  Mr. REID. As part of their scheme-of-the-week program to have this \nblue smoke and mirrors, is the Senator also aware--I know he answered \nthis question, as he so aptly pointed out--that now they want an \nacross-the-board cut, saying they want to eliminate waste and fraud, \nbut that across-the-board cuts are indiscriminate; it doesn't go to any \none pocket; it cuts programs across the board? Is the Senator aware of \nthat?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. It does not, for \nexample, even give the military, give the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff and the commanders, the range of options they could have in \norder to meet their responsibility. We are up to 270-odd billion \ndollars in terms of defense appropriations; 1 percent is $2.7 billion. \nAs a member of the Armed Services Committee, we heard from the Joint \nChiefs that it would be a devastating cut in terms of personnel and in \nterms of readiness. They don't give the flexibility to any of the \nadministrators to be able to do it. They are just mandating the \nrequirement right across the board. That is the most inefficient way of \ndoing it.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator, is he aware that instead of their scheme \nof the week, they have now done two schemes this week? So maybe next \nweek they will use one of the old ones. Is the Senator aware that one \nof the latest schemes is to withhold money from the National Institutes \nof Health for 11 months of the fiscal year so all the money comes in \nthe 12th month? It helps their bookkeeping. Is the Senator aware of \nthis scheme they are floating around here?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I had heard that, that they were going to hold \nsome $7.8 billion. Maybe they could, with $1 billion, hold for some \nperiod of time. NIH might be able to deal with that. They are talking \nabout $7.8 billion, effectively undermining the most significant and \nimportant basic research that is taking place any place in the world at \na time of extraordinary possibility and breakthroughs in terms of \nhealth, in order to fund a number of military pieces of equipment that \nwere never requested by the military and other special projects that \nwere never requested by the administration. They don't want to cut \nthose out, but they want to tamper with the greatest research center in \nthe world, which is the NIH, doing so much on so many of these diseases \nthat affect every family in America, whether it is cancer, whether it \nis on the issues of Alzheimer's, whether Parkinson's disease, you name \nit, lupus, whatever it is, osteoporosis that affect our senior \ncitizens. They are tampering with those funds. I have seen a lot of \nshenanigans in the budgeting of the Federal budget, but I would \ncertainly agree with the Senator that tampering with the NIH funds in \nthe way this is done would have a dramatic adverse impact in our whole \nbasic research programs at the NIH and would cause enormous harm. I \nwelcome the Senator's observation, because, if there weren't other \nproblems in this report, that in and of itself would justify the \nrejection of it.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator is going to yield the floor, I would like to \nclaim the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to ask the Senator a question.\n  Mr. REID. I wanted to ask the Senator from North Dakota a question, \nbut please proceed. I have the floor, and I yield to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield, we have been going back and \nforth. So please be short, if you can. We want to have that comity \ncontinue.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from South Carolina, are we in a hurry \naround here?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is the comity and not the time. Please talk until \ntomorrow, when we vote.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Massachusetts still has the floor then.\n\n[[Page S13365]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor. We will speak very shortly so the Senator \nfrom Illinois can be recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Illinois should be recognized. If I \ncould ask forbearance, I wanted to ask the Senator from Massachusetts a \nquestion. Since he doesn't have the floor, let me at least propound the \nquestion.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I would like to have unanimous consent \nto speak for a couple of minutes on our departed colleague, John \nChafee, after which I have to preside. I will just take a couple \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Chair, I am happy to yield my time for 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Illinois. I will reclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I take this opportunity to express my great sense of \npersonal loss on the passing of our colleague from the great State of \nRhode Island, John Chafee.\n  I have only been in the Senate for under a year now. I got to know \nSenator Chafee while I was running for the Senate about a year ago. \nEven in that short period of time, I came to have great admiration and \nrespect for Senator Chafee. I can only imagine the great sense of grief \nmy colleagues and others who have known him several decades feel at his \npassing.\n  Of all the people I have known in my lifetime, I have to say that \nSenator Chafee had more of an aura of goodness, kindness, gentleness, \nand of fineness than just about anybody I had ever encountered in my \nlife.\n  In many ways, he was a quintessential New Englander. He was modest; \nhe was often taciturn. He did not complain about the health problems he \nhad in the last few months. In fact, he didn't wish to talk about that. \nHe was very hard-working. Others have spoken about his distinguished \ncareer in the Senate, as Governor of Rhode Island, and as our Secretary \nof the Navy. But for all of us who knew him personally, he was a great \nand fine gentleman. He embodied the best of his State, of his region, \nof our country, and certainly of this institution.\n  I just wanted to say now how much I appreciated John Chafee for the \nwarm welcome he gave me as a freshman Senator. I regret that I did not \nhave the chance to thank him while he was still with us. We used to \nshare the elevator rides after we voted. We were on the fifth floor of \nthe Dirksen Building, and we would be riding up to that top floor \ntogether after practically every rollcall vote in the Senate. I got to \nknow Senator Chafee quite well in the last few months. He was always \nvery kind and interested in me as a freshman. He was always offering to \nhelp. When I took a trip earlier this year to give a speech in Rhode \nIsland, he wanted to know beforehand exactly where I was going and my \nitinerary in his State, and he quizzed me about it afterward.\n  He was a Theodore Roosevelt Republican who was concerned about the \npreservation of our environment, enhancing it for future generations, \nand he did a marvelous job as chairman of the Environment Committee.\n  I express my condolences to his wife Virginia, his five children, and \nmost especially to his staff. Senator Chafee's office is right next \ndoor to my office in the Dirksen Building. I know that he had a very \nloyal staff who loved him dearly. Many of his legislative assistants \nhad been with him for 10 years or more, which bespeaks the sense of \nloyalty and affection they had for him. I know they have suffered a \ngreat loss, and we extend our condolences to them. John Chafee will be \nmissed by me and by all of us in the Senate and by the great State of \nRhode Island and by our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13365-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13365-S13377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the Chair. I \nyield now to the minority leader, with the agreement that I will have \nthe floor when he completes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the assistant \nDemocratic leader, for his willingness to allow me the opportunity to \ntalk a little bit more about why we are here.\n  We are stalled for one reason: The majority leader has again, for the \nseventh time now, filled the tree, precluding 45 Democrats from \noffering amendments. That is why we are here. And on two other \noccasions this year, the majority leader preemptively filed cloture on \nmeasures immediately after calling them up--and then proceeded to other \nbusiness in order to prevent amendments or debate. So nine times so far \nthis year, the majority leader has said, well, we are going to decide \nwhich amendments are offered, we are going to decide which amendments \nare passed, we are going to decide what kind of role you as Senators \nought to have, and we will tell you that you are not going to be able \nto offer amendments. We are going to decide, in other words, whether to \ngag you and to lock you out of the legislative process to which you \nwere elected as a representative of the people.\n  It began on March 8, 1999, on the so-called Education Flexibility \nAct. The bill was offered, the majority leader was recognized, and the \ntree was filled, locking out every single Democrat from their right to \noffer amendments to the Education Flexibility Act.\n  He chose to do it again on April 22 on the Social Security lockbox. \nHe said: We are going to have an up-or-down vote, and it is going to be \nour lockbox or none at all. We said: What about Medicare? What about \nlocking up the Medicare trust fund? They said: No, you can't offer that \namendment; we are going to fill the tree and preclude you from offering \namendments on the Social Security lockbox. And, again, the issue was \nshelved.\n  On April 27, 1999, the Y2K Act, an extremely complex and very \ndifficult issue, the majority leader came to the floor and filled the \ntree, precluded Democratic amendments, and said it is take it or leave \nit.\n  April 30, again he apparently tries to make the point that Social \nSecurity lockbox is important to Republicans--as long as Democrats \ndon't have the opportunity to offer an amendment. Again, we said: We \nwould like to offer an amendment on Medicare. Again, our Republican \ncolleagues said: It is our bill or no bill. At that point, it went from \nbecoming the Republican lockbox to, as our colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, said this morning, the Republican ``squawk box.''\n  On June 15, 1999, the ``squawk box'' was debated again. Again, the \nmajority leader offered the bill, filled the tree, precluded Democratic \namendments, and the lockbox was shelved.\n  On July 16, Republicans used the ``squawk box'' approach again, \nclaiming to be interested in getting the bill passed, precluding \nDemocratic amendments on Medicare.\n  On June 16, in a similar situation, they did it again. They called up \na House bill, the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Act, filed \ncloture, and went off the bill to other business. And then, on \nSeptember 21, the most recent effort by the majority leader and the \nmajority to lock out Democratic amendments, they brought up the \nbankruptcy reform bill, filed cloture, and moved on to another bill, \nprecluding Democratic amendments.\n  I only recite the litany of occasions when the majority leader filled \nthe tree in order to make clear how objectionable this coercive tactic \nreally is. For those who are not familiar with parliamentary jargon, \n``filling the tree'' is a procedure that the leader can use to offer \nmultiple amendments and thereby fill all of the available amendment \nslots that a bill has under the Senate rules, precluding any Senator \nfrom offering an amendment. That is what filling the tree is all about. \nTogether with the practice of preemptively filing cloture, which has \nthe same effect, it has been done now on nine separate occasions. The \nsad thing about it being done on this bill is that it plays right into \nthe hands of the opponents of the legislation.\n\n  The opponents are very grateful to Senator Lott and the majority for \nfilling the tree because it certainly makes\n\n[[Page S13366]]\n\nit easy. It turns the issue away from whether or not one supports CBI \nto whether or not one supports a Senator's right to be a full \nparticipant in this Senate Chamber on this or any other bill. It ceases \nto become substantive and becomes a matter of individual Senator's \nrights.\n  Well, because I want this bill passed so badly and because I know it \nis one of the highest priorities for the administration, because I \nthink this legislation has languished too long, because I think there \nis a real chance we can get this legislation passed and signed into \nlaw, going into conference with our House colleagues, I made an offer \nyesterday that was unprecedented since I have been leader. I said to \nthe majority leader that if he would agree to allow us to offer on \nother legislation some of the amendments contemplated on this \nlegislation, I would be prepared to work with him to table amendments \non this bill. That is remarkable. It wasn't without a great deal of \nconcern for protecting Senators' rights that I offered this latest \nproposal.\n  I draw a distinction between protecting a Senator's right to offer an \namendment and supporting whatever amendment a Senator chooses to offer. \nI might not support an amendment on this particular bill, as important \nas some of these issues might be, but I will fight to protect every \nSenator's right to offer it. But there is a very important caveat here, \nand I think it needs to be emphasized. I insisted that we must have the \nopportunity to at least offer these amendments on another bill.\n  We have to have an opportunity, for example, to offer minimum wage on \nthe bankruptcy bill when it comes up. The majority leader again said \nno. The problem, as we have said on so many occasions, is that there \nare those on the majority side who want this Senate to be a second \nHouse of Representatives. They want this body to act and to proceed as \nif it were the House of Representatives. That is the problem.\n  The amazing irony is that our Republican colleagues never dreamed of \nasking for this kind of procedural constraint, this kind of enslaved \napproach to legislation, when they were in the minority. They had no \ntrouble offering extraneous amendments that were not necessarily \nrelevant to a particular bill when they were in the minority. Of course \nnot. The amazing thing is Democrats did not insist on a procedural \nconstraint of the magnitude our Republican colleagues are now \ndemanding.\n  Why? Because we had the confidence when a bill came to the floor that \nwe would have a good debate, we would take all comers, we would table \namendments that we didn't support, and we would offer second-degree \namendments that we thought would be approved. We used all of the tools \navailable to us. And this Senate acted like a Senate.\n  This Senate isn't acting like a Senate today. This is a sham. This is \na terrible excuse for this body. This should not happen. We should not \nhave to come pleading for the right to do what we were elected to do. \nAnd it happens over and over--almost once a month this year.\n  I am telling you, we are losing some of the institutional tradition \nhere. We are seeing the erosion of an extraordinarily important body \nand the rights incorporated within that body. Who today could, without \nsmiling, argue that this is the most deliberative body? Who could say \nwith a straight face, yes, this is still the world's most deliberative \nbody? I daresay no one could say that. There is nothing deliberative \nabout the Senate today. They want to make this a legislative assembly \nline. You take something up, you vote it up or down, and you move it \nalong.\n  I am surprised we don't have a conveyor belt somewhere on the lower \npart of the floor where we just kind of say yes and no, yes and no, as \nbills on the conveyor belt come through--no debate, no deliberation; \nlet's move them out.\n  This isn't what our Founding Fathers expected of us. They expected \nmore. They put the rights in the hands of Senators to say: No, let's \nslow down on the legislation; or, I want to be able to offer an \namendment. And I don't care whether it is a farm bill to a peace \ntreaty. We want to have the opportunity to deliberate in the most \ndeliberative body. Rubber stamping doesn't work around here. We have \nonly had a handful of amendable vehicles--just a handful.\n  The response from the majority leader to my offer suggests that there \nmay never be another amendable vehicle in this session of Congress--\nwith no amendments on this bill, no amendments on any other bill. That \nis what the Republicans want. The results of doing business this way is \nremarkable.\n  We talk about a legislative landfill. I am telling you, I have never \nseen a legislative landfill of the magnitude we have today. We keep \nthrowing bills into the legislative landfill, and that landfill keeps \ngetting larger.\n  This has been the biggest legislative graveyard I have seen since \ncoming to Congress. Republicans get elected to prove government doesn't \nwork, and they prove it every day. When they are in control, they prove \nthat government doesn't work because they don't want it to work. They \ndon't want minimum wage. They don't want a Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThey don't want good gun legislation. They don't want a Medicare \nprescription drug bill. They don't want legislation that moves this \ncountry forward. They don't want it. They don't want to admit it. They \nought to admit it.\n\n  We are not going to be a part of this. We are going to stick up for \nour rights. We are going to amend legislation when it comes to the \nfloor. We are going to go back into that legislative landfill and one \nby one we are going to recycle, because I am telling you that is what \nthis Senate and this country needs. We are going to recycle the \nPatients' Bill of Rights until it is done right. We are going to \nrecycle minimum wage. We are going to recycle the gun legislation. We \nare going to recycle farm legislation. We are going to recycle every \nsingle bill the Republicans insist on burying, and we are going to keep \ncoming back because that is what we were elected to do. That is what we \nare going to do. That is what we believe in doing.\n  I have to say I am disappointed. I am about as patient a person as I \nthink I can be, but I lose my patience, and I get angry and frustrated \nat the level of duplicity and the extraordinary encumbrances that the \nmajority demands of this body each and every day we legislate. This is \nwrong.\n  I am not proud to be in the Senate when I can't legislate as a \nSenator. I am not proud when we tear away the pillars of the Senate \ninstitution. I am not proud when I can't go to the public and say, yes, \nI am one of the 100 Members of the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. I am not proud about that. For however long I am here, I would \nlike to be proud of the fact that, as a Senator, I lived up to the \ntraditions and the practices and the extraordinary honor that comes \nwith being a Senator. But that isn't happening today.\n  I left the House of Representatives 12 years ago for a good reason. I \nthought I could do more here. I thought I could play a bigger role \nhere. I thought the Senate was where a Senator could really legislate. \nIt was true in 1987. It was true in 1992. It was true all the way up \nuntil recently when slowly but most assuredly date by date, bill by \nbill, in filling the tree and using other devices, this majority leader \nsaid no. No. We are going to be a House of Representatives. Forget \nregular order. Regular order says you can offer amendments. We are not \ngoing to have regular order in the Senate. We are going to have narrow \norder, or no order at all, as the case may be.\n  What order is there when Senators can't offer amendments and we are \nstymied for 2 days? Do you realize how many bills we could have \nfinished, or how many amendments we could have finished in just the \nlast couple of days? We probably could go to final passage with the \nnumber of Senators who support this legislation by the end of the week. \nBut here we are stymied once again.\n  We haven't passed the Social Security lockbox. That is part of the \nlegislative landfill because we have filled the tree.\n  We haven't been able to pass anything where the majority leader has \nfilled the tree until he has torn the tree down. That is the case here \nas well.\n  We will never let this legislation pass if we can't offer an \namendment, not because we don't support it--I strongly support it--but \nbecause I also even\n\n[[Page S13367]]\n\nmore strongly support the right of every single Senator to be partners \nin the legislative process.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my leader for his comments and his spirit because \nit is the spirit we need in this country, which is the can-do spirit. \nWe can take care of the people's business, even if it is difficult for \nmy friend. I know it is because I know the kind of goodness he has in \nhis heart. This isn't his favorite moment to come down to the floor and \nhave to express his feelings of dismay and his anger, frankly. My \nfriend listed bills that are in the landfill, the graveyard. I want to \nask the Senator about three other issues that I think are in danger of \njoining in that Republican graveyard: The 100,000 teachers, the 100,000 \npolice, and decent, qualified judges who have been waiting for years to \nget a vote.\n\n  I wonder if my leader would comment on those three areas, as well.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California puts her finger right on the \nissues I omitted, and rightfully so. One year ago, we all had a \nbipartisan agreement and celebrated the fact we were going to reduce \nclass size. How ironic it is now, after all the celebration, that in \njust 12 months Republicans have had a change of heart. Now, apparently, \nclass size is no longer an issue. Now, apparently, it is OK to have \nkids in classrooms with 35, 40, 50 children. It doesn't matter. The \nSenator is right about that.\n  The Senator is also right about judges. I don't know how anyone can \nlook Judge Paez in the eye and say he got a fair deal. I don't know how \nMembers tell anybody who has had to wait for more than 3 years that \nthis system is fair. I don't know how Members tell the Hispanic \ncommunity we are being equally as fair with them as we are with all \nnon-Hispanic judges when that simply is not true. If one is in a \nminority, that person has a bigger contest in getting confirmed. That \nis a fact. I won't deal with all the perceptions that creates, but it \nis wrong. Hispanic or non-Hispanic, African American or non-African \nAmerican, woman or man, it is wrong not to have a vote on the Senate \nfloor.\n  What are they afraid of? What are they afraid of? What is wrong with \na vote? There is something wrong in our system when somebody has the \nright to tell somebody who is willing to commit him or herself to \npublic service that we are going to make that person wait 3\\1/2\\ years \njust to get a vote. We are not going to tell them what is wrong. We are \nnot going to say if there is something wrong in their background. We \nare not going to debate whether they have qualifications or not. We are \ngoing to make them wait, and hopefully they will go away. Hopefully, \nthey will go away.\n  What does that say? What does that say about the intentions of people \non the other side? Go away. Don't make any noise.\n  That is wrong. That is worse than a legislative landfill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend the Senator for his very eloquent and accurate \nassessment of what has happened to this institution. I have been here \nfor some period of time, and I say this is absolutely a unique set of \ncircumstances. The leader has, I think, accurately described the \ncurrent system.\n  I think it is important, as our friend from California pointed out, \nwhat it means in terms of people's lives. We can talk about the tree \nand blocking amendments, but let's take one bill, the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  This chart lists in white all the provisions that were in the Senate \nbill, which our Democratic leader managed so well, and which was \nsubmitted in the Senate. All of these provisions represent the best \njudgment of a bipartisan commission set up by the President. They \nunanimously made these recommendations. They had to be unanimous in \norder to make the recommendations. They didn't make the recommendation \nto put them in law, but they said: This is what is necessary to protect \nthe people. Or by the insurance commissioners, that are neither \nDemocrat or Republican organizations; or, in other instances, in \nMedicare.\n  This side of the chart represents what happened in the House of \nRepresentatives with a bipartisan group of House Members, 68 \nRepublicans and the Democrats. These full dots indicate the House of \nRepresentatives has effectively agreed with the legislation advanced by \nthe minority leader.\n  I ask, since this was a bipartisan program and the leader had the \noverwhelming support of the Democrats, whether the Senator would not \nwelcome the opportunity this afternoon to go ahead and pass what was \npassed in the House of Representatives so we would not have the kind of \ncircumstance we have every single day we are delayed: 35,000 Americans \ndelayed or denied specialty care; 31,000 forced to change doctors; \n18,000 forced to change medicine indications; 59,000 Americans with \nadded pain and suffering; 41,000 with a worsening condition; and 11,000 \nwith permanent disability.\n  That happens every single day.\n  As I gather from what the leader has said, the kind of legislative \ntrapeze that has been set up by the majority leader denies this \nminority the opportunity to take action that can make a difference in \nthe lives of the families of America. I think it is worthwhile, as we \ntalk and listen carefully to the Senator's concerns, to know the result \nof the inaction. Real families are being hurt in America. They don't \nhave to be hurt. Republicans and Democrats alike got together to \nprovide some protection, but this leadership in this body is denying \nthe American people the ability to receive the kind of protections they \nshould.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. He \ngave a perfect illustration of how they are being hurt on health care. \nI think he is also right that it is important to try to put this in \nterms the American people understand. This has to do with more than \njust procedure. We are talking procedure, and sometimes I may get too \nengrossed in my own procedural frustration to try to ensure that we \ntalk about this in ways the American people fully understand.\n  If anyone out there today has been ripped off by an insurance company \nor has been denied care by a hospital or doctor because they are being \ntold by the insurance company they cannot do it, those people are \naffected by what is happening this afternoon on the floor, one of the \nthousands of people who have been adversely affected by our inability \nto have a good debate. Anyone out there who has a child in a classroom \nwith 35 or 40 kids is affected by what is going on right now.\n  If anyone out there has been affected by some crime in the \nneighborhood because we haven't fully funded the COPS Program, then, by \ngolly, those Americans are affected dramatically by what has happened \nright now. If anyone is out there working at lousy minimum wage and \ncan't make ends meet, they are affected by what is happening right now \nbecause the other side doesn't want a minimum wage increase--not this \nyear, not ever. If they did, they would have supported it a long time \nago. If anyone out there wonders why this is all going on, turn the \npages of the calendar back 2 weeks and find out it was their side that \ndefeated campaign finance reform and we are affected by what is \nhappening right now. Don't let anybody out there, I don't care what \nissue, think this is not relevant.\n\n  The assistant Democratic leader probably made the best illustration. \nI think our people are in greater danger today than they have ever been \nbefore to the exposure of greater nuclear proliferation because of what \nthe Senate did 3 weeks ago. You are affected by it. You are affected by \nit.\n  This is more than procedure. This is what is going on here and how \naffected we are by it. This has everything to do with why we got \nelected in the first place, because we wanted to come down and fight \nfor these issues. It is more than whether we can offer an amendment, it \nis whether we pass the amendment. It is whether we do something good \nfor this country, for whatever limited time we are here. That is what \nthis is about.\n  We came to fight. We came to fight for the things in which we \nbelieve: A better minimum wage, more teachers, a good health care \nsystem, an end to nuclear proliferation, a safer neighborhood, a better \nminimum wage--things\n\n[[Page S13368]]\n\nabout which people today can only dream. That is what we came to fight \nfor. There are opportunities for debates about things; there ought to \nbe.\n  We have to decide what kind of body this is going to be. Those who \nwish for the rules of the House ought to go to the House. To understand \nthe 200-year tradition of the Senate, pull open this drawer. I see some \nwonderful names, names in some cases that have been there for \ngenerations. These people, the people in my drawer, fought for the same \nthings I am fighting for right now. These people fought for health \ncare, these people fought for better working conditions for families, \nthese people fought for a safer neighborhood, these people fought for \nthe arms control agreements of their day. They fought. They were not \nhandcuffed. They were not gagged. They were not confined to a \nlegislative straitjacket. They fought valiantly, and today we sing \ntheir praises as the legislative leaders and giants of old.\n  We want to fight. We want to be part of this process. We want to be \nable to pass this institution onto the next generation of Senators and \nsay: Welcome to the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make sure those who are following this debate \nunderstand what we are talking about. When we use terms such as ``fill \nthe tree,'' which we are talking about, we are basically talking about \na gag rule here which says Members of the Senate can't offer \namendments.\n  Some critics say: We know what you mean; the old Senate filibuster. \nYou want to go on forever offering amendment after amendment after \namendment so you can never get anything done around here.\n  Can the leader on the Democratic side tell us, have we offered to the \nRepublican side to limit the debate on the amendments, to limit the \nnumber of amendments, to require they be published in the Record so we \nknow the parameters of the debate and so we know it will come to an end \nat a certain time, we know there will be an up-or-down vote? Has that \nbeen part of the bargaining?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois has raised an important \nquestion. On the issue of bankruptcy, the answer is absolutely yes.\n  My initial position on bankruptcy was, we ought to have the \nopportunity to offer amendments, relevant or nonrelevant. We ought to \nuse regular order--I should say that. We ought to use the regular order \nof the Senate in taking up a bill. That is what my suggestion was.\n  The majority leader said: No, we cannot do that.\n  So I said: What about offering at least five amendments that may not \nbe directly related to bankruptcy but are important to Democrats?\n  He said: No, we can't do that.\n  I said: What about offering three amendments that are important to \nDemocrats that may not be directly related to bankruptcy, requiring \nthat all Senators file all relevant amendments prior to a certain time?\n  I am told now the majority leader cannot do that.\n  So, inch by inch, step by step, the majority wants to rob you and rob \nevery single Member on this side of the aisle of your right to be a \nfull partner in the Senate.\n  We all want to be able to move legislation. I will agree with some, \ndisagree with others. Ultimately, if the Senator from Illinois is right \nand we are able to close the gap on bankruptcy with some good \namendments, I will be supportive of that legislation. I expect to be. \nBut I also expect you will have a right to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator agree with our former friend, late \ndeparted Mike Synar, Congressman from Oklahoma, who is quoted as \nsaying: If you don't want to fight fires, don't become a fireman, and \nif you don't want to come to Congress and vote on tough amendments, \ndon't run for the House or Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois recalls and I recall our \nwonderful colleague very well. No one was sharper, more energetic, \nbrighter, better liked in our caucus in the House than Mike Synar. He \nsaid that and a lot of other truthful things. He was right.\n  It makes me wonder what people are afraid of. What in the world are \nSenators afraid of, bringing up and debating an amendment? We used to \ndo that all the time. I can recall so many occasions when we had to \ncome down to the floor and table an amendment that might have had \nimmediate popularity but was not good for the country. We did that. We \ntabled amendments. We second-degreed them.\n  Again, I am getting into ``beltway speak'' here, but the bottom line \nis, we respected Senators' rights to fight for the things they cared \nabout, to fight for the things for which the people sent them to fight.\n  The Senator from Illinois has done that on an array of issues. Every \nSenator on this floor has come with a certain agenda and a belief they \ncould make a difference. But how do you make a difference if you do not \nhave a voice? How do you make a difference when you do not have an \nopportunity to legislate? How do you make a difference when you are \nreally shoved back into the mentality and the constraints of the House \nof Representatives when you are a Senator? That is not what the people \nof our States and this country sent us to do.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the stand the distinguished leader takes \nis one of a fundamental nature. It is one of principle and not \npolitics, and I am in the best position to comment upon it, for the \nsimple reason, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota favors the \nFinance Committee bill. He would favor throttling me and getting rid of \nme and having a quick vote. But he understands, better than any, there \nis more to the Senate than a gymnasium for political gymnastics \nwhereby, on parliamentary positions, you can just cut everybody off.\n  I cannot see Senator Mansfield for a second going along with this \nnonsense. I could not see for a second Senator Dirksen even suggesting \nit. There has always been an unwritten rule of comity and understanding \nand friendship and the strength of feeling. Sometimes, when Senators \nhave that feeling, it is respected by the other 99 Senators.\n  Here, the Senator from South Dakota, our minority leader, has been \nvery eloquent on the position taken as a matter of principle. His \npolitics are otherwise. He could go along with Senator Lott and say: \nThe dickens with it, fill up the tree, tomorrow we'll vote, we'll have \ncloture, and this bill will be over with, and everything else of that \nkind.\n\n  But the opposite is the case. He has taken a stand for the Senate \nmajority and minority. It is a Senate stand. I commend him for taking \nit.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I know the assistant Democratic leader has been very patient, waiting \nto speak. For that reason, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Before the leader leaves, on behalf of the Democrats in the \nSenate and the people of the United States of America, we congratulate \nand applaud his statement. The Senate stands for what our Constitution \nwas set up to do. We are not the House of Representatives. We are not \nelected every 2 years. We are to be a deliberative body, and the leader \nspoke so well in that regard. I, as I said for all Democrats and for \nthe country, respect and appreciate his position.\n  I would like to ask a question of my friend from North Dakota. I say \nto my friend from North Dakota, does he remember--I see at least five \nSenators, here coincidentally on the floor, all of whom agreed to \noppose the rush by the Republicans to have a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget. We opposed that, the five of us on the floor \ntoday: The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer; the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy; the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nHollings; this Senator; and the leader walking out to his office.\n  Do you recall we all opposed the constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget that was presented by the Republican majority? Do you recall \nour opposing that?\n\n[[Page S13369]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. In response to the Senator from Nevada, when we had the \ndebate in the Senate on the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, one of the questions we raised was about writing into the \nConstitution of the United States a practice of using Social Security \ntrust funds for the purpose of balancing the budget; in other words, \ntaking trust funds that were designated for Social Security, which came \nfrom the taxpayers' paychecks and put into a trust fund, and using them \nas other revenue, just as if it was any other dollar of tax revenue. We \nraised the question: Do you think it is appropriate to weld into the \nU.S. Constitution a practice as dishonest as that? These are trust \nfunds, after all.\n  Mr. REID. What was their answer to that question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Their answer was: We insist on doing it this way; we \ndemand we change the U.S. Constitution by requiring that Social \nSecurity trust funds be counted as any other form of revenue for the \npurposes of computing our budget balance. We demand it, they said.\n  One of the meetings was in this Cloakroom, another back there, \nanother on the floor. We said: But that is not an honest way of \nbudgeting. If you did that in private business--if you have a company \nand you want to show how much profit you made last year, and in showing \nhow much profit, you want to bring your employees' pension moneys into \nthe bottom line and say that is the profit, if you do that, you are \ngoing to get 10 years of hard time in some prison.\n  We said: It is not appropriate to use Social Security trust funds and \ncertainly not appropriate to lock it into the Constitution.\n  They said: We have to use them; it is the only way we can balance the \nbudget. They said, back in the Cloakroom, to Senator Conrad and myself: \nWe will make a deal with you. We want to write into the Constitution \nthat we can use the Social Security trust funds to balance the budget, \njust as other revenues, just take them out of the trust funds and use \nthem as other revenues, and we will stop doing it in the year 2012.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator remember that was put in writing by one of \nthe Republican Senators?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The year 2012 was not put in writing. We said that \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  They have two stages of denial. First, we are not using Social \nSecurity, they said. Second, if we are, we will stop by 2012.\n  Then they said: If you don't buy 2012, we will actually put in this \nconstitutional amendment that we will stop using the Social Security \ntrust funds in 2008. And that is what they put in writing. I still have \nthat deep in the bowels of my desk somewhere with their handwriting: We \npropose we stop using Social Security trust funds by 2008, but we \ninsist on the right to do it until then. In fact, we want to put it in \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator recall that the Senators on the floor \noffered our own constitutional amendment to balance the budget that \nsaid we want to balance the budget the hard way, the honest way, and we \ndo not want to use Social Security surpluses? We offered that amendment \nand the Republicans, all but two of them, voted against it; is that \nright?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is correct on that. We offered that \namendment, in fact, on a couple of different occasions. They wanted \nnothing to do with it.\n  The reason this is an important issue, if I can respond to the \nSenator from Nevada, is because we have the majority party running \ntelevision ads across the country at the moment.\n  Mr. REID. I wanted to give a lead in to my friend from North Dakota. \nNorth Dakota is a State sparsely populated, somewhat similar to Nevada. \nThe State of North Dakota has a single congressional district; is that \nright?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Republicans have been running ads, I have been told, in \nthat congressional district, which is that whole State, saying \nDemocrats are bad because we are using Social Security surpluses to \nbalance the budget. Are they running ads like that? And if they are, \nwill the Senator from North Dakota comment on what is going on?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In our State and others, the majority party is running \nads, and the ads are fundamentally dishonest. In political dialog, you \nhave a right to say what you want to say even if it is fundamentally \nuntrue. The ads in North Dakota by the Republican Party are saying the \nDemocrats are stealing, taking Social Security trust funds, they are \nspending trust funds. In fact, just the opposite is the case. It is the \nmajority party that is taking the trust funds. They demanded they be \ntaken back in the debate on the constitutional amendment. In fact, they \ndemanded the opportunities to take them and put it in the Constitution.\n  They are doing it and denying they are doing it and charging others. \nIt is akin to the big bully on the schoolyard playground who blames \nsomebody else: No, ma, those aren't my cigarettes; I was holding them \nfor two other guys who were fighting. It is that approach.\n  Let me read a letter to the Senator from Nevada from the head of the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. REID. Dated today?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Dated today.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator explain for those within the sound of his \nvoice what ``CBO'' is?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Congressional Budget Office is an office that has \nhistorically been a nonpartisan office. It is supposed to be the \nscorekeeper. This would be the referee keeping score on numbers and \nbudgets. What happened previously--this is very interesting--is the \nmajority party wrote to the Congressional Budget Office, and they \nsaid--\n  Mr. REID. The Republicans wrote; is that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is right. They said they wanted to have certain \ndirected scoring adjustments. Let me give an example of what is a \ndirected scoring adjustment. They were writing to the Congressional \nBudget Office to get comfort for what they were doing. Directed scoring \nadjustment is, if I went to an accountant and said: All right, I want \nyou to certify for me what my checkbook balance is, but I direct you \nnot to count the last 10 checks I have written in determining the \nbalance. That is a directed adjustment.\n  Or I say: I want you to tell me whether there are any hills on the \nEarth, and for that purpose, will you assume that the Earth is flat. \nThat is a directed assumption.\n  The Republicans used these directed assumptions and said to CBO: \nUsing these directed assumptions, tell us, are we in good shape?\n  CBO: Yes, using those assumptions, you are in fine shape. Not using \nSocial Security money, you are in good shape.\n  This is what Mr. Crippin, the head of CBO, says in response to \nCongressman Spratt who wrote to him:\n\n       As you requested, these estimates reflect the Congressional \n     Budget Office's assumptions and methodology and exclude these \n     directed scoring adjustments.\n\n  That is the little funny money put in--\n  Mr. REID. The last 10 checks; they can count everything.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Right. This is an honest look. There are no games here; \nthey haven't jimmied up the estimates on the baseline based on a \nrequest by anybody. Here is the honest look, and what they say is: \nHaving done your 13 appropriations bills, Republicans in Congress, you \nhave now spent $17 billion of the Social Security trust funds this \nyear, and you will require a nearly 6-percent, across-the-board \nreduction in all spending--all spending--veterans' health care, senior \ncitizens, the WIC Program for infants and low-income women, the Head \nStart Program--you will require a nearly 6-percent, across-the-board \ncut in all spending in order to avoid your continued use or misspending \nof the Social Security surplus.\n\n  This is today's letter. I want to make this point: Those who are \nspending the money to put the dishonest ads on television this \nafternoon in my State ought to be ashamed of themselves. They ought to \nbe ashamed. They know it is dishonest. This proves it is dishonest. But \nmoney in today's politics is speech. If money is speech, there are a \nlot of speechless people in this country, and that is regrettable. But \nthe folks with the money can put a television ad on and say down is up, \nblack is white, grass is purple--whatever they want to say, and they \ncan, as they have done, ask somebody with directed scoring adjustments, \ntell me my bank balance if you don't count the last 10\n\n[[Page S13370]]\n\nchecks; or tell me the Earth is flat if I insist the Earth is flat in \nthe assumption.\n  They create a dishonest brand of politics in this country. Shame on \nthose who do it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, what you are saying \nis the majority party, the Republicans who run this place--they have \nthe majority, they are passing these appropriations bills--and the CBO \nhas said they have already used--they, the majority party who gets \nbills passed here--they have used Social Security surplus moneys this \nyear and they are running ads in the State of North Dakota and around \nthe country saying Democrats are using Social Security money? The \nSenator has been very discreet in his description. To me, where I come \nfrom, that is a falsehood; that is a lie; that is dishonest. Am I \nmisinterpreting what you have said?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No; the Senator has stated it exactly as I said. Let me \nmention one additional point that relates to something about which the \nDemocratic leader spoke.\n  One could say: Well, if you know this to be true--we know it to be \ntrue by the Congressional Budget Office today--why don't you do \nsomething about it? Why don't you bring an amendment to the floor of \nthe Senate?\n  The point is, we can't bring an amendment to the floor of the Senate. \nThe Senate is tied up, deliberately. We have what is called a \nlegislative tree that has been created that would prevent those on our \nside from offering amendments.\n  If I might just take one additional minute. I grew up in a town of \n300 people. We had an elderly widow in my town, kind of a disagreeable \nelderly widow. She had a huge crab apple tree in her front yard. And \nshe was disagreeable enough to demand, although she had so many crab \napples--she could have fed the whole town; they dropped on the ground--\nshe demanded that children never pick her crab apples. So, of course, \nwe had to wait until after dark to pick her crab apples. But she was \nonly disagreeable with those she did not want to pick crab apples. Her \nfriends, she would usher them in, and they would pick her crab apples.\n  I was thinking about the majority leader today and the tree. It is \nkind of like that disagreeable elderly woman in my hometown. He says: I \nwant to create a tree here and decide--standing right over there on the \nfloor--who can come in and pick the fruit from this tree. By the way, \nthat doesn't include anybody from the Democratic side of the aisle--\nnobody. No one on that side of the aisle is going to pick any of my \nfruit.\n  Why? It is partisan. Everybody says: Well, this is all partisan with \nyou. It is not partisan with us. It is partisan with those who want to \nrun the Senate in a manner that says our friends are going to have full \nopportunity to bring their ideas to the floor of the Senate--and, after \nall, that is the only currency in this kind of institution: An idea, a \ngood idea. The majority leader will say: The way I want to run the \nSenate is my friends have an opportunity to bring their ideas to the \nfloor of the Senate; and we are going to have votes; but you in the \nminority will not, and may not, have that opportunity.\n  That is why we cannot allow that to continue. It is unforgivable to \nallow that to continue.\n  Mr. REID. I direct a question to my friend from California.\n  You have heard the dialog, the discussion, the colloquy between the \nSenator from North Dakota and the Senator from Nevada. I would like the \nSenator to comment on something that was killed here a couple weeks \nago, and that is campaign finance reform. Why is it needed? I would \nlike the Senator to comment on that. Especially in light of all these \nfalse ads that have been running all over this country, why do we need \ncampaign finance reform in our country, which the Republicans have \nkilled?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think one of the reasons people are disillusioned today \nand do not participate in the greatest democracy in the world is that \nthey believe their voice does not count. They believe money talks. And \nlistening to the debate we had on this floor, with the Senator from \nKentucky on their side of the aisle leading that fight, I am sure they \nhave concluded they are right. The Senator equates money with speech. \nIt was, to me, one of the saddest debates I have ever heard around \nhere.\n  People do not vote, they do not participate, because they believe \nthey do not count. Ordinary people, average people, they can't make the \n$1,000 contribution, or the $5,000, or the $10,000, or the $20,000 \ncontribution, or, frankly, the $100,000 and $200,000 contributions of \nsoft money that come into play here.\n  I think it was a very sad situation when the Republicans, defying a \nmajority of this Senate--and we had a majority vote for campaign \nfinance reform--took that piece of legislation and threw it into the \ngraveyard, along with all the other things our Democratic leader and \nour assistant Democratic leader have talked about--all the important \nthings: The HMO reforms, the teachers, the policemen, the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty, and a number of other issues that they have thrown \ninto that graveyard, the last one being campaign finance reform.\n\n  Mr. REID. We have been so impeded in progress around here.\n  Does the Senator also recognize we have done nothing with important \nenvironmental issues facing this country?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I have been waiting 3 days to see us get into a \ndebate on the things that matter to people--things such as the minimum \nwage and environmental protection.\n  Mr. REID. The minority leader has mentioned, and the Senator from \nCalifornia has just mentioned, minimum wage. Does the Senator from \nCalifornia understand that over 60 percent of the people who draw \nminimum wage are women, and of those 60 percent, for 40 percent of them \nthat is the only money they get for their families? So, in short, would \nthe Senator agree that the people who need minimum wage are not \nteenagers at McDonald's flipping hamburgers?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. My friend is right. We held a number of press \nconferences before the last increase of the minimum wage--which now \nseems like history, it was so long ago--where we brought that point out \nthat 60 percent of the people on minimum wage are adult women who are \nsupporting their families. They work very hard. If they work full time \nat a minimum wage job, I say to my friend, they are way below the \npoverty line. They are earning about $11,000 a year. For a family of \nthree or four, they can barely make it. They can't feed their kids, pay \ntheir rent, or buy many clothes at all.\n  So the bottom line is, my friend is right. When we talk about minimum \nwage, we should get behind what that means. What that means is, if we \ndo not raise it, people in this country will be hungry, children in \nthis country will be hungry. We already have many children living in \npoverty. That is the largest group of our citizenry living in poverty.\n  I want to ask my friend to comment on something here, if he would do \nme that favor. I am so proud of his leadership and that of Senator \nDaschle today in framing the issues.\n  When I heard the Senator from North Dakota go back and forth with my \nfriend from Nevada on the Social Security issue, I was very glad they \nraised this issue on the floor. Because of the fact that we have a \nsocial safety net for seniors in this country, we have seen that the \npeople in poverty no longer are the senior citizens. We should all be \nproud of that. But I want to read just a few lines from an editorial \nthat ran in the San Diego Union Tribune. It was written by a man named \nLionel Van Deerlin who, for many years, was in Congress.\n  Mr. REID. From California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Correct, from the San Diego area. He is now a senior \ncitizen himself and quite sharp, as you can tell from this.\n  I am going to read probably just 2 minutes' worth of his words, and I \nwould love my friend to comment. It is called ``Trusting the GOP to \n`save' Social Security.''\n\n       For anyone who just fell off the turnip truck, Republicans \n     in Congress have a new rallying cry--``We won't let them raid \n     Social Security!''. . . .\n       [Tom] DeLay [who is the Republican whip in the House] asks \n     us to believe that the Social Security trust fund is under \n     assault by Democrats, and we must trust his party [the \n     Republican Party] to protect it.\n       I'd sooner entrust a lettuce leaf to a rabbit. Credibility \n     surely matters. In probing the violence at Grandmother's \n     house in the woods, whom do we believe, Little Red Riding \n     Hood or the wolf?\n\n[[Page S13371]]\n\n       Here is one of those demonstrable facts of history:\n\n  And he goes on:\n\n       Had it been left to the Republicans in Congress, we'd never \n     have had Social Security in the first place. Nor Medicare.\n\n  He says:\n\n       GOP House and Senate members invariably lined up \n     in opposition to these social programs.\n\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator pause from finishing her statement?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I carry with me in my wallet, because I think it is hard \nfor people to comprehend this is true--here it is. Just to show Lionel \nVan Deerlin is not too old to remember what really happened, I have \nhere what I carry in my wallet: GOP leaders on Medicare and Social \nSecurity.\n  Let me read to the Senator what some of the leaders have to say.\n  House Majority Leader Dick Armey, with whom we both served when we \nwere in the House, said:\n\n       Medicare has no place in a free world. Social Security is a \n     rotten trick. I think we're going to have to bite the bullet \n     on Social Security and phase it out over time.\n\n  I could read a statement from former leader Bob Dole, from House \nSpeaker Gingrich.\n  The point is, Lionel Van Deerlin is right on target because \nRepublicans did not vote for Social Security to begin with. And they \nstill hate it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am glad you carry that around because if you were to \nlisten to these ads on TV, you would think the Republicans thought of \nthe idea of Social Security and Medicare, when, in fact, they fought it \nevery inch of the way.\n  Just a few years ago, in 1994, Dick Armey, in addition said if he \nwere here, he wouldn't have voted for Social Security.\n  So this is what Lionel Van Deerlin writes.\n\n       GOP House and Senate members invariably lined up in \n     opposition to these social programs.\n       As Casey Stengel would advise, you could look it up.\n\n  He writes further on:\n\n       Yet when President Roosevelt's original Social Security \n     bill neared passage the following year, every Republican \n     present voted to ``recommit'' the measure. To send it back to \n     committee, that is, to kill it.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       Today's GOP generation offers little more to warm one's \n     hands on. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a one-time \n     economics professor, has openly urged the phasing out of \n     Social Security. And no less a prophet than ex-Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich tipped his hand upon taking the gavel in 1995.\n       ``Let it wither on the vine,'' was his chilling suggestion \n     for dealing with a system vital to the support of nearly 45 \n     million Americans.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       I offer the foregoing compendium from public records, not \n     to belittle or embarrass decent, often likable leaders of \n     past and present. They did not climb the ladder with \n     subnormal IQs, nor by ignoring ordinary folk in their \n     respective states and districts . . . no matter how earnestly \n     Armey, DeLay, [and the Republicans] ask us to trust them in \n     regard to Social Security, I offer this advice:\n       Don't.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe editorial from which I just quoted.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the San Diego Union Tribune, Oct. 27, 1999]\n\n               Trusting the GOP To `Save' Social Security\n\n                        (By Lionel Van Deerlin)\n\n       For anyone who just fell off the turnip truck, Republicans \n     in Congress have a new rallying cry--``We won't let them raid \n     Social Security!''\n       Those of us past 65 are expected to feel relieved. Final \n     budget negotiations are under way between Congress and the \n     White House. Listen to those Sunday talk shows and you'd \n     believe a profligate president is poised to riddle the \n     retirement system that has served America since before thoese \n     guys were born.\n       A bone of contention concerns the willingness of either \n     side to rely on a portion of the Social Security trust fund \n     in balancing the Treasury's books. Though this has happened \n     often in the past, it's a crutch that should not seem \n     necessary in light of record surpluses.\n       But resolving the question hardly seems worth another \n     government shutdown. Nor, I'd add, letting one side escape \n     nearly seven decades of some pretty telling history.\n       My understanding of actuarial tables and most financial \n     matters is no sharper than average. I sometimes lose my way \n     in a maze of bookkeeping totals. But the years have not \n     impaired my memory. And when someone like Republican Whip Tom \n     DeLay, the ex-termite mogul from Texas, impersonates Horatio \n     at the Bridge. I cringe in wonderment.\n       DeLay asks us to believe the Social Security trust fund is \n     under assault by Democrats, and we must trust his party to \n     protect it.\n       I'd sooner entrust a lettuce leaf to a rabbit. Credibility \n     surely matters. In probing the violence at Grandmother's \n     house in the woods, whom do we believe, Little Red Riding \n     Hood or the wolf?\n       Here is one of those demonstrable facts of history: Had it \n     been left to the Republicans in Congress, we'd never have had \n     Social Security in the first place. Nor Medicare. GOP House \n     and Senate members invariably lined up in opposition to these \n     social programs.\n       As Casey Stengel would advise, you could look it up.\n       Midterm elections in the Depression year 1934 had reduced \n     GOP ranks in the House to fewer than 90 members. Yet when \n     President Roosevelt's original Social Security bill neared \n     passage the following year, every Republican present voted \n     to ``recommit'' the measure. To send it back to committee, \n     that is, to kill it.\n       It was much the same with Medicare nearly 30 years later. \n     In July, 1962, only five Republican senators supported \n     President Kennedy's plea for this historic expansion of \n     Social Security--which then failed on a 52-48 vote. The \n     eventual enactment of Medicare had to wait three years more.\n       Almost always, top GOP leaders were slow to embrace or to \n     improve the sort of social insurance system long in place \n     among other industrial nations. Sen. Barry Goldwater, the \n     GOP's 1964 presidential candidate, may have doomed his \n     chances in the New Hampshire primary by saying:\n       ``I would like to suggest that Social Security should be \n     made voluntary--that if a person can provide better for \n     himself, let him do it.''\n       And Ronald Reagan? The conservative magazine Human Events \n     in November, 1966, quotes the future president saying \n     ``Social Security ought to be voluntary . . . so those who \n     can make better provision for themselves are allowed to do \n     so.''\n       Ten years later Reagan was telling The New York Times: \n     ``Don't exchange freedom for the soup kitchen of compulsory \n     insurance.''\n       The soup kitchen? It goes without saying that noting in the \n     law prevents any recipient from making better provision for \n     him or herself, as most do. But without the total involvement \n     of all wage earners, Social Security would quickly slip into \n     a massive welfare system for the improvident and unlucky. And \n     higher taxes for the rest.\n       Today's GOP generation offers little more to warm one's \n     hands on. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a one-time \n     economics professor, has openly urged phasing out Social \n     Security. And no less a prophet than ex-Speaker Newt Gingrich \n     tipped his hand upon taking the gavel in 1995.\n       ``Let it wither on the vine,'' was his chilling suggestion \n     for dealing with a system vital to the support of nearly 45 \n     million Americans.\n       I offer the foregoing compendium from public records not to \n     belittle nor to embarrass decent, often likable leaders of \n     past and present. They did not climb the ladder with \n     subnormal IQs, nor by ignoring ordinary folk in their \n     respective states and districts.\n       Dr. Kevorkian, too, seems an intelligent and genial fellow. \n     It's never unreasonable to seek a second opinion.\n       Meanwhile, no matter how earnestly Armey, Delay, et al. ask \n     us to trust them in regard to Social Security, I offer this \n     advice:\n       Don't.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from California, we came to the House \ntogether in 1982. I had never seen you before until the day we had our \norientation. We have served together in the House of Representatives \nand the Senate. You and I have been involved in some very tough \ncampaigns over the years. I have always been so proud of the Senator \nfrom California, because it doesn't matter if you are speaking to the \nLeague of Women Voters or to a high school class, whoever you are \nspeaking to, you say the same thing in response to the same question.\n  You have had tough, hard campaigns, but you have never deviated from \nwhat you believe in. It has caused you some heartache and heartburn \nbecause they have been tough decisions. That is why I am so upset and \nfeel so oppressed, put upon, and don't know what to do about these ads \nrunning all over the country.\n  You can have tough campaigns. A person can run against Barbara Boxer. \nA person can speak out against Barbara Boxer on an issue because they \ndisagree with how you feel on that issue. That is what government is \nall about. That is what governing is all about. But not to come up \nwith, we love Social Security and the Democrats are trying to destroy \nit. That, I am sorry to say, is not fair. It is not right. It is \ndishonest. It is wrong. This is what a totalitarian government is all \nabout. If you tell a lie long enough, people might believe it.\n\n[[Page S13372]]\n\n  I hope the American people will not believe the lie being perpetrated \naround this country by the Republicans saying Democrats are trying to \ndestroy Social Security. We founded Social Security. Just as \nCongressman Van Deerlin said, we did it on the votes of Democrats. We \nhave saved Social Security. We are the ones who stopped it from being \nplaced in the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, where \nthey would raid the funds more. What is happening around the country is \ndistasteful. It is wrong. It is dishonest. It is repugnant. Somebody \nshould speak out against it. That is why you are here today.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am so proud of the Senator's leadership today on this \nissue and so many others. I think these ads are going to backlash. In \nthe end, the truth will come out. The American people are fair people. \nThe American people are going to judge us, and they are going to judge \nus harshly on what we say and what we do. But they want the truth.\n  I do believe that with this kind of writing by Congressman Van \nDeerlin, who left the Congress a long time ago but still carries a \ntremendous amount of respect, his being, in his own conscience, unable \nto let this go and writing such strong words with a sense of humor--and \neditorials are popping up all over the country--I think the Republican \nParty is going to find a backlash across this Nation. I believe in my \nheart people will understand what they are doing.\n  It is fair to attack a candidate, a Senator, a Presidential \ncandidate, a President on an issue. It is fair to do that. It is not \nfair to make up a story, make up a scenario because you have taken a \npoll and you know you are on the wrong side.\n  As I said today, the Republicans say they created a lockbox for \nSocial Security. They forgot to tell us, they have the key. They \nalready opened up that lockbox to give $18 billion to the programs they \nwant. It is similar to the crab apple analogy before. They are taking \nout those apples, $18 billion, and then they hold the key.\n  The bottom line is, to say we are not protecting Social Security \ndoesn't pass the smell test or the laugh test or the test of time or \nthe test of history.\n  I am, again, proud of my friend for taking the floor.\n  Mr. REID. In closing our dialog, I have confidence in the sense the \nSenator has, that this will all come out. I hope the Senator is right. \nMy concern is--based upon what Senator Daschle a few minutes ago, when \nhe said they have put in the landfill, the graveyard, campaign finance \nreform--money can sure confuse a lot of things. When they are spending \nmillions and millions of dollars on these false and misleading ads, I \nhope we can right the ship. We need to speak out. I again tell the \nSenator from California how much respect I have for her for standing \nup, always, for what she thinks is right.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We will fight for the truth.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I wonder if the Senator from Nevada shares my same \nfrustration that the Republicans are distorting the record of Social \nSecurity and their efforts to protect it. Like you, I lived through the \ndays of the Republican revolution back in 1995, when they literally \nwere talking about dismantling the Social Security system. Their \ncurrent track seems to be entirely bogus. But at the same time they are \ndistorting Social Security, they are also turning their backs on the \nneed in our country for some important legislation.\n  Many of them have been mentioned, but there is one, I think, that \nwarrants particular emphasis. That is hate crimes legislation. After \nthe tragic death of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming, of James Byrd in Texas, \nthe tragedy at Columbine, and arsons at synagogues in Sacramento, it is \nhigh time we took a very simple step to provide the full ambit of our \ncivil rights protection for those crimes that are hate oriented, that \nhave been based upon gender or disability or sexual orientation. Yet \nthat, too, is in, as our leader said, the landfill of legislation that \nhas become this Congress to date.\n  I wonder if the Senator shares my frustration about that?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island has mentioned \nthree of the most dramatic and most publicized incidents, but they are \nhappening every day in America, tragic events where someone is being \nhurt, maimed, killed, because they are a Jew, because their skin is a \ndifferent color--it may be black; it may be brown. The fact is, \nsomebody may have a different lifestyle with which someone doesn't \nagree. People every day are being hurt in America.\n  There may be people who disagree with what we want to do with this \nhate crimes legislation. But in the light of the Senate, couldn't we \nhave a debate on it? I know the Senator from Rhode Island would agree \non a very short time limit. I think we could do all we have to do in 2 \nor 3 hours, debate this issue and have an up-or-down vote on it. \nDoesn't the Senator think the American people deserve a debate and a \nvote on this issue?\n  Mr. REED. I do, indeed, agree with the Senator. What also strikes me \nas particularly ironic is, when one of these incidents occurs, across \nthe spectrum of political thought, across the spectrum of this body, \nthere is unanimous condemnation. There is a lot of moralizing, a lot of \ntalk about isn't this horrible. Yet we have it within our power, as the \nSenator suggests, to bring this legislation to the floor, to have a \ndebate, to constructively engage, to compromise, not on principles but \non details, so we can fulfill our legislative responsibilities.\n  Yet what frustrates me, and I believe also the Senator from Nevada, \nis the fact that none of this is taking place, that all of this is \nbeing shoved off to the sideline so that we are not able to do our \njobs. And while we are being frustrated, I should say that, as the \nSenator pointed out so accurately, these hate crimes go on day in and \nday out. Some are very publicized, some are not getting attention. It \nis frustrating and it is wrong. All we are asking for a very simple \nremedy. Let's make the protections of the hate crimes bill within the \nambit of our civil rights laws. Let us be able to give our enforcement \nauthorities the power to deal with crimes that are based upon \ndisability, gender, or sexual orientation. If we do that, then I think \nwe will advance the cause of justice in this society.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are talking statistics and we are talking \nabout names of people whom we don't know, such as Matthew Byrd, the \nyoung man in Wyoming. But the fact is, every day in America, someone's \nhusband, son, daughter, or wife is being hurt--a real person--and we in \nthe Senate and this Congress have the power to make their lives a \nlittle better, to make sure that an example is set when somebody \ncommits a despicable act, and that it will become a crime that should \nbe--in the greatest country in the world, you should not be able to \noppress people because of race, color, creed, religion, or their \nlifestyle. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. REED. Absolutely. One thing that resonates throughout this entire \ndialog this afternoon is the fact that our inaction costs individual \nAmericans; it costs them better health care, it costs them better \neducation, it costs them the right to have a Federal judiciary that is \nfully staffed by competent and committed judges, and it costs many \nliterally their lives because our indifference to hate crimes can do \nnothing to stop them. In fact, one could suggest they create an \nenvironment that does not discourage them and therefore might encourage \nthem. But, in any case, our inaction means that Americans are bearing \nthe costs, and these costs can be avoided simply by bringing to the \nfloor legislation and by moving with respect to this legislation in a \nprompt and purposeful way. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am about to yield the floor because I know \nthe Senator from South Carolina has had time to have a breather and the \nSenator is now rejuvenated and ready to go on for a while longer.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think now is the time that a record should be made \nthat this isn't a question of consuming time in the sense the majority \nleader wants to move in an expeditious fashion to the legislation. He \ndoesn't want to hear it, and he doesn't want anybody else to discuss \nthese items. Let's look at the facts.\n\n[[Page S13373]]\n\n  This bill was called on Friday and we had a motion to proceed since \neverybody was leaving town. I wanted to discuss it and wanted to have \nsomeone to talk to. I objected to the motion to proceed. I guess it was \na week ago Thursday night when they discussed and voted on other \nmatters on Friday. It was set again for Monday's discussion, but then \nwe lost our wonderful colleague, Senator Chafee. In respect to him, we \ndidn't debate anything. Instead we all expressed our sympathy and deep \nsense of individual loss of such a wonderful colleague, who was so \nconsiderate and so moderate in the sense of listening to both sides, \nand willing to discuss issues. On Tuesday, we made opening statements \nagain--Senator Moynihan and Senator Roth and myself. I had to leave, \nbut it was thoroughly discussed all day Tuesday. On Wednesday, I was \nprepared, having returned early in the morning. I had to testify before \na council meeting back in my own hometown on Tuesday evening. But I was \nback here early.\n  Mr. REID. That was because your house burned down.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is exactly right. What happens is, on Wednesday \nmorning, we didn't have the side agreements about NAFTA. We were being \ntold this was good because of NAFTA and that NAFTA worked--at least \nNAFTA had side agreements on environment, labor, reciprocity, and \notherwise. Even though I was gone, my staff worked on the legislation.\n\n  When I took the floor on Wednesday morning, I was not recognized to \nhave the floor. I said I just wanted to discuss these amendments but \nthe Senate was conducting a quorum call. The leadership waited for an \nhour and a half for the leader to come and did not allow any \ndiscussion. I had gotten up twice and they would not even give me \nconsent to talk about the amendments, which is really what I had to \nmind.\n  Then the leader comes in and he so-called filled up the tree, but \nreally he put it on the fast track. Namely, I could not, or you could \nnot, or anybody on this side of the aisle could not offer an amendment. \nNow, on the other side of the aisle, the Senator from Illinois can get \nhis amendment in at the committee hearing. He can get his amendment in \nwhen the leader puts down the managers' amendment. He can get that \ntaken care of there. Or you can do as Senator Ashcroft of Missouri did. \nHe got the leader to call down the last amendment, come to the floor \nand put up his agricultural amendment and, in the same breath, say the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota is irrelevant. That is how \ngauche, arrogant, and unsenatorial this thing is. I never heard of such \na thing. They just lock you out and say, as has been pointed out, we \nfilled up the tree, and only Members on that side of the aisle can \nenjoy the fruits of the tree.\n  Here we are. So don't have the majority leader come back and have the \naudacity to say these are important matters; you all want to \nfilibuster. He is the one. I told him, up or down, I would take five \nminutes to a side on amendments and we will have a roll call. He \ndoesn't want to have this subject up.\n  We ought to have Members on that side have at least the courage to \nget up and say, wait a minute, these are important subjects. I would \nthink somebody on the other side of the aisle would like to talk about \nthe minimum wage. They say 83 percent of the people of America favor \nit. We know what the situation is. Yet they won't even broach the \nsubject. They don't want the subject to come up. All we are hearing \nwhen the leader comes is this is a tough job and these are the things \nwe have to do, and I would be glad to take two or three amendments. I \nsaid, wait a minute. I would be glad to offer two amendments right now, \nwith five minutes to a side, and have a vote, or have 20 minutes to a \nhalf hour of discussion and then vote, and we will be through with it.\n  Instead of doing that, it is a closeout of discussing important \nsubjects for the American people. From Friday of last week until \ntonight, Thursday night, the majority was absolutely opposed to you \ngetting the floor whatsoever to discuss it. All of these subjects--\nSocial Security, education measures, the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nhealth matters--the majority said was irrevelant. We are going to try \nand complete our spending bills and try our dead level best to do it \nwithout using Social Security. This comes at the very same time that \neven their own Congressional Budget Office says Congress has already \nspent $18 billion of Social Security monies.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say this to the Senator from South Carolina before I \ngive up the floor. We have talked today about a couple of very \nimportant items, separate and apart from this underlying legislation, \nto show what we have been unable to accomplish because they have put \nstuff in the graveyard, the dump yard. The Senator from South Carolina \nhas spoken out more vividly and clearly than anybody else in this body \nabout the need for campaign finance reform, and I have supported the \nSenator from South Carolina with the constitutional amendment. That is \nthe only way I think we can solve the problem once and for all. Does \nthe Senator agree?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir. I have tried my best. I would like to bring \nit up. I am a realist. Let's bring up Shays-Meehan, which passed by a \nstrong bipartisan vote over on the House side. You would think it could \nbe voted upon, but it has not even been further discussed. We could \nhave 30 seconds to a side and vote. They won't let you vote.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to my friend, we have had a lot of talk today \nabout Social Security. I want the Record to be spread with the fact \nthat the Senator from South Carolina has been one of the leaders who \nhas been there every step of the way on making sure that we do not use \nSocial Security surpluses to balance the budget.\n  The Senator from South Carolina and I attended meetings at the \nSheraton Hotel when there were just a few of us. The Senator will \nremember that we were fighting this onslaught to have a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. The Senator recalls the grief and the \neditorials written about us because we said it is wrong to use Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n  Does the Senator remember that?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I remember it very vividly. The truth is that I finally \nsaid: Let's cut out the charade. Let's go to Social Security itself. \nSo, I asked the Administrator of Social Security: You folks write the \nbill so that rather than using Social Security monies for IOUs and the \ndebt, we put it up in a lockbox. I want to make sure it is a truly, \nhonest-to-goodness lockbox.\n  So he wrote the measure, and I introduced it back in January. It went \nto the Budget Committee, on which I serve. I asked for a hearing but \ncouldn't get one. They do not want to hear about a true lockbox.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from South Carolina could be the ranking \nmember, and in the majority he would be chairman of that committee.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. I was the chairman under President Carter.\n  Mr. REID. It is not as if the Senator from South Carolina is a junior \nmember of the Budget Committee. He is a senior member of the Democratic \nParty, and he can't even have a hearing on the bill in the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I worked on the bill with Senator Muskie; we wrote the \nlaw. I have been on the Budget Committee ever since it was created. I \nthink Senator Domenici and I are the only two Members who have been on \nthe committee since its inception.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, I say to my friend from South Carolina that the \ndebate here is not over. The Senator from South Carolina is not the \nreason this bill isn't going forward. The reason this bill is not going \nforward is that they will not allow the Senator from South Carolina to \noffer an amendment. I don't know, but I assume the Senator might want \nto offer an amendment on minimum wage, or he might want to offer the \nShays-Meehan bill. He would agree to 5 minutes to each side to speak on \neach one of those. We have had 7 days. If we had those with 20 minutes \nout of 6 days to speak, that isn't much time, is it?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not at all. That is what we ought to emphasize. It \nisn't a matter of time and holding the process up or any of those kind \nof things. It is that these important subjects will not be touched upon \npolitically because all that is being done is geared toward the next \nelection, the polls, and everything else of that kind. The majority \ndoesn't want to make unpopular votes. So you are protected with this \narrogant kind\n\n[[Page S13374]]\n\nof thing of filling up the tree, instituting fast track, and blocking \namendments except those checked through the Majority Leader's office. \nAnd I hope this is publicized. I hope they have a conscience and will \nquit this nonsense so we can save time, discuss the subjects, vote up \nor down, and move on like an orderly body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment or two \nto respond to some of the charges that have been leveled on the floor.\n  After listening to the colloquy that has gone on for some time, the \nonly thing I think is accurate out of it is that I would agree that my \nfriend from South Carolina has fought for years to ban Congress from \nplundering the Social Security trust fund. He has been a leader in that \nfight. But the one thing I would point out is that the whole other side \nof the aisle has been voting time and time again this year against \ndoing just that--locking up the Social Security trust fund so it can't \nbe spent on other programs.\n  Ever since the Social Security program was created, all the money \nthat has been poured into it that is over and above that necessary to \npay current Social Security benefits has been taken out and spent on \nother programs. That is not right. I and my friend from South Carolina \nagree with that.\n  I know Senator Hollings, as he has said before--if somebody in the \nprivate sector were to reach into an employee's pension fund and take \nthat money out and spend it for some other purpose than the employee's \npension, they would go to jail under laws that we in Congress have \npassed.\n  My understanding is as well that a few years back Congress made it \nillegal for anybody in State or local governments to raid one of their \npension funds.\n  It is important that Congress move forward now to once and for all \nban the plundering of the Social Security trust fund so we are setting \naside money and are in a better financial position come the year 2015 \nto pay the Social Security benefits of the baby boomers as they retire.\n  I have to say that if, indeed, my friends on the other side of the \naisle are in favor of banning Congress and the Government in Washington \nfrom spending Social Security trust funds on other programs, why has it \nbeen that they have voted against cloture on our Social Security \nlockbox proposal time and time again this year?\n  It is for that reason I disagree with my friend from California, who \nsaid she thought the criticism was unfair in some of those television \nads she was talking about. I don't think it is unfair. How can you vote \nagainst a Social Security lockbox but then say you really want to \nprotect Social Security? I think it is a very fair point that \nRepublicans have been making. It is a fair criticism of the other side \nof the aisle.\n  Furthermore, I point out that the other side of the aisle has \nproposed one new spending bill after the other, and we have no surplus \nother than the Social Security trust fund. If we want to have more \nmoney for spending, where are we going to get that money? The only \nplace to take it, unless you are proposing a tax increase, is to take \nit out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  Isn't it intellectually dishonest to stand here and say we support \nprotecting Social Security but at the same time get up and propose a \nwhole bunch of new spending bills that there is absolutely no way to \npay for without either a tax increase or another raid on Social \nSecurity? To my friends on the other side of the aisle, I have to say I \nthink the criticism has been fair.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has said, as my friends from \nCalifornia and Nevada have said, that Republicans have put some of your \nproposals in what you call the ``legislative graveyard.'' But don't \nforget those times this summer and before this summer when, time and \ntime again, my Democratic friends put the Social Security lockbox \nprogram in the graveyard, from which it still has not emerged. It has \nonly been with repeated pressure that this side of the aisle, on the \nadministration and on the appropriators, has largely been able to set \naside the money that is in surplus in Social Security so it will not be \nspent on other programs.\n  I am hopeful that someday I can work with Senator Hollings to get the \nstrongest possible protection for those Social Security trust funds. \nRight now, when we are talking about a lockbox, we are really just \ntalking about using that money to pay down the Government debt--the \ndebt that is now in the hands of people who own Government bonds. We \nare really still not at the point where we can talk about creating a \nreal trust fund that has real money in it that is available to pay \nbenefits. I think someday we need to make that trust fund a real trust \nfund.\n\n  But the problem with that is, in order to cross that line, we have to \nhave the great national debate as to where we are going to invest that \nmoney because if we are going to make the Social Security trust fund a \nreal fund--I favor doing that--we are going to have to cross a \nthreshold on this issue of what we want that real money to be invested \nin.\n  Until we have had that debate and reached consensus on that issue, it \nis appropriate that we take that $3.5 trillion in debt we now owe to \npeople who own Government bonds in this country and all around the \nworld and use the Social Security excess to pay down that debt. That is \nabsolutely the best use of the money. It is far superior to taking it \nand frittering it away on other programs and leaving our external debt \nat such high levels.\n  I, again, compliment my friend from South Carolina. He has been the \none person I have found in this Senate who agrees with me on this issue \nthat it is wrong for Washington to be telling the American people we \nhave a budget surplus when, in fact, the national debt is still going \nup. It will go up almost $100 billion.\n  The biggest adjustment I have had coming to Washington, as a first-\nyear freshman coming from a private sector background in banking, is \ngetting used to the Washington math. When I looked at the first budget \nproposal that said we will have trillions of dollars' worth of \nsurpluses between now and 2015, and I looked at the back of the budget \nand it had a schedule of the national debt which is going up every \nyear, I asked, how can the national debt be rising if we are running \nsurpluses? Obviously, that doesn't make any sense. That is an \naccounting trick. If anybody in the private sector used that kind of \naccounting, they would be in jail. They would have ankle bracelets on. \nThat is a disgrace. It is misleading.\n  I thought the President's address, when he told the country we were \ngoing to pay off the national debt by 2015, was very reckless. It was \nreckless of him to so mislead people. He was talking about one of only \ntwo components of our national debt. There are two components of the \nnational debt: debt we owe to people who own government bonds and debt \nwe owe to pension and trust funds, such as the Social Security trust \nfund and the Federal employees pension fund.\n  We have a President who has a well-deserved reputation for choosing \nhis words carefully. I looked at his statement and couldn't find \nanything he said that was inaccurate. He said we were going to pay down \nthe debt owed to the public by 2015. What he did not tell the American \npeople, and what Congress has not told the American people, is that the \nother portion of the national debt, that portion owed to government \npension and trust funds, is going to quadruple between now and 2015.\n\n  Senator Hollings has used the analogy of a family who has a Visa and \na MasterCard. In our own families, we would not go home and uncork the \nchampagne when paying down the Visa by putting more debt on the \nMasterCard. Such dubious refinancing is no cause for celebration. Yet \nall over Washington they are uncorking the champagne because they are \npaying down one portion of the national debt; they are not telling \nanybody the other portion is continuing to skyrocket.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator talked about the lockbox bill before the \nSenate. Does the Senator agree it would be appropriate that the \nDemocrats, the minority, should be able to offer one amendment on your \nlockbox proposal?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I have no problem with offering an amendment. I am \nhappy to vote on it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, I appreciate his candor. \nI appreciate the Senator indicating he doesn't\n\n[[Page S13375]]\n\nthink there is anything wrong with it. Either do we. That is what this \nis about.\n  The majority, the Republicans, have a lockbox proposal; and we do, \ntoo. What we think should happen is the Republicans offer their \nproposal, we offer ours, we have a debate. That is what this body is \nall about.\n  I have followed the short career in the Senate of the Senator from \nIllinois. I have acknowledged and appreciated some tough votes the \nSenator has cast against the majority in opposition to most of the \npeople on the Senator's side of the aisle. I think that is good.\n  The Social Security debate is one where we should be honest with one \nanother. There are ads running around America sponsored by the \nRepublican Congressional Campaign Committee and the RNC, Republican \nNational Committee, that say with this Congress, this year, the \nDemocrats are spending Social Security money.\n  We have done our best to make the point that is simply not true, and \nI believe there are people of good will, of which I think the Senator \nfrom Illinois has the ability to be one of those, to speak out against \nthose ads. They add nothing to the political process. They only take \naway from it.\n  That is the point we have been talking about today. The ads are \ndisingenuous. They are wrong.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I want to follow up on that. I said earlier I think \nthe ads are fair in light of the fact that Democrats have voted against \nthe lockbox several times this year.\n  Certainly the Senator would agree the Senator's party has run ads. I \nwas the recipient of $3 million worth of soft money ads that accused me \nof wanting to do everything except take away Christmas from the people \nin this country.\n  What has mainly come out in this colloquy on your side of the aisle \nis that the Senator has stated a good case why it is better to be in \nthe majority than in the minority.\n  Mr. REID. My friend from Illinois learns quickly. The fact is, that \nis not how this body has run in the past. For over 200 years, this body \nhas been able to survive in comity. We recognize the minority has \nrights. There was a time not long ago when the Democrats had a veto-\nproof majority in the body but the Republicans were not treated badly.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, Democrats have voted against no \nlockbox provision. We have voted to sustain our rights to be able to \noffer an amendment to the Senator's lockbox proposal so there could be \na debate. If, in fact, the Senator thinks those ads are running because \nwe voted against lockbox, I respectfully submit the Senator needs to \nstudy the issue more.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I say to my friend from Nevada, I wonder if there are \nany Senate rules that have changed from the time the Democrats were in \nthe majority and now when the Republicans are in the majority that the \nSenator could identify that he thinks have unfairly cut off the rights \nof the minority. Have any rules changed?\n  Mr. REID. That is the whole point. The rules have not changed.\n  The fact is, however, the majority is not treating this body in the \nsenatorial tradition. The rules have held that we in the Senate have \nthe right to offer amendments. This body is being treated like a House \nof Representatives where a bill comes upon the floor, there is a rule \noffered, and that is it. The so-called tree is filled up, we can offer \nno amendments, and we are locked out of offering amendments.\n  That is what the Senator from South Carolina has been saying. All we \nwant is to offer amendments. Shouldn't the Senate of the United States \nbe able to have a debate on minimum wage?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I think we have already, to some extent. We have had \none or two votes that I can recall earlier this year. But the question \nis, How many times will Members keep bringing up the same issues?\n  Mr. REID. I have the greatest respect for my friend's intellect. We \nhave had just one vote this year on minimum wage. We didn't have one \nlast year. Or the year before.\n  We want to have a debate. We want to have an amendment offered where \nwe raise minimum wage. We have not had the opportunity to do that. If \nthe majority doesn't agree, fine. The Senator from South Carolina said \nhe would agree to a 10-minute time limit on minimum wage. I am not sure \nI can agree to 10 minutes, but I certainly agree to 2 hours.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, picking that one issue, doesn't the \nSenator think it would be appropriate this body debate minimum wage?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Absolutely, and I am sure we will at some point. I do \nknow we had some votes, whether they were procedural or actually \nsubstantive, on minimum wage because I talked to Senator Kennedy about \nit. He was very pleased with my vote earlier this year on that. We have \nhad some votes that touched on that area.\n  I was not in the Senate before this year, so I can't comment on how \nit was run when the other side was in the majority. My impressions from \nspeaking to some of my senior colleagues on this side of the aisle is \nthat they felt it was always very difficult for them to be in the \nminority. I think they probably often felt the frustrations that the \nSenator is feeling now.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the last several hours on the floor of \nthe Senate, we have discussed basically the business of the Senate over \nthe last year. A lot of us focused on Social Security. It is a curious \nthing that this program, which once was so controversial, has now \nbecome so universally lauded and acceptable that both political parties \nare determined to be portrayed as the guardians of Social Security.\n  Coming from the Democratic side of the aisle, the party of Franklin \nRoosevelt, I think our party has good claim to the authorship of the \noriginal program of Social Security and the fact it has been sustained, \nnow, for some 62 years primarily because of Democratic support.\n  Having said that, though, I will concede over the years what started \noff as Republican opposition to Social Security has mellowed to some \nextent, and they now embrace it where once they called it socialism and \nbig government and the New Deal and Franklin Roosevelt run amok. They \nnow have come to a different conclusion since millions of Americans and \ntheir families rely on Social Security to live independent and decent \nlives after their retirement. The debate now seems to focus on, what \nare we going to do with the excess money collected--for instance, in \npayroll taxes for Social Security? Should the Government be allowed to \nborrow that money and the money then be used for some other purpose and \npaid back to Social Security with interest? Or should the money be held \nsacred and apart, untouchable? That seems to be where the debate is.\n  The television ads, which have been the source of a lot of debate on \nthe floor, relate to an effort by the Republican Party, soon to be \nanswered by the Democrats, to blame us for somehow spending the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  It is an interesting claim to make for several reasons. First, we are \nthe minority party. We do not pass bills here; the Republicans pass the \nspending bills. So to blame us for a spending bill which reaches into \nthe Social Security trust fund just defies arithmetic and common sense. \nIf there has been a bill passed, a spending bill, it has been initiated \nby the Republican leadership. It has come forward and been sent to the \nPresident primarily with Republican votes. For them to suggest one of \nthese bills went over the line and reached into the Social Security \ntrust fund and blame the Democrats for it is really a stretch.\n  But I will tell you what we can point to, and it is not in the area \nof spending bills. It was a project by the Republican Party just a few \nmonths ago initiating an idea of a massive tax cut. The party, the \nRepublican Party, which had bemoaned deficits for years, to the point \nof calling for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, now, \nwhen they heard of the possibility of a surplus at the Federal level, \nanswered by suggesting we should have a tax cut of some $792 billion \ngiven primarily, if not exclusively, to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. They thought this was going to be a big winner. It was an echo \nof Senator Robert Dole's Presidential campaign where, when he could not \nget traction against President Clinton, he came up with the Dole tax \ncut.\n\n[[Page S13376]]\n\n  It did not work for Senator Dole then. It certainly did not work for \nthe Republican Party a few months ago. They took this idea back to the \nStates, and people universally said: What are you talking about? Why \nwould you, after years and years of deficits, be giving a $792 billion \ntax cut primarily to wealthy people? If you are going to do anything, \ntake the money and pay down our national debt which costs us $1 billion \na day in interest. If we have a surplus, make sure Social Security is \nsound and solid for decades to come. Put the money into Medicare, make \ncertain it is there for generations to come, for our parents and \ngrandparents who will need it.\n\n  In fact, those who analyzed the Republican tax cut said, \nincidentally, of the $792 billion, at least $83 billion of that has to \ncome out of the Social Security trust fund.\n  So the Republican Party that is pointing its finger at Democrats and \nsaying we are raiding the Social Security trust fund had a tax cut \npackage primarily for the wealthy which dipped its hand into the Social \nSecurity trust fund for $83 billion. That is a fact.\n  Now let's take a look at the spending bills, the Republican spending \nbills, keeping in mind the Republicans control both the House and \nSenate and Appropriations Committees and have now broken from the \ntradition of Congress which used to call for bipartisan meetings of the \nAppropriations Committees. They are very partisan now. I am a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee here in the Senate, and I was in the \nHouse. For years, we worked on a bipartisan basis in an effort to try \nto pass bills. I am sad to say, now, many times we are not even called \nfor meetings. The Republicans author these bills and put them together, \nbring them to the floor, and basically the Democrats are not part of \nthat process.\n  What do we make of the claim by the Republicans that the Democrats \nare reaching into the Social Security trust fund? The most recent thing \nwe have to point to is a letter from the Congressional Budget Office. \nThis is one of the two offices we turn to for answers to questions such \nas: If we initiate a certain program, how much will it cost us? How \nmuch will this program cost us each month? Will it add to the deficit \nor to the surplus? All of the basic questions that need to be answered \nto be responsible in budgeting.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has today sent a letter--yesterday, I \nbelieve--to Congressman John Spratt, the ranking Democrat on the House \nBudget Committee. Congressman Spratt, a friend of mine and former \ncolleague, asked the Congressional Budget Office whether or not the \nspending bills already passed by the Republicans and sent to the \nPresident, reached into the Social Security trust fund. The \nCongressional Budget Office, which enjoys a reputation primarily for \nbeing nonpartisan, replied that the Republicans have already spent $17 \nbillion of the Social Security trust fund.\n  They then asked the Congressional Budget Office, in the same letter, \nWhat about the proposed 1-percent across-the-board reductions in \nspending which the Republicans now propose as a way to solve all our \nproblems and go home? It was the conclusion of the Congressional Budget \nOffice that, if the Republicans really wanted to keep their hands off \nSocial Security and not reach in the trust fund, certainly 1 percent \nacross-the-board was not going to do it; they had to find some $17 \nbillion to be made up that they have already reached into the trust \nfund for. They said it would take another 4.8-percent cut across the \nboard for that to happen, meaning 5.8 percent would have to be cut from \nall budgets of the Federal Government to avoid touching the Social \nSecurity trust fund, just with appropriations bills already enacted by \nthe Republican majority in the House and the Senate--5.8 percent.\n  Then they went on to say--and this is important considering the \nrealities of politics in Washington--if you take off the table the \ndefense budget, saying our national security cannot stand the 5.8-\npercent cut, military construction --part of the same argument, and \nveterans programs, which both parties hold dear, everything else will \nhave to be cut 11.8 percent.\n\n  Here we are, deep into the next fiscal year. We do not have our \nappropriations in order. In order to balance the books and not touch \nSocial Security, the Republicans would have to cut almost 12 percent \nacross the board in budgets for things such as education; Head Start; \nWomen, Infants and Children; Meals on Wheels--things on which senior \ncitizens rely.\n  What a curious state of affairs that only a few weeks ago Republicans \ntold us we were so awash in money, we could give out a $792 billion tax \ncut to the wealthiest people in this country and now have come back to \ntell us we are in such dire straits that they, frankly, have to be \ncutting education by 10 or 11 percent in order to balance the books. \nThat, to me, shows the basic emptiness of this argument that has been \nmade against the Democrats and so many others.\n  The sad reality is that we come to the end of the session and find \nourselves bereft of accomplishment. Having been sent to Washington to \nrespond to the needs of America's families, we have dropped the ball. I \nhave said repeatedly, if you held a gun to the head of any Senator in \nthis body and said I am going to shoot you unless you tell me what you \nhave done to help average American families lead a better life and have \nmore opportunity, I would have to say: Fire away. I can't point to a \nthing.\n  What did we do on minimum wage? Nothing, absolutely nothing; turning \nour backs on the millions of people who go to work every day in this \ncountry stuck at a minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. The Republicans will \nnot even allow us to debate the issue. The greedy big-business \ninterests that will not give working families a decent living wage have \nprevailed over those who get up and go to work every single morning--\nprimarily women, many minorities--working at minimum wage, showing they \nbelieve in the work ethic, and hoping this body and the House of \nRepresentatives will be sensitive to their need for more resources for \ntheir families.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights: How many times have I been across \nIllinois and met families, sat down with them, and doctors, and nurses? \nThey have told me horror story after horror story of trying to provide \nquality medical care for people in need only to be turned down by \ninsurance companies; Doctors on telephones debating with insurance \ncompany clerks about surgeries and hospital admissions and different \nmedications that the doctor thinks are necessary, and losing the debate \nevery single time.\n  We want to stop these faceless bureaucrats in the insurance companies \nmaking life-or-death decisions without any medical training. We want \nfamilies across this country to be able to sit down across the table \nfrom a doctor when someone is seriously ill and be treated in an \nhonest, competent, professional way.\n  We lost that fight on the floor of the Senate. No, let me take that \nback. We did not lose that fight; America's families lost that fight \nhere. Do you know to whom we lost it? Another special interest group. \nThe health insurance lobby prevailed big time in this bill, and \nAmerica's families lost big time, and that is another failure of this \nyear we have spent here on Capitol hill.\n  Campaign finance reform: This is truly a bipartisan issue. Senator \nJohn McCain, a Republican candidate for President from the State of \nArizona, and Senator Russ Feingold, who sits behind me, a Democrat from \nthe State of Wisconsin, came forward with a bipartisan way to clean up \nthis mess of campaign financing that has everybody across America so \ncynical about our process.\n  The President supports it. In fact, a majority of Senators support \nit. Fifty-five voted in favor of it. That is not good enough for the \nSenate; we need 60 votes. We could not dislodge some 45 Republicans who \nare bound and determined to keep this miserable system in place. This \nis another failure of this Congress.\n  Sensible gun control: How many times, walking into the Cloakroom \nright behind the Senate floor, have I been startled to hear a news \nflash on CNN that in another high school in America, there is more \nviolence, kids being shot, teachers being shot, the grief of parents, \nand the visits by the President and the Vice President, news magazines \nand shows on television just focusing for days and weeks on violence in \nschools.\n  People across Illinois and across America say: Senator, what are you\n\n[[Page S13377]]\n\ndoing to make this a safer place to live, to protect our kids?\n  We work up all kinds of speeches in this Chamber, but what do we do? \nWe have one bill, a sensible gun control bill, which says if you want \nto buy a gun at a gun show, we have a right to ask whether or not you \nhave a criminal record or a history of violent mental illness. That \nbill passed the Senate with the vote of Vice President Gore breaking a \ntie. It went over to the House and disappeared. Sensible gun control. \nNothing is going to happen this year. The Republican majority in the \nHouse and the Senate do not want to act on that issue.\n  I pray to God there is never another school tragedy in America, but \nif there is, each of us will be held accountable as to whether we did \neverything we could to keep guns out of the hands of kids and those who \nwould misuse them, criminals and those with serious background \nproblems.\n  This Senate passed a bill, barely; the House Republicans killed it. \nThe National Rifle Association, another special interest group, won and \nAmerica's families and schoolkids lost again.\n  100,000 teachers: This is a program the President has proposed for \none simple reason. He believes, and I agree with him as a parent who \nhas raised three kids, that if you can have fewer kids in a classroom, \nyou have a better chance of paying attention to their needs.\n  I went to Wheaton High School and met with a teacher who had 15 kids \nin her class. She was part of the President's program. She said: Thank \nyou; I can help the kids who are falling behind and the gifted kids; it \nreally works better when I have a smaller class size.\n  What parent would not agree? I remember how tranquil life was with \none child in our house and how hectic it became when the second and \nthird arrived. Imagine a classroom of 20, 30 kids. The President said: \nReduce the size of that class and I bet you have more kids who can \nread, learn basic math, and have a better chance for their education.\n  The Republicans want to kill it. They do not agree. Last year, they \nvoted for it; this year, they want to kill it. This is a partisan \nbattle. The losers are the families across America who expect us to do \nsomething in Washington to make education better for our kids and give \nthem a chance.\n\n  Cops on the Beat Program: I see my friend, Senator Leahy, from the \nJudiciary Committee. I am proud to serve with him. He was one of the \nleaders on the President's program to send 100,000 police to local \ncommunities and reduce crime.\n  Do my colleagues know what happened when we sent policemen out to the \ncities of Chicago, and Cairo, IL, and across America? The crime rate \ncame down. The people who wanted to commit a crime looked around and \nsaw there were a few more cops and squad cars and decided not to do it. \nThank goodness. It meant fewer victims and less crime perpetrated on \nthe people in this country.\n  The Republicans fought us tooth and nail. They do not want to \ncontinue this program despite its proven success. They have put \npartisanship ahead of reality. The reality is we all want to be safe in \nour neighborhoods. We want our kids safe in school. The President has a \nprogram that works, and they want to kill it, stop the 100,000 COPS \nProgram. That is so shortsighted.\n  The Medicare prescription drug program: Here is one where seniors \nacross America tell us--Senator Dodd from Connecticut, Senator Leahy, \nand others--that this is a very real concern, paying that bill every \nsingle month for these prescription drugs that Medicare does not cover. \nThe President has a plan to move us forward. The Republicans say: Oh, \nhere comes a brand new program.\n  They have a self-financing mechanism, as they should, to make certain \nwe do not cause any more problems to the fiscal picture in the Medicare \nprogram. The fact that we cannot move forward on this Presidential \nsuggestion of a Medicare prescription drug program is going to be a \nserious problem for seniors across America.\n  So we come to the end of this session with an empty basket, with \nnothing to show to families across America. Oh, we have drawn our \npaychecks, we punched our time cards for our pensions, and we are \nheaded home looking forward to the holidays, and we have nothing to \nshow for it.\n  My basic question to the Republican leadership is, Why are you here? \nWhy do you want to be called leaders if you do not want to lead? Why do \nyou ask to serve in the Senate, which was formerly known as the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world, if you do not even want to \ndeliberate these questions? Why are you afraid to debate these \nquestions? If your position is so sound and solid, for goodness' sake, \nstand up and defend it. Let me argue my best point of view, you do the \nsame, and let's have a rollcall vote up or down, yes or no. Let it be \nprinted in the Congressional Record to be seen by the United States and \nthe world.\n  That is why we are here. That is why we ran for these offices--not \nfor a title but to do something for America's families. We have not \ndone it this year. We have not done anything substantive to help these \nfamilies lead a better life.\n  We have lost opportunities, and I hope we do not continue to lose \nopportunities. We have given in to special interests time and time \nagain. We have forgotten the interest of America's families.\n  I sincerely hope Senator Daschle, who took this floor earlier, \nprevails; that he can convince Senator Lott, the Republican leader, to \nfinally let Senators roll up their sleeves and get down to work. \nGoodness' sake, in the last 2 weeks, let's do something substantial. \nLet's have courage to vote on the issues. To stop debate and put a gag \nrule on Senators so we cannot offer amendments on all the issues I \nmentioned, frankly, is a travesty. It is a travesty not only on those \nwho serve here, but on the history of this great institution of which I \nam proud to be a part.

Mr. President, on Friday, October 29--tomorrow--the Senate \nwill say a fond farewell to one of its longest serving employees, \nsomeone who has been with me almost 19 years, Kathy Keup.\n  Kathy Keup began her Senate service almost 34 years ago. She is one \nof the longest serving employees in the Senate. She began her service \nNovember 1, 1965. On that date, Kathy Keup joined the staff of her home \nState Senator, Ed Muskie of Maine. After nearly 6 years of service with \nSenator Muskie, Kathy Keup served on the staffs of Senator Warren \nMagnuson of Washington and Senator John Culver of Iowa. She also served \nfor several years in the 1970s on the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee.\n  Some of our colleagues who have been here a few years will recall, \nback in those days, it was not uncommon for Senate staff, both \nRepublican and Democratic, to serve for temporary stints on their \ncaucus' campaign committees. As a historical note, the campaign offices \nwere actually located in this building. That practice is long since \nover, but 25, 30 years ago, that was not an uncommon practice.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, for the past 18 years and 9 months, it \nhas been my very good fortune to have Kathy Keup as a member of my \nstaff. In fact, she joined my office just a few days after I was sworn \nin as a new Member of this very body. I can say without any hesitation \nthat each and every day of her time in my office has been marked by a \nconsistent, thorough, and outstanding commitment on her part to serving \nnot only me and the people I represent in Connecticut, but the public \nat large across this country.\n  As a fellow New Englander, perhaps the highest compliment we can \nbestow on any individual is to say they are a true Yankee, and Kathy is \na true Yankee, in all the wonderful meanings of that word. She \nepitomizes the very best values of our region of the country. She is \nvery diligent and hard-working, and respectful of others, no matter \ntheir station in life. She is modest and discreet, a person of few\n\n[[Page S13378]]\n\nwords. Indeed, in an era and in a city where the dubious quality of \nself-promotion is rarely in short supply, Kathy Keup serves as a living \nreminder of the timeless virtue of letting one's work speak for itself.\n  She also possesses the virtues of loyalty and dedication. The \nSenators and others for whom she has worked over the years could always \ntake comfort in knowing she would be at her desk each morning at 7 \no'clock, as she has been with me for almost 19 years, come rain, shine, \nsnow, or whatever the weather.\n  She earned the trust of those around her, not by what she said but by \nwhat she did, reliably and superbly, day in and day out, for these past \n34 years.\n  Each of us who is privileged to serve as a Member of the Senate knows \nwell the importance of having loyal and talented men and women who work \nwith us in this wonderful institution. These public servants may not \nhave their names on election certificates or in the newspapers, but \nthey are vitally important to the ability of the Senate to function on \nbehalf of the American people. In a very real sense, they make the \nwheels of this democracy turn every single day. And in so doing, they \nmake real the timeless promise of our representative government.\n  Kathy Keup has dedicated her working life--her entire working life--\nto the Senate. By her efforts over more than a third of a century, she \nhas made an invaluable contribution to this institution and to the \ncountry as a whole. She epitomizes what a Senate staff person should \nbe. She has rendered truly exemplary service to this individual \nSenator, to our former colleagues whom I mentioned already, to the \nSenate, and to our Nation.\n  Come next Monday morning, I will call the office, I suppose out of \nhabit, at around 7 or 7:15. And that voice will not be there, as it has \nbeen for almost 19 years. Kathy will return to a place she calls home--\nher beloved Maine. I know I speak for all who have worked with her over \nthese past 34 years, in saying thank you for all she has done to make \nthis a better place. And on their behalf, let me say that I wish her in \nher retirement a life full of new challenges, good health, and many \nother rewards she so richly deserves for her long and distinguished \ncareer in public service.\n  We thank you, Kathy, for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13378-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13378-S13387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, some of my esteemed colleagues argued this \npast week that we are losing jobs in manufacturing, particularly in \ntextiles and apparel, because we have set the American standard of \nliving too high through the minimum wage, Social Security, Medicare, \nworkplace safety rules, environmental standards, and social policies \nsuch as parental leave. That is the sort of broad assertion we have \nheard about every trade bill or trade vote that has come to the floor \nin the past years.\n  They argue that any trade liberalization will lead to a reduction in \nour own labor and environmental standards, rather than encouraging an \nincrease in the labor and environmental standards among the beneficiary \ncountries. That attack on this legislation is wrong for three reasons.\n  First, there is no evidence that trade has weakened our labor and \nenvironmental standards--quite the contrary. During the period from \n1970 to the present day, while trade as a percentage of American GDP \nmore than doubled from 11 to 25 percent, our labor and environmental \nlaws were strengthened. What we have witnessed has been the exact \nopposite of what the trade critics would have predicted. Our labor laws \ncontinue to provide strong protection to workers, and the reach of our \nworkplace safety laws has continued to expand.\n  The last 30 years witnessed the passage of landmark environmental \nlegislation, enormous set-asides of wilderness areas, and significant \nimprovements in air and water quality. We have seen sufficient progress \non endangered species so that the President recently removed the bald \neagle from the list of endangered species. Who would have thought of a \nmore potent symbol of the progress we have made in the last 30 years. \nHave we done enough? No. There is still more we can do to encourage \nconservation and environmental protection. Based on the last 30 years \nof evidence, there is no reason to forgo the benefits of trade based on \nthe errant assumption that trade will somehow undermine the basic \nfabric of our environmental law or encourage a race to the bottom.\n  What has been true in the United States has also proved true \nelsewhere. The truth is that economic growth and a rising standard of \nliving is a necessary predicate for higher labor and environmental \nstandards, and trade is essential to both goals. What the most recent \nstudies have shown is that air and water quality improve as per capita \nincome increases. The growth in pollution declines as incomes rise. \nThere should be no doubt, then, that poverty is the enemy of both labor \nand environmental standards and that both benefit from economic growth \nto which trade contributes.\n  Third, there are sound reasons why higher labor and environmental \nstandards will not lead to a race to the bottom, even in a world of \nexpanding trade. Pollution control costs, even in the dirtiest of \nindustries, account for less than 1 or 2 percent of total production \ncosts. In other words, even in the dirtiest of industries, the cost of \ncompliance with our environmental standards is not sufficient to \npersuade companies to invest in other countries simply to take \nadvantage of lax environmental laws.\n  Trade critics who argue that trade will devastate the environment \ntend to overlook that firms generally invest in the developing world's \npollution havens to gain market access, not to take advantage of the \nlower environmental standards. In other words, the companies generally \ninvest because their exports face tariffs averaging between 10 and 30 \npercent, a cost disadvantage they can only overcome through investing \non the other side of that tariff wall.\n\n  Given those facts, we would be better off beating down high tariffs \nin the developing countries in order to allow the export of goods from \nclean factories in the United States, rather than encouraging trade \nrestraints that lead to investment in pollution havens.\n  Equally important, our companies tend to take their existing \ntechnology and production techniques with them, even when they do \ninvest in pollution havens abroad, in order to get around the high \ntariff walls. They do not do this out of altruism. They do it because \nit makes good, cost-effective, economic sense.\n  Our companies have found ways of producing in the United States that \nboth allow them to comply with our environmental standards and remain \nglobally competitive. We should be encouraging the export of those \ntechniques of manufacturing wherever we can. But what those facts most \nassuredly do not mean is that trade has somehow led to a race to the \nbottom. In fact, trade appears to lead to a rising standard of living \nin environmental as well as economic terms.\n  My colleagues say we can no longer compete in textiles and apparel \nbecause our producers compete with many countries in the world with far \nlower standards of living. They explicitly or implicitly argue that we \nmust impose trade restraints in order to protect these industries and \nthe associated jobs.\n  Let me be blunt: There is no protection in protectionism. For every \njob we save through trade restraints, we lose many more in other \nsectors of the economy. As we have learned this past summer during the \ndebate over quota legislation, saving one job in the steel industry by \nimposing trade restraints puts 40 jobs in the consuming and exporting \nindustries at risk. Those who oppose this legislation do not favor the \nwin-win outcome that the Finance Committee bill would create and the \ntextile industry itself supports.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the distinguished chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator spoke of those who oppose this legislation. \nI believe we voted to move to this legislation by a vote of 90-8?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S13379]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I believe this measure came out of the Finance \nCommittee, under the Senator's leadership, unanimous, both parties?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would the Senator think I was out of range if I \nsuggested there are 75 votes for this legislation as it is?\n  Mr. ROTH. I think that is a fair statement.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well, then doesn't the Senator think we should find a \nway around our self-imposed restraints and vote?\n  Mr. ROTH. I couldn't agree with my colleague more. I wish we could \nproceed. I think this legislation is critically important. I think we \nhave, as the Senator says, a vast majority on both sides of the aisle. \nAs we have already said on many occasions, it has the strong support of \nthe President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Who is meeting this morning with the President of \nNigeria who is here to talk about that.\n  Mr. ROTH. I understand a number of the ambassadors from the countries \nin Africa that would be impacted with this legislation have been \ncalling and telling people of the importance they attach to it. It \nwould be a major setback, inexcusable for this legislation not to \nproceed.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Exactly, sir.\n  Mr. ROTH. As I said, there is no protection in protectionism. For \nevery job we save through trade restraints, we lose many more in other \nsectors of the economy.\n  Those who oppose this legislation do not favor the win-win outcome \nthat the Finance Committee's bill would create and the textile industry \nitself supports.\n  Some of my colleagues would seem, instead, to prefer the ``lose-lose-\nlose'' option of imposing a regressive form of taxation on the poorest \nin our society, lowering employment in the textile and apparel sector, \nand lowering employment throughout the economy.\n  I want to reemphasize what I have been saying. It is not the chairman \nand it is not the ranking member of the Finance Committee that is \ntelling you that the Senate bill would lead to higher sales and higher \nemployment in the textile industry. No, it is the textile industry \nitself that is telling us the Senate bill would increase textile \nshipments by $8.8 billion over 5 years and increase textile-related \nemployment by 121,000 jobs over the same period.\n  That is a win-win outcome we should support. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment to the legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it goes without saying that I wholly \nagree with the remarks and statements of our revered chairman. May I \nsay, there is still hope. It is not over yet.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I obtain the floor in order to thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Fitzgerald. He is a \nbanker, a financier. He is far more experienced in financial affairs \nthan I, and he is on the other side of the aisle. His arrival now makes \nit bipartisan and I am very grateful to him. We had a bipartisan move \nwith Senator Heinz and myself in passing section 13.301 of the Budget \nAct, which says you could not use Social Security--either the Congress \nor the President--in reporting a budget. That was approved by 98 \nSenators in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Yet the budgeters continue to ignore it. So I have been looking, \nsince we lost Senator Heinz on that side of the aisle, for some \nassistance. We had otherwise the leadership of Senator Armstrong and \nSenator Boschwitz. We were in the extreme in 1989, for supporting a \nvalue-added tax, a 5-percent value-added tax, allocated to reducing the \ndeficit and the national debt so we would not spend Social Security. In \nfact, we had eight votes in the Senate Budget Committee. We recommended \nagain another VAT. We tried to pass other laws. But with respect to the \ndistinguished Senator's statement that the Democrats have voted against \nSocial Security several times, let me clarify that observation of his \nto the extent that we, right now, are in that same situation. Here now, \nthe tree is filled up. You have veritably fast track; namely, you have \na bill out from the committee with a substitute or leader's amendment \nor maybe they want to call it the amendment of the committee itself. \nBut whatever they call it, it is the committee bill and you cannot \namend it.\n  When the tree is filled up that way on cloture, it will be difficult \nto get cloture because no one is allowed to offer amendments. We need \nsomeone to understand this and allow us to begin deliberating. Now, \nthat is what we have. If this persists through tomorrow, I am hopeful, \nbut I don't know because I am a minority of a minority of a minority \nhere, that we can move forward. But it could very well occur that we \nmay not get cloture tomorrow morning at 9:30, if that is when they call \nthe vote. They said they didn't think there are any votes tonight, \nother than a continuing resolution, which we can voice vote. We may, \nbut I doubt if we could get that vote.\n  So the reason you don't vote cloture is because you want to try to \nget some amendments considered to discuss these issues. That was the \nsituation each time they brought up that Social Security. I know better \nthan any because I put in my amendment at the very beginning of the \nyear, drawn, if you please, by the Social Security Administrator \nhimself. We introduced it. It was referred under the rules, of course, \nof the Budget Committee. I have been on that Budget Committee since \nthey started it as a Budget Committee in 1974, some 25 years. So I have \nbeen there. I have been chairman of the Budget Committee. I thought I \ncould get a hearing. They don't want to talk about a true lockbox or \ntaking it off budget. They will vote for a sense of the Senate. Then \nthey will vote for the law and then totally ignore the law. And if you \ncan put in my amendment in, as we have it propounded now in the Budget \nCommittee, I can tell you here and now we really will have lockbox, and \nyou won't be able to touch it.\n\n  We won't have to debate whether or not we are. Everyone could see and \nunderstand it. That situation happened several times, and the majority \nwas going to call it the lockbox. One proposal was made by the majority \nleader that allowed three amendments. We would bring it up, have three \namendments considered with time agreements, and then vote.\n  When they found out about my one amendment that was for a true \nlockbox that is in the Budget Committee, which they won't even give you \na hearing on, they would not agree. We had to go ahead and vote against \ncloture. The distinguished Senator from Illinois calls that a vote \nagainst Social Security. Not at all. That is a vote, really, for Social \nSecurity.\n  Tomorrow, when a substantial number vote, let's say, assuming against \ncloture, someone could say they voted against the trade bill. Not at \nall. They are for the trade bill. The distinguished minority leader has \nmade that clear. The Senator from South Dakota is for this bill, but he \nis trying to protect the rights of Senators on both sides of the aisle \nto offer amendments. The Senator from Illinois was mistaken to \ncharacterize that as a vote against Social Security several times, \nsaying, ``Why did you vote against it if you are sincere?'' We are \nsincere all right, to try to preserve Social Security.\n  I was one of them and I will go immediately now to the observation \nmade by my distinguished ranking member on the Finance Committee about \n90 votes to proceed. I was one of those 90. That doesn't mean you can \npass the bill without even considering any amendments. When I voted to \nproceed, I voted to do just that--proceed to debate the amendments, \nvote upon them, and get to a final enactment thereof. I have several \nthings that we want to bring up. I see other Members present.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have watched with some interest in \nrecent days the Senator from South Carolina holding forth on the floor \nof the Senate on trade issues. This isn't the first time. He has often \ncome to the floor of the Senate to engage in interesting and robust \ndebates about international trade.\n  I also noticed that the bill that is before us, the House bill \ndealing with African trade, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, if \nyou read it, reads like a lot of trade deals we have dealt with. It is \nkind of a NAFTA for Africa approach with trade adjustment assistance, \nCBI, and other things added to it.\n  As I was thinking about all of this, I realized that nothing really \nchanges very much. I guess it has been 4, 5, 6 or\n\n[[Page S13380]]\n\n7 years I have been here on the floor of the Senate talking about trade \nissues to no avail. The debate never changes.\n  Those who come to the floor proposing a new trade initiative will \nspeak only about their new trade initiative. They will refuse to speak \nat all, or refuse to address the residue and the problems resulting \nfrom the trade bills we have recently passed, NAFTA being one, United \nStates-Canada being another, and GATT being a third. You never hear \nanybody willing to tackle the problems.\n  I had a chart with me. It is lost in a pile of charts somewhere. But \nI wish I could show it. It shows the trade deficits. After several \ndecades of ballooning Federal budget deficits and after getting those \ndeficits under control, now we have another deficit. It is the trade \ndeficit. The annual trade deficit on a chart is just spiking almost \nstraight up. It is a devastating consequence of bad trade policy and a \nrange of other things, but especially bad trade policy. Yes, the \ncollapse of economies, or the difficulties of economies in Asia \ncontribute to it, and there are some other things that contribute to \nit, but by and large this has been an abiding trade deficit that has \nbeen growing for a long period of time, and a chart would show a very \nsignificant spike in this deficit.\n  It is serious. Our current account balance deficit as a result of \nthis trade deficit is going up and up, and it is unsustainable. We \ncan't continue to do this. Yet there is no discussion on the floor by \nthose who bring trade legislation to the floor to say, well, let's talk \nabout what is happening; let's talk about our current experience with \nour trade practices.\n  It is not the case that I believe we should put a wall around our \ncountry, or we should restrict trade, or we ought to decide to in some \nway diminish trade. That is not the case at all. I believe, however, \nthat after about 50 years of post-Second World War experience in trade, \nwe ought to understand what is going on. For the first 25 years after \nthe Second World War, our trade policy was exclusively foreign policy. \nThey called it trade policy, but it wasn't trade policy; it was foreign \npolicy. We used trade as a foreign policy instrument with which to help \na range of other countries around the world.\n  That was fine. We could beat any country virtually on any set of \ncircumstances and any competition with one hand tied behind our back. \nWe were bigger, tougher, stronger, and more able to compete. And we \ncould essentially create all kinds of approaches that would be helpful \nto other countries in foreign policy, call it trade policy, and still \nwin and still prevail.\n\n  But the second 25 years after the Second World War, things were \ndifferent, especially recently. Our trading partners have become \nshrewd, tough, economic competitors. This is not any longer, and should \nnot be, about foreign policy. It ought to be about trade policy, about \nwhat makes sense for our country's interests and how to engage in \npolicies with other countries that are mutually beneficial, yes, to \nthem and also to us.\n  As I listened to the Senator from South Carolina, I was thinking \nabout something I told the Senate some many years ago. I had a young \nson who ordered an ant farm from a magazine. He is 12 now. I guess he \nwas probably 5 years old. He saw this advertisement for an ant farm. It \nwas a thing you ordered by mail. It was a container. It would hold \nsand. They sent you the container and the sand. They put the sand in \nthe container. Then they sent you the ants separately. They said in the \norder to put the ants in the container. They said you should put that \nlittle vial of ants in the refrigerator for a while to slow them down a \nbit.\n  So my son got all of this in the mail. He put these ants in the \nrefrigerator and slowed them down a bit. He poured them into his ant \nfarm and then put the top on. For, I don't know, a month or two, we \nwatched these ants in the ant farm. There must have been 100 or 200 \nants in this little ant farm. You could watch them every day. They \nwould go from one end of this little partition to the other hauling all \nof this sand back and forth, and back and forth, and nothing ever \nchanged. I looked at those ants. I thought, I wonder what they are \nthinking, if they think; they just keep hauling this sand back and \nforth, and nothing ever changes.\n  I thought the Senate is similar to that, especially on trade policy. \nYou could put a blindfold on and earmuffs on, and for 7 years nothing \nwould change--at least it hasn't in the 7 years I have been in the \nSenate. Back and forth, back and forth, never a change.\n  Does anybody here have a debate about the provisions in NAFTA that \nlead to the terribly unfair trade in durum wheat? Did anybody ever hear \nof that? I have never heard of that. I have been down here and talked \nabout it a lot. In fact, most people probably don't know much about \ndurum wheat at all.\n  Probably many of the expert staffers working on trade have no \ninterest in and no knowledge of durum. They have no knowledge of durum. \nThey certainly have no knowledge of semolina flour. If they eat pasta, \nthey are eating semolina flour and durum wheat. Eighty percent of the \ndurum wheat in America is produced in North Dakota. Anyone working on \ntrade issues in the Senate and eating spaghetti or lasagna might well \nbe eating something that came from a North Dakota durum field.\n  After this country negotiated a trade agreement with Canada, we had a \ntrade negotiator who reached an agreement with Canada and put it in \nwriting to Members of Congress. He said in writing--Clayton Yeutter, \nour trade ambassador--there will not be an increase in the flow of \ngrain back and forth across the border as a result of this agreement. \nThat was a guarantee in writing to Members of Congress. It wasn't worth \nthe paper on which it was written. It wasn't worth anything. The fact \nis, the trade agreement was enacted by Congress after it was \nnegotiated. It was sent here and voted on by Congress and prevailed. I \ndid not support it.\n  Immediately, we had an avalanche of Canadian durum coming across our \nborder. That durum undercut our farmers' prices, took a couple hundred \nmillion dollars out of the pockets of our farmers in a year, and has \nhappened time and time again. This past year was the largest amount of \ndurum, over 20 million bushels in the first 7 months of this year; for \n6 months, up over 80 percent.\n  People say it doesn't matter; that is technical; that is detail. That \nis fine for someone wearing a suit and tie, but try farming, raising \ndurum, and having the price collapse and see what it does to your \nincome and wonder whether it is important. Wonder whether you \nunderstood it and wonder whether you had a responsibility when you talk \nof trade the next time or talk of the trade problems you caused for the \nhard-working people in our country. Wonder about the trade problems you \ncaused them by the previous trade agreements.\n  The same agreement, NAFTA, which has opened the floodgates for the \ngrain coming in that has terribly hurt the family farmers, was \nadvertised to Members, as the Senator from South Carolina knows, as \nbeing a trade agreement that would create several hundred thousand new \njobs in our country. It didn't turn out quite that way. When NAFTA was \nnegotiated with Canada, Mexico, and the United States, we had a trade \nsurplus with Mexico and a small trade deficit with Canada--not so small \nbut a trade deficit with Canada. So this Congress passes NAFTA, \napproves NAFTA. The trade surplus with Mexico has now been changed from \na surplus to a $16 billion annual deficit just in the first 8 months of \nthis year alone. The trade deficit with Canada has more than doubled.\n  In a study by the Economic Policy Institute, Rob Scott says NAFTA has \nresulted in a net loss of over 440,000 jobs in this country.\n  But the NAFTA supporters advertised that ``a lot of new jobs will be \ncreated.'' The fact is, a lot of jobs were destroyed.\n  ``It will be good for our country.'' In fact, big trade balances that \nwere positive were turned to very large trade balances that are \nnegative for our country. Yet the same folks continue to peddle the \nsame merchandise on the floor of Senate.\n  Just make this trade agreement and somehow it will be better. My \nresponse is to say if we are going to talk about trade, I am perfectly \nwilling to listen and be reasonable about all of these things. I want \nto help Africa. I want to help the Caribbean nations. I want to reach \nout and do all those things. But,\n\n[[Page S13381]]\n\nI want it to be fair. I want our producers to have fair competition. I \nam willing to retain these, but I refuse to have people come to the \nSenate and say: Here is our agenda and we demand you respond to that. \nAnd we don't intend at all to address the problems we have created in \nthe previous trade agreements. To us, they are irrelevant. We don't \nintend to address them. They don't matter. They don't exist, and we \ndon't intend to talk about them.\n\n  The remedies that normally would have been available to fight the \nunfair trade have been traded away in previous trade agreements. Those \nwho have lost their jobs and farms find little solace in those who say: \n``We have a new agreement now and we don't intend to talk about the old \nproblems.''\n  It seems to me we ought to talk about some of the problems that exist \nin previous trade agreements and fix them. The quickest way for \nPresident Clinton and, for that matter, the committee chairman and the \ntwo managers of this bill, to have a thoughtful discussion about new \ntrade initiatives is to agree to have a thoughtful discussion about the \nproblems created by the old trade policies and begin to fix them. If we \nare not willing to fix some of the mistakes in previous trade \nagreements, we are not going to get consensus to move to new issues. I \ntold the President the best way for him to get fast-track authority \nfrom the Congress is to show a willingness to fix the problems that \nhave existed in NAFTA, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and GATT.\n  When a ship pulls up at a dock in California loaded with grain that \nis dumped in this country--clearly illegally--and there is no remedy to \naddress it, our farmers say, how can grain be shipped from a European \nport to a dock in California and be sold for half the price of the \ngrain that is being sold here, even after transportation is paid? How \ncan that be? The answer is it is unfair trade and there is no remedy to \ndeal with it and you can't stop it.\n  That is why producers in this country are saying to those who are \npushing new trade agreements, help fix some of the trade problems we \nhave. When that is done, we will listen. We will work with you. We will \naddress some of these additional trade issues. It is not acceptable to \nsimply ignore the misery, the suffering, and the difficulty that so \nmany producers in this country experience because of unfair trade \npolicies. It is not fair to ignore them. We must get our priorities \nstraight.\n  I find it fascinating that some who have been so concerned about \ndeficits during the years I have been in Congress are those who are the \nleast concerned about trade deficits. Japan, $50 or $60 billion a year, \nevery year. Want to buy a T-bone steak in Tokyo? Does anybody in this \nChamber know what kind of a tariff will be imposed on a T-bone steak \ncoming from the United States and sold in a Tokyo restaurant? Does \nanybody know the answer to that? I bet not. After a trade agreement \nwith Tokyo in order to get more U.S. beef into Tokyo, we have a 50-\npercent tariff on all U.S. beef going into Tokyo which diminishes but \nsnaps back if the quantity increases. Today there is a 40.5-percent \ntariff on every pound of American beef going into Tokyo.\n\n  That is considered a failure in any set of circumstances in any trade \nnegotiation. But our trade negotiators, when they reached that deal, \nthought they won the Olympics. They were feasting and rejoicing, \nbreaking their arms patting each other on the back. It was a big deal.\n  It is a failure. A 40.5-percent tariff in foreign markets for our \nbeef is a failure. After all of this posturing and genuflecting and \ntrade talks, the average tariff confronting our products going overseas \nfrom the agricultural sector is nearly 50 percent.\n  We will have some discussions in Seattle in December with our trade \nnegotiators. We have been talking with our trade negotiators and we \nhope very much for once we could win. Will Rogers once said, the United \nStates of America has never lost a war and never won a conference. He \nsurely must have been talking about our trade negotiators.\n  We must start standing up for the interests of American producers and \nAmerican workers not in a way that prohibits competition. We can \ncompete; our farmers can compete. They are willing to do that. But they \nsure are not willing to compete when the ground rules are not fair.\n  We end a negotiation with Europe on the issue of grain. Let me go \nback to grain because I represent a farm State. We didn't even cut \nEuropean grain export subsidies that are multiples of ours. We say that \nis fair competition. I don't think so. In my hometown, that is not fair \ncompetition. It is the best they could get. The result is a trade \nagreement that is unfair, a trade agreement that hurts our producers.\n  Senator Roth from Delaware is managing this bill. He is a Senator for \nwhom I have a great deal of respect. I have worked with him. I like \nhim. We are friends. He comes to the floor and I am sure he believes \nstrongly in this bill.\n\n  Senator Moynihan, legislative giant and great thinker, comes to the \nfloor. He believes strongly in this bill. The Senator from South \nCarolina believes differently. I believe differently in these issues.\n  The way to deal with them is to have amendments offered and have \nvotes. One would think an elementary lesson in politics is that \npolitics is a process of making choices. You make choices by voting. \nBut we have this vineyard I described earlier that has been planted by \nthe majority leader with a whole series of vines now. He has decided he \nis the gatekeeper of the vineyard. These are his vines. He will decide \nwho comes through the gate and picks the fruit. His friends will be \nable to do that. ``My friends will get in, they will offer their \namendments, but I will not allow any other amendment because that's a \nnuisance.''\n  That is not the way to legislate. That is not an appropriate way to \ndo business in the Senate. It is an appropriate way to do business in \nthe House. The majority leader served there. I served there. We \nunderstand that. In the House, you have a Rules Committee, you have a \n1-minute rule, you have a 5-minute rule, and everything happens by the \nclock. That is the way the House works.\n  When the framers of the Constitution created this Senate, they \ncreated a different body. I guess they cannot jettison the habits--they \ndie hard--the habits of those who served in the House and who now want \nto control the Senate in the same manner. But the Senator from South \nCarolina, for example, has every right, in my judgment, to come to this \nfloor, when this bill is before the Senate, to offer amendments and say \nto the Members of the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats: Here are \nmy ideas. Here is the merit I ascribe to my ideas. Here is how I feel \nabout them. Here is my passion. Let's have a vote about it up or down, \nyes or no. I am not afraid of that.\n  What we can do, it seems to me, is have a system in this Senate where \nwe allow full, free, and open debate. Unfortunately, that does not \nalways happen. So we have this legislative tree.\n  Earlier we had a filibuster on the motion to proceed. But we had \ncloture the motion to proceed. We will move on. Now we have this \nlegislative tree which is totally unacceptable. At some point, I hope \nwe can do this in a different manner. The best way for this Senate to \nact is for people with ideas to come together.\n  This week I worked with Senator Brownback on a bill we introduced \ndealing with wireless telephones. I have been working with Senator \nCraig on a WTO trade caucus. I have been working with a range of others \non the Republican side on legislation dealing with telecommunications. \nThat is the best way to legislate: to find good ideas and work together \nto get them done. But that is not the way the Senate is working these \ndays. In many ways that is regrettable because the public is not well \nserved by this kind of parliamentary tactic we find ourselves in now.\n  I yield the floor and will listen to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. He knows this particular subject \nintimately. He is an expert in the field. He is right on target on the \nbroad observation that it is very unfortunate we cannot debate trade--\njust generally speaking.\n  I am going to make a few comments in just a little while with respect \nto\n\n[[Page S13382]]\n\nthe overall idea that the software industry, computerization and \notherwise, is the engine, this is the engine that has gotten America \nthis wonderful boom of its economy. It has for the stock market, but \nnot necessarily for the strength of the economy. We will have to get \ninto that.\n  There are a few loose ends. Just recently, for example, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, as I understood it, questioned the \nmatter of jobs and the statistics used. So I have the statistics from \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, dated October 15, at 12:05. We have \nlost 17,700 textile jobs and 13,500 apparel jobs, for a total of \ntextile and apparel jobs lost in South Carolina of 31,200, and a \nnational loss of 424,000. That is the authority for the statistics, the \nfacts I have been using.\n  Further, I have heard the debate. I want to be sure that it does not \nslip my memory. The distinguished Senator from Delaware came up a \nmoment ago, the chairman of our committee, and said: ``Really, the \nreason for the loss of jobs is high tariffs. That is why they go to get \nthe protection of high tariffs.''\n  I will try to get to see him later. Maybe he is joining me in my \nposition because we certainly then do not want reduce the tariffs. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of the \ntariffs in the Caribbean and the text of the tariffs in Africa.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n             textile tariffs in the caribbean (As High As)\n\n       Dominican Republic: 43% (Includes 8% VAT).\n       El Salvador: 37.5% (Includes 12% VAT).\n       Honduras: 35% (Includes 10% VAT).\n       Guatemala: 40% (Includes 10% VAT).\n       Costa Rica: 39% (Includes 13% VAT).\n       Haiti: 29%.\n       Jamaica: 40% (Includes 15% general consumption tax).\n       Nicaragua: 35% (Includes 15% VAT).\n       Trinidad & Tobago: 40% (Includes 15% VAT).\n\n\n                       textile tariffs in africa\n\n       Southern Africa Customs Union (South Africa, Botswana, \n     Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland): 74% (Includes 14% VAT for \n     South Africa).\n       Central African Republic: 30%.\n       Cameroon: 30%.\n       Chad: 30%.\n       Congo: 30%.\n       Ethiopia: 80%.\n       Gabon: 30%.\n       Ghana: 25%.\n       Kenya: 80% (Includes 18% VAT).\n       Mauritius: 88%.\n       Nigeria: 55% (includes 5% VAT).\n       Tanzania: 40%.\n       Zimbabwe: 200%.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have made that point. With NAFTA, we \nat least eliminated the tariffs. We had the side agreements on labor \nand environment, we had reciprocities, and we cut down on the tariffs. \nBut here we have no reciprocity. There is no tariff elimination. \nAccording to the argument propounded by the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, since Zimbabwe has a 200-percent tariff, all of \nthe textile industry should move there immediately, under his \nreasoning.\n  The truth is, with the elimination of the tariffs, the opposite is \ntrue. With the elimination of the tariffs the investment has gone \nsouth. That sucking sound, as Ross Perot talked about, I can hear it. \nThey can't hear it but I have heard it, 31,200 textile and apparel jobs \nin my State since NAFTA. I continue to hear the sound. I want to \nemphasize that.\n  Further, the statement was made by the distinguished Senator from \nIowa that we had a 50-year history of removing barriers. Ha. Not at \nall. Not at all. We have had a 50-year history of removing our \nbarriers, using foreign trade as foreign aid. But take textiles alone--\nwe have the book. This is ``Foreign Regulations Affecting U.S. Textile \nand Apparel Exports''; from 1994.\n  Maybe it is on account of me because I used to use this book. Over at \nCommerce they are not putting it out, but you can get the individual \ncountries and make up an even bigger book--because it has gone up. It \nhas not gone down. They said ``50 years of liberal trade policies \neliminating or reducing tariffs.'' The war was over in 1945. To 1995 \nwould be 50 years; to 1994, 49 years. That is 49 years of not reducing \nforeign textile tariffs and not reducing all the other tariffs and \nnontariff barriers.\n  You cannot get in and do business, still, in Japan. If you want to \nsell textiles or do anything about textiles in Korea, you have to get a \nvote of the industry. Everybody knows Korea have used the Japanese \nsystem of controlled capitalism, and it works. That was the American \nsystem under Alexander Hamilton. We point out time and again to the \nBrits, once we won our freedom in the earliest days--David Ricardo, the \ndoctrine of comparative advantage; Adam Smith, open markets, let's go \nright now. The Brits corresponded with Hamilton saying: You fledgling \ncolony, now that you have won your freedom, let's trade back to the \nmother country with what you produce best and we will trade back with \nyou what we produce best.\n  Hamilton said in a book ``Reports On Manufacturers''--bug off. He \nsaid: We are not going to remain your colony.\n  The second bill that passed this Congress, from which I stand here \nthis evening, on July 4, 1789--the first bill being, of course, the \nSeal of the United States--the second bill on the 4th of July, 1789, a \ntariff bill of 50 percent on 60 articles. We started and built this \neconomic giant with controlled capitalism, with protectionism. It is \nemulated--and I do not blame them, it has worked--in Japan.\n  It is not about being fair. These American politicians whine: You \nhave to be fair, be fair.\n  Come on. You have to be realistic. Trade is trade--a fair price for a \nsound article. It is not a giveaway. Japan is working. Its system is \nworking.\n  All these articles have been written. That is why I want everybody to \nread Eamonn Fingleton's ``Hard Industry.'' I cannot put the whole book \nin the Record, but I will make reference to it in a minute.\n  Japan, with 125 million citizens and the United States with 260 \nmillion citizens, still outproduces us. They are outproducing us. They \nhave a stronger economy. They have a better savings rate. There may be \none or two banks bankrupt, but a lot of them did not go bankrupt. They \nreadjusted. They continued to take over market share.\n  This past year, they have taken over, again, more of the American \nautomobile industry than the American manufacturers. It is working. If \nI were there, I would run it the same way. I would not run away saying \nthey are being unfair. We are being downright stupid.\n  The Senator from North Dakota pointed out the observation of Will \nRogers: We win every war but lose every conference because we run \naround like we are fat, rich, and happy. That is exactly what we heard \nfrom the Senator from Delaware, that we have this booming economy. Not \nso. We have a $300 billion deficit in the balance of trade and we \nincreased the debt again at the end of the fiscal year. We spent $127 \nbillion more than we took in and one important economic indicator--the \nconsumer confidence index--is falling. Chairman Greenspan is raising \ninterest rates, and our nation has lost textile jobs to the extent that \ntwo-thirds of the clothing I am looking at is represented in imports. I \nam fighting today to maintain the one-third.\n  This industry is very productive and very competitive but cannot \nremain so if this bill passes. Within a 5-year period, we are going to \nhave enough problems with respect to the phasing out of the Multifiber \nArrangement. So we have to batten down the hatches now and stop putting \nin these giveaway programs to the Caribbean and to the sub-Sahara on \nthe basis of helping the Caribbean and the sub-Sahara people.\n  I wanted to put in the book of foreign firms located in Mexico in the \nfabric field. They said it was too many pages. The reason I wanted to \ndo that, of course, is the fabric field abandoned the apparel industry. \nNow that industry is locating jobs out of the U.S. and that sucking \nsound of jobs you hear I am trying to prevent from becoming a roar.\n  Maybe they are listening because I received a letter from ATMI. I had \nnot seen this letter. It is dated October 1, 1999. There are two dates. \nSeptember 28, 1999:\n\n       Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the American Textile \n     Manufacturers Institute, I would like to share our views \n     regarding the Caribbean Basin [Initiative] and the Africa \n     Growth and Opportunity Act that was approved by the Senate \n     Finance Committee . . . and to express, for the record, our \n     position on any trade package that might include the \n     measures.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S13383]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Milliken & Company,\n\n                                               September 28, 1999.\n     Re CBI, Africa trade legislation.\n       Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the American Textile \n     Manufacturers Institute (ATM), I would like to share our \n     views regarding the Caribbean Basin trade bill (S. 1389) and \n     the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (S. 1387) as approved \n     by the Senate Finance Committee, and to express, for the \n     record, our position on any trade package that might include \n     these measures.\n       On CBI, ATMI supports the yarn-forward, 807A/809 approach \n     embodied in S. 1389. This approach, which has also been \n     proposed by the Administration, would extend duty-free, \n     quota-free treatment to apparel from the region only if it is \n     made of U.S. yarn and U.S. fabric, and U.S. thread of fabric \n     shipped to the region in roll form. It would ensure that \n     benefits accrue to all sectors U.S. apparel manufacturers, \n     the CBI countries, U.S. importers and retailers, and U.S. \n     textile and fiber producers while harming none of them. No \n     other CBI proposal strikes such a balance. And, in the \n     current political climate, no other CBI proposal stands a \n     better chance of being enacted.\n       ATMI cannot, however, support Senate passage of the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act (S. 1387) in any form as a stand-\n     alone bill or as part of a trade package because of the \n     dangers posed by a conference with the House. While S. 1387 \n     includes critical U.S. yarn and fiber requirements, the \n     House-passed Africa bill (H.R. 434) will promote massive \n     illegal transshipments of Asian and apparel products through \n     the 48 nations of Sub-Saharan Africa to gain duty-free, \n     quota-free access to the U.S. market. The result will be that \n     billions of dollars of illegal Asian, particularly Chinese \n     transshipments will enter the U.S. at zero duty, resulting in \n     job losses for thousands of workers, many of whom are \n     African-American, in the U.S. textile, apparel and fiber \n     industries. The House Africa bill is so fatally flawed that \n     any compromise other than the bill approved by the Senate \n     Finance Committee would be extremely harmful to our industry.\n       Therefore, without firm assurance that the Senate Finance \n     Committee's Africa bill will be maintained in conference \n     without change, we remain opposed to any package containing \n     the Africa bill, even it were also to include the Finance \n     Committee's yarn-forward, 807A/809 CBI bill. For as \n     beneficial as an 807A/809 CBI bill would be for all the \n     sectors in the textile complex from fiber all the way through \n     retail, it would not overcome the price of a bad Africa bill. \n     Simply put, the Sub-Saharan Africa bill is a poison pill it \n     is so badly flawed and would exact such a heavy toll on the \n     U.S. textile industry at we must oppose it, even at the \n     expense of a balanced and viable CBI bill.\n       Accordingly, ATM encourages you to oppose any trade \n     legislation containing a Sub-Saharan Africa trade bill and \n     support passage of the Finance Committee's CBI bill (yarn-\n     forward, 807A/809) apart from the Africa bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Doug Ellis,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  American Textile\n\n\n                                      Manufacturers Institute,\n\n                                                  October 4, 1999.\n     Re Update on trade and legislative issues.\n\n     To Chief Executive Officers of ATMI Member Companies.\n       Dear Members: ATMI's Board of Directors discussed a number \n     of key trade and legislative issues at its fall meeting last \n     month. I want to take this opportunity to inform you of those \n     discussions and to review ATMI's positions on these issues.\n       One of the key issues discussed at the meeting was the \n     pending Caribbean enhancement legislation, often referred to \n     as the CBI (Caribbean Basin Initiative) bill. Presentations \n     by John Reilly of Nathan Associates and Fernando Silva of \n     Kurt Salmon Associates indicated that the U.S. textile \n     industry will benefit most from a bill that requires \n     Caribbean apparel to use U.S. fabrics made of U.S. yarns in \n     order to gain quota-free and duty-free access to the U.S. \n     market. That approach is contained in the Senate Finance \n     Committee's bill (S. 1389), but not in the bill reported by \n     the House Ways and Means Committee. The Senate bill also \n     requires that if the U.S. fabric is cut in the Caribbean the \n     apparel must be assembled with U.S.-formed thread.\n       The Senate is likely to vote on this bill within the next \n     three weeks, and it will probably be considered together with \n     the Sub-Saharan Africa free trade bill.\n       The Sub-Saharan bill was also discussed by the Board and, \n     as noted below, the Board's previous decision to oppose Sub-\n     Saharan legislation was reiterated. Even though the Senate \n     Finance Committee version of the Sub-Saharan bill requires \n     U.S. yarns and fabrics, as with the Caribbean bill, the \n     House-passed Sub-Saharan bill would be so damaging to the \n     U.S. textile industry that ATMI's Board remains committed to \n     opposing Sub-Saharan legislation. The risk of a compromise \n     between the House and Senate versions that would still be \n     damaging to the U.S. industry has made this position \n     necessary.\n       After extensive discussion, the Board voted to reaffirm its \n     support for the Senate CBI bill and opposition to the Sub-\n     Saharan Africa bill as follows: ``The Board of Directors \n     reaffirms its current position on CBI parity and the Sub-\n     Saharan Africa Bill and unconditionally opposes the CBI bill \n     approved by the House ways and Means Committee''.\n       Other trade/legislative issues discussed were reform of the \n     trade rules governing imports from the Northern Mariana \n     Islands, China's attempt to join the World Trade Organization \n     (WTO), and the new round of WTO trade negotiations. Following \n     is a summary of ATMI's positions on each, which were not \n     changed by the Board:\n       The Board resolution on China's accession to the WTO \n     approved by the Board on March 11, 1999 is as follows:\n       The ATMI Board holds as a pre-condition for its support for \n     China's accession to the WTO the following:\n       A. The reduction or elimination of tariff and non-tariff \n     barriers to its textile and apparel market that will result \n     in effective market access to all WTO exporting countries.\n       B. China must also adhere to equitable conditions of \n     competition regarding: 1. Worker's rights; 2. Environmental \n     preservation; 3. Dumping, countervailing duties (subsidies); \n     and, 4. Transparency.\n       C. China must go through the full ten-year integration \n     schedule out of the quota system as every other WTO member \n     country.\n       WTO Negotiations--The U.S. should seek the following as \n     part of a new round of WTO negotiations that will be kicked \n     off at the WTO meeting in Seattle in December:\n       No cuts of U.S. Textile/apparel tariffs:\n       Access to key textile/apparel markets, which those \n     countries committed to provide in the previous round of WTO/\n     GATT negotiations;\n       Maintain U.S. laws against foreign unfair trade practices \n     (dumping subsidies) without any weakening;\n       No acceleration of the phaseout of textile/apparel quotas.\n       Northern Marianas--ATMI supports bills (H.R. 1621 and S. \n     922) that will close a loophole and prevent apparel made in \n     the Northern Marianas from being labeled ``Made in the \n     U.S.A.'' and from entering the U.S. duty-free and quota-free. \n     For more information and to contact your representatives and \n     senators on this, please see the excellent internet site \n     www.takepride.org.\n       I hope this provides you with a useful update of key trade/\n     legislative issues. I urge each of you to continue to contact \n     your congressional representatives in the House and Senate to \n     support our position.\n       Please call me, Carlos Moore or Doug Bulcao of our staff if \n     you have any questions or information about these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Doug Ellis,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do not want to mislead or misquote. They say they are \nfor the CBI part of the bill. I quote from the letter in the third \nparagraph:\n\n       ATMI cannot, however, support Senate passage of the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act in any form as a stand-alone bill \n     or as part of a trade package because of the dangers posed by \n     a conference with the House. While S. 1387 includes critical \n     U.S. yarn and fiber requirements, the House-passed Africa \n     bill will promote massive illegal transshipments of Asian and \n     apparel products through the 48 nations of sub-Sahara Africa \n     to gain duty-free, quota-free access to the U.S. market. The \n     result will be that billions of dollars of illegal Asian \n     particularly Chinese transshipments will enter the U.S. at \n     zero duty resulting in job losses for thousands of workers, \n     many of whom are African American, in the U.S. textile \n     apparel and fiber industries.\n       The House Africa bill is so fatally flawed that any \n     compromise, other than the bill approved by the Senate \n     Finance Committee, would be extremely harmful to our \n     industry. Therefore, without firm assurance that the Senate \n     Finance Committee's African bill will be maintained in \n     conference without change, we remain opposed to any package \n     containing the African bill even if they were to also include \n     the Finance Committee's yarn forward 807A/809 CBI bill.\n\n  That would have saved me days in this debate because we are using the \nsame authority. I wish we could have the sandwich board back up. They \nwere saying the ATMI, representing all of the textile industry, will \nsupport my position.\n  Let's say they oppose half of my position; namely, the CBI. I at \nleast have support from my own ATMI for the position I have taken. I am \nbeginning to feel a little strength this afternoon where we are picking \nup a little speed. Maybe I can get the Senator from Florida to support \nme. I am going to try my best because I want everyone to understand \njust exactly what was being talked about by the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota with respect to the overall trade.\n  We are finding out with respect to agriculture, where I think it \nwould almost be an embarrassment to ask for another subsidy for \nagriculture--I support agriculture. Everybody knows it. But we have to \nbe up front and lay it on the line.\n  We have magnificent agriculture, not on account of market forces but \non account of Government forces. They are\n\n[[Page S13384]]\n\nsaying market forces, free market. They always give me that when I \nbring up my textile bill, and they have, what? The land itself.\n  We had our friend--Sen. Dale Bumpers--the Senator from Arkansas, talk \nabout the leases ranchers can get for grazing lands to get their wool.\n  I understand the distinguished ABC announcer who lives in New Mexico \nhas a mohair subsidy. I know the telephone is subsidized with the co-\nops. Electricity is subsidized.\n  These producers have been getting price supports. They get export \npromotion, trade promotion, and everything else like that. If it rains \nthey get help. If it dries up, they get a drought, they get help.\n  With durum wheat and these so-called free trade market forces, we \nhave had an amendment introduced on this particular bill for trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  So you can see the article by Mort Zuckerman of October 18 in U.S. \nNews & World Report states:\n\n       We are becoming two nations. The prosperous are rapidly \n     getting more prosperous and the poor are slowly getting \n     poorer. George W. Bush did well to rebuke his party when \n     House Republicans maneuvered to balance the budget by \n     proposing to delay the earned income tax credit for the \n     working poor--paying it in monthly installments rather than \n     an annual lump sum. ``I don't think they ought to balance the \n     budget on the backs of the poor,'' Bush said. Instead, it is \n     time for aspiring leaders to ponder how the two nations might \n     more closely become one.\n       The American economy is growing dramatically. But this \n     prosperity is being distributed very unevenly. The America \n     that is doing well is doing very well indeed. But most \n     benefits have gone to those who work in industries where the \n     main product is information. The losers have been the \n     producers of tangible goods and personal services--even \n     teachers and health care providers. The high-tech information \n     economy has been growing at approximately 10 times the rate \n     of the older industrial economy. It has enjoyed substantial \n     job growth, the highest productivity gains (about 30 percent \n     a year), and bigger profits. It can therefore afford bigger \n     wage gains (about four times that of the older economy). And \n     this wage gap is likely to widen for years to come.\n       The rich get richer. The concentration of wealth is even \n     more dramatic. New York University economist Edward Wolff \n     points out that the top 20 percent of Americans account for \n     more than 100 percent of the total growth in wealth from 1983 \n     to 1997 while the bottom 80 percent lost 7 percent. Another \n     study found that the top 1 percent saw their after-tax income \n     jump 115 percent in the past 22 years. The top fifth have \n     seen an after-tax increase of 43 percent during the same \n     period while the bottom fifth of all Americans--including \n     many working mothers--have seen their after-tax incomes fall \n     9 percent. The result is that 4 out of 5 households--some 217 \n     million people--will take home a thinner slice of the \n     economic pie than they did 22 years ago.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in its \nentirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, Oct. 18, 1999]\n\n                            A Nation Divided\n\n                       (By Mortimer B. Zuckerman)\n\n\n     What to do about the ever widening gulf between rich and poor?\n\n       We are becoming two nations. The prosperous are rapidly \n     getting more prosperous and the poor are slowly getting \n     poorer. George W. Bush did well to rebuke his party when \n     House Republicans maneuvered to balance the budget by \n     proposing to delay the earned income tax credit for the \n     working poor--paying it in monthly installments rather than \n     an annual lump sum. ``I don't think they ought to balance the \n     budget on the backs of the poor,'' Bush said.

The result is that 4 out of 5 households--some 217 \n     million people--will take home a thinner slice of the \n     economic pie than they did 22 years ago.\n       There are those who point out that these income figures do \n     not fully reflect the improvement in the standard of living \n     and say that attention should be paid to what Americans \n     own, what they buy, and how they live. A fair point. Two \n     economists, W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm, have revealed \n     that each person in the average household today has 814 \n     square feet of living space compared with 478 square feet \n     in 1970; that 62 percent of all households own two or more \n     vehicles compared with 29 percent back then; that the \n     number of gas ranges has increased sixfold, air travel \n     four times, and the median household wealth--i.e., the \n     familiy right in the middle--has jumped dramatically. Even \n     given such improvements in life quality, our public policy \n     must not exacerbate the disproportionate concentrations of \n     wealth.\n       Fortunately, Americans are pragmatists. They know that what \n     you earn depends on what you learn, especially in a digital \n     economy; so 83 percent of our children now complete four \n     years of high school, compared with 55 percent in 1970. This \n     is good news. But vast numbers of people feel marginalized in \n     an information-based economy. For too many, work no longer \n     provides the kinds of wages and promotions that allow them to \n     achieve economic success or security. Wage increases do not \n     substantially increase their real income, so they have to \n     work longer hours, get a higher-paying shift, or find another \n     job. These are the people who are particularly concerned \n     about the benefits they stand to gain from Medicare and \n     Social Security. If they do manage to put together a \n     successful strategy to survive, they should not be hit with \n     sudden shocks--like the denial of the lump-sum tax credit.\n       Bush may have discomfited his Republican colleagues, but \n     his words served to remind that they are out of touch with \n     the realities of life for so many Americans. He later \n     softened his criticism, but it is time, nevertheless, for a \n     more generous leadership from the House Republicans. They \n     should not berate Bush. Indeed, they may well find themselves \n     in his debt should his appeal to the center of American \n     politics provide them the coattails they will need when \n     voters head to the polls in just over a year.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I emphasize:\n\n       The top fifth have seen an after-tax increase of 43 percent \n     during the same period, while the bottom fifth of all \n     Americans--including many working mothers--have seen their \n     after-tax incomes fall 9 percent.\n\n  Fall 9 percent? Disappear. That is the issue in the bill before us. \nThat is why the Senator from South Carolina takes the floor, because \nthey are going to disappear. You have seen exactly what causes that \ndisappearance. It is so-called free trade, free trade--the CBI. We are \nall for liberal free trade.\n  We can sit around, as politicians, and we can wonderfully agree, in a \nbipartisan fashion, on this high standard of living. Before you can \nopen up X manufacturing, you have to have clean air, clean water, \nminimum wage, Medicare, Medicaid, safe working place, safe machinery, \nplant closing notice, parental leave--all of these ramifications of the \nhigh standard of living that Republicans support, that Democrats \nsupport. But then when you open it up, without protection of your \neconomic strength--your industrial backbone--you begin to hollow it \nout, and see free trade, free trade, you can go, for 58 cents an hour, \ndown to--someone used the figure 82 cents an hour--to Mexico with none \nof those requirements.\n  I went down to Mexico. I crossed into Tijuana. And the mayor saw me. \nHe said: Senator, I want you to meet with 12 people. I said: Well, yes. \nI am down here, and you have been nice enough to come out. I will be \nglad to.\n  I was looking at all the different industries, of course, and talking \nto the industrialists themselves, not politicians. But the mayor was \nvery courteous, so I met with them in a little grouping. And in a short \nword, what happened was--this is about 4 years ago--they had a heavy \nrain at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year. And it \nflooded and washed down these little hovels.\n  There are 100,000 people out in this valley of hard dirt. For a place \nto live, they take five garage doors and put them together. There are \nno streets. There are no power lines. There is a little electric wire, \nbut that isn't sufficient other than to hold a light. It cannot run the \nTV. They have a battery to\n\n[[Page S13385]]\n\noperate the TV. It is a terrible, miserable existence. But they are \nproud people, and they work, and they try to get their children to \nschool.\n  So when the rain fell, they all got bogged down--they missed a day of \nwork. So they went to the plant the next day, trying to hold on to \ntheir garage door housing, and they found out, under the work rules in \nMexico, they were going to be docked another 3 days. So they lost 4 \ndays' pay. That sort of got them a little discouraged with this plant \nthat had moved down from California making these plastic coat hangers.\n  A month passed in February. These workers did not have any protection \nwhatsoever on the inside with the manufacturing--as we talk about with \nsafe machinery and a safe working place--and something broke and flew \ninto a worker's eye, which he lost. Then the workers became more \nconcerned.\n  But on May 1, they had a favorite supervisor. She was expecting. She \nwent to the front office and said: I'm sorry, I'm not doing well. I'm \nsick. I'm going to have to go home. They said: No, you're not. You stay \nin here and work or else you are not going to have a job. So she \nstayed, worked, and miscarried.\n  Then the employees said: We are going up to California, and we are \ngoing to get a union. You know what they did? They went up there and \ngot a lawyer in Los Angeles and found out that they had a union.\n  These maquiladora owners are clever enough. When they move down, they \nfill out the papers, saying that they have a union. And the papers are \nthere but the workers never see a shop steward. They never saw a union \nman, or anybody else around the plant; never met them. No one was ever \nthere. But they swap monies amongst themselves to try to make it look \nofficial.\n  Mexican law says if you have a union and try to organize one, you \nlose your job. And the 12 I was talking to with the mayor were fired. \nThey could not make a living anymore, could not get a job.\n  You wonder why illegal immigration is so high--I would have bugged \nout of that country, too. I would have sneaked into the United States \nor some other country, I can tell you now, to feed my family.\n  That is the kind of work conditions that we try to prevent here in \nthe U.S., which still persist in Mexico. These are the kind of side \nagreements that we had to try to prevent within NAFTA. So we did that, \nand we don't have that at all with respect to the different companies \ndown there, let's say, in El Salvador. I won't get into every one of \nthem.\n\n  A Korean-owned maquila with 900-plus workers, Caribbean Apparel, \nS.A., American Free Trade Zone, Santa Ana, El Salvador: death threats, \nworkers illegally fired and intimidated, pregnancy tests, forced \novertime, locked bathrooms, starvation wages, workers paid 15 cents for \nevery $16.96 pair of Kathie Lee pants they sold, cursing and screaming \nat the workers to go faster, denial of access to health care, workers \nfired and blacklisted if they tried to defend their rights. Caribbean \nApparel is inaccessible to public inspection. The American Free Trade \nZone is surrounded by walls topped with razor wire. Armed guards are \nposted at the entrance. Forced overtime, 11-hour shifts, 6 days a week, \nmandatory pregnancy tests, and on and on.\n  I have to get this in the Record this evening because I have been \nvery considerate of my colleagues. Many wanted to talk about our late \ncolleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, obviously. I will always \nyield for that and for other particular points they want to make.\n  You have another Kathie Lee (Wal-Mart) sweatshop in Guatemala, San \nLucas, Santiago, Guatemala: forced overtime, 11- to 14\\1/2\\-hour \nshifts, 6 days a week, 7:30 to 6:30 p.m., sometimes they work until \n10:00 p.m. The workers are at the factory between 66 and 80 hours a \nweek. Refusal to work overtime is punished with an 8-day suspension \nwithout pay. The second or third time this offense occurs, the worker \nis fired. Below subsistence wages, for 44 regular hours the pay is \n$28.57 or 65 cents an hour. This does not meet subsistence needs. Armed \nsecurity guards control access to the toilets and check the amount of \ntime the women spend in the bathroom, hurrying them up if they think \nthey are spending too much time. Public access to the plant is \nprohibited by heavily armed guards.\n  You can go right on down this list. I will tell you right now, if you \ntry to organize a union, they will shoot you.\n  Point: You are going to hear how this is going to be so good--as the \nSenator from Delaware said, a win-win situation. You are going to hear \nanother Senator now say this is the way we want to go.\n  Can't we stop, look, and listen and get these dreadful labor \nsituations cleaned up before we go? Is that what we want to put the \nstamp of approval on, this kind of heinous conduct down there in the \nCaribbean? This isn't with everybody sitting on the beaches with the \nsuntan oil waiting for the President to call us back in session this \nfall, maybe, if we don't pass this bill. All kind of threats made, how \nimportant the bill is.\n  In September, Jiovanni Fuentes, a union organizer assisting the \nworkers at Caribbean Apparel, received a death threat from the company. \nHe was told he and his friends should leave the work or they would be \nkilled. He was told he was dealing with the Mafia, and in El Salvador \nit costs less than $15 to have someone killed.\n  Whoopee, let's pass the CBI bill. We want to make sure we get that \nkind of production. The cheap shirt they put on the floor and said, \nlook at what we are doing, the retailers are for this bill. Sure they \nare because they will kill you if you don't produce for next to nothing \ndown there in the CBI.\n  It is a broader problem. Let us go right to what I have heard all \nyear long about software, software. Software is the engine that is \nreally running this wonderful economy here in the United States of \nAmerica. Of course, we have had the pleasure of meeting Microsoft's \nBill Gates. I happen to be one of his admirers. I particularly admire \nthe recent initiative with his foundation, that they gave $1 billion to \nour friend, Bill Gray, United Negro College Fund, to make sure every \nblack in America could receive a college education. Gates is making \nmaybe $2 billion. He can afford it. But that is the finest thing this \nSenator has heard all year of 1999.\n  Somehow, somewhere it is an economic situation that we face in the \nState of South Carolina, Georgia, the southern part of our country, \nwhere we have had, for a long time, a lack of any kind of educational \nfacilities for the minorities. When I first came to public office, I \nwent out and saw that little American Freedom School for the blacks. It \nwas one big building. They had four classrooms in one room, a pot belly \nstove in the middle, and one teacher.\n  Somehow, somewhere they have been getting jobs. Do you know what? \nThey have textile jobs: 37 percent minority employed; over 50 percent \nare women.\n  They wouldn't allow minorities to work in a textile plant when I \nfirst came to public office. I can tell you that they do now. That is \nwhy the head of the Black Caucus, the distinguished Congressman James \nClyburn of South Carolina, why he is opposed to this bill. Don't give \nme no sandwich board of Amoco, Exxon, Citicorp, and all the money boys, \nfor Lord's sake. Ask somebody, as they used to say with the Packard \nautomobile, ask the man who owns one. Ask the Congressman who has \nworked in the vineyards, trained in the public, headed up our human \naffairs councils, now head of the Black Caucus in the House of \nRepresentatives of the United States of America. He is absolutely \nopposed to this because he is just getting jobs for his constituents. \nAnd he knows now we are going to export jobs. That is the biggest \nexport we have. Export, export, export.\n  Well, back to Bill Gates. I am referring, of course, to ``In Praise \nof Hard Industries,'' by Eamonn Fingleton: Mr. Gates himself \nexemplifies in high degree the sort of mind that succeeds in the \nsoftware industry. He reportedly can recall the telephone extension \nnumbers and car license plate numbers of countless Microsoft employees. \nAccording to the authors James Wallace and Jim Erickson, even as a \nchild he displayed amazing memory skills. In particular, he won a local \nparish contest by memorizing and reciting the entire Sermon on the \nMount. The passage is the equivalent of nearly four standard newspaper \ncolumns of type.\n\n[[Page S13386]]\n\nAmong the hundreds who participated in the contest over the years, \nGates, who was then only 11, was the only challenger who ever succeeded \nin reciting the entire passage without stumbling or missing a line.\n  Now, you have to respect that. That is a fellow who deserves a \nbillion a year or whatever it is he is making. I can't keep up with it. \nI do know he has done extremely well. I visited in Redmond, WA. He has \nthe most magnificent, I don't mean ornate, I mean commonsensical \napproach to his employees.\n  I understood from Time magazine, at the close of the year, they had \n22,000 employees with stock options, 22,000 millionaires. So they are \nall well paid, and we respect that and we don't oppose that. We don't \nexpect this bill is going to affect that one way or the other, but it \nis going to affect the $8.37-an-hour textile and apparel worker in the \nState of South Carolina, I can tell you that; or the average is even \nbetter, about $10 an hour now. They have health care. We are all \ntalking about those who don't have health care. A young lady can work \nand she can get health care so when her child is sick, they can get to \na doctor. When she can save a little every month and get a health \ninsurance policy and send the kids to college, that is a good job.\n  I have lost 31,200 of them; I can tell you now. The Senator from \nDelaware says, well, we ought to realize the trend is global \ncompetition, better jobs. Let's think on those 31,200 because I know we \nhave had a net loss of manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Yes, we have BMW \nand Hoffman-LaRoche and all these industries that are the envy of \neverybody. I have GE, General Electric. My trouble is, I used to have \nfive General Electrics. I only have one left. They have all left to go \nto Brazil or Malaysia or elsewhere.\n  I can tell you now that it isn't easy to hold on to these industries. \nWhat has happened to my industry--and the reason I want to emphasize \nthis about software is to disabuse the political minds in the National \nCongress that it is not the engine on the one hand, and on the other \nhand, they are headed the same way of textiles.\n  Mr. President, 1998 ratios of imports to consumption. Aircraft \nengines, we import 70 percent. You see, the Airbus--market forces, \nmarket forces, market forces. Well, the European, very sensibly--not \nsaying it is unfair and just whining about fairness. Come on. That \ncomes from silly pollsters who never ran for office. The Europeans \nrealize that, wait a minute, out of the defense industry came the \nmagnificent research in aerospace. Out of our space program came the \nmagnificent research in aerospace. So we gave that to the Boeing, \nLockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and all the rest of them.\n  We gave them Export-Import Bank financing. It was a predominant \nindustry at one time. The engines are being made by GE, Pratt and \nWhitney, and the rest. But now we find out that we are importing the \nmajority of the engines. I have seen where USAir, which I travel back \nto South Carolina on, bought Airbus. There is no such thing as ``buy \nAmerican.'' I remember when they used to demonstrate when they didn't \n``buy American.'' We can go down the list: Tape recorders and video \ntape players, 100 percent; radio transmission and reception apparatus, \n58 percent; television apparatus, 68.5 percent. You can go down to \nelectrical capacitors and resistors, 69.5 percent, and that is where I \nlost my GE plant. That means we have about 30 percent being produced \nhere. It gets unproductive to produce here, uneconomical. Watches, 100 \npercent. Look at the watch on your hand; it came from elsewhere, I can \ntell you that. Footwear, 84.2 percent. Look at the shoes. If they stop \nworking overseas, we have to go barefoot. This is the list.\n  Now, what about this wonderful engine with this magnificent economy \nthat they brag about? I have stopped them bragging with some of the \ncolumns in the financial news, and otherwise.\n\n       In his search for world-beating software talent, [Mr. \n     Gates] has included six Japanese universities among the top \n     twenty-five universities worldwide where he likes to \n     concentrate Microsoft's recruiting efforts. Gates should know \n     about Japanese software talent given that one of his closest \n     friends and confidants in his early days was the Japanese \n     software engineer Kazuhiko Nishi. Before they had a falling-\n     out in the mid-1980s, Gates described Nishi as ``my best guy \n     ever.''\n\n  This says:\n\n       Thus, for a software entrepreneur in a low-wage country, \n     the capital cost per job can be as little as $10,000, a \n     reduction of more than 90 percent from the mainframe era. \n     This figure is well within the reach of software \n     subcontracting companies in low-wage countries--and far \n     less than is needed to get started in even the least \n     sophisticated areas of manufacture.\n\n  So we know none better than Mr. Gates himself. They have the \nmentality. We don't have all the Gateses in the world, because Kazuhiko \nNishi will probably near equal him, according to Gates himself. What \ndoes it cost? It costs $100,000 to create a textile job when you have \nhigh-tech machinery now in these plants. They have been spending $2 \nbillion a year. I use that quote on page 18 of this particular volume, \nwhich is authoritative. Spinning is a good example, as recounted in the \nWall Street Journal. ``The capital required in the state-of-the-art \nspinning mill these days can amount to as much as $300,000 per job.''\n  In contrast, this requires only 10,000 in so-called software. The \nminds ought to flex in the Senate body because what has happened is \nthey are blindly looking at the stock market. Maybe some of them are \nmaking a bunch of money. They don't want to see further; all they know \nis they are making a fortune. But they are not looking at the jobs. I \nhave tried my best to get the figures with respect to the balance of \ntrade in software. I am convinced we have a deficit in the balance of \ntrade. But according to the Department of Commerce figures, the U.S. \nreceipt in software is $3.2 billion and the payments are $.05 billion, \nfor a net balance of $2.7 billion in software trade.\n  But I looked further and I found out licensing is considered exports. \nSo as they license them in India, for example, and other places to do \nthis computerization--like my light bill in South Carolina is made up \nin India out of a firm from Columbia, SC. They send it in overnight. \nWhen they close down, all that work is done for them, so when they come \nto work in the office in the morning, it is all a done deal and they \npay, let's say, $10,000 a job over there; whereas, it costs at least \n$100,000 in the American software industry.\n  We should dwell on this particular volume, Mr. President, and take a \nhard look at computer software because it goes right down and shows not \nonly the Japanese are coming in, but the Chinese also. I had in here \nsome sections that are easily referred to about the Japanese because \nthey have really got the balance of trade. I read that earlier today. \nLet me say this.\n\n       Chinese programmers can develop software for, say, a clinic \n     in the United States without knowing anything other than the \n     end-user's basic requirements. Perhaps the most surprising--\n     and for American software workers, the most ominous--aspect \n     of IBM's Chinese affiliate is that it is pioneering a new \n     work shift system linking several low-wage countries. When \n     the Chinese programmers finish each evening, they pass their \n     work on to Latvia and Belarus, where other IBM engineers \n     continue working on the modules during the Chinese night. No \n     wonder Bloomberg News commented: ``The tilt in software \n     design towards more basic, interchangeable products is good \n     news for countries like China with armies of talented \n     programmers.'' Given that IBM has laid off thousands of \n     programmers in the United States and other Western countries \n     in the last five years, the message could hardly be clearer: \n     the software industry's spread into the Third World has \n     already begun--and a challenge to the West's software job \n     base is imminent.\n\n  So China is coming in. The truth of the matter is, we are going to be \nlosing this particular industry. And we ought to have a full debate \nwhen you start losing your hand tools and machine tools. When you start \nlosing your steel industry, when you start losing the textile \nindustry--found to be the second most important to our national \nsecurity--when you start losing finally your software industry, then \nthis crowd will sober up and begin to debate a trade bill in the proper \nfashion.\n  This is not in the interest of the worker. It is not in the interest \nof the economy. It is not in the interest of the security of the United \nStates. It is a terrible, fatal blow, final and fatal blow to the \ntextile industry. I know from hard experience. I have been in the work \nof creating jobs. I know about education and technical training. I know \nabout the best of the best coming in. And I know about the best of the \nbest leaving.\n\n[[Page S13387]]\n\n  In spite of all the jobs we have attracted to South Carolina, in the \nlast 4 years, there has been a loss of 12,000 jobs. Don't give them the \nWashington solution of retraining and new skills. We had the Oneida \nplant. It made just T-shirts. It closed at the beginning of last year. \nWe got it some 35 years ago making these T-shirts. They had 487 \nemployees. The age average was 47 years. They are closed now. But where \ndid the jobs go? They have gone to Mexico. They did not create the jobs \nfor the Oneida workers. They lost the jobs for the Oneida workers.\n  Now Washington is overly smart here, telling the workers that this is \nthe trend--global competition, engine of the economy, and all that kind \nof nonsense. Retrain--let's try that on for size.\n  Let's assume tomorrow morning we have to retrain and have new skills \nfor computer operators. I know the distinguished Chair is an \noutstanding business leader. He knows business. He knows that business \nis not going to hire the 47-year-old computer operator. They are going \nto hire the 21-year old computer operator. Business in competition \ncan't afford to take on the retirement costs of a 47-year-old or the \nhealth care costs of a 47-year-old. They are going to take on that 21-\nyear old.\n  So Andrews, SC, is a ghost town. We have some other industries I \nhelped bring there. But I can tell you, those 487 are not coming back, \nas the distinguished Chair of the Finance Committee says, by just \nretraining and new skills.\n  This is happening with the automobile industry, with the automobile \nparts industry, with the aircraft industry, Boeing, and now, according \nto the recent statistics, with the software industry.\n  This Congress and this Government has a real problem up here. It is \nnot a problem of getting these folks, me included, reelected. It is a \nreal problem that only we can handle, that only we can take care of. \nEveryone else has their government on their side. When is our \nGovernment going to get on our side?\n  Yes. The Secretary of Labor is not calling over here. It is \nunfortunate. Do you know who is calling over here? The Secretary of \nState. The Secretary of State has a European Desk. She has a Japanese \nDesk. She has a Chinese Desk. She has a Cuban Desk. When are they going \nto get an American Desk? She is not going to have one. That isn't her \nresponsibility. But she is talking free trade, free trade, so that the \nstriped-pants diplomats can run around and give away even more.\n  You know how wonderful, fat, rich, and happy we were after World War \nII. We are going broke. I can prove it. You watch it. You will see it \nhere. It will happen--not totally broke, obviously. The economy is \nsimmering down. Don't worry about it. We are losing that hard industry, \nhard-core industry in the middle class. That is the strength of the \ndemocracy, according to G.K. Chesterton. That is why we have succeeded \nas a fledgling democracy--the strong middle class. And instead, we are \ngetting rid of it. As Zuckerman says, we are going into two groups of \npeople--the haves and the have-nots. One important industry to our \nnational security is about to bite the dust with this piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, this is the eighth time in recent days I \nhave come to the floor to talk about the issue of prescription drugs \nbecause, frankly, I think this is a priority for this session of the \nCongress and one we can tackle in a bipartisan way.\n  Senator Olympia Snowe and I have teamed up on a bipartisan bill. We \nwere able to get 54 votes on the floor of the Senate for a concrete \nfunding plan for our approach.\n  What I have been doing, as folks can see in the poster right next to \nme, is urging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug \nbills. The poster is very clear. We would like seniors to send copies \nof their prescription drug bills directly to each of us in the Senate \nso we can emphasize how important it is that this be tackled in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Senator Snowe and I have heard again and again that this is an issue \nthat just has to be put off until after the 2000 election. The \nRepublicans and Democrats are going to just bicker about it and sort of \nhave an ongoing finger-pointing exercise and nothing will get done.\n  I happen to think there are a lot of Members of the Senate who want \nto tackle this issue and want to tackle it in this session of Congress.\n  Since I have come to the floor of the Senate and brought this poster \nurging seniors to send their prescription drug bills in, I have heard \nfrom a number of our colleagues in the Senate. They have said we need \nbipartisan action. A number of them have asked for copies of the \nbipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill. They want to know more about it.\n  I am going to continue tonight to read from some of these letters, \nparticularly from folks I am hearing from in Oregon. But I want to take \na few minutes tonight to talk about some important issues relating to \nthis question of prescription drug coverage for senior citizens and \nparticularly ask about this issue of whether we can afford, as a \nnation, to cover prescription medicine.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, I believe America cannot afford to not \ncover prescription drugs. The reason that is the case is that drugs in \nthe 21st century are going to be preventive. They are going to allow \nfor patients to be treated on an outpatient basis and it will make part \nA of Medicare, the hospitalization part of Medicare, less expensive.\n\n  I mentioned a drug the other night, an important anticoagulant that \nhelps to prevent strokes. It is a drug that would cost perhaps $1,000 a \nyear to assist seniors. If we can prevent those strokes through the \nanticoagulant drugs, we can save $100,000 that might be incurred as a \nresult of expenses associated with a disability.\n  There is one bipartisan bill before the Senate dealing with this \nprescription drug issue. It is the Snowe-Wyden legislation. My view is \nwe can't afford to continue to pass up the opportunity to address these \nhealth care issues in a preventive way rather than incurring the \nextraordinary expenses for more institutional care.\n  I will mention a few of the drugs that will be particularly important \nto older people. One is Neupogen, which helps cancer patients and \nothers with compromised immune systems boost their white blood cell \ncounts and avoid hospital stays. Another is Glucophage, which is now \nbeing used to help those at risk for diabetes from getting that disease \nwhich causes so many other serious health problems.\n  My mom has had diabetes for a long time. I have seen the costs of \nthese medicines. To think there is an opportunity with a particular \ndrug to cover these seniors with their prescription drug bills seems to \nme to be an option as a nation we cannot afford to pass up.\n  Another drug is Vasotec, which treats high blood pressure and helps \nto stave off strokes and heart disease and other major problems.\n  These are all important medications. They do cost money, but the \nbottom line is we can use these medicines. When seniors receive these \nmedicines, they are in a position to stave off much more serious and \nmuch more expensive problems. It is sensible, in my view, to make sure \nseniors who need these medications--that are preventive in nature--can \nget them. Under the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill, that would be done.\n  As far as I am concerned, in my reading of history, there is pretty \nmuch nothing that can get accomplished in the Senate that is truly \nimportant that isn't bipartisan. Our proposal gives each senior a \nchance at affordable prescription medicine. It ought to be recognizable \nto Members of Congress because a version of this model is what ensures \ngood health for the families of Members of this body and the Congress.\n  Since my days with the Gray Panthers--I have been working on this \nprescription drug issue for many years now--I have seen how many \nseniors have to walk an economic tightrope, balancing their food \nagainst their fuel costs and their fuel costs against their medical \nbills. We have now more than 20 percent of the Nation's older people \npaying more than $1,000 per year for prescription drugs. The typical \nsenior is using 18 prescriptions a year.\n\n[[Page S13388]]\n\n  One constituent from Medford, OR, wrote that from a modest income he \nspent more than $1,230 so far this year on prescription medicines.\n  The typical senior is taking 18 different prescriptions. I hope, as a \nresult of this effort to collect these drug bills from seniors, we can \nactually get some relief for people in this country who are facing such \nserious and urgent health care needs.\n  Some have said we ought to wait until after the next election, we \nought to wait for comprehensive Medicare reform. I know the Presiding \nOfficer believes strongly in this. There are a lot of Members who want \nto see broader, more comprehensive Medicare reform. Under the Snowe-\nWyden prescription drug proposal, we are using the kind of principles \nthat make sense for Medicare in the 21st century. It is choice-\noriented. It gives a lot of options to older people. We use marketplace \nforces to contain costs.\n  It has worked for Members of Congress and their families. I think it \ncan work for my constituents at home in Oregon. I think it can work for \nthe older people of this country. I am hopeful in the days ahead we can \nmake the case for why it is important the Senate Act in this session.\n  The question of prescription drugs and will Congress tackle it now--\nall of the political prognosticators have said this is an issue the \nCongress is going to punt on. They have said this is an issue that is \ngoing to have to be put off. I don't see how, when seniors are sending \ncopies of their prescription drug bills, a Member of this body, a \nMember of this Congress, can say we ought to put this issue off when \nthere is a model that 54 Members of the Senate have voted for, that has \nstrong bipartisan support, that uses marketplace forces as a model. \nLet's not say this is something that ought to be put off.\n  I think we know what needs to be done. I think we can do it in a \ncost-effective fashion. Our bill doesn't involve price controls. Some \nseem to think that is the way to go. What troubles me about plans to \ndeal with prescription drug costs that involve price controls, we will \nhave massive cost-shifting. If we have Medicare acting as the buyer for \nall the medicine, it may be possible for the Government to negotiate a \ndiscount. I have always said that might be possible. What troubles me \nabout that approach is we will have the cost passed on to someone else \nwho might be 26 or 27--maybe a divorced mom who has a couple of kids--\nworking as hard as they can, and all of a sudden they find out their \nprescription drug bill shoots up because Congress adopted an approach \nin this area that doesn't use marketplace forces.\n\n  Under the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden plan, the only bipartisan \nprescription drug bill now before the Senate, we reject those cost \ncontrols. We don't advocate a one-size-fits-all Federal approach. We \nuse marketplace forces, the kind of forces that help deliver decent and \naffordable care to Members of this body and our families.\n  I want to read briefly from a couple of the other letters I have \nreceived from Oregon. I will keep coming back to the floor of the \nSenate again and again until we get bipartisan action on this \nprescription drug issue. I think the question of prescription drugs is \nthe kind of issue that can leave a legacy for this session. It is the \nkind of important question that will help folks and help families at a \ntime when a lot have fallen between the cracks. We know the economy is \nstrong. We know a lot of people are doing well. If they happen to be in \nthe stock market, most of the time they are doing very well. But there \nare a lot of folks who don't have the stocks in the technology \ncompanies, a lot of folks are on modest incomes. A lot of the seniors I \nhave worked with since my days with the Gray Panthers are telling me \nand telling other Members of the Senate they just can't afford their \nprescriptions. That is what this is about. They can't afford their \nprescriptions.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with that issue. The \nwrong way, in my view, is to have a price control regime and produce \ncost-shifting with intervention by Government. I don't think that will \nwork. I think a lot of people will end up getting hurt by that \napproach. I think there would be a lot of unintended consequences.\n  The right kind of approach, the one advocated in the bipartisan \nSnowe-Wyden prescription drug bill, uses marketplace forces. It gives \nseniors the kind of bargaining power that health maintenance \norganizations would have. Those big organizations, the health \nmaintenance organizations, can go out and negotiate deep discounts. \nThey use their bargaining power in the marketplace to get discounts. \nWhat happens is seniors get shellacked twice. They get hit once because \nMedicare doesn't cover prescription drugs.\n  Medicare started out as half a loaf back in 1965. It did not cover \nprescriptions and eyeglasses and hearing aids and a variety of needs \nolder people have. But as a result of the escalating costs of health \ncare, a lot of seniors are paying more proportionately out of pocket \ntoday than when Medicare began in 1965.\n  So seniors are not able to afford their prescriptions, and that \nsenior purchaser, a low-income elderly widow, in effect has to \nsubsidize the big purchasers, the health maintenance organizations that \ncan negotiate discounts.\n  There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with the issue of \naffordable medication. The wrong way is to create a one-size-fits-all \nFederal regime and put the Government in the business of trying to \norchestrate this entire program. The other is to use a model that we \nknow works. Under our proposal--we call it SPICE, the Senior \nPrescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act--Senator Snowe and I, we \nreject this Government model. We use an approach that has private \nsector options and choices and gives seniors bargaining power.\n  We hope more older people will send us copies of their prescription \ndrug bills. This poster really says it all to seniors and their \nfamilies:\n\n       Send us copies of your prescription drug bills.\n\n  Send them to your Senator. Write to:\n\n       Your Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n\n  I am going to wrap up tonight--because I know several of our \ncolleagues would like to discuss matters important to them--with just a \ncouple of other letters.\n  From the Oregon coast in the last few days, I received a particularly \npoignant letter. It is from an individual with an income of about \n$1,000 per month. She has to take prescription medicine, a number of \nprescriptions. Over the last few months, out of her $1,000-a-month \nincome, she has had to spend almost $700. That is just over the last \nfew months, from somebody who is on a very modest income.\n  Picture any one of us, or our relatives, trying to get by on an \nincome of $1,000 a month and having to spend a significant portion of \nit, around $700 just in recent days, on prescriptions. We know they \nwould not be able to do it. But that is the reality of what seniors on \nthe Oregon coast are facing. That is the reality of what seniors all \nover this country are facing. That is what the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden \nprescription drug bill seeks to deal with. We want that person to get \nsome real relief. We think it is time for the Senate to act on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  One other letter I received from the Willamette Valley, not far from \nmy hometown, I thought was also particularly poignant. This was from a \nsenior who sent me, really, all of his prescriptions. Just as we said \nin our poster, send us copies of your prescription drug bills, I think \na lot of the seniors are doing it in a pretty detailed fashion. This is \njust an example of what I received from one older person in the \nWillamette Valley. She reports, on a very modest income, she is \nspending $236 a month on her prescription drugs. As she reports, that \nis without the over-the-counter medication she also has to take. She is \n78 years old. She is concerned about whether or not the Senate is going \nto act. She is pretty skeptical, just the way a lot of other seniors \nare in our country. What we need to show is this Senate is willing to \ntackle these issues and do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  The time for finger pointing and scapegoating on this issue is over. \nWe cannot wait for another year, another full year, for action on this \nmatter. We ought to move now. There is one bipartisan bill before the \nSenate, one which I believe can bring Democrats and Republicans \ntogether. I am going to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate to \ntalk about the SPICE Program, the\n\n[[Page S13389]]\n\nSenior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It is voluntary in \nnature. Nobody is required to change anything. No senior, no family, \nwould be required to change anything in their buying practices should \nthey choose to continue doing exactly what they are doing. But for \nmillions of older people, the SPICE Program, the Senior Prescription \nInsurance Coverage Equity Act, will be a bargain. It will be a winner \nbecause it will give seniors the kind of bargaining power the big \nhealth maintenance organizations have had.\n  It is not right, in my view, to give those buyers significant power \nin the marketplace and just say seniors and families do not matter. In \neffect, that is what we are doing. We are telling them: You go on out \nand do your best, walk into a pharmacy, and even though you are \nsubsidizing the big buyers, this Senate will not do anything about it.\n  I believe it is time for bipartisan action on this. I believe it is \ntime to create an approach to cover prescription drugs under Medicare \nthat uses the forces of the marketplace, that is bipartisan, and that \nhelps hold costs down. I believe a lot of seniors cannot afford their \nprescriptions. There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with it. \nThe bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation is what we think is the \nappropriate way to go. We are going to continue to come to this floor \nand talk about the need for action on it.\n  As this poster says, what will help is if seniors send in copies of \ntheir prescription drug bills. We urge seniors to send them to us and \nsend them to their Senator here in the U.S. Senate, Washington, DC \n20510, because that will help Members of the Senate to see how urgent \nis this need.\n  The need was great years ago, but it is getting even greater. Too \nmany older people every week are having to make a choice between their \nfood costs and their fuel costs and their fuel costs and their medical \nbills. Let us show we can deliver on this important issue. There is a \nbipartisan bill now before the Senate. We hope seniors, as this poster \nsays, will be in touch with us to let us know their feelings on this \nimportant matter.\n  I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate until we get \naction on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I regret that because of a long-standing \ncommitment, I will not be here for tomorrow's vote on cloture on H.R. \n434, The Sub-Saharan Africa Free Trade Act. If I could be here, I would \nvote against cloture.\n  I strongly oppose the majority leader's decision to fill the \namendment tree to prevent us from offering amendments on some of the \nmost important issues facing working families in this country, \nespecially the minimum wage.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has said numerous times \nthat increased trade has raised the standards of living and the quality \nof life for almost all countries involved in trade, and especially the \nquality of life in our own country. Chairman Greenspan believes that \nthe number one benefit of trade is not simply jobs, but enhanced \nstandards of living.\n  I can think of no more important enhancement to the standard of \nliving of America's hardest pressed working families than to increase \nthe minimum wage. Surely, it is appropriate to send the message on this \nlegislation that increased trade must definitely mean a better quality \nof life for the working poor.\n  I had hoped to offer an amendment to raise the minimum wage to this \nbill, but the majority leader's actions prevent me from doing that. \nThis trade bill has been offered to enhance the standards of living for \nworkers in Africa and the Caribbean. I am certainly in favor of that, \nbut there are honest disagreements as to whether the proposal before us \neffectively does so. But, while we express our concern for workers in \nthese nations, we cannot forget about the workers in our own country.\n  I commend President Clinton for making trade with Africa a priority \nfor his administration. His leadership is the driving force behind this \nentire debate. As the Senate debates trade with Sub-Saharan Africa and \nthe Caribbean region, we must ensure that we take the right approach to \nbuilding these vital partnerships. Clearly, we must strengthen our \neconomic ties with these nations, but I am not convinced the proposal \nbefore us is the best way to do so.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader's actions have also prevented \nanyone on this side of the aisle from offering germane amendments that \nwill help us to build lasting partnerships between African and American \nbusinesses, provide strong protections for workers rights, and preserve \nthe environment. We clearly had an opportunity to enact a bill that \nwould make trade with Africa and the Caribbean Basin countries a win-\nwin for all of the nations involved, but the majority leader's actions \nhave made that impossible.\n  Any bill on Africa that comes before the Senate should address both \ntrade and the other important issues facing Africa today. It must deal \nwith the AIDS crisis. It must offer substantial debt relief. And it \nmust restore foreign aid. Yet the proposal currently before the Senate \nis silent on these fundamental issues facing Africa. I am pleased that \nSenator Feingold, Senator Durbin, and other Senators are prepared to \noffer amendments that address all of these concerns, and I strongly \nsupport them.\n  I am also very concerned about the impact of the pending bill on our \ntextile and apparel industries, which are often hardest hit by imports. \nThese industries remain a critical source of employment for many \nAmerican workers. In Massachusetts, many textile and apparel employees \nlive in the Merrimack Valley and in Southeastern Massachusetts. They \nwork hard, and they have made a lasting impact on our state's history \nand culture.\n\n[[Page S13390]]\n\n  I believe even the proponents of this bill will admit that the short-\nterm effect of the legislation will be an acceleration of job loss in \nthe apparel sector. And while this bill includes a re-authorization of \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which I strongly support, \nnothing in this bill will create a single job for these displaced \nworkers to have.\n  While Massachusetts continues to be a leader in exports, many small \ncompanies and workers are suffering as a result of the trade deficits \ncaused by the economic crises in Asia and South America. In response to \nthe needs of companies hurt by imports, the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram in general, and the New England Trade Adjustment Assistance \nCenter in particular, exist as valuable resources. They offer vital \nassistance to firms and workers suffering from competition by imports. \nThe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is an effective initiative that \nhas been shown to provide a return on investment of up to 348 percent.\n  The American people, I believe, will hold this Congress responsible \nfor refusing to address so many issues which are critical to our \nfamilies and our communities. The majority has once again turned a deaf \near to the pleas of the American people for action, and I regret this \nlatest missed opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13390-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DRYLAND DEGRADATION AND ITS IMPACT ON TRADE RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act, I would like to draw my colleagues' \nattention to an important article from the President of the Corporate \nCouncil on Africa, Dr. Mima S. Nedelcovych, concerning Africa's problem \nof severe dryland degradation (known as ``desertification'') as it \naffects our trade relations.\n  The Corporate Council on Africa, CCA, includes 180 members with \nsubstantial business interests in Africa, including such industry \ngiants as General Electric, Ford Motor Company, IBM, Citibank, ConAgra, \nCargill, AGCO, 3M, Pfizer, Land O'Lakes, Chevron, Texaco, Bristol-Myers \nSquibb, Eli Lilly, Raytheon and Rhone-Poulenc USA. Recently Dr. \nNedelcovych, who also serves as Vice President for International \nBusiness Development for F.C. Schaffer & Associates, published a short \narticle entitled ``Africa's Creeping Desert, A Problem for the U.S. \nToo,'' in the CCA's Perspectives on Africa (Fall 1999).\n  In it, Dr. Nedelcovych outlines clearly the extent to which the \ndegradation of Africa's agricultural land is undermining one of the \ncontinent's most crucial natural resources, impeding economic growth, \nand slowing the hoped-for shift from aid to trade. Cocoa, coffee, \ncotton, cola nuts and spices grown in Africa end up in a myriad of \neveryday processed products on American store shelves, but land on \nwhich they are produced is increasingly threatened by a combination of \nbad management practices, drought and poverty.\n  As a boost to U.S. trade relations with Africa, Dr. Nedelcovych makes \na strong case for full U.S. participation in the 1994 United Nations \nConvention to Combat Desertification, not just because it seeks to help \nAfrica's agricultural sector grow and achieve food self-sufficiency, \nbut because it will also open greater opportunities for U.S. sales to \nAfrica, including seeds, agricultural machinery, irrigation equipment \nas well as a wide range of automobiles, pharmaceuticals, electronic \nequipment and other goods to more prosperous African consumers.\n  Dr. Nedelcovych ends with an urgent plea for the Senate to ratify \nthis important agreement without delay. With a world population now \nover 6 billion and fertile farmland shrinking at an alarming rate \nworldwide, I heartily support Senate action on the Convention to Combat \nDesertification.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Nedelcovych's article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [Published by The Corporate Council on Africa, Fall 1999]\n\n                         Perspectives on Africa\n\n\n              a quarterly journal of dialogue and opinion\n\n          Africa's Creeping Desert--A Problem for the U.S. Too\n\n  (By Dr. Mima S.

All too often, however, we also are noted \n     for our inability to see crises in advance and deal with \n     problems when they are still easily manageable.\n       One such issue is the world's desertification problem. In \n     Africa, more than two-thirds of the land is dry land, and \n     approximately 70 percent of the population lives on that \n     land. They also grow crops such as cocoa, coffee, cotton, \n     cola nuts and spices on that land. Moreover, rare and \n     endngered animals--a key to tourism in African countries--\n     currently struggle to survive on that land. Without effective \n     land management policies in developing nations, the need for \n     foreign aid will rise at a time when available funds are \n     shrinking.\n       The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification has \n     been designed to deal with this problem in a cost-effective \n     way. The Convention does not call for the creation of a major \n     new center of bureaucracy at the UN, nor does it create a \n     mandated contribution by the United States. The onus is \n     placed on developing nations needing assistance to devise a \n     comprehensive national plan to effectively deal with \n     desertification. However, if the United States Senate doesn't \n     ratify this convention, the U.S. will be on the outside of \n     this process, which will directly endanger U.S. interests.\n       The U.S. private sector has five concerns with how the \n     problem of desertification is handled. First, no issue is \n     more important than that of land use. The national plans \n     called for in the Convention will govern all land use--not \n     just agricultural land. Oil drilling, mining and \n     manufacturing operations, all will be affected by this \n     convention. If the United States fails to ratify this \n     Convention, we will have no voice in the development and \n     implementation of national land use plans.\n       Second, the United States sells hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in irrigation and related equipment to Africa each \n     year, as well as seeds and agricultural equipment. Companies \n     and experts in nations that ratify the Convention will be \n     placed on a roster of service providers. While America \n     currently has a competitive advantage, that advantage will \n     soon disappear if U.S. firms and experts are not on the \n     convention-generated list. Our firms will then face the \n     prospect of losing contracts to countries such as Spain, \n     Portugal, Italy and Greece, who will provide technology based \n     on what we have developed earlier.\n       Third, U.S. firms purchase millions of dollars of \n     agricultural goods each year from developing nations. \n     Products such as coffee, cocoa, cotton, cola nuts and spices \n     are grown on dry or sub-humid lands facing the impact of \n     desertification. Many consumers products we now use would \n     cost more if the problem of desertification is not dealt with \n     successfully. A morning cup of coffee surely would be more \n     expensive--so would the chocolates given on Valentine's Day. \n     The prices for items ranging from cooking oils or soft drinks \n     also would rise.\n       Fourth, it is much cheaper to work with African nations to \n     implement effective land management plans than to send \n     millions to implement disjointed anti-desertification efforts \n     and hundreds of millions more to provide humanitarian \n     assistance to combat the effects of droughts and other \n     natural catastrophes caused by desertification after they \n     occur. Individual taxpayers and corporations certainly would \n     appreciate a more cost-effective approach to this problem.\n       Finally, developing nations--particularly African nations--\n     see this Convention as their major international initiative. \n     The Convention was developed with the assistance of the \n     United States Government. To date, all but Australia and the \n     United States have ratified this Convention. U.S. failure to \n     ratify this Convention will leave the United States \n     Government, U.S. corporations and American experts out of the \n     anti-desertification process. Moreover, it will poison our \n     relations with African and other developing nations who \n     believe non-ratification is a lack of support of their \n     efforts to both deal with their problem and join global \n     markets.\n       It is critical that the U.S. business community let the \n     U.S. Senate know the importance we place on the ratification \n     of the Convention to Combat Desertification. Potentially \n     billions of dollars--and more importantly, millions of \n     lives--depend on what the Senate does about this issue in the \n     next few weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13390-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13390-S13391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PROPOSED DELAY IN FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious \nconcern that House and Senate negotiators have agreed to delay for one \nyear almost all of the proposed increase in the National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH) budget for FY 2000. I strongly disagree with this approach \nto balancing the budget. Fully funding biomedical research at the NIH \nshould be one of our\n\n[[Page S13391]]\n\nhighest priorities, and I intend to oppose proposals that would delay \nfunding for the NIH or fail to provide sufficient funding to ensure \ncontinued advancement in the field of biomedical research.\n  The proposed delay in NIH's authority to use $7.5 billion of its FY \n2000 funding will mean that no new grants could be made until the end \nof the fiscal year. Thus, a one-year freeze will be put on all new \nbiomedical research. Moreover, some on-going grants will have to be \nshort-funded. For those suffering from life-threatening diseases, a \none-year delay could be devastating. We cannot imperil continued \nprogress in an area as important as biomedical research.\n  As our Nation searches for ways to improve health care for all its \ncitizens, the need to ensure stability and vitality in biomedical \nresearch programs is increasingly imperative. Biomedical research has \nfundamentally changed our approach to treating disease and illness and \nhas revolutionized the practice of medicine. Through the NIH, the \nFederal government has been the single largest contributor to the \nrecent advances made in biomedical research, and NIH research has \nplayed a major role in the key medical breakthroughs of our time.\n  Biomedical research at the NIH has also contributed significantly to \nthe growth of this Nation's biotechnology, medical device, and \npharmaceutical industries. Many of the new drugs and medical devices \ncurrently in use were developed based on biomedical research supported \nby the NIH. NIH research has paved the way for the development of \npharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries that have \ncreated millions of high wage jobs.\n  The promise of continued breakthroughs in the eradication of disease \nand the overall improvement in public health are contingent upon our \ncommitment to supporting our scientists and researchers with adequate \ntools and resources. However, today, only one of three approved \nresearch proposals can be funded.\n  We must maintain our commitment to achieving full funding for \nbiomedical research by FY 2002. Last year, we provided NIH with a \ndownpayment on the resources it will need to take full advantage of the \noverwhelming opportunities for scientific advancement currently \navailable in the field of biomedical research. This year, again we \nstarted on the right track by including another fifteen percent \nincrease in the NIH budget. However, the proposed one percent overall \nbudget cut will have a dramatic impact on the grant-making capacity of \nthe NIH. As a result of this cut, 500 to 550 fewer grants will be \nawarded by the NIH next year.\n  This most recent proposal to require that the NIH delay spending \napproximately $2 billion of its FY 2000 funding until FY 2001, \nessentially revokes the entire increase for next year and goes back on \nour promise to substantially increase NIH funding by 2002. This \nadditional funding cut will disrupt and delay research fundamental to \nsaving lives and improving public health. It will also critically \nundermine our progress toward securing a strong and stable funding \nstream needed to ensure continued advances in biomedical research.\n  The proposed delay in NIH funding for FY 2000 is unconscionable. I \nwill oppose it, and I urge the President to veto any conference report \nthat includes this proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13391-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13391-S13392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AGJOBS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I'm pleased to have joined Senators Gordon \nSmith, Bob Graham, Max Cleland, and several other colleagues this week \nin introducing S. 1814. This bill is a new, improved version of the \nAgricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act--or, as we \ncall it, the ``AgJOBS'' bill.\n  We are facing a growing crisis--for both farm workers and growers.\n  We want and need a stable, predictable, legal work force in American \nagriculture.\n  Willing American workers deserve a system that puts them first in \nline for available jobs with fair, market wages. We want all workers to \nreceive decent treatment and equal protection under the law.\n  Consumers deserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply.\n  American citizens and taxpayers deserve secure borders and a \ngovernment that works.\n  Yet Americans are being threatened on all these counts, because of a \ngrowing labor shortage in agriculture, while the only program currently \nin place to respond, the H-2A Guest Worker Program, is profoundly \nbroken.\n  Last year, the Senate adopted meaningful H-2A reform, on a bipartisan \nvote of 68-31. Unfortunately, that bipartisan floor amendment did not \nsurvive the last round of negotiations over the omnibus appropriations \nbill last year.\n  This year, the problem is only growing worse. Therefore, we are \nintroducing a new, improved bill. The name of the bill says it all--\n``AgJOBS''.\n  Mr. President, our farm workers need this reform bill.\n  There is no debate about whether many--or most--farm wokers are \naliens.\n  They are. And they will be, for the foreseeable future. The question \nis whether they will be here legally or illegally.\n  Immigrants not legally authorized to work in this country know they \nmust work in hiding.\n  They cannot even claim basic legal rights and protections. They are \nvulnerable to predation and exploitation. They sometimes have been \nstuffed inhumanly into dangerously enclosed truck trailers and car \ntrunks, in order to be transported, hidden from the view of the law.\n  In fact, they have been known to pay ``coyotes''--labor smugglers--\n$1,000 and more to be smuggled into this country.\n  In contrast, legal workers have legal protections.\n  They can assert wage, safety, and other legal protections. They can \nbargain openly and join unions. H-2A workers, in fact, are even \nguaranteed housing and transportation.\n  Clearly, the status quo is broken.\n  Domestic American workers simply are not being found to fill \nagricultural jobs.\n  Our own General Accounting Office has estimated that 600,000 farm \nworkers--37 percent of the total 1.6 million agricultural work force--\nare not legally authorized to work in this country.\n  That estimate is low; it's based on self-disclosure by illegal \nworkers to government interviewers.\n  Some actually have suggested that there is no labor shortage, because \nthere are plenty of illegal workers. This is not an acceptable answer.\n  Congress has shown its commitment over the past few years to improve \nthe security of our borders, both in the 1996 immigration law and in \nsubsequent appropriations.\n  Between computerized checking by the Social Security Administration \nand audits and raids by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nmore and more employers are discovering they have undocumented \nemployees; and more and more workers here illegally are being \ndiscovered and evicted from their jobs.\n  Outside of H-2A, employers have no reliable assurance that their \nemployees are legal.\n  It's worse than a Catch-22--the law actually punishes the employer \nwho could be called ``too diligent'' in inquiring into the \nidentification documents of prospective workers.\n  The H-2A status quo is slow, bureaucratic, and inflexible. It does \nnothing to recognize the uncertainties farmers face, from changes in \nthe weather to global market demands.\n  The H-2A status quo is complicated and legalistic. DOL's compliance \nmanual alone is 325 pages.\n  The current H-2A process is so hard to use, it will place only 34,000 \nlegal guest workers this year--2 percent of the total agricultural work \nforce.\n  Finally, the grower can't even count on his or her government to do \nits job.\n  The GAO has found that, in more than 40 percent of the cases in which \nemployers filed H-2A applications at least 60 days before the date of \nneed, the DOL missed statutory deadlines in processing them.\n  The solution we need is the AgJOBS Act of 1999.\n  Our new, improved AgJOBS bill includes three main parts:\n  First, it would create a national AgJOBS registry.\n  This new program would match willing workers anywhere in the U.S. \nwith available farm work. Workers would be\n\n[[Page S13392]]\n\nfree to work where they want and for whom they want.\n  Domestic American workers would be given first preference in job \nreferrals. Once no domestic worker is available for a job, an \n``adjusting'' worker could receive a referral. If no domestic or \nadjusting worker is available, an employer could then use the H-2A \nprogram.\n  This is essentially the same job registry as in last year's bill, \nexpanded to accommodate the new category of adjusting workers.\n  Second, it includes much-needed reforms to the H-2A program.\n  Currently, red tape, regulation, and bureaucracy has rendered the H-\n2A program almost completely ineffective.\n  Our reformed H-2A program would expedite the process and more closely \nreflect market reality. Current red tape, delays, and paperwork would \nbe reduced or eliminated. Growers would be assured of the timely \navailability of workers.\n\n  Employers still would be required to provide transportation in out of \nthe U.S., as under the current H-2A program. Employers must provide \neither a housing allowance or actual housing to H-2A workers. After 3 \nyears, actual housing would be required, unless the governor of a state \ncertified a housing shortage. This is a more stringent housing \nrequirement than last year's bill.\n  The premium wage guaranteed to H-2A workers--called the Adverse \nEconomic Wage Rate or ``AEWR''--would be based more accurately on \nprevailing wage paid to similar workers in that area. This is similar \nto current law, but other jobs, those not closely related, would be \nexcluded from the calculation of the AEWR. This simply would ensure \nthat the AEWR more closely reflected prevailing wages for that \nparticular type of work. In the case of low-wage jobs, a premium would \nbe added to the wage. This would still mean H-2A wages higher than \nvirtually all non-H-2A farm worker wages. In other words, current H-2A \nworkers would still have significant wage protection, and virtually all \nnew H-2A workers would get a raise.\n  Third, the bill creates a one-time-only new Category called \n``Adjusting'' Workers.\n  Experienced farm workers who are already in the U.S. would be allowed \nto stay if:\n  --They have worked at least 150 days in agriculture in the 12 months \nbefore the October 27 introduction of this bill;\n  --They agree to work at least 180 days a year, only in agriculture, \nfor at least 5 of the next 7 years; during this 5-7 year adjustment \nperiod, they would be in a temproary, non-immigrant status;\n  --They return to their home country at least 2 months a year (during \nthe 5-7 year adjustment period. Those with U.S.-born children--i.e., \nchildren who were already U.S. citizens--could stay year-round, but \nmust agree to work in agriculture 240 days/year.\n  ``Adjusting'' workers would be earning the right to keep their jobs \nor move to other agricultural jobs. Eventually, they could earn the \nright to a so-called ``green card''--in other words, permanent \nresidency.\n  For one moment, I want to mention, and then dispose of, the ``A-\nWord\":\n  This bill is not about amnesty, for several reasons. I have always \nbeen opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants. If this were an amnesty \nbill, I'd be against it.\n  This bill is about workers who are already here, for employers who \nneed them and value their services, earning a right to stay.\n  Amnesty is a gift; this bill is about earning a right. Amnesty means \none is home free; this bill is about stabilizing the agricultural work \nforce and conditions residency on a 5-7 year agreement to continue in \nfarm work.\n  The level of documentation required to prove a worker already has \nbeen working in the U.S. is much stricter than for any past amnesty \nlaw.\n  In closing, Mr. President, this is win-win legislation.\n  It will elevate and protect the rights, working conditions, and \nsafety of workers. It will help workers--first domestic American \nworkers, then other workers already here, then foreign guest workers--\nfind the jobs they want and need.\n  It will assure growers of a stable, legal supply of workers, within a \nprogram that recognizes market realities. The adjusted-worker \nprovisions also will give growers one-time assistance in adjusting to \nthe new labor market realities of the 21st Century.\n  It will assure all Americans of a safe, consistent, affordable food \nsupply.\n  The nation needs the Smith-Graham-Craig-Cleland AgJOBS bill. I invite \nthe rest of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors; and I urge the \nSenate and the House to act promptly to enact this legislation into \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13392-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13392-S13396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE HUNGER RELIEF ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

This \n     crucial legislation would help to address a serious problem \n     plaguing millions of children and adults--widespread hunger \n     and food insecurity.\n       The bill would target Food Stamp Program improvements to \n     ensure more adequate nutrition assistance for at-risk groups, \n     especially needy legal immigrants and low-income households \n     with children, including working families and families with \n     children with high shelter costs. It also would provide \n     greater resources through The Emergency Food Assistance \n     Program (TEFAP) for those families, children, and elderly \n     turning to food pantries and other emergency feeding sites.\n       Recent studies confirm that, despite a strong overall \n     economy, hunger and food insecurity are prevalent in \n     communities across the country. While participation in the \n     Food Stamp Program declined by more than seven million \n     persons over the past three years, many working parents still \n     struggle to feed their families. A July 1999 GAO study \n     concludes, ``children's participation in the Food Stamp \n     Program has dropped more sharply than the number of children \n     living in poverty, indicating a growing gap between need and \n     assistance.'' USDA has determined that 6.1 million adults and \n     3.3 million children lived in households which experienced \n     hunger during 1998, and hunger rates are highest in \n     households with children led by single women and minorities. \n     An Urban Institute study of former welfare recipients finds \n     that 33% have to skip or cut meals due to lack of food.\n       The toll hunger takes on individuals, families, and \n     communities is serious. Children who lack adequate daily \n     nutrition score lower on tests, miss school more often, have \n     more disciplinary difficulties, and face increased health \n     risks. Hunger diminishes adults' health and ability to \n     concentrate as well. And hunger diminishes all of us as a \n     society when we allow hunger in the midst of such affluence. \n     Hunger has a cure and our nation must take steps to implement \n     that cure.\n       This legislation takes several important steps in \n     alleviating hunger. First, it builds on the bipartisan down \n     payment the 1998 Agricultural Research Act made in \n     restorations of benefits for needy legal immigrants. The \n     Hunger Relief Act restores food stamp eligibility to all \n     otherwise eligible legal immigrants. Among these are \n     taxpayers working in low-income jobs, parents of young \n     children, and elderly persons.\n       Second, the bill updates food stamp rules. Most low-income \n     parents need a car to get to work, but families who own a \n     vehicle worth more than $4,650 may be disqualified from \n     receiving food stamps. This limit has risen only $150 since \n     1977, and is less than the amount that most states deem \n     appropriate for allowing working parents to own a reliable \n     car and still qualify for the Temporary Assistance for Needy \n     Families (TANF) Program. The Hunger Relief Act allows states \n     the option of using the same rules to count the value of a \n     vehicle under both TANF and Food Stamp Programs.\n       Third, the bill helps low-income families with children \n     with high shelter costs. In order to allow food stamp \n     allotments to more accurately reflect actual household need, \n     the Food Stamp Program takes into account a household's \n     shelter expenses when determining the household's food stamp \n     allotment. The program does this by allowing households to \n     deduct shelter costs from their income. Current food stamp \n     rules, however, cap the amount of shelter costs ($275 now, \n     $300 starting in FY 2001) that non-elderly, non-disabled \n     households may deduct, leaving many families with children \n     forced to choose between heating and eating. The hunger \n     Relief Act raises the food stamp shelter deduction cap to \n     $320 per month over four years and then indexes it to \n     inflation.\n       Fourth, the Hunger Relief Act bolsters TEFAP, which since \n     1983 has leveraged private and volunteer resources in \n     communities across the country to meet short-term nutrition \n     needs of families in crisis and provided an outlet for excess \n     government-owned commodities. As many as one in ten Americans \n     a year turn to the emergency feeding network. Last December \n     the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that requests for \n     emergency food assistance had increased by an average of 14%, \n     with 78% of the cities registering increases. According to a \n     report released by America's Second Harvest in 1998, 39% of \n     those who sought emergency food were employed, with half of \n     those employed full-time. The private charitable sector \n     cannot meet present needs alone. The Hunger Relief Act \n     authorizes additional appropriations of $100 million over \n     five years for commodity purchases and food distribution \n     costs, approximately 10% more than present spending.\n       The Hunger Relief Act would make important progress in \n     addressing hunger in America.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RACISM AGAINST AMERICAN INDIANS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am compelled to raise a recent, \nshocking example of racism in South Dakota.\n  An Indian woman residing on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South \nDakota came across an ``advertisement'' in the local newspaper that \nbore the heading ``State of South Dakota, Game Fish and Parks \nDepartment''. She sent me a copy of the ad along with her letter.\n  The ``ad,'' which resembles a run-of-the-mill hunting and fishing \nseason announcement, was located in the editorial section of the \nnewspaper. The ``ad'' went on to outline the rules for ``Indian Hunting \nSeason'' in the State of South Dakota, including a limit on the number \nof Indians a ``hunter'' was allowed to kill and the approved methods \nfor killing them.\n  I cannot express to you the anger and deep disappointment I felt when \nI read this ad because for those who think anti-Indian sentiment and \nfeelings is a ``relic of the past,'' I urge them to read this product \nof a twisted and hateful mind.\n  At the turn of the millennium in the greatest nation on Earth, there \nare pockets of hate that continue to thrive. After my tenure in \nCongress, I know full well the limits of government. I know we can pass \nno law forcing people to respect each other or forcing them to be \ntolerant. But this ad goes beyond mere hurtful words and actually \nadvocates murder, and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, an enrolled member of \nthe Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana, and as an American, I am \nembarrassed and outraged at the same time. This is shameful.\n  Indian children are most affected by this kind of bile. They hear \nthese hate-filled expressions in school, in public places like shopping \nmalls and grocery stores, and they start to believe they are worthless, \nand they eventually stop trying to become or achieve anything. Many \ncommit suicide. This is ongoing.\n  In a few days, the Nation will honor the contributions of generations \nof Native Americans by dedicating the month of November, 1999, as \n``American Indian Heritage Month''.\n  Native people have fought and died for this country in every war from \nthe Revolutionary War to WWII to Vietnam to the ongoing missions around \nthe world.\n  Yet, as this ad shows, Indians are still targeted by these \nexpressions of hate.\n  I condemn this and every instance of discrimination and hatred \nagainst any American--red, black, white or yellow--and call on my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the newspaper ad printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Sicangu Sun Times, Oct. 15, 1999]\n\n                        Caution: Racist Material\n\n                         State of South Dakota\n\n      Game, Fish and Parks Department, Pierre, SD, (605) 224-0000\n\n\n                              proclamation\n\n       RE: Indian Hunting Season hunting fees: Free to first 7,683 \n     hunters/$1.00 thereon.\n       Dear South Dakota Hunters: The 1999 Big Game hunting season \n     in the State of South Dakota has been canceled due to \n     shortages of Deer, Turkey, Elk and Antelope. However, this \n     does not mean there will be no hunting. In the place of the \n     big game animals this year we will have open season on the \n     Sioux Reservations. This will entail the hunting of Americans \n     Worthless Siounis Pyutus, commonly known as ``Worthless Red \n     Bastards,'' ``Dog Eaters,'' ``Gut Eaters,'' ``Prairie \n     Niggers'' and ``F--- Indians.'' This year from 1999-2000 will \n     be an open season, as the f--- Indians must be thinned out \n     every two to three years.\n       It will be unlawful to: Hunt in a party of more that 150 \n     persons. Use more than 35 bloodthirsty, rabid hunting dogs. \n     Shoot in a public tavern (Bullet may ricochet and hit \n     civilized white people). Shoot an Indian sleeping on the \n     sidewalk.\n       Trapping regulations: Traps may not be set within 15 feet \n     of a liquor store. Traps may not be baited with Muscatel, \n     Lysol, rubbing alcohol or food stamps. All traps must have at \n     least 120 lb. spring strength and have a jaw spread of at \n     least 5'3''.\n       Other rules and regulations: Shooting length-wise in a \n     welfare line is prohibited. It will be unlawful to possess a \n     road-kill Indian, however, special road-kill permits shall be \n     issued to people with semi-tractor trailers and one-ton \n     pickup trucks. With such a permit you may bait the highway \n     with Muscatel, Lysol, rubbing alcohol or food stamps.\n       How to know when an Indian is in your area: Disposable \n     diapers litter the street. Large lines in front of the \n     welfare office and for free cheese. Trails of empty wine \n     bottles leading from the city parks to all city alleys. Empty \n     books of food stamps thrown all over. Car-loads of Indian \n     children waiting outside liquor stores.\n       Remember Limit is ten (10) per day. Possession of limit: \n     Forty (40). Good Hunting!\n       Editor's Note: The flyer above is similar to one found in \n     other states. In the last couple of years, they began \n     cropping up in South Dakota and Nebraska. Varying versions \n     can also be found on the Internet. Such sentiments have \n     helped fuel tension between Indians and whites in the last \n     year, say Indian leaders. State government officials have \n     denied that the flyers originated in any of their \n     departments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13396-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13396-S13397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DRUG COURT REAUTHORIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Congress created drug courts 5 years ago in \nthe 1994 crime law as a cost-effective, innovative way to deal with \nnonviolent offenders in need of drug treatment. Though authorization \nfor this program was repealed just two years later, we wisely continued \nto fund this program. I am pleased to join with Senator Specter today \nto cosponsor the ``Drug Court Reauthorization and Improvement Act of \n1999.''\n  In just 5 years, drug courts have taken off. There are 412 drug \ncourts currently operating in all 50 States plus the District of \nColumbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and two Federal districts. An additional \n280 courts are being planned.\n  Let me tell you why I am such an advocate for these courts. Drug \ncourts are as much about fighting crime as they are about reducing \ndependence on illegal drugs.\n  Our Nation has about 3.2 million offenders on probation today. They \nstay on probation for about 2 years. Throughout those 2 years, they are \nsubject to little, if any, supervision.\n  For example, almost 300,000 of these probationers had absolutely no \ncontact with their probation officer in the past month--not in person, \nnot over the phone, not even through the mail--none!\n  Drug Courts fill this ``supervision gap'' with regular drug testing, \nwith the offender actually coming before a judge twice a week, and \nactually seeing a probation officer or treatment professional three \ntimes a week.\n  Nearly 100,000 people have entered drug court programs and the \nresults have been impressive. About 70 percent of the drug court \nprogram participants have either stayed in the program or completed it \nsuccessfully. That is more than twice the retention rate of most \ntraditional treatment programs.\n  The other 30 percent of the participants went to jail. And I think \nthat should be heralded as a success of the drug court program as well. \nWithout drug courts, this 30 percent would have been unsupervised, not \nmonitored, and unless they happened to be unlucky enough to use drugs \nor commit a crime near a police officer, they would still be on the \nstreets abusing drugs and committing crimes. Drug courts provide the \noversight to make sure that does not happen.\n  The Specter-Biden reauthorization bill calls for fully funding drug \ncourts at the level the Attorney General and I called for in the 1994 \ncrime law--- $200 million. Drug courts are effective and cost \neffective. Let's spend our money wisely and invest in what works.\n  There are a number of jurisdictions that want to open or expand their \ndrug courts but are unable to do so because of lack of treatment \ncapacity. We always talk about devolving power to State and local \ngovernment. Let's put our money where our mouth is and give these \njurisdictions the funds they need. The Specter-Biden reauthorization \nact includes $75 million a year to expand local treatment capacity so \nthat no community that wants to start or expand a drug court is \nprecluded from doing so due to lack of treatment slots.\n\n[[Page S13397]]\n\n  Make no mistake, participating in the drug court program is not a \nwalk in the park. If you use drugs while in the program, you go to \njail. Period.\n  Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the \ncriminal justice system, drug courts help these folks to get their acts \ntogether so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court \nprograms they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in \nsociety. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school \nor obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial \nobligations including drug court fees and child support payments. They \nare also required to have a sponsor who will keep them on track.\n  This program works. And that is not just my opinion. Columbia \nUniversity's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse found \nthat these courts are effective at taking offenders with little \nprevious treatment history and keeping them in treatment; that they \nprovide closer supervision than other community programs to which the \noffenders could be assigned; that they reduce crime; and that they are \ncost-effective.\n  According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least \n$5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing \nof the cost savings associated with future crime prevention. Just as \nimportant, scarce prison beds are freed up for violent criminals.\n  I have saved what may be the most important statistic for last.

Mr. President, Monday was a tragic day for golf fans \nacross the country, and especially for folks in my home town of \nSpringfield, MO--the town where pro golfer Payne Stewart was born and \nraised. Today, we mourn the loss of Payne, who lost his life Monday in \na plane crash. I rise to express my sympathy to Payne's family and \nloved ones, and to the families of the other individuals who lost their \nlives Monday: Robert Fraley, Van Ardan, Michael King, and Stephanie \nBellegarrigue.\n  I would also like to take a moment to remember Payne Stewart, a man \nwhose personality, talents, and faith are an inspiration to us.\n  From his early years, Payne distinguished himself as not only a \ngolfer, but as an all-around athlete. One of my staff members from \nSpringfield remembers tagging along as a six year-old little sister \nwith her father, her brother, Payne, and his father on a road trip to \nKansas City, where the boys competed in the state's annual Pass, Punt, \nand Kick contest. She also recalls the countless hours her brother was \ngone during the summers, playing golf--often times with Payne.\n  In high school, Payne excelled as an athlete in football, basketball, \nand of course, golf, at Greenwood High School, where he graduated in \n1975. Payne then attended Southern Methodist University, where he won \nthe Southwestern Conference Golf Championship and was named an All-\nAmerican.\n  Payne turned professional in 1981 and embarked upon what would be a \nhighly successful career.\n  Payne's flare for style and individualism soon made him one of the \nmost recognizable golfers on the PGA tour, with his now-trademark \nknickers, long colorful socks, and coordinating hat.\n  But Payne's attire on the golf course was not the only thing that \ndistinguished him among his colleagues. Overall, Payne won 11 PGA Tour \ntitles, including three major championships: the PGA in 1989, the U.S. \nOpen in 1991, and the U.S. Open again in June of this year. He was on \nfive Ryder Cup teams and won three consecutive Skins Games. He was \ninducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame earlier this year.\n  In what is now known as his final U.S. Open appearance, Stewart \nfinished his last U.S. Open round by sinking the longest winning putt \never to win the most heralded American tournament. While Stewart always \nwill be remembered for this clutch putt to win the 1999 U.S. Open, what \nhe did one month later during the Ryder Cup competition speaks to his \ncharacter. After a miraculous final day comeback by the American team, \nStewart's opponent, Colin Montgomerie, faced a ten foot putt to win the \nindividual match on the final hole. Although the American team already \nhad assured itself a victory, a tie with Europe's top player would have \nbeen a tremendous individual feat for Stewart. Instead of making \nMontgomerie attempt the putt, Stewart told his opponent to ``pick it \nup,'' conceding the putt and ensuring his own defeat. Stewart's \njustification for his action was that Montgomerie had been heckled all \nday by the American fans and he did not want to put his opponent \nthrough that if he missed.\n  Payne Stewart, who became a world-famous golfer, continued to be a \nhome-town boy from the Ozarks after his success. Although Orlando had \nbecome his official home, Payne still liked to come back home to \nSpringfield to spend time with family and friends. Those close to him \nsay that when he came home, Payne didn't act like a celebrity, but \nrather more like ``everyday people.''\n  There are many words that have been used to describe Payne Stewart. \nFun-loving and generous. Highly competitive. Yet Payne was also very \nmuch of a family man.\n  Payne was always close to his father, Bill. The father and son tandem \nshared the unique distinction of winning dual amateur championships, \nthe Missouri Amateur and the Missouri Senior Amateur in 1979. After his \nfather had died of cancer in1985, Payne donated his entire $108,000 in \nwinnings from the 1987 Bay Hill Classic to a Florida hospital. Mr. \nPresident, I, too, had a father who had a major impact on my life, and \nI was touched by the reflections I heard Payne share about his father.\n  Payne was also recently described by the Springfield News-Leader as \nthe ``consummate family man who was as thrilled with picking up \ndaughter Chelsea [13] and son Aaron [10] from school, or shuttling them \nback and forth to ball games, activities, etc., as he was picking up a \nfirst-place check.'' Friends say that Payne believed that family time \nwith his children and his wife Tracey was the most important thing in \nhis life, even if it meant canceling a tournament appearance.\n  In the last year or so, Payne Stewart characterized himself as an \nincreasingly religious man. He said that watching his children grow up \nfurther strengthened his faith. Payne also attributed his success to \nhis faith. In fact, he publicly credited this faith with giving him the \nstrength to sink the winning 15-foot putt at this year's U.S. Open this \nJune. A close friend, reflecting Monday on Payne's death, said, ``Later \non, coming to know the Lord, he was attributing his success, his \ntalents and his blessing--he attributed it all and gave glory to Jesus \nChrist.''\n  Mr. President, while it is painful to see someone in the prime of his \ncareer have his life cut short by tragedy, it is also encouraging to \nremember someone whose life has inspired us--through both his talents \nas a golf champion and through his commitment to faith and family. \nToday we remember Payne Stewart--a local hero from the Ozarks--a \nchampion and a competitor, and we convey our thoughts and prayers to \nhis family and loved ones during this time of grief. I also want to \nexpress condolences to the families and friends of those who perished \nwith Payne, Robert Fraley, Van Ardan, Michael King, and Stephanie \nBellegarrigue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13397-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13397-S13398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEW YORK YANKEES WINNING THE WORLD SERIES\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the New York \nYankees on the occasion of their victory in Major League Baseball's \nWorld Series last night. In front of 56,752 fans, the Yankees defeated \nthe Atlanta Braves 4-1 and clinched a series sweep in this best of \nseven series. Fittingly, ``The Team of the Millennium'' has staked its \nclaim as the best franchise in the 1990's.\n\n[[Page S13398]]\n\n  As the season began, few seers in the sports world could have \nforetold the indelible mark this team would leave behind. The adversity \nthese young men faced would have folded a team of lesser character. \nTheir stalwart manager Joe Torre began the year in a hospital room \nrather than in the dugout as he battled prostate cancer. Teammates Paul \nO'Neill, Luis Sojo, and Scott Brosius all lost their fathers during the \npast season. In addition, the Yankee family was struck by the passing \nof baseball legends, Joe DiMaggio and Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter. Yet this \nteam endured and reached its goal, giving New York an unfathomable 25th \nWorld Championship.\n  For the past two seasons--and three of the last four--we have seen \nthe Yankees go to the World Series. They emerged victorious after the \nminimum of four straight wins on both occasions. Starting pitchers \nDavid Cone, Orlando Hernandez, and Roger Clemens held the Braves to a \nmeager six hits and two runs in 21\\2/3\\ innings. Reliever Mariano \nRivera had saves in Games One and Two and won Game Three on his way to \nbecoming the Series Most Valuable Player. Offensively, the team had \nDerek Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch getting on base, and Chad Curtis came \noff the bench to hit two home runs in Game Three, with the second \ncoming in the bottom of the 10th, sealing the victory for the Bronx \nBombers.\n  All in all, this team put forth admirable effort coupled with \nunmatched talent. This victory is a truly epochal moment that brings \njoy to the hearts of Yankee fans everywhere. An editorial appearing in \ntoday's New York Times puts it best, ``We are all fans now.'' In \nclosing I would like to offer a possible slogan for next year's team: \nThrice would be nice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 29, 1999]\n\n                            The Yankees Win\n\n       Maturity in sports has many looks, but right now it looks \n     like the New York Yankees, who won their 25th World Series \n     last night against the Atlanta Braves. Clearly, the Yankees \n     were able to dominate the Braves, whom they swept, but just \n     as clearly they were able to dominate themselves and their \n     own fortunes. Patience is a word that has been much used \n     around the Yankees dugout this season, and what it means is a \n     privileged manner of looking at baseball. What this team \n     seems to see is not a game where one event cascades into \n     another as the innings slip by, the past steadily \n     commandeering the present. To this team baseball looks like a \n     game of constant renewal, with each pitch, each batter, each \n     defensive out.\n       Baseball is, if anything, too rich in the grand themes, \n     especially during a World Series. You expect television to \n     turn grandeur into grandiosity, and it does. But a kind of \n     triumphalism thrives at Yankee Stadium too, where the World \n     Series pregame soundtrack included the theme from ``Star \n     Wars'' and the ``1812 Overture.'' But that mood is meant for \n     the fans, not the players. There is a difference between \n     destiny and opportunity, and the 1999 Yankees know it. They \n     will take opportunity every time, and in this Series, take it \n     they have.\n       It is easy, in the high-wattage glare of a Series game, to \n     lose sight of the fact that baseball, even at Yankee Stadium, \n     can still have a pleasantly smalltown feel to it. Kofi Annan, \n     mayor of the world if not the city, throws out the first \n     pitch in New York, which bounces halfway to the plate. \n     Marching bands from South Jersey assemble on the warning \n     track--the outfield grass remaining inviolate--and play \n     ``Gimme Some Lovin'' and ``Louie, Louie.'' The notes of all \n     the instruments, except the base drums, gust away into the \n     evening, just as they would at a local homecoming game. Hand-\n     lettered signs rise in the stands--``Dripping Springs, Texas, \n     Loves the Yankees''--and the stadium sparkles with camera \n     flashes going off, snapshots of a vortex where a batter steps \n     up to the plate.\n       The fans roar with emphatic, if imprecise, knowledge. They \n     call balls and strikes from a mile away. The air is barbed \n     with advice, with schoolyard taunts, and then with the \n     exultation of the moment. The emotion so latent in the \n     players, so overt in the fans, gives way at the final out, \n     and at last, in the rejoicing, there is no distinction \n     between players and fans. We are all fans now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13398-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, a lack of leadership from the \nadministration is responsible for the present difficulty in reaching an \nagreement on the foreign operations appropriations bill. The President \nsays he vetoed the bill over low levels of foreign assistance in \ngeneral and a lack of funding for the Wye Accord specifically. The \nAdministration did not exert the leadership needed to secure the Wye \nfunding, however, and did not work with Congress to find a way to \nprovide this critical assistance to Israel, Jordan, and the \nPalestinians without raiding the Social Security surplus. I am a strong \nsupporter of funding the Wye Accord if the money can be found without \nusing Social Security surplus funds. The President should make Wye \nfunding the priority it should be and find the money somewhere in the \nbudget.\n  The lack of leadership from the administration in providing for our \nallies and interests in the Middle East already has had real costs, \nhowever. The President's veto of the foreign operation appropriations \nbill on October 18, 1999 sends a disturbing signal that our foreign \npolicy is being held hostage to the domestic budget politics of the \nadministration. While the President's veto was the wrong step for U.S. \nforeign policy around the world, the administration's rejection of the \nbill is particularly troubling for U.S. policy in the Middle East and \nstrategic allies such as Israel.\n  The foreign operations bill passed by Congress contains $960 million \nin economic assistance and $1.9 billion in military assistance for \nIsrael. The foreign operations bill also contains over $2 billion in \nassistance to Egypt and $225 million in aid to Jordan, both important \ncountries in the peace process. The provision of such assistance to \nIsrael is critically important at this juncture of the peace process, \nand it troubles me that the administration did not lay the groundwork \nfor an acceptable foreign assistance package. The government of Prime \nMinister Ehud Barak has stated its intention to complete final status \nnegotiations within one year. Many difficult issues must be resolved \nfor a final settlement to be reached. Jerusalem, refugees, and water \nrights are just several of the monumental issues that will be topic of \nnegotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.\n  It is my hope that the administration will support Israel more \nforcefully during these negotiations, including a clear statement of \nU.S. policy that Jerusalem is and should remain Israel's undivided \ncapital. As final status negotiations proceed, the United States should \ndefend Israel against diplomatic ambushes in international fora such as \nthe United Nations. An unequivocal U.S. position in support of Israel \nin the coming months will be essential to achieve a sustainable peace \nsettlement.\n  Also at stake is a potential peace settlement with Syria. I trust \nthat Prime Minister Barak will not make territorial concessions in the \nGolan Heights that will jeopardize Israel's security. As a former \nmilitary chief of staff, Prime Minister Barak is well aware of the \nsecurity implications associated with relinquishing territory in the \nGolan. Any Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights should be met with \nthe most reliable assurances from Syria that its hostility toward \nIsrael and support for terrorism will cease. For the peace to be \nsustainable, however, and Israel-Syrian settlement will have to be \nbased on more than words. Israel will have to be able to defend itself, \nand continued provision of annual U.S. military assistance is an \nintegral part of that process.\n  With all that is at stake right now in the peace process, it is \ndifficult for me to understand why the administration has not worked \nclosely with Congress to ensure that vital assistance is provided to \nIrasel in a timely fashion. Mr. President, it is my hope that the \nadministration will demonstrate better leadership in supporting Israel \nas the peace process enters this critical year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13398-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13398-S13399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HIGH SPEED RAIL INVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating Senator \nLautenberg for developing this important piece of legislation that \nrecognizes the importance of rail in our overall transportation system \nas we approach the 21st century.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the High Speed Rail \nInvestment Act, which will provide Amtrak with\n\n[[Page S13399]]\n\nmuch needed resources to pay for high speed rail corridors across the \ncountry. This legislation is crucial for the country, and for my home \nState of Massachusetts, and I am hopeful we can move it quickly through \nCongress.\n  This bill will give Amtrak the authority to sell $10 billion in bonds \nover the next 10 years to finance high speed rail. Instead of interest \npayments, the Federal Government would provide tax credits to \nbondholders. Amtrak would repay the principal on the bonds after 10 \nyears, however, the payments would come primarily from required state \nmatching funds. I know many states will gladly participate in this \nmatching program, as their Governors and State legislatures are eager \nto promote high speed rail. Amtrak would be authorized to invest this \nmoney solely for upgrading existing lines to high speed rail, \nconstructing new high speed rail lines, purchasing high speed rail \nequipment, eliminating or improving grade crossings, and for capital \nupgrades to existing high speed rail corridors.\n  Let there be no mistake, this country needs to develop a \ncomprehensive national transportation policy for the 21st century. So \nfar, Congress has failed to address this vital issue. What we have is \nan ad hoc, disjointed policy that focuses on roads and air to the \ndetriment of rail. We need to look at all of these modes of \ntransportation to alleviate congestion and delays on the ground and in \nthe sky and to move people across this country efficiently. Failing to \ndo this will hamper economic growth and harm the environment.\n  Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency and reliability in Europe \nand Japan, and also in the Northeast corridor here in the United \nStates, passenger rail is severely underfunded. We need to include rail \ninto the transportation mix. We need more transportation choices and \nthis bill helps to provide them.\n  In the Northeast corridor, Amtrak is well on its way to implementing \nhigh speed rail service. The high speed Acela service should start \nrunning in January. This will be extremely helpful in my home State of \nMassachusetts, where airport and highway congestion often reach \nfrustrating levels. The more miles that are traveled on Amtrak, the \nfewer trips taken on crowded highways and skyways.\n  But new service in the Northeast corridor is only the beginning. We \nneed to establish rail as a primary mode of transportation along with \nair and highways. This bill will help us achieve that goal across the \ncountry and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of such an important \npiece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13399-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13399-S13400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION WEEK\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in observance of \n``National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week'' to highlight the \nproblem of childhood lead poisoning and the deficiencies within the \ncurrent system of detection and prevention.\n  Lead poisoning is the number one environmental health hazard to our \nchildren, despite a ban on the manufacture of lead paint and efforts to \nremove lead from gasoline and dietary sources. It is estimated that \n800,000 children today suffer from elevated lead levels. Lead poisoning \nattacks a child's nervous system, impairing physical, mental, and \nbehavioral development. Extreme exposure can cause seizures, brain \ndamage, comas, and even death. And, inadequate diet and exposure to \nenvironmental hazards such as old housing make the threat greatest for \nthose who possess the fewest resources to confront it--our nation's \npoor children.\n  This is why in 1992 Congress required states to test every Medicaid \nrecipient under age two for lead poisoning. Mandatory screening would \nenable the highest-risk children to be tested and treated before lead \npoisoning impairs their development. However, many Medicaid providers \nare not conducting the required screening. A recent GAO study found \nthat two-thirds of the children on Medicaid have never been screened \nfor lead. In New Jersey, only 39% of children covered by Medicaid are \ntested.\n  A report issued this past summer from the Alliance to End Childhood \nLead Poisoning and the National Center for Lead-Safe Housing provides \nnew information regarding the extent of this problem. This report, a \nstate-by-state analysis of follow-up care provided to lead-poisoned \nchildren, found that only 29 states have standards for how to care for \nlead-poisoned children. The report also found that only 35 states have \ndeveloped specific strategies for investigating lead hazards in \npoisoned children's homes. And, 22 states reported that they lack the \nnecessary funding to make a home safe for a lead-poisoned child.\n  This report presents compelling evidence in support of legislation, \nS.1120, the Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999, introduced by Senator \nReed and myself to strengthen lead screening policy. This legislation \nwould ensure that every federal program which serves at risk kids is \ninvolved in the lead screening process. Our bill would require WIC and \nHead Start centers to determine if a child has been tested and ensure \ntesting for those children who have not. As 75% of at-risk children are \nenrolled in federal health care programs, this would ensure that no \nchild is overlooked.\n  Secondly, the Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999 would guarantee that \nMedicaid contracts explicitly require health care providers to adhere \nto federal rules for screening and treatment. Currently, many states \nare having Medicaid services provided by health maintenance \norganizations (HMO's). These HMO's, however, either are not conducting \nthe required lead screening tests or are only conducting one of two \nrequired tests. This legislation would effectively stop this corner \ncutting. Our bill would also ensure that states and federal agencies \nhave the resources and incentives to complete mandatory screening by \nrequiring Medicaid to reimburse WIC and Head Start for screening costs. \nWe must create a bonus program that rewards states who screen more than \n65% of their Medicaid population.\n  But additional testing is only a first step. Our legislation would \nalso focus on prevention by reducing the sources of poisoning and \nprovide for follow-up care for those children identified as at-risk. \nThis includes expanding Medicaid coverage to include treatment for lead \npoisoning and for environmental investigations to determine its \nsources.\n  I am extremely pleased to tell my colleagues that in response to the \nefforts of the Senator from Rhode Island and myself, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services has initiated some important steps to address \nthe problem. Their efforts include ensuring that state Medicaid \nagencies comply with existing Medicaid policies requiring lead \nscreening and requiring states to report the number of children under \nage six screened for lead poisoning. These measures will help us to \nbetter understand the problem and how to respond to it.\n  However, enhancing screening and identifying children exposed to lead \nis only the first step. Identification must be followed with treatment \nand abatement, including controlling the source of lead poisoning. For \nexample, my own state of New Jersey has made great efforts in the area \nof abatement. Specifically, New Jersey requires the renovation and \nmaintenance of older housing as well as mandating landlords to \nperiodically test for lead. New Jersey has also initiated statewide \nprograms to educate families on how to find and eliminate lead sources \nfrom their homes.\n  Similarly, on the federal level, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment provides grants to states and local governments to reduce \nlead hazards in housing. Yet, for every application, there are nine \nthat go unfunded. This year, the House tried to cut funding for this \nprogram by $10 million. Although conferees ultimately restored funding \nequal to the President's request, this attempt demonstrates the need to \nprovide greater awareness of the need for lead prevention efforts.\n  As the Alliance report suggests, there is more every state must do \nand there is clearly more the federal government can do to protect \nlead-poisoned children. I encourage my colleagues to examine the \nAlliance report and learn about what can be done in your states to \nimprove lead poisoning treatment and prevention efforts. Finally, I \nwould encourage Senator Roth and Senator Jeffords to begin hearings not \nonly on our legislation but also on this issue. In 1992, Congress\n\n[[Page S13400]]\n\nmade a commitment to improving our children's health by reducing the \nprevalence of childhood lead poisoning and improving treatment. I urge \nmy colleagues to join Senator Reed and myself in fulfilling this \ncommitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13400-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2260.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nprovide meaningful campaign finance reform through requiring better \nreporting, decreasing the role of soft money, and increasing individual \ncontribution limits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n\n\n        The Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I join several of my \ncolleagues in introducing the ``Open and Accountable Campaign Financing \nAct of 2000.'' This bill increases disclosure requirements on campaign \ncontributions and political broadcast advertisements. It also caps \n``soft money'' contributions to political party committees at $60,000 \nand adjusts individual contribution limits for inflation. I am pleased \nthat the following Senators have joined me today in offering this bill: \nSpencer Abraham (R-MI), Mike DeWine (R-OH), Slade Gorton (R-WA), Bob \nKerrey (D-NE), Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Craig Thomas (R-WY).\n  Changing the way federal campaigns are financed is inevitable, the \nAmerican people will demand it. At some point, the Senate will have a \nfull and open debate on how best to reform our campaign finance system. \nI was disappointed that floor procedures prevented us from doing so \nlast week, because several of us had intended to offer amendments to \nthe McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  My colleagues and I introduce this bill today as a bipartisan \nalternative in what has been a very polarized debate. If we are ever to \nmove forward on this issue, we will need to look at a variety of ways \nto reform the campaign finance system. This bill is a combination of \nideas offered by myself and a number of my colleagues. Several specific \nprovisions in this bill have widespread support by both Republicans and \nDemocrats, and, I believe, can form a base from which consensus can \nbuild.\n  Confidence in our political system is the essence of representative \ngovernment. This begins with an open and accountable campaign financing \nsystem. We need to rise above partisan, ideological and personal \nrivalries, and find common ground on campaign finance reform.\n  There are several elements that must be part of any reform of our \ncampaign finance system. One of the most important is increased \ndisclosure for all who participate in the political process. We should \nnot fear an educated and informed body politic. If individuals and \norganizations are going to participate in the election process, their \nparticipation must be revealed to the public.\n  To provide for fuller disclosure, this bill increases the financial \nreporting requirements for candidates and political parties. This \nlegislation also takes the rules on broadcast ads that apply to \ncandidates and extends them to all political broadcast ads. Under \ncurrent federal regulations, when a candidate buys a political ad, the \nbroadcaster is required to place information on the ad in a file that \nis open to the public. This includes a record of the times the spots \nare scheduled to air, the overall amount of time purchased and at what \nrates, and the names of the officers of the organization placing the \nad. Under current federal regulations, when an interest group places a \npolitical ad with a broadcaster, it does not have to meet all of these \nrequirements. This bill requires that interest-group ads related to any \nfederal candidate or issue go into the broadcaster's public file. There \nwould be no added burden on the broadcaster. The broadcaster would \nsimply use the same form already used for candidate and party ads. Let \nme make clear one thing the bill does not do. It does not require \norganizations to identify individual donors or provide membership \nlists. It preserves a reasonable balance between the public's right to \nknow which groups are attempting to influence an election, and the \nprivacy rights of individual donors.\n  In addition to disclosure, we need to look at soft money \ncontributions to national party committees. Most constitutional experts \nsay that an outright ban on soft money would be unconstitutional. But \nthis unaccountable, unlimited flood of soft money cascading over \nAmerica's politics must be stopped. We need to find a middle ground \nbetween the extremes of banning soft money and leaving it unrestricted. \nThis bill limits soft money contributions to national party committees \nto $60,000. This is not a ban on financial support of parties. It is a \nreturn to the original intent of the campaign finance reforms of the \n1970s, which worked well until they were exploited and abused.\n  We also need to increase the ability of individuals to participate in \nthe most accountable method of campaign financing. This bill adjusts \nand indexes contributions to inflation and indexes them for further \nyears. For an individual, contribution limits would increase from \n$1,000 to $3,000 per candidate, per election. I've heard the argument \nthat raising these limits would give the wealthy too much influence and \naccess. If we cap or eliminate soft money and do not adjust the hard-\nmoney limits, we will chase more money into the black hole of third-\nparty ads, where the public cannot\n\n[[Page S13404]]\n\nview the flow of money. I want to bring more of that money into the \nsunlight where the American people have access to who is giving money \nand how much.\n  We have a great opportunity to restore some of the confidence the \nAmerican people have lost in their political system. Improving our \nsystem that selects America's leaders--who formulate and implement the \npolicies that govern our Nation--is a worthy challenge.\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I would like to express my \nsupport for ``The Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of \n1999,'' which would provide this country with much needed campaign \nfinance reform. Our Constitution lays out the requirements for someone \nrunning for office. In order to run for the Senate, the Constitution \ntells us that there are three requirements: you must be at least 30 \nyears old; you must have been a U.S. citizen for nine years; and you \nmust be a resident of the state you wish to represent.\n  What the Constitution doesn't tell you about is a fourth requirement: \nyou must have an awful lot of money, or at least know how to raise it. \nThe Constitution doesn't tell you this because when the framers drafted \nthe Constitution, they could not have imagined the ridiculously large \namounts of time and money one must spend today if he or she wants to be \nelected to office.\n  We need to change the law to give power back to working families, \nrestore their faith in the process, and make democracy work. That's why \nI have been an avid supporter of the McCain-Feingold bill and the \nShays-Meehan bill that recently passed the House, and that's why I am \nnow a cosponsor of Senator Hagel's bill.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate debated the McCain-Feingold bill. This \nyear's version was a stripped down version of the McCain-Feingold bills \nwe've debated, and I have supported, in years past. Although I prefer \nthe more comprehensive House passed Shays-Meehan bill, I understood \nSenators McCain and Feingold's decision to purposefully strip down \ntheir bill. They knew the realities of the vote count in the Senate. We \ndidn't have the votes to pass anything more comprehensive, so they \nintroduced a ``barebones'' bill which essentially did one simple thing: \nban soft money.\n  Unfortunately, the bill was pulled from the floor after a vote \nshowing McCain-Feingold still didn't have the votes to pass. The good \nnews is we picked up one vote; the bad news is we still haven't passed \na campaign finance reform bill. We made progress. That is why it is \nimportant to not let this issue die on the back burner. That is why I \nam joining in Senator Hagel's effort to keep this issue alive.\n  Currently, soft money is uncapped and unregulated--corporations, \nunions and wealthy individuals can contribute unlimited amounts of soft \nmoney. Senator Hagel's bill would cap soft money at $60,000. Although I \nprefer a complete ban, it is clear the Senate is a few votes short of \npassing this ban. Senator Hagel's new approach just might be the \ncompromise that can muster enough votes to pass the Senate. Let me be \nclear--while I prefer much more comprehensive reform of our campaign \nfinancing system--I do believe Senator Hagel's proposal is a step in \nthe right direction. This bill, with its cap on soft money and \ntightening of disclosure requirements, would be a good beginning.\n  The American people are frustrated with the millions of dollars they \nsee poured into campaigns. They are frustrated with out tendency to \ntalk instead of act. I am hopeful this bill can help make that happen. \nIn fact I want to applaud my friend, Senator Hagel for his efforts, and \nurge our colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1820. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nnational service educational awards from the recipient's gross income; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  americorps scholarship fairness act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of thousands dedicated volunteers around the country. The \nlegislation I am offering addresses an inequity in the tax code that \nadversely affects AmeriCorps volunteers. I urge my colleagues to pass \nit immediately.\n\n  Since 1994, in 4,000 communities across the country, AmeriCorps \nparticipants have tutored and mentored more than 4 million children, \ndeveloped after-school programs for over one million young people, and \nhelped build more than 11,000 homes. Their dedication and commitment \nare a tribute to the American tradition of public service. Currently, \nat the conclusion of 1,700 hours of service, AmeriCorps members receive \nan education award of $4,725. The award may be used by former \nvolunteers to pay for tuition expenses or the repayment of student \nloans.\n  Under long-established tax law, scholarships and grants are \nexcludable from income. However, because the AmeriCorps awards are \nconsidered to represent payment for services rendered, they must be \nincluded in taxable income at the end of the year. This tax treatment \ncreates a significant hardship for former volunteers. Because \nAmeriCorps education awards are sent directly to the loan agency or \neducational institution, they do not represent income from which a \nportion may be reserved by the beneficiary for the payment of tax. \nAfter serving in AmeriCorps, many former volunteers work part-time to \npay for college, and the education award pushes their income above the \nstandard income tax deduction, creating tax liability for an individual \nwith little means to pay for it.\n  Mr. President, allow me to illustrate. Maleah Thorpe of Sunderland, \nMassachusetts, is a two-year AmeriCorps participant. Most recently, \nMaleah served as a volunteer with Massachusetts Campus Compact. The \nMassachusetts Campus Compact coordinates formal and informal assistance \nfor students, staff, and faculty in the areas of: America Reads and \nearly childhood literacy initiatives, America Counts and math education \ninitiatives, and other Campus and community partnerships. Maleah's \nservice has benefited our community and our country, while at the same \ntime, has provided a rewarding personal experience.\n  Listen to what Maleah has to say about AmeriCorps:\n\n       My experiences with AmeriCorps have been life-changing, \n     introducing me to so many opportunities and a new \n     appreciation of both the diversity and strength of people in \n     our nation. I consider myself fortunate and am thankful that \n     I will have not one, but two educational awards should I need \n     to use them. However, I am at the same time dreading the out-\n     of-pocket expense that will accompany their use * * *. \n     Although I was anxious to use the educational award earned \n     during my first year of service to reduce my undergraduate \n     loan debt, the cost of paying taxes on the amount has \n     prohibited me from doing so.\n       When I entered AmeriCorps two years ago, I did so for the \n     service. I also anticipated that approximately 75 percent of \n     my undergraduate loan debt would be paid within three years \n     of graduation, something that helped justify the financial \n     cost of living on only the minimal stipend. Instead, I will \n     enter graduate school in the fall, my undergraduate loans \n     will continue to accrue interest and I will likely acquire \n     additional loans to cover some expenses because I can simply \n     not afford to use and pay taxes on my educational awards \n     while I am a student.\n       I know that I am not alone in this predicament. Many alumni \n     with whom I served are either students or completing \n     additional years of service, solely responsible for \n     educational and living expenses. Many of us do not have \n     additional income to pay taxes on the educational awards nor \n     the ability to ask friends or relatives to assist us.\n       I have given two years to serve my fellow citizens of the \n     nation and the Commonwealth and would never give up those \n     experiences. However, I should not now be punished for this \n     choice by the burden of additional taxes.\n\n  Similar situations arise with other programs. Congress has recognized \nthese inequities and acted to address them. For example, this summer's \nTaxpayer Refund and Relief Act would have specifically provided that \nscholarships received through the National Health Service Corps, the \nArmed Forces Health Professions program, and the National Institutes of \nHealth Undergraduate program are tax exempt. Let's do the same for the \nthousands of volunteers who, through the AmeriCorps program, give up \ntwo years of their lives to make a difference in communities across our \nnation.\n  The AmeriCorps Scholarship Fairness Act clarifies that AmeriCorps \neducation awards should receive the same tax treatment as a traditional \ncollege scholarship. Under the proposal, amounts received by an \nindividual as part of a national service education award would be \neligible for tax-free treatment as a qualified scholarship\n\n[[Page S13405]]\n\nunder section 117 of the tax code, without regard to the fact that the \nrecipient of the scholarship has provided services as a condition for \nreceiving the scholarship. The Joint Tax Committee estimates the cost \nin lost revenue would be $2 million the first year, $15 million over \nfive years, and $32 million over ten years.\n  The government should cherish, not punish, volunteerism and public \nservice. I hope my colleagues will join me in enacting this simple but \nmeaningful legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthree letters from Massachusetts constituents be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I am a two \n     year alumna of AmeriCorps, serving with City Year Rhode \n     Island (1997--98) and most recently as a VISTA with \n     Massachusetts Campus Compact (1998-99) working at the \n     University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n       My experiences with AmeriCorps have been life-changing, \n     introducing me to so many opportunities and a new \n     appreciation of both the diversity and strength of people in \n     our nation. These past two years have left an immeasurable \n     impact on my life, changed my perspective on many things, and \n     even altered my future plans; in September I will begin \n     graduate studies at UMass Amherst.\n       I consider myself fortunate and am thankful that I will \n     have not one, but two, Educational Awards should I need to \n     use them. However, I am at the same time dreading the out-of-\n     pocket expense that will accompany their use. I had a small \n     preview of what is to come last December when I used my \n     Interest Payment option from my first year of AmeriCorps \n     service. For choosing to use this ``benefit'' of $543, I was \n     required to pay an unexpected $120 in state and (mostly) \n     federal taxes. While this may seem like a small sum, I assure \n     you that it is not to someone living on a VISTA stipend where \n     every penny is accounted for to cover basic living expenses.\n       Although I was anxious to use the Educational Award earned \n     during my first year of service to reduce my undergraduate \n     loan debt, the cost of paying taxes on the amount has \n     prohibited me from doing so.\n       When I entered AmeriCorps two years ago, I did so for the \n     service. I also anticipated that approximately 75% of my \n     undergraduate loan debt would be paid within three years of \n     graduation, something that helped justify the financial cost \n     of living on only the minimal stipend. Instead, I will enter \n     graduate school in the fall, my undergraduate loans will \n     continue to accrue interest and I will likely acquire \n     additional loans to cover some expenses because I can simply \n     not afford to use and pay taxes on my Educational Awards \n     while I am a student.\n       I know that I am not alone in this predicament. Many alumni \n     with whom I served are either students or completing \n     additional years of service, solely responsible for \n     educational and living expenses. Many of us do not have \n     additional income to pay taxes on the Educational Awards nor \n     the ability to ask friends or relatives to assist us.\n       I have given two years to serve my fellow citizens of the \n     nation and the Commonwealth and would never give up those \n     experiences. However, I should not now be punished for this \n     choice by the burden of additional taxes. As a citizen of the \n     Commonwealth and on behalf of those who have served and will \n     serve in the future, I ask that you work to remove this \n     burden of taxation of the AmeriCorps Educational Awards.\n       Thank you for your time and efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Maleah F. Thorpe.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Ware, MA, July 19, 1999.\n       To Whom it May Concern: My name is Jamie Rutherford and I \n     am a resident of Ware, Massachusetts. Following graduation \n     from the University of Hartford in 1996, I entered the \n     AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps. I served two \n     10-month terms in the program, 1996--97 in Denver, CO, and \n     1997-98 in Charleston, SC.\n       My motivation for joining AmeriCorps included my desire to \n     travel, to learn new skills, to lend myself to the community, \n     and to earn an educational award that I would be able to \n     apply toward my substantial student loans. I greatly enjoyed \n     my experience the first year in Denver, and had very little \n     difficulty deciding to reapply for a second year in South \n     Carolina. Over those two years I took part in fourteen \n     separate projects pertaining to the environment, education, \n     public safety, and unmet human needs. I traveled to nine \n     states and enjoyed experiences ranging from inner city \n     tutoring, to midwestern trailbuilding, to even Gulf Coast \n     erosion control.\n       My experiences in AmeriCorps were wonderful, and have \n     instilled in me a great appreciation for national service. I \n     did, however, face several daunting challenges during my term \n     of service. The most difficult challenges usually involved \n     personal finance. The living stipend provided to us was \n     minimal, and it was often quite difficult to get by on such \n     meager funds. We did receive additional allotments for food \n     and travel, however, and got by as well as possible. Upon \n     completion of my first year in Denver, I applied my first \n     award to my student loan provider here in Massachusetts. The \n     greatest challenge for me came with the taxation of that \n     award during my second term in South Carolina. When I \n     discovered that I owed $350 to the Internal Revenue Service \n     due to the taxation of the award, I was forced to go on a \n     monthly payment plan during that second term. This was very \n     difficult for me considering our minimal living stipend. I \n     could not then and cannot now understand why the award was \n     taxable as such, or why the taxed amount could not at least \n     be subtracted from the $4,725 award initially.\n       Nearly a year after completing my second term and receiving \n     my second award, I still maintain the $4,725 balance of that \n     award. My current finances greatly necessitate the \n     utilization of the award toward my substantial student loan \n     bills. Nevertheless, I am reluctant to do so due to \n     uncertainty for my future financial viability. I fear that I \n     will not be able to afford another heavy taxation. Though the \n     award seems to be so beneficial, it threatens to actually be \n     somewhat detrimental to me.\n       My hope and request is that this taxation be abolished. It \n     simply does not seem reasonable that young people devoting \n     themselves to the improvement of our country should be so \n     unjustly penalized. I greatly support AmeriCorps and all the \n     good that it represents. I only wish that this one matter \n     would be reconsidered in order to lift the gray cloud that \n     has fallen over my memories of two wonderful years of \n     national service.\n           Thank you.\n     James E. Rutherford.\n                                  ____\n\n                                 Jamaica Plain, MA, July 20, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: My name is Brendan Miller and I am an alumnus \n     of AmeriCorps. I served two years, one with the Northwest \n     Service Academy in Oregon and one with City Year in South \n     Carolina as an AmeriCorps Leader. My AmeriCorps experience \n     changed my life and set me on a path of public service that I \n     now know is my calling.\n       I currently live in Boston, Massachusetts. As a supporter \n     of AmeriCorps you surely know a benefit of the AmeriCorps \n     experience is the Education Award that is granted at the end \n     of one's service. I used approximately $6,000 of this award \n     in January to pay off my loans from college. Unfortunately, \n     the Ed Award is considered income for tax purposes, so I will \n     be burdened with significantly higher taxes this year. In \n     fact, I chose not to use my whole Award this year in order to \n     split the tax burden between two years. If I had used the \n     entire Award this year, my financial situation would surely \n     have prevented me from meeting this tax without significant \n     hardship.\n       I am working for the Boston Plan for Excellence in \n     Education, which is a non-profit that is seeking to encourage \n     lasting school reform in the Boston schools. Although I \n     receive great satisfaction from this work, it does not pay \n     that well. Since my AmeriCorps experience, I have committed \n     myself to\n\n[[Page S13406]]\n\n     doing work that I feel is really making a difference, but \n     this also means living on a tighter budget.\n       I know many of my friends in service have also made similar \n     commitments to a life of service. However, our resolve can be \n     tested by the need to pay our bills. As a graduate of Brown \n     University with a degree in Computer Science, I could be \n     making significantly more money in the for-profit sector, and \n     I am often tempted to break my commitment to a life of \n     service.\n       As a supporter of AmeriCorps and national service, I know \n     you want to make it easy as possible for America's citizens \n     to serve their country. I ask you to remove the tax on \n     Education Awards to take a giant step forward in this effort.\n       Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any \n     additional questions. I look forward to hearing of your \n     leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brendan Miller.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1821. A bill to authorize the United States to recover from a \nthird party the value of any housing, education, or medical care or \ntreatment furnished or paid for by the United States and provided to \nany victim of lead poisoning; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            the lead poisoning expense recovery act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy colleague Senator Torricelli that would give the federal government \nclear authority to recover from the manufacturers of lead-based paint, \nfunds spent on the prevention and treatment of childhood lead \npoisoning.\n  Our knowledge of lead poisoning dates back to 200 BC, when the Greek \nphysician Galen wrote ``lead makes the mind give way.'' Benjamin \nFranklin knew about ``the mischievous effects of lead'' back when he \nwrote those words in 1786. In the late 19th century, scientific studies \nand medical reports began detailing the effects of lead on children. \nAnd by 1904, the source of those poisonings was identified as white \nlead paint used in housing. Queensland, Australia, was the first to ban \ncertain applications of lead-based paint in 1922. Austria, Belgium, \nBulgaria, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, France, Latvia, Poland, \nRomania, Spain, and Sweden followed suit in the mid-1920's. In 1978, \nmore than a half of a century later, lead-based paint was banned in the \nUnited States.\n  Today, nearly one million preschoolers nationwide have excessive \nlevels of lead in their blood; making lead poisoning the leading \nenvironmental health disease among children. Even low levels of lead \nexposure can cause serious injury to the developing brain and nervous \nsystem of children, lost IQ points, learning and reading disabilities, \nhyperactivity, and aggressive or delinquent behavior. At high levels of \nexposure, lead causes mental retardation, coma, convulsions and even \ndeath.\n  Lead-based paint in housing is the major remaining source of exposure \nand is responsible for most cases of childhood lead poisoning. Children \ncontract lead poisoning when they come into contact with lead-based \npaint chips, contaminated soil, or dust generated from deteriorated \npaint. An estimated three million tons of lead still coats the walls \nand woodwork of American homes. Approximately half of America's housing \nstock, roughly 64 million units contain some lead-based paint. Twenty \nmillion of which are considered hazardous because they contain paint \nwhich is peeling, cracked, or chipped. My home state of Rhode Island \nhas the fifth oldest housing stock in the country, and, as a result, \nhas a lead poisoning rate that is three times the national average.\n  Sadly, this disease is particularly prevalent in those communities \nwith the fewest resources to address the problem. Poor children are \neight times more likely than kids from moderate and upper income \nfamilies to contract lead poisoning. Yet, while lead poisoning is most \nprevalent in low-income communities, 20-25 percent of children who are \npoisoned live in middle- or upper-income homes. They were poisoned by \nexposure to lead released through renovation or repainting activities.\n  Taxpayers have already paid billions of dollars to deal with the \ntragic consequences of childhood lead exposure, including large \nexpenditures for medical care, special education, and lead abatement in \nhousing. However, what has been spent so far is barely a drop in the \nbucket. In Rhode Island alone, we are looking at a bill of $300 million \nto clean up just the most dangerous housing units. There are simply not \nenough grant or loan programs available. Last year, one federal lead \nabatement program had to turn down nine applicants for every grant it \nmade.\n  Each year, we fight to make childhood lead poisoning a priority in \nCongress, in State legislatures, in cities, and in communities, knowing \nthat the real solution is getting rid of the source of a child's \nexposure. At the same time we are frightfully aware that it could be \ndecades longer, and millions of poisoned children later, until we \nfinally ``get the lead out.''\n  The Rhode Island Attorney General recently filed a 10-count lawsuit \nagainst the manufacturers of lead paint and the industry's trade \nassociation. The lawsuit documents nearly a century-long record of \nindustry culpability. The lead industry aggressively marketed its \nproduct as safe, despite knowledge of its harmful effects that were \nmade apparent by continuous warnings from the medical community. To \ndate, an industry that has over $30 billion in assets has yet to make a \nsignificant contribution to addressing the problems associated with its \nproduct.\n\n  Clearly, victims of lead poisoning were never given a chance, not \neven a warning. Parents were never told that the product they used to \nbeautify their home could prevent their children from achieving their \nfullest potential. Instead, the industry fought regulations in \nCalifornia, New York, and Maryland that would have banned the use of \nlead-based paint or required the product to be labeled as poisonous. In \n1954, the Board of Health of New York City proposed a sanitary code \nprovision banning the sale of paints containing more than 1 percent \nlead, and requiring lead paint to be labeled as ``poisonous'' and not \nfor interior use. The lead industry opposed the proposal as \n``unnecessary and unjustified'' and unduly burdensome. Ultimately, the \nNew York City Board of Health dropped the proposed ban of lead paint in \n1955, and adopted a more narrow warning label requirement. This is only \none example from an extensive record of industry wrongdoing which I \nbelieve the federal government should have the authority to address.\n  That is why Senator Torricelli and I are introducing legislation that \nwill ensure that justice is served. Our legislation provides clear \nauthority for the Federal government to recover the significant \nresources it has expended to mitigate childhood lead poisoning. This \nincludes dollars spent on medical care and treatment, special \neducation, and funds spent to make homes lead-safe for children. As \ncities and states stand up and say enough is enough, it is only \nappropriate for the federal government to join them in the effort to \nhold the industry responsible. The severity of childhood lead poisoning \nand the considerable expense borne by taxpayers to clean up the \nindustry's mess demands action now. I urge my Senate colleagues to join \nme in supporting this legislation so that we can move aggressively \ntowards our goal to end childhood lead poisoning. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1821\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Lead poisoning is the number 1 environmental health \n     threat to young children, affecting an estimated 890,000 \n     children.\n       (2) Most children are poisoned in their homes through \n     exposure to lead particles when lead-based paint deteriorates \n     or is disturbed during home renovation or repainting.\n       (3) Lead paint remains in almost \\2/3\\ of the housing stock \n     of the United States.\n       (4) Lead poisoning may cause serious, long-term harm to \n     children, including reduced intelligence and attention span, \n     behavior problems, learning disabilities, and impaired \n     growth.\n       (5) Research shows that children with elevated levels of \n     lead in their blood are 7 times more likely to drop out of \n     high school than children without elevated blood-lead levels.\n       (6) Children from low-income families are 8 times more \n     likely to be poisoned by lead than children from high-income \n     families.\n       (7) African-American children are 5 times more likely to be \n     poisoned by lead than white children.\n\n[[Page S13407]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to require that group and individual health insurance coverage \nand group health plans provide coverage for treatment of a minor \nchild's congenital or developmental deformity or disorder due to \ntrauma, infection, tumor, or disease; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            treatment of children's deformities act of 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwith my colleague, Senator Snowe, to address the growing problem of \nHMOs denying insurance coverage for reconstructive surgery for children \nsuffering from physical defects and deformities. This legislation would \nrequire medical plans to cover the medical procedures to reconstruct a \nchild's appearance if they are born with abnormal structures of the \nbody, including a cleft lip or palate.\n\n  Today, approximately seven percent of American children are born with \npediatric deformities and congenital defects such as cleft lip, cleft \npalate, missing limbs including ears, and other facial deformities. \nUnfortunately, it has become commonplace for insurance companies to \nlabel reconstructive procedures to correct these deformities as \ncosmetic surgery and deny coverage to help these children eradicate or \nreduce deformities and acquire a normal appearance.\n  A recent survey of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive \nSurgeons indicated that over half the plastic surgeons questioned have \nhad a pediatric patient in the last two years who has been denied, or \nexperienced tremendous difficulty in obtaining, insurance coverage for \nreconstructive surgery.\n  It is disgraceful that many insurance companies claim that medical \nservices to restore to a child some semblance of a normal appearance \nare superfluous and merely for vanity or cosmetic purposes. My \ncolleagues may be wondering how such a ludicrous and cruel argument can \nbe made when these procedures are clearly reconstructive in nature. \nHelping a child born without ears or with a cleft so severe it extends \nto her hairline is not cosmetic surgery.\n  The medical and developmental complications arise from these \nconditions are tremendous. Speech impediments, hearing difficulties and \ndental problems are a few of the physical side effects resulting from a \nchild's physical deformity. In addition, the effect of a child's \ndeformities on their personal development, confidence, and self-esteem \nand their future aspirations and achievements, is often very far \nreaching.\n  A healthy self image is vitally important to develop self esteem and \nconfidence. How people see themselves, and how others see them, helps \ndetermine how a person feels about himself and whether he has the \nstrength to cope with difficult challenges, including the taunting of \npeers and disengagement from school activities. As parents, we want our \nchildren to be armed with a healthy self esteem and confidence. The \nbest way to guarantee that happens is to help them develop a strong and \nhealthy self image.\n  At the same time, I recognize that we live in a society which places \na high value on physical beauty and often unfairly uses it to measure a \nperson's worth, ability or potential in society. It is unrealistic not \nto recognize the unfair obstacles facing children born with deformities \nif they are not provided access to medical services to help them attain \na more normal physical appearance.\n  Some of my colleagues may know that my daughter, Bridget, whom Cindy \nand I adopted from Mother Theresa's orphanage in Bangladesh, was born \nwith a severe cleft. We are fortunate to have had the means and \nopportunities to provide the expert medical care necessary to help \nBridget physically and emotionally. However, we, too, encountered \nnumerous obstacles and denials by our insurance providers who did not \nbelieve that Bridget's medical treatment was necessary. Fortunately, \nCindy and I were able to afford the reconstructive services Bridget \nneeded, despite denials by our health plan. Most hard-working American \nfamilies are not so fortunate. That is why I am introducing this \nimportant bill to assist all American children.\n  This is not a new mandate that could cause health care premiums to \nescalate.

A bill to revise and extend the Safe and Drug-Free Schools \nand Communities Act of 1994; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           THE SAFE AND DRUG FREE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is no secret that drugs and violence \ndestroy lives and families. They also can destroy entire neighborhoods \nand communities. More and more, our young people--our children--are \nbeing exposed to the evils of drugs and the dangers of violence. That \nis why I am introducing legislation today, along with my colleagues \nSenators Dodd and Murray, that would reauthorize the Safe and Drug Free \nSchools program.\n  This program funds a wide range of drug education and prevention \nactivities. Our bill, which was drafted with the assistance of \ncommunity anti-drug organization representatives, would give states \ngreater flexibility on targeting assistance to schools in need; \nincrease accountability measures to ensure that assistance is targeted \nto programs that work; and improve coordination of Safe and Drug Free \nprograms with other community-based anti-drug programs.\n  Mr. President, I have dedicated a great deal of time, both in the \nHouse and the Senate, to fighting illegal drug use in this country. Way \nback in 1990, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I was on the \nNational Commission on Drug Free Schools. From my experience on this \nCommission, and through my work on drug prevention when I was \nLieutenant Governor of Ohio, I learned that school-based prevention \nefforts must be coordinated\n\n[[Page S13409]]\n\nand consistent during a child's school years. Programs must not have \ngaps that leave our children vulnerable to the lure of drugs.\n  Throughout my efforts, I always have emphasized the importance of a \nbalanced attack against drug use. We must win the fight against people \nwho manufacture and grow drugs, we must put a stop to those who \ntransport illegal drugs into, and through, this country, and we must \nfight against the dealers who their trade drugs on our streets and yes, \neven in our schools.\n  There are many fronts in the important battle against drugs. The Safe \nand Drug Free Schools program is one area where I think we can improve \nour efforts. I believe we should continue the Safe and Drug Free \nSchools Program, but increase the accountability of federally funded \nprograms and focus limited resources on programs that demonstrate an \nactual reduction in drug use. We must provide parents, schools, and \nlocal communities with the resources and flexibility they need to \nreduce drug use among kids.\n  Every child deserves to live and go to school in a drug and violence-\nfree community. Our bill helps ensure that our children have this \nopportunity. Congress first passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act--the \nprecursor to the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act--in \n1986. This legislation was the product of an aggressive, ambitious, and \ncomprehensive anti-drug effort, which contributed to a 25% overall \nreduction in adolescent drug use from 1988 to 1992. Unfortunately, over \nthe course of this decade, much of that success was lost. Youth drug \nuse increased dramatically, including an 80% increase in marijuana use \nby high school seniors, an 80% increase in cocaine use, and a 100% \nincrease in heroin use. We must reverse this trend. We have an \nobligation to our kids to reverse this trend.\n  I believe that our children's disturbing acceptance and \nexperimentation of life-destroying drugs is due in large part to the \nAdministration's national anti-drug strategy, which has been neither \nbalanced nor comprehensive. Reinvesting in an improved Safe and Drug \nFree Schools and Communities program is a critical part of restoring \neffectiveness in and purpose to our national drug policy. Our \nlegislation would be a major assault against drugs and violence in our \nschools and communities, by coordinating school-based programs with the \nbroader community anti-drug effort.\n\n  Children spend more time at school than at any single place. A \nquality education starts with a quality educational environment. \nCongress can show its commitment to this goal by continuing--and \nimproving--our investment in the Safe and Drug Free Schools and \nCommunities Program. Specifically, our bill would increase the \naccountability within the program and ensure that only effective, \nresearched-based programs receive federal funding. Also, it would \nprovide States and Governors with greater flexibility in targeting \ntheir grants to prevent youth violence and drug use. Each state has \nunique drug prevention challenges and this bill provides the states \nwith the flexibility to target funds to all of their schools, focus on \nthose schools with the greatest drug/violence problems, or a \ncombination of these two groups.\n  Our bill would increase community participation in the development \nand implementation of drug and violence prevention programs. Drug abuse \nand violence among young people is a community problem and requires a \ncommunity-based solution. That's why when we drafted this bill, we \nworked closely with the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America. \nThanks to their input, this bill ensures that the entire community is \ninvolved in the creation and execution of programs to fight youth drug \nabuse and violence. It would maintain a viable program for all schools \nwilling to conduct research-based violence and drug abuse prevention \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, the threat of violence--and the reality of drug \nabuse--in our schools are all too real. If we get to our kids before \nthe drug dealers do--if we have a policy of zero tolerance on drugs--\nAmerica's children have a chance. I believe that the Safe and Drug Free \nSchools program empowers America's families and teachers with the \ninformation, training, and resources they need to help our children \nresist the temptation of drugs.\n  Over the coming months, we will be reauthorizing the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. The Safe and Drug Free is an important part of \nthat legislation. I look forward to working on this bill and making \nthis country's schools safer and drug free for our kids.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be entered into \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1823\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join with Senators DeWine, Dodd, \nand Abraham to introduce a bill to reauthorize the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools and Communities Act. This bill sends a strong signal to \nAmerican schools and communities about the importance of creating a \nsafe learning environment in the wake of recent tragedies in Littleton, \nColorado; Springfield, Oregon; Paducah, Kentucky; and Moses Lake, \nWashington. It serves as a reminder that we haven't forgotten these and \nmany other tragedies, and that the Senate recognizes all communities \nneed funding and tools to effectively reduce violence and drug use.\n  The hallmark of the bill is a new emphasis on accountability for \nresults in creating safer schools and using research-proven prevention \nstrategies. The bill reauthorizes the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \nCommunities Act, and authorizes funding of $875 million to local school \ndistricts that they can use flexibly to address local needs for the \nprevention of violence and drug use.\n  In exchange, schools must invest in strategies that are shown to be \neffective in reducing drug use, discipline problems, and school \nviolence.\n  What we've learned from recent school tragedies is that this can \nhappen anywhere in America. No school is immune from problems, so every \nschool community must take steps to prevent them.\n  We know that local educators know best how to prevent these problems, \nwhether through offering after-school programs, or working with parent \ngroups and law enforcement to reduce gang activity, or getting young \npeople\n\n[[Page S13416]]\n\nmore involved in their community activities. This bill gives \ncommunities the tools to make a measurable difference--and recognizes \nthat we won't prevent violence unless we all work together in \npartnership.\n  Our legislation is based on more than a year of conversations with \nlocal educators in Washington state and around the country. I have \nworked closely with Senators Dodd, DeWine, Abraham and other Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle to assure that we find areas of agreement \nearly, so that we can make real progress in our discussions as we move \nforward. The bill emphasizes results and accountability, but gives \ncommunities flexibility to get there. Recognizing that no efforts can \nsucceed to make young people safe and drug free--inside or outside of \nthe classroom--without all elements of the community working together. \nThe bill assumes collaboration and communication at all levels and \nacross all barriers.\n  There are several areas where this bill does not yet reflect a full \nvision of how we can help schools and communities prevent violence and \ndrug use. We need to continue working on national activities, on school \nsafety planning, on coordination, and on other areas. We need to \naddress the concerns of other Members who have not yet participated in \nthe debate. However, this bill is a good, bipartisan start to the \ndiscussion, and represents Senators looking for common goals--something \nthat needs to be brought back into the larger debate on education and \nour public schools.\n  I want to thank Senators Dodd, DeWine, and Abraham and Suzanne Day \nfrom Senator Dodd's office and Paul Palagyi from Senator DeWine's \noffice for their great work on this so far. I look forward to making \ncontinued progress in this discussion.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with the distinguished senior \nSenator from Ohio, Mike DeWine, to introduce legislation that will help \ncreate safe, orderly and drug-free schools for our nation's youth \nthrough the reauthorization of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \nCommunities Act.\n  Mr. President, the need for this legislation could not be more clear. \nLittleton, Colorado; Paduka, Kentucky; Springfield, Oregon; Pearl, \nMississippi, and Jonesboro, Arkansas--up until a year or two ago, these \ntowns were likely to appear on a list of nice small towns in America. \nToday, instead, they have been inscribed on our collective memory for \nthe horrors of what happened at each school--children shooting down \nother children, families in crisis and communities and a nation \nshattered by grief.\n  In the wake of each of these incidents, our nation has struggled to \ncome to terms with the tragedies at these schools. And while many \nquestions will never be answered, we must rededicate ourselves to \nmaking our schools safe for learning and to reassuring parents and \nstudents that schools are a safe haven. We clearly have a long way to \ngo in this effort.\n  Statistics suggest that there has been some improvement in many areas \nin recent years, but clearly violence and drug and alcohol abuse remain \nall too pervasive in our children's lives.\n  Nationwide, from 1992-1994, 63 students ages 5 through 19 were \nmurdered at school in 25 different states in communities of all sizes. \nIn my own state of Connecticut alone, there were 1,532 juvenile (ages \n10-17) crime arrests made from 1993-1994, illustrating the large number \nof youth involved in some form of crime.\n  With regard to substance abuse, by 12th grade, more than three-\nfourths of students have used alcohol in their lifetime and more than \n50% have tried an illicit drug. At any given time, 52% of 12th graders \nreport being current drinkers and 25% report being current illicit drug \nusers. In Connecticut, in 1993, 31% of eighth and tenth grade students \nreported having used alcohol in the past 30 days. Not only do youth \nsubstance abuse and violence harm our children, but they also drain our \ncommunities' valuable resources. According to some analyses, the total \neconomic costs related to substance abuse added up to $377 billion in \n1995, and the costs of crime directly attributed to drug abuse added up \nto $59 billion.\n  These are all alarming statistics, and even more so when the \ninterplay between violence and substance abuse is considered. For \ninstance, there is compelling evidence that aggressive behavior is \nlinked to frequency of marijuana use. Both youth violence and youth \nsubstance abuse are pressing matters in need of our attention.\n  The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act is the leading \nfederal program in this area. This program, funded at $566 million for \nFY1999, currently reaches 97 percent of school districts and provides \nflexible support for primary prevention activities like conflict \nresolution, peer mediation, and after school activities, as well as \nassistance in purchasing security equipment that has become so common \nin our schools. This program also supports prevention activities aimed \nat substance abuse among our youth. There have been some who have \nraised concerns that this program has not adequately accomplished its \ngoals, in that youth violence and substance abuse rates remain high. I \nagree that those rates are still too high. But the proper response is \nto strengthen, no diminish, our commitment to assisting local schools \nin their efforts.\n  And let me hasten to add that there has, in fact, been progress. For \ninstance, in the area of youth substance abuse, a 1998 national survey \nof student drug use in grades 8, 10, and 12 demonstrated that alcohol \nuse slightly declined in grades 8 and 10, from prior years. And, after \nsix years of steady increases, drug use among students was found to \nhave declined and student opposition to drug use has increased. The \nproportion of students who reported use of illicit drugs during the 12 \nmonths prior to the survey declined at all three grade levels.\n  With regard to violence, a 1997 study found that 90 percent of public \nschools reported no incidents of serious violent crime to the police \nand less than half (43 percent) reported no crime at all. Over the past \nfive years, school crime generally has decreased, as has the number of \nstudents being expelled for bringing a firearm to school. Fewer kids, \nin fact, brought weapons to school in 1997 than in 1993. The Centers \nfor Disease Control report that between 1991 and 1997, the number of \nstudents involved in a physical fight decreased by 14 percent, and the \nnumber of kids carrying a weapon to school decreased by 30 percent.\n  Thus, the SDFSCA has made gains in providing students with safe and \ndrug-free learning environments. The legislation we have introduced \ntoday will build on these successes. The program will continue to offer \nstates and local districts significant flexibility. We have also added \nstrong new accountability measures. States will have the option of \ntargeting dollars to areas of greater need, providing them with a \nhigher concentration of resources. State and school districts will work \ntogether in the development of a common plan with shared goals and \nmeasures of progress. Funded activities will be tied to these plans and \nwill be required to be based on community needs assessments and to \nfollow strategies found to demonstrate success through rigorous study. \nIn addition, districts and schools participating in SDFSCA will be \nguided by a school safety plan to ensure coordinated, effective \nprograms.\n  Clearly, this legislation is just the first step. Senator DeWine and \nI, along with Senators Murray and Abraham, will work with the other \nmembers of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, other \ncolleagues, and other interested in this important effort to continue \nto improve this bill as we craft the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. I am interested in particular in looking \nmore closely at the idea of a National School Safety Center, which I \nbelieve could provide districts and schools with invaluable advice and \nservices as they struggle to confront violence in their schools. A \nrelated idea is the one proposed by the Administration to authorize \nProject SERV to assist schools when there is a sudden and serious event \nat the school. In addition, I think we should work at additional ways \nto strengthen interagency cooperation, including developing and funding \ninitiatives like the Safe Schools/Healthy Students program that is \nmaking such a difference in my state and so many others. Finally, I am \nvery interested in considering ways to support prevention very early on \nin\n\n[[Page S13417]]\n\nchildren's life through character education and training of parents, \npreschool teachers and other professionals in violence prevention.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator DeWine for his leadership, \ncommitment and involvement in this issue, as well as Senator Murray \nwith whom we have worked very closely over the past few months. I am \nvery pleased to co-sponsor this bill with such dedicated leaders, and I \nlook forward to working with them and other of our colleauges for its \nenactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 1824. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to enhance \nthe efficient use of spectrum by non-federal government users; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   private wireless spectrum use act\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator \nfrom Washington, Mr. Gorton, in introducing the Private Wireless \nSpectrum Use Act. This legislation will help the more than 300,000 U.S. \ncompanies, both large and small, that have invested $25 billion in \ninternally owned and operated wireless communications systems. It will \nprovide these companies with critically needed spectrum and will do so \nthrough an equitable lease fee system.\n  The private wireless communications community includes industrial, \nland transportation, business, educational, and philanthropic \norganizations that own and operate communications systems for their \ninternal use. The top 10 U.S. industrial companies have more than 6,000 \nprivate wireless licenses. Private wireless systems also serve \nAmerica's small businesses in the utility, contracting, taxi, and \nlivery industries.\n  These internal-use communications facilities greatly enhance the \nquality of American life. They also support global competitiveness for \nAmerican firms. For example, private wireless systems support: the \nefficient production of goods and services; the safe transportation of \npassengers and products by land and air; the exploration, production, \nand distribution of energy; agricultural enhancement and production; \nthe maintenance and development of America's infrastructure; and \ncompliance with various local, State, and Federal operational \ngovernment statutes.\n  Current regulatory policy inadequately recognizes the public interest \nbenefits which private wireless licensees provide to the American \npublic. Consequently, allocations of spectrum to these private wireless \nusers have been deficient. Private wireless entities received spectrum \nin 1974 and 1986 when the FCC allocated channels in the 800 megahertz \nand 900 megahertz bands. Over time, however, the FCC has significantly \nreduced the number of channels available to industrial and business \nentities in those allocations. Private wireless entities now have \naccess to only 299 channels, or 32 percent of the channels of the \noriginal allocation.\n  Spectrum auctions have done a great job of speeding up the licensing \nof interpersonal communications services and have generated significant \nrevenues for the U.S. Treasury. They have also unfortunately skewed the \nspectrum allocation process toward subscriber-based services and away \nfrom critical radio services such as private wireless which are \nexempted from auctions. Nearly 200 megahertz of spectrum has been \nallocated for the provision of commercial telecommunications services, \nvirtually all of which has been assigned by the FCC through competitive \nbidding.\n  Competitive bidding is not the proper assignment methodology for \nprivate wireless telecommunications users. Private wireless operations \nare site-specific systems which vary in size based on a user's \nparticular needs, and are seldom mutually exclusive from other private \nwireless applicants. Auctions, which depend on mutually exclusive \napplications and use market areas based on population, simply cannot be \ndesigned for private wireless systems.\n  Under this legislation, the FCC would allocate no less than 12 \nmegahertz of new spectrum for private wireless use as a measure to \nmaintain our industrial and business competitiveness in the global \narena, as well as to protect the welfare of the employees in the \nAmerican workplace. Research indicates that private wireless companies \nare willing to pay a reasonable fee in return for use of spectrum. They \nrecognize that their access to spectrum increases with their \nwillingness to pay fair value for the use of this national asset.\n  This bill grants the FCC legislative authority to charge efficiency-\nbased spectrum lease fees in this new spectrum allocation. These lease \nfees should encourage the efficient use of spectrum by the private \nwireless industry, generate recurring annual revenues as compensation \nfor the use of spectrum, and retain spectrum ownership by the public. \nFurthermore, the fee should be easy for private frequency advisory \ncommittees to calculate and collect.\n  Mr. President, there may be some who believe this bill does not \nadequately address all their concerns. I assure all interested parties \nthat I will work with them through the legislative process to address \ntheir concerns. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill \nand ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1824\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Private Wireless Spectrum \n     Use Act.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Competent management of the electromagnetic radio \n     spectrum includes continued availability of spectrum for \n     private wireless entities because of such entities' unique \n     ability to achieve substantial efficiencies in their use of \n     this important and finite public resource. A private wireless \n     system licensee or entity is able to customize communications \n     systems to meet the individual needs of that licensee or end \n     user while using engineering solutions and other cooperative \n     arrangements to share spectrum with other private system \n     licensees and entities without causing harmful interference \n     or other degradation of quality or reliability to such other \n     licensees or entities. Accordingly, spectrum allocations for \n     the shared use of private wireless systems achieve a high \n     level of spectrum use efficiency and contribute to the \n     economic and social welfare of the United States.\n       (2) Wireless communication systems dedicated to the \n     internal communication needs of America's industrial, land \n     transportation, energy (including utilities and pipelines), \n     and other business enterprises are critical to the \n     competitiveness of American industry and business in \n     international commerce; increase corporate productivity; \n     enhance the safety and welfare of employees; and improve the \n     delivery of products and services to consumers in the United \n     States and abroad.\n       (3) During the past decade, the Federal Communications \n     Commission allocation and licensing policies have led to \n     dramatic increases in spectrum available for commercial \n     mobile radio services while the spectrum available for \n     private mobile radio systems has decreased, even though the \n     Commission recognizes the spectrum use efficiencies and other \n     public benefits of such private systems and the substantial \n     increases in the use of such systems.\n       (4) Spectrum auctions are designed to select among \n     competing applications for spectrum licenses when engineering \n     solutions, negotiation, threshold qualifications, service \n     regulations, and other cooperative means employed by the \n     Commission are not able to prevent mutual exclusivity among \n     such applications. Private wireless systems, on the other \n     hand, avoid mutual exclusivity through cooperative, multiple \n     uses generally achieved by the Commission, the users, or the \n     frequency advisory committees. Accordingly, the requirements \n     of such private wireless systems are accommodated within the \n     spectrum bands allocated for private uses. Since there is no \n     mutual exclusivity among private wireless system \n     applications, there is no need for the Commission to employ a \n     mechanism, such as auctions, to select among applications. \n     Auction valuation principles also do not apply to the private \n     wireless licensing process because the private wireless \n     spectrum is not used on a commercial, interconnected basis. \n     Rather, such private allocations are used for internal \n     communications applications to enhance safety, efficiency and \n     productivity. Nonetheless, there should be some payment \n     associated with the assignment of new private wireless \n     spectrum, and the Commission can and should develop a payment \n     mechanism for this purpose.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Breaux, in introducing a bill to rationalize \nthe federal management of spectrum that is used by entities for their \ninternal wireless communication needs. The legislation does essentially \nthree things. First, it recognizes that auctions are not an appropriate \nmeans of allocating spectrum for these private users, and so exempts \nfrom auction that spectrum that is used for private wireless \napplications. Second, it directs the FCC to reallocate an additional 12 \nmegahertz of spectrum to private wireless users, who, over the years, \nand despite the efficiencies they have obtained through shared use, \nhave lost spectrum and currently do not have enough to meet demands in \nsome areas. Third, the legislation authorizes the FCC to collect lease \nfees for the use of the 12 MHZ to be reallocated.\n  One of the biggest challenges in preparing this bill, Mr. President, \nhas been to define the class of beneficiaries, that is, to identify \nwhat is a ``private wireless'' system. The definition in the measure we \nare introducing today may not be perfect, and I look forward to working \nwith all interested parties to ensure that the definition covers the \nappropriate class of users. The intent, however, and one that I believe \nis captured in the current definition, is that we recognize that there \nare thousands of corporations, utilities, farmers, and other entities, \nthat use spectrum purely for their internal communication needs, with \napplications that range from reading utility meters from a distance, to \noperating sprinkler or irrigation systems, to communicating over hand-\nheld radios in the middle of the woods, a factory floor, or a \nconstruction site. This use of the spectrum, Mr. President, is \neconomically vital to our economy, as it enhances the productivity of \nall of these users and, in many cases, makes their operations possible.\n  A distinguishing characteristic of private wireless users, and a \nreason that we are proposing that they be treated differently than \nother spectrum users, is that the private wireless users' application \nof the spectrum is often specifically tailored to the needs of that \nuser, that is, it is a unique application that is not offered by \ncommercial wireless providers.\n  Currently, private wireless users are licensed on a site-by-site \nbasis by the FCC. Their license applications are coordinated by \nspectrum managers who attempt to maximize the efficiency of the \nspectrum and eliminate mutually exclusive applications by requiring \nthat the spectrum be shared by multiple users. In this way, hundreds of \ndifferent users can and do operate their internal wireless \ncommunications systems within a given geographic area. When the users' \nneeds change, as they frequently do, as companies open new production \nfacilities, begin work at new construction sites, or extend their \nservice area, the spectrum coordinators, (spectrum allowing), will \npropose a new sharing arrangement and obtain a new site-specific \nlicense for the user.\n  The geographic based auction concept that the FCC is currently \nproposing for some of the spectrum now being used by private wireless, \nmakes little sense for these private users. Unlike a commercial \nwireless provider, whose service must be operational within the \nentirety of a broad geographical license area, an individual private \nwireless user may require use of the spectrum only at single site \nwithin the area proposed to be auctioned. Moreover, private wireless \nsystem users are not in the business of\n\n[[Page S13419]]\n\nproviding communications services, and don't want to be--so it is not \nin their interest to acquire, through auction, exclusive rights to the \nuse of spectrum in a large fixed geographic area, when they will use \nonly a small fraction of it, their site may change, and they lack both \nthe expertise or the desire to rent out what they do not need.\n\n  Recognizing that auctions are ill-suited as a means of allocating \nspectrum to private wireless users, however, is not to say that the \npublic should receive no compensation for the use of this public \nresource. Unfortunately, the desire to raise revenue from the sale of \nspectrum appears to have overtaken the need to ensure that spectrum is \nused efficiently and that current, economically valuable applications, \nare not disrupted by a rush to sell in order to raise revenue. The \nproposal in this measure to allow the Federal Communications Commission \nto collect lease fees for the use of private wireless spectrum is, I \nbelieve, a way to reintroducing some rationality into our spectrum \nmanagement policies, while ensuring a return for the taxpayer.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, Mr. President, is not a \nfinal product. It stakes out, however, a very important claim, and that \nis the importance of the private wireless spectrum users to the smooth \nand efficient operation of our economy. I look forward to working with \nall interested parties to improve, and pass swiftly, this important \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1825.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Customer bills for telecommunications services are \n     unreasonably complicated, and many Americans are unable to \n     understand the nature of services provided to them and the \n     charges for which they are responsible.\n       (2) One of the purposes of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104-104) was to unleash competitive and \n     market forces for telecommunications services.\n       (3) Unless customers can understand their \n     telecommunications bills they cannot take advantage of the \n     newly competitive market for telecommunications services.\n       (4) Confusing telecommunications bills allow a small \n     minority of providers of telecommunications services to \n     commit fraud more easily. The best defense against \n     telecommunications fraud is a well informed consumer. \n     Consumers cannot be well informed when their \n     telecommunications bills are incomprehensible.\n       (5) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n     established new, specific charges on customer bills commonly \n     known as ``line-item charges''.\n       (6) These line-item charges have proliferated and are often \n     described with inaccurate and confusing names.\n       (7) These line-item charges have generated significant \n     confusion among customers regarding the nature and scope of \n     universal service and of the fees associated with universal \n     service.\n       (8) The National Association of Regulatory Utility \n     Commissioners adopted a resolution in February 1998 \n     supporting action by the Federal Communications Commission to \n     require interstate telecommunications carriers to provide \n     accurate customer notice regarding the implementation and \n     purpose of end-user charges for telecommunications services.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to require the \n     Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade \n     Commission to protect and empower consumers of \n     telecommunications services by assuring that \n     telecommunications bills, including line-item charges, issued \n     by telecommunications carriers nationwide are both accurate \n     and comprehensible.\n\n     SEC. 3.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``telecommunications carrier'' has \n     the meaning given that term in section 3(44) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153(44)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1826. A bill to provide grants to the State of Alaska for the \npurpose of assisting that State in fulfilling its responsibilities \nunder sections 803, 804, and 805 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce \nlegislation regarding the State of Alaska's sovereign right to manage \nits fish and game resources. It is a sad day that I come to the floor \nof the United States Senate to inform my colleagues that for the first \ntime since Alaska became a state it no longer has sole authority to \nmanage its fisheries on federal lands.\n  For everyone of my colleagues their respective states right to manage \nfish and game is absolute--every state but Alaska manages all its own \nfish and game. As of October 1, in Alaska, this is not the case, and \ntherefore, action must be taken to try and provide the opportunity for \nthe state to regain this authority back as swiftly as possible.\n  Some background is in order here.\n  When Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation \nAct (ANILCA) in 1980, Title VIII required the State of Alaska to \nprovide a rural subsistence hunting and fishing preference on federal \n``public lands.'' If the State fails to provide the required preference \nby State statute, the law provided that the federal government would \nstep in to manage the subsistence uses of fish and game resources on \nfederal lands.\n  The Alaska State Legislature passed such a subsistence preference law \nin 1978 which was upheld by referendum in 1982. The law was slightly \nrevised in 1986, and remained on the books until it was struck down by \nthe Alaska Supreme Court in 1989 as unconstitutional because of the \nAlaska Constitution's common use of fish and game clause. It is easy to \nsee how there would be a conflict between a federal law that requires \nthe state to provide a preference for rural Alaskans for fish and game \nresources and a state constitution that provides for equal access. When \nthe state statutes were struck down, the Secretary of the Interior and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, for Forest Service lands, took over \nmanagement of fish and game resources on federal public lands in \nAlaska.\n  For the most part the early focus was on game management and little \nwas done to impact Alaska's fisheries. That all changed in 1995 when a \ndecision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Katie John v. United \nStates extended the law far beyond its original scope to apply not just \nto ``federal lands'' but to navigable waters owned by the State of \nAlaska. Hence State and private lands were impacted too. The theory \nespoused by the Court was that the ``public lands'' includes \nnavigable waters in which the United States has reserved water rights. \nIf implemented, the courts decision would mean all fisheries in Alaska \ncould effectively be managed by the federal government. In April of \n1996, the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture published an \n``Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking'' which identified about half \nof the state as subject to federal authority to regulate fishing \nactivities.\n\n  These regulations were so broad they could have affected not only \nfishing activities, but virtually all activities on state and federal \nlands that may have an impact on subsistence uses. There is no \nprecedent in any other State in the Union for this kind of overreaching \ninto State management prerogatives. For that reason Congress acted in \n1996 to place a moratorium on the federal government from implementing \nthose regulations and assuming control of Alaska's fisheries. This \nmoratorium was provided mainly to allow the State time to make \nappropriate changes to the constitution and relevant statutes in order \nto comply with the federal law. The moratorium was extended three times \nby Congress and just recently expired October 1, 1999.\n  The Governor, and the majority of the State legislators have worked \nto try and resolve this issue by adopting an amendment to the State \nconstitution that would allow them to pass State statutes to come into \ncompliance with the federal law and provide a subsistence priority. \nUnfortunately, the State of Alaska's Constitution is not easily amended \nand these efforts have fallen short of the necessary votes needed to \nplace the issue before the Alaska voters. In fact, in the most recent \nspecial session a majority of the legislators voted to do just this. \nUnfortunately they were just two votes shy in the State Senate of the \n2/3 majority needed to place the necessary amendment before the voters.\n  With the failure of the legislature to place a constitutional \namendment on the ballot prior to October 1, 1999, we now find ourselves \nin a situation where the federal government has assumed control of \nsubsistence fisheries in Alaska. Therefore, absent a lawsuit or major \nchange to federal law, the only way the State can now regain management \nof the subsistence fisheries is if the Secretary were to certify that \nthe citizens of Alaska voted on, and approved, a constitutional \namendment and the State Legislature had approved appropriate State \nstatutes to conform with ANILCA. Under the most optimistic \ncircumstances, the absolute earliest this could occur would be after \nthe general election in November of 2000--and more likely it would not \noccur until 2001 or 2002. This just cannot be allowed to continue \nwithout some effort to return management to Alaska as soon as possible.\n\n[[Page S13421]]\n\n  The proposal I am introducing today would minimize the duration of \nfederal control if the State legislature passes a constitutional \namendment that would allow them to adopt laws to come into compliance \nwith the federal law. This would continue to make sure the focus of a \nresolve remains on State action and not in the ill-placed hopes of some \naction by Congress.\n  Specifically, the proposal would do the following:\n  Provide that the State can regain management authority as soon as the \nSecretary certifies the State legislature has approved a constitutional \namendment that would allow the State to comply with ANILCA.\n\n  As soon as the Secretary certifies the amendment, any unexpended \nfunds that were provided to the Secretary as a result of the \nlegislature's failure to act by October 1, 1999 are turned over to the \nState.\n  In order to continue to retain management the State must place the \namendment on the ballot at the earliest date possible under State law.\n  The Secretary could manage subsistence again if the amendment is not \nadopted by the voters or if it is adopted but the State fails to adopt \nthe needed state statutes at the end of the first legislative session \nafter passage of the constitutional amendment.\n  At any time that the Secretary is managing subsistence fisheries in \nAlaska, he must comply with section 1308 of ANILCA which requires local \nhire.\n  Mr. President, I along with most Alaskans, believe that subsistence \nuses of fish and game should have a priority over other uses in the \nState. We have provided for such uses in the past, I have hunted and \nfished under those regulations and I respected and supported them and \ncontinue to do so now. I believe the State can again provide for such \nuses without significant interruption to the sport or commercial \nfisherman.\n  I also believe that Alaska's rural residents should play a greater \nrole in the management and enforcement of fish and game laws in Alaska. \nThey understand and live with the resources in rural Alaska. They see \nand experience the fish and game resources day in and day out. And, \nthey are most directly impacted by the decisions made about use of \nthose resources. They should bear their share of the responsibility for \nformulating fish and game laws as well as enforcing them.\n  It is my intention to ensure that at anytime the Secretary is \nmanaging any of Alaska's wildlife resources that he maximize the \nexpertise of Alaska's Native people. I also hope the State would \nprovide Alaska's rural residents a greater role as it seeks to resolve \nthe subsistence dilemma once and for all. But until that happens, I \ncannot stand by and watch the federal government move into the State \nand assume control of the Alaska fish and game resources for an \nextended period of time. That is why I am providing for the earliest \nopportunity for the State to regain management.\n  I've lived under federal management during Alaska's territorial days \nand it does not work. In 1959 Alaskan's caught just 25.1 million \nsalmon. Under State management we caught 218 million salmon in 1995.\n  Federal control would again be a disaster for the resource and those \nthat depend on it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1827. A bill to provide funds to assist high-poverty school \ndistricts meet their teaching needs; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                       transition to teaching act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which is \nentitled ``Transition to Teaching. This legislation starts from a \npersonal experience.\n  Bill Aradine is a first-year teacher. He tells me he is greatly \nenjoying his experience in the classroom. He has 150 students from the \n9th to the 12th grade at North Marion High School near Ocala, FL. Mr. \nAradine teaches automobile mechanics. He has sparked an interest in \nstudents that may lead many of them to rewarding, lucrative, and \nchallenging careers. I know Mr. Aradine because I did one of my \nworkdays--in fact, my most recent workday--at North Marion High School. \nIt is the story I learned that day at North Marion that brings me to \nthe Senate floor today.\n  Up to this point, it may not seem that unusual of a story--a \nbeginning teacher facing new challenges--but Mr. Aradine brings \nsomething else to his first year at North Marion High School. He brings \na previous career of 11 years on-the-job experience. He has years of \nexperience in a local Chevrolet car dealership. He is now starting a \nsecond career as a teacher. The students look to him with a different \nperspective. When he says, you will need to know this if you are going \nto get the job done, they know he knows what he is talking about. \nHaving just come directly from the industry, he teaches at the cutting \nedge.\n  The information he brings to his students is what he was actually \ndoing in the workplace not that long ago. Mr. Aradine is also a bridge. \nHe is a bridge between North Marion High School students and the world \nof employment. He offers them advice, counsel, and real-life \nconnections to future jobs.\n  Mr. Aradine learned of the opening at the high school when one of the \nautomobile mechanic's teachers retired. He applied for the job. He was \nallowed to obtain a temporary teaching certificate based on his prior \nwork experience. He will take four courses over the next 3 years to \nobtain a permanent teaching certificate. North Marion High School \nprincipal, Walter Miller, could not be more pleased with the situation. \nMr. Aradine is doing an excellent job with the students. North Marion \nHigh School was able to fill a vacancy and ease its teacher shortage.\n  More and more schools will be turning to teachers who are in their \nsecond career. The Washington Post of October 4 of this year remarks on \nthe trend of professionals entering teaching after years of work in a \nnonacademic job.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks, \na copy of an article entitled, ``Disillusioned Find Renewal in \nClassroom,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Every August and September, another school year begins. \nThousands of young Americans enter the classroom. Almost every year at \nthis time, I hear from school districts throughout Florida about \nteacher shortages. What did I hear in 1999? I heard from Miami Dade \nthat they had hired 1,700 new teachers for the 1999 school year but \nstill had 300 vacancies to fill on the first day of classes. \nHillsborough County, Tampa, hired 1,493 teachers for the start of the \nschool year. They were still 238 teachers short when the first school \nbell rang. Orange County, Orlando, needed 1,300 teachers for the new \nyear and still had 50 vacancies a month after school started.\n  These concerns will only get worse. Forty percent of current \nschoolteachers are over the age of 50. They are nearing retirement. Who \nwill be the future role models to the next generation of Americans? Who \nwill take their places in the classroom? The importance of having high \nquality teachers in sufficient numbers is crucial, if we are to look at \nthe challenges facing education in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article by Dr. Robert McCabe entitled, ``A Twenty-First Century \nChallenge: Underprepared Americans.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       A Twenty First Century Challenge: Underprepared Americans\n\n                         (By Robert H. McCabe)\n\n       The essential mission for higher education in the new \n     America of the 21st Century will be creating opportunity for \n     new populations. Higher education will be more important than \n     every before, but the scope of services will be very \n     different and should be dramatically expanded to match the \n     changed environment. In short, the current emphasis on \n     exclusion must shift to inclusion.\n       In the new America, we will be older, less white, and more \n     diverse. Our workforce will shrink. Information technology \n     will impact everything and everybody. Business will function \n     in a global economy and unskilled jobs will be exported to \n     low wage developing nations. The gap between the skills and \n     competencies of Americans, and those required for an \n     Information Age workforce will continue to widen, threatening \n     the very well being of our nation.\n       As we enter the 21st Century we face three critical \n     challenges: remaining competitive in a global economy; \n     reversing the growth of a\n\n[[Page S13422]]\n\n     seemingly permanent and disenfranchised underclass; and \n     developing a broad based workforce possessing Information Age \n     skills. Whether or not we successfully meet these challenges \n     will depend on the achievement of our educational system. The \n     public schools, however, face ever greater difficulties. \n     Increasing numbers of diverse children will enter the schools \n     with significant educational and life deficiencies. Despite \n     the school reforms that are sweeping the nation, it is \n     virtually certain that increasing numbers of individuals will \n     reach adulthood unprepared for 21st Century life and \n     employment. Failure to educate these individuals would result \n     in a catastrophic decline in our economy and standard of \n     living. The role of higher education is critical. It must \n     provide leadership in reshaping an educational system that is \n     significantly more successful at all levels. Colleges will \n     experience extraordinary enrollment growth from previously \n     undeserved and underprepared populations. They must assist \n     these Americans in achieving the higher order competencies \n     necessary to succeed in the Information Age. To reach this \n     goal, colleges must partner with public schools to \n     participate in school reform. They must also insure that \n     strengthened and well-supported college remedial education \n     programs are available, primarily in community colleges, to \n     rescue underprepared adults for their own benefit and to the \n     benefit of the nation as a whole.\n       The following is a review of factors that will redefine the \n     mission of higher education in the new America of the 21st \n     Century.\n\n\n                       business/industry and work\n\n       In a global economy, business and industry will get its \n     work done where it is least costly. Manufacturing is already \n     moving from the United States to less developed nations where \n     wages are lower. This trend will continue. Sustaining \n     America's current prosperity will depend on its ability to \n     lead and develop knowledge industries, which are based on a \n     highly skilled and a more productive workforce. Brainpower \n     and technology can multiply individual productivity, thus, \n     compensating for higher wages and helping America to retain \n     global competitiveness.\n       Experts believe--judging from successful economies already \n     functioning in the new global environment--the countries that \n     remain competitive in the next century are those with the \n     highest overall literacy and educational levels--that is, \n     nations, such as Germany and Japan, that have a strong \n     ``bottom third.'' This should be a compelling wake up call \n     for America because demographic trends indicate that the \n     future U.S. work force will be increasingly composed of \n     groups such as minorities and immigrants, who have \n     disproportionately high rates of illiteracy and educational \n     underachievement (Immerwahr et al. 1991 p. 15).\n       Beyond the basics, workers need additional skills to meet \n     workforce demands--even if they hold the same job. Regardless \n     of the product or service offered, the competitive workplace \n     of today is a high-skill environment designed around \n     technology and people who are technically competent.\n       A 1997 National Alliance of Business report, ``Job Cuts \n     Out, High Skills In,'' states: ``With the explosion of \n     technology in the workplace, skill level requirements are \n     being ratcheted up by employers. Inventory, sales, marketing, \n     expense analysis, communications, and correspondence are \n     being one faster, better and cheaper, and with greater \n     efficiency in the workplace'' (National Alliance of Business, \n     p. 1).\n       Through turbulent years of reorganization, companies have \n     raised skill requirements in order to hire employees with the \n     competencies they need to be more competitive. More highly \n     skilled workers have replaced employees with lower or \n     outdated skills. Job elimination and downsizing have declined \n     to their lowest levels in the decade, as companies are \n     prepared for increased productivity and profitability. \n     ``We're seeing the payoff after a decade of pain,'' says Eric \n     Greenberg, director of management studies for the American \n     Management association. ``The same forces that were costing \n     jobs in the earlier years, such as restructuring, re-\n     engineering and automation are now creating jobs that demand \n     high skill levels. The people going out the door don't have \n     them, the people coming in do'' (National Alliance of \n     Business, 1997, p. 6).\n       At the same time that necessary skill levels are rising, \n     the skills of American workers are declining--a bleak picture \n     indeed. In 1995, The National Workforce Collabative estimated \n     that the incidence of low basic workplace skills among U.S. \n     workers ranging from 20 to 40 percent.\n       Business and Industry estimates that 80 percent of the 21st \n     Century workforce will need some post-secondary education. In \n     addition, they will need higher order information \n     competencies as a base for life long continuing education. \n     Today, fewer than half of Americans have achieved this level \n     of competence and demographic changes indicate that in the \n     future even fewer will be as well prepared.\n\n\n                          DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES\n\n       As the millennium approaches, stores analyzing the state of \n     the nation and predicting its future fill the public \n     discourse. Demographers can accurately describe what Newsweek \n     magazine termed the ``face of the future'' (Morganthau 1997). \n     In the 21st Century, the United States will become more \n     ethnically diverse, more crowded and much older.\n       The greatest changes will occur in the Hispanic population. \n     Today, Hispanics make up nearly 30 million people and 11 \n     percent of the population. With high birthrates and high \n     legal and illegal immigration, this share will continue to \n     increase. Hispanic Americans average 2.4 to 2.9 children per \n     couple, compared to white Americans average of just under two \n     children per couple (Sivy 1997). In addition, the majority of \n     today's immigrants are Hispanic, a trend that is expected to \n     continue. Within the next seven years, Hispanics will \n     overtake African Americans as the nation's largest minority. \n     By 2005, Hispanics will number more than 36 million people \n     compared to a projected 35.5 million African Americans. \n     (Holmes 1998). By 2050, they are expected to comprise nearly \n     one quarter of the total population, almost 96 million \n     people. (Morganthau 1997). This growth is remarkable \n     considering that in 1970 Hispanic accounted for just nine \n     million citizens or roughly four percent of the national \n     population (Population Reference Bureau 1999).\n       Virtually all of our growth will be from minorities, \n     principally Hispanics. These groups are disproportionately \n     poor, and thus, disproportionately educationally \n     underprepared. To illustrate, African Americans are 13 \n     percent of the general population and 40 percent of welfare \n     recipients while Hispanics are 11 percent of the population \n     and 22 percent of welfare recipients.\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n       Changing patterns of immigration are rearranging the face \n     of America. Immigrants make up a significant portion of \n     population growth. These new Americans differ in origin from \n     those of earlier years. Between 1820 and 1967, 40 million of \n     America's 44 million immigrants came from European countries. \n     From 1968 to 1994, only three million of the 18 million \n     immigrants came from Europe--a decrease from 90 percent to 17 \n     percent. Today's immigrants come primarily from Latin America \n     and Asia, and most importantly, from underdeveloped nations. \n     Unfortunately, the immigrant population that is a major \n     source of future workers also adds to our underprepared \n     population. In the early 20th Century, most European \n     immigrants were also unskilled. At that time, however, work \n     was predominantly unskilled, and the immigrants provided much \n     needed unskilled manpower. Circumstances are now quite \n     different. Less than 20 percent of today's jobs are \n     unskilled. Few new immigrants arrive on our shores with the \n     job skills that business and industry need, yet these ``new \n     workers'' represent a key source of potential employees \n     needed to fill the void created by retiring ``Baby Boomers''.\n\n\n                          THE AGING OF AMERICA\n\n       In 1900, the average life expectancy was 48. Today it is \n     76. In addition, America's fertility rate has dropped below \n     the 2.1 children per woman population replacement rate. In \n     1950, the average age of Americans was 21 while today it is \n     37. Demographer Samuel Preston reports that the population is \n     rapidly growing older and will continue to do so in the next \n     half century (1996). Between 1995 and 2010, the number of \n     people 65 and older will grow slowly from 33.5 million to \n     39.4 million, as people born in the 1930s and early 1940s \n     (when fertility was low) grow older. By contrast, between \n     2010 and 2030, with the ``Baby Boomers'' aging, the number \n     will soar from 39.4 million to 69.3 million. Meanwhile, the \n     population in the prime working ages of 20 to 59 will remain \n     stationary at about 160 million. In 1900, there were 10 times \n     as many children below 18 as there were adults over 65. By \n     2030, there will be slightly more people over 65 than under \n     18.\n       Most discussion about the aging of Americans has focused on \n     the viability of Social Security and Medicare. The Social \n     Security system uses a pay-as-you-go model whereby payments \n     by current workers are used to pay benefits to retirees. The \n     concept was that when current workers retire, new workers \n     would be available to pay into the system to support their \n     retirement. That is history. In the future, it will simply no \n     longer be the case. When the system began, 17 to 20 workers \n     paid in for each retired worker receiving benefits. By 1960, \n     the ratio had fallen to five workers for each retiree. Today \n     it is 3.4 to one and by 2020 there will only be two workers \n     for each retiree. While this forecasts serious problems, they \n     are not nearly as severe as the problem of a declining \n     percentage of the population in the workforce. Quite simply, \n     to sustain our economy, everyone in their prime work years \n     will need to be in the workforce. They must be highly skilled \n     and extremely productive to support more retirees.\n\n\n                                POVERTY\n\n       With our high standard of living and prosperity, America \n     continues to have a persistent underclass with more \n     individuals living in poverty than other developed nations. \n     This is an unacceptable, deeply imbedded and seemingly \n     unresolvable American problem. In the 1950s and 1960s, a near \n     national consensus believed that the problem of poverty and \n     equal opportunity for all could and should be resolved. \n     Today, cynicism has replaced optimism. People living in \n     poverty feel there is no way out and that the system is \n     rigged against them. Those supporting the dependent \n     population are frustrated and angry and increasingly blame \n     those who live in poverty for their own poor circumstances.\n       Politicans applaud the apparent successes of welfare reform \n     efforts intended to quickly remove individuals from the \n     welfare rolls. A closer look, however, reveals that the \n     successes are more a result of a robust economy\n\n[[Page S13423]]\n\n     than successful reform programs. Many have only progressed \n     from poverty to joining the working poor. Persistent \n     poverty appears to be impervious to every attempt at \n     improvement.\n       From kindergarten to college, poverty correlates more \n     closely with academic deficiency than any other factor. The \n     strong relationship between socio-economic status and \n     educational achievement and the rising skill levels required \n     for employment result in growing numbers from impoverished \n     neighborhoods being undereducated for 21st Century jobs. \n     These underprepared individuals add to the nation's \n     unemployed, are dependent on the society and expand the gap \n     between the haves and have nots--a destructive and dangerous \n     situation.\n\n\n                        THE NEW AMERICAN FAMILY\n\n       Today, nearly half of all American children experience the \n     breakup of their parents' marriage. Family arrangements are \n     diverse, and increasingly, do not involve a full-time father. \n     In 1963, 77 percent of white children, 65 percent of Hispanic \n     children, and 36 percent of African American children lived \n     in two-parent families. By 1991, only half of the United \n     States' children and teens lived in a traditional nuclear \n     family. Fifth percent of white children live with a divorced \n     mother; while 54 percent of African American children and 33 \n     percent of Hispanic children have mothers who have never \n     married (McCabe and Day 1998, p. 7). More children are born \n     to unmarried women, 33 percent in 1994 compared with 5 \n     percent in 1960 (Preston 1996). Even those children from a \n     two-parent household spend less family time together. About \n     70 percent of mothers with children at home are working \n     (Edmondson 1997). Children are often shuttled between day \n     care centers, baby sitters, and extended family members.\n       According to Prather (1995), ``There are three problems \n     that impact the learning abilities of young children that are \n     exacerbated by the changing structures of families: \n     Insufficient parenting, poor prenatal care, and inadequate \n     health care.'' One-fourth of the pregnant women in America, \n     particularly those who live in poverty, receive no prenatal \n     care. Problems in the womb often lead to learning \n     disabilities and other cognitive disorders.\n       Recent brain development research indicate that ``wiring'' \n     of neurons occurs after birth, and that experience during \n     infancy and early childhood plays a critical role in defining \n     an individual's capacity to learn. The child's brain and \n     central nervous system develop rapidly during the first three \n     years of life in response to parental attention and \n     stimulation, such as talking, seeing and playing. Absence of \n     these critical early child care experiences, can result in \n     permanent loss of learning capacity. This obviously occurs \n     more frequently in single parent families because there is \n     less time available for the children.\n       Children who suffer from inadequate economic resources and \n     parental attention are children at risk of school failure. \n     When these students progress into secondary schools, they are \n     often tucked away in a holding pattern in general studies \n     programs, and other programs that set lower expectations and \n     develop less information competency. These students are \n     destined to become underprepared adults.\n       The decline in the traditional family and the rising \n     percentage of children born into poverty raises the question \n     of whether children of the 21st Century will be sufficiently \n     nurtured and prepared to mature to the productive adults that \n     America needs.\n       At the heart of the United States' future will be the \n     changing concept of family--a kind of new social \n     demographics. Tomorrow's family will be less traditional and \n     more complex. The 1950s nuclear family with the father as the \n     sole breadwinner will be a distant memory. Instead, family \n     life will be plagued by much of the same problems it suffers \n     from today--divorce, single parenting, and a fractured and \n     harried household.\n       Taken together--an analysis of demographics and family \n     structure--we have a clear picture of the 21st Century. The \n     United States will be crowded, diverse, older, and Americans \n     will be less well prepared for employment. But what then does \n     all this really mean? How will these changes influence \n     everyday life? How well will we prepare our children for the \n     future? What challenges will they face? How will we care for \n     our elderly, infirm, and needy?\n\n\n                  EDUCATING A MAJORITY MINORITY NATION\n\n       The demographic realities--particularly the growing \n     diversity--will have the greatest impact on our education \n     system. We know that by 2020 half of the nation's youth will \n     be ``minority.'' But what is most striking about this \n     statistic is the shifting concept of minority. Demographer \n     Hodgkinson explains that educating tomorrow's minority will \n     be more complicated because of who they are. Between 1820 and \n     1945, the nations that sent us the largest numbers of \n     immigrants were (in rank order): Germany, Italy, Ireland, \n     United Kingdom, Soviet Union, Canada, and Sweden. The nations \n     that send us the most immigrants now and through the year \n     2000 are (in rank order): Mexico, Philippines, Korea, China/\n     Taiwan, India, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Canada, \n     Vietnam, United Kingdom, and Iran (Hodgkinson 1993).\n       This shift indicates a clear transformation. The United \n     States has gone from a nation of Europeans with a common \n     European culture to a nation of the world. Students from all \n     over the world will be in the same classrooms--making our \n     schools truly international in composition (Hodgkinson 1993). \n     The change brings with it a set of unique instructional \n     problems. In the past, schools could use the European \n     commonality to socialize immigrant children. Today, children \n     come to classrooms with different diets, different religions, \n     different individual and group loyalties, different music, \n     and different languages.\n       Tommorrow's students will be problematic for an even more \n     profound reason--their lack of academic skills. Teachers will \n     not only struggle with their diversity but also with their \n     poor language skills and lack of educational attainment. \n     Minorities have traditionally lagged behind academically. \n     Educational policy makers often view them as an \n     afterthought--gearing their decisions to the more successful \n     white majority. As the demographics shift, however, educators \n     will face a nation dominated by struggling students, at the \n     same time more must complete their education with higher \n     order skills.\n       The statistics illustrate a wide educational gap between \n     minorities and non-minorities. In 1996, 30 percent of \n     Hispanics had less than a ninth grade education, compared \n     with 10 percent of African Americans and only about five \n     percent of whites. Little more than one-half (53 percent) of \n     Hispanics ages 25 or older had completed high school, and \n     less than 10 percent had at least a bachelor's degree. Nearly \n     85 percent of non-Hispanic adults were high school graduates, \n     and nearly 25 percent were college graduates (del Pinal \n     1997). The high school dropout rate--the percentage of \n     people, ages 16 to 24, who do not have a high school \n     diploma--reflects a similar disparity. In 1993, 27.5 \n     percent of Hispanic students, 13.6 percent of African \n     American students, and 7.9 percent of white students fell \n     into this category (Coley 1995).\n       Minority children start two or three steps behind their \n     white counterparts. They start elementary school with fewer \n     social skills and lower language skills than their white \n     counterparts (del Pinal 1997). Their path of underachievement \n     then continues throughout their academic career.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       A series of circumstances are converging to create a 21st \n     Century American dilemma that threatens the nation's economic \n     and societal well being. The global economy is forcing \n     manufacturing and businesses that utilize less skilled labor \n     out of the country. The nation's hope for continued \n     prosperity is to be the leader of the world's knowledge \n     industries. This requires a highly skilled, highly productive \n     workforce. Formidable obstacles must be overcome to reach \n     that goal. With the aging population, the percentage of \n     individuals in their primary work years will decline. It is, \n     therefore, necessary to insure that the maximum number of \n     Americans are well prepared and in the workforce. They will \n     have to be more productive both to offset the competitive low \n     salaries in less developed countries and to support the \n     growing number of elderly. America does not have any one to \n     waste!\n       Virtually all of our population growth will be from groups \n     that are disproportionately underprepared--immigrants mostly \n     from Third World countries, and minorities, principally \n     Hispanic, who are disproportionately poor. Changes in the \n     American family will also contribute to underpreparation. \n     Changing family and work circumstances result in poor \n     parenting practices that are linked to early children sensory \n     deprivation and learning disabilities. Due to the hardships \n     of growing numbers of single parent families, children's \n     social, physical and educational progress is impeded.\n       The workforce could be both undersized and \n     disproportionately underskilled. It would be unable to \n     sustain a knowledge based economy and our quality of life.\n       America must depend on education to avert this pending \n     national crisis. Despite reforms and hoped for improvements \n     in the public schools, more Americans will reach adulthood \n     underprepared. States are now taking school reform seriously \n     and there is evidence of some improvement. The task, however, \n     is monumental. The public schools cannot be expected to solve \n     it alone.\n       The following graph dramatically demonstrates the scope of \n     the problem. Currently, 85 percent of young Americans \n     graduate from high school, 56 percent enter college and, \n     unfortunately, only 39 percent are prepared for college work. \n     This means that unless there is tremendous improvement, less \n     than 40 percent of young Americans will be prepared for the \n     80 percent of high skill jobs. Sixty percent will only be \n     prepared for the 20 percent of low skill jobs. It will be the \n     essential and daunting task of public schools and college \n     remedial programs to raise the 39 percent prepared to 80 \n     percent. Substantially more students need to achieve higher \n     skills at the same time large numbers of children will enter \n     the educational system with serious life and educational \n     deficiencies.\n       The great strength of America is the belief in the value of \n     every individual and the commitment to equal opportunity for \n     all. Higher education can do nothing more important and more \n     difficult than helping the underprepared achieve educational \n     parity. Higher education leadership is essential in meeting \n     this challenge. Colleges must join with public schools in \n     unified efforts to raise the educational achievements of all \n     children. They must also insure the availability of quality \n     remedial education programs, primarily in community colleges. \n     This will assure that\n\n[[Page S13424]]\n\n     the critical final bridge to full participants in our society \n     is available to everyone.\n\n\n                               references\n\n       Cassidy, J. ``Who Killed the Middle Class?''

Dr. McCabe raises several crucial demographic and \nsocietal changes that will affect American education in the coming \nyears. Let me mention two of these issues.\n  First, the American family structure will change in the coming \ndecades. Half of all children will spend some of their childhood in \nsingle-parent homes and are more likely to live in poverty.\n  Of the children who grow up in a nuclear family, very often both of \ntheir parents will work; thus, they will be less able to be involved in \nthe child's school and schoolwork. That is what is happening to \nAmerican families. That is what will increasingly in the family \nenvironment from which American schoolchildren will enter the \nclassroom. But as they exit the classroom, societal expectations for \nstudents upon graduation will be greater.\n  In the middle of this century, 50 years ago, 20 percent of American \njobs required a specific skill. At the end of this century, today, 80 \npercent of jobs need skilled workers. Thus, the American student will \nneed to graduate from school better prepared for the high-tech world \nthan ever before; but single-parent families and dual-income families, \nin general, will face more challenges in being able to be actively \ninvolved in the support of that child's education.\n  These challenges, and others, will face the American educational \nsystem. I rise today to take one step forward in easing the nationwide \nteacher shortage and offering challenging new opportunities for \nAmerica's professional working people by introducing the Transition to \nTeaching Act of 1999.\n  Senator Kennedy is to be commended for his work in including similar \nlanguage in the Elementary and Secondary Education Reauthorization \nBill. Representatives Jim Davis of Florida and Tim Roemer of Indiana \nhave taken the lead in the House of Representatives on this issue.\n  We have a very successful model on which to build the Transition to \nTeaching program. Since 1994, the Troops to Teachers program has \nbrought more than 3,000 retired military personnel to our classrooms, \nparticularly as math, science, and technology teachers.\n  Schools in my State of Florida have benefitted by more than 270 \nindividuals who have successfully completed the Troops to Teachers \nprogram, and are bringing their life experience to the classroom today.\n  Troops to Teachers, and now Transition to Teaching, assist in \novercoming two of the main obstacles that mid-career professionals face \nwhen they want to become a teacher. It is not impossible to do this \nnow, as Mr. Aradine has shown; but this legislation will assist with \nand simplify the process.\n  The first issue that is addressed involves teaching colleges within \nuniversities. These teaching colleges are often set up for the \ntraditional students in their early twenties, right out of high school, \njust starting their new lives.\n  These programs are generally taken over a multiyear period as a full-\ntime college student. This legislation encourages teaching colleges to \ndevelop curriculum suitable for an individual who already has many \nyears of experience. These programs are more streamlined, more flexible \nin school hours, and recognize that the mid-career student brings more \nlife and work experience than does a traditional college student.\n  By developing such programs, teaching colleges can maintain high \nstandards, but allow a mid-career worker, making the change into \nteaching to become certified in a more efficient, streamlined manner.\n\n  Teaching colleges are also asked to develop programs to maintain \ncontact with and support for these new teachers during at least their \nfirst year in the classroom.\n  Second, Transition to Teaching will assist teachers who come to the \nprofession in mid-career in a very tangible way.\n  Grants will be awarded, up to $5,000 per participant, to offset the \ncosts of becoming a certified teacher. Why are these grants \nappropriate? The traditional college student comes directly from a \nfamily setting. They typically have limited personal or family \nfinancial obligations. In contrast, people like Mr. Aradine have their \nown families, spouses, children, and they have a house and car \npayments. They have the kind of financial obligations that would be \ntypical of any mid-career adult. They would need this financial \nassistance in order to give them that little degree of support and help \nthat will allow them to make this transition to become a certified \nteacher and move into a second career in the classroom.\n  Thus, this legislation deals with two of the biggest obstacles to \nbecoming a teacher in mid-career. The certification process is \nstreamlined, and stipends are provided to offset the cost of this \nadditional education.\n  The success can be highlighted best with a personal story--a personal \nstory, not like Mr. Aradine who is in his first year, but the personal \nstory of a man who is already well into his second career. Ronald \nDyches grew up in a military family. His father was a noncommissioned \nofficer. When Mr. Dyches attended college at Sam Houston State, he \nfollowed in his family's military footsteps and enrolled in the ROTC.\n  When he graduated, he became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army. \nFor more than 21 years, Mr. Dyches served our Nation as an Army \nintelligence officer, living throughout the United States and Europe. \nHe feels the highlight of his career were the three years he spent on \nGeneral Norman Schwartzkopf's staff at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa \nduring the Gulf war. Mr. Dyches retired from the Army in 1995. But you \ncan say his service to the country did not end.\n  With the help of the Troops to Teachers program, Mr. Dyches began a \nsecond career teaching social studies at Bloomingdale High School in \nBrandon, FL. He has been on the faculty at Bloomingdale since 1995--and \nthis year he is teaching three periods of Honors World History and two \nperiods of an elective class that he created: The History of the \nVietnam War.\n  Mr. Dyches' military experiences are an integral part of his \nclassroom teaching. In addition to developing new elective courses, \nsuch as the one on the Vietnam war, Mr. Dyches uses the wealth of \nknowledge acquired living and working twelve years in Europe with the \nmilitary to enliven his World History class. With his background, he \noffers advice and counsel to students including those considering a \nmilitary career or wishing to attend one of the Nation's service \nacademies.\n  Mr. Dyches feels that this classroom experience would not have been \npossible without the Troops to Teachers program. It rekindled his \ninterest in teaching from his college days, and it opened doors to \ncertification that would have been closed to him.\n  In some sense, Troops to Teachers helps make ``perfect marriages.''\n\n[[Page S13425]]\n\n Bloomingdale High School needed a social studies teacher. Ron Dyches \nneeded a challenging, rewarding second career. He, the school, and all \nof Bloomingdale's students have benefited from this perfect marriage.\n\n  Other professionals, other workers, should be allowed to follow in \nthe footsteps of the retired military personnel like Mr. Dyches, who \nhave set such a shining example for us and the students that they \nserve.\n  Law enforcement, attorneys, business leaders, scientists, \nentrepreneurs, technically competent men and women, and others in the \nprivate sector should be encouraged to share their wisdom with \nstudents.\n  As I mentioned, under the Transition to Teaching Act, colleges and \nuniversities would be awarded grants to design educational programs \nmodeled after Troops to Teachers to train mid-career professionals, and \nothers, to become teachers.\n  Individuals would be eligible for grants of up to $5,000 to pay for \nthe courses and training they need to become qualified teachers.\n  In return for the training, the new teachers would agree to teach in \nlow-income schools, determined by the percentage of title I students in \nthe school population, for three years.\n  This legislation is timely. We are on the cusp of retirement of \nmillions of baby boomers.\n  By encouraging recent retirees, or mid-career professionals, to \nbecome certified through Transition To Teaching and spend a few years \nin the classroom, we will bring the life skills of experienced \nprofessionals to our youngest citizens.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Our nation's children deserve our best efforts to provide them with a \nworld class education that they will need in the 21st century.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nDisillusioned Find Renewal in Classroom--New Teachers Coming From Other \n                              Professions\n\n                            (By Liz Seymour)\n\n       To become a teacher, Mary Ann Richardson left a $113,000-a-\n     year job lobbying Congress as a U.S. deputy assistant \n     secretary in the Labor Department.\n       Now she's a 46-year-old intern at Falls Church High School, \n     a substitute teacher in history, government and civics \n     without her own classroom or even her own desk. Next year, \n     after she receives her master's degree in education, she will \n     be applying for teaching jobs that pay about $80,000 a year \n     less than what she used to earn.\n       She grapples with a new identity and the loss of family \n     income that she worked 16 years to get and will never see \n     again. But, she said, ``when those kids look up to you or \n     they're having a crisis and you can help . . . I can tell you \n     right now, I have found a purpose.''\n       The teaching profession, shunned for decades by college \n     graduates in search of higher pay and prestige, is attracting \n     a growing number of people who started their careers in \n     another field. Some are downsized corporate executives who've \n     heard about the national teacher shortage and are enticed by \n     the job security. Others, like Richardson, are disenchanted \n     lawyers and lobbyists who found that their high salaries did \n     not make up for job pressures.\n       They are being lured, too, by an easing of teacher \n     licensing requirements for career-switchers in many states \n     and school districts, a trend that is likely to continue as \n     the national teacher shortage worsens.\n       About 55 percent of the students currently enrolled in \n     post-undergraduate teaching programs started their careers in \n     another field, according to a study to be released this week \n     by the National Center for Education Information, a \n     Washington-based think tank. The study also found that 27 \n     percent of universities have programs solely for second-\n     career teachers, up from 3 percent in 1984.\n       Officials in several Washington area school districts said \n     they are seeing more people like Richardson, although they do \n     not keep such figures.\n       ``People used to be driven by the financial rewards of \n     their career,'' said Kevin North, the director of employment \n     for Fairfax County schools. ``People are starting to step \n     back and say, `Other things are more important to me, and I \n     want something more fulfilling.' ''\n       Second-career teachers are appealing job candidates in \n     several respects, said Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor of \n     education at Stanford University and director of the National \n     Commission on Teaching & America's Future. They are more \n     mature than first-career teachers and often have experience \n     with children through parenting. And because their decision \n     to teach usually requires a substantial pay cut, they tend to \n     have a deeper commitment to public education, she said.\n       Jerome ``Rick'' Peck, 55, a first-year science teacher at \n     Loudoun County's Seneca Ridge Middle School, said the biggest \n     attribute he brings to the classroom is ``the ability to say \n     to the kids--and to mean it and to know it--`Hey, this is \n     something you're going to need later in life.' ''\n       A certified public accountant with a master's degree in \n     business administration from the Wharton School, Peck was \n     earning a six-figure salary as chief financial officer of a \n     magazine publishing company until it was sold a few years \n     ago. He was financially secure and his decision to teach was \n     ``really selfish,'' Peck insists, because he saw it as \n     something he would enjoy.\n       Five weeks into the school year, he still feels that way. \n     But the transition hasn't been easy. He is mired in more \n     paperwork than he expected. Many of his students fared poorly \n     on the first test he gave, about the metric system, and some \n     complained that he was lecturing too fast.\n       ``When it comes to teaching, I'm definitely still \n     learning,'' Peck said.\n       James R. Fields, 38, a former supervisor at United Parcel \n     Service, is studying for his master's degree in education at \n     George Washington University and substitute teaching at Sligo \n     Middle School in Silver Spring.\n       Fields was earning $59,000 a year after 14 years at UPS. \n     But when he moved from the Miami area to Montgomery County to \n     get married, the company wouldn't transfer him.\n       He probably won't earn more than $35,000 a year when he \n     gets a full-time teaching job next year. Fields said he is \n     lucky that his wife, a gynecologist, has a salary that allows \n     him to pursue teaching.\n       Fields, who is African American, said he hopes to be a \n     strong influence on young black males. But right now, his \n     main goal is to learn the routines of running a classroom. He \n     said it's a challenge sometimes just to get his students to \n     settle down--never mind actually paying attention and \n     comprehending his lessons.\n       ``It's kind of tough as a sub--[the students] think it's a \n     field day,'' Fields said. ``In a sense I see that as a plus; \n     you quickly develop some classroom management skills.\n       Tom Brannan, 52, quit his $83,000-a-year job as an \n     assistant city manager in Alexandria to enroll in the \n     master's degree program at George Washington. He enjoyed many \n     aspects of his job but not the long hours and frenetic pace. \n     Time with his family was often cut short, he said.\n       In just a few weeks as a substitute teacher at Fairfax's \n     George Marshall High School, Brannan already has seen \n     rewards. One day, he was assigned on short notice to teach a \n     history class, with little time to prepare a lesson. After \n     sweating out the period, the bell rang and the students filed \n     out. One stopped to ask him: ``Are you gonna be back any time \n     soon?''\n       Career-switchers typically take fewer education courses \n     than students who go into teaching as a first career but \n     often get more field work in schools.\n       Despite the growing calls from politicians and school \n     officials to streamline the certification process for second-\n     career teachers, they may still face challenges getting \n     hired, said C. Emily Feistritzer, president of the National \n     Center for Education Information.\n       Some may possess several advanced degrees, which would put \n     them at a higher pay scale than most beginning teachers. \n     Feistritzer said she has spotted another hurdle: Principals \n     are sometimes less inclined to put older adults on their \n     teaching staff because they won't be as easy to supervise as \n     a 22-year-old college graduate.\n       Amy Harris is 26, younger than many of the other teachers \n     who started in a different profession. She gave up a job at a \n     brokerage firm in Minneapolis to lead 27 fifth-graders at \n     Loudoun's Cool Spring Elementary School. Although she didn't \n     take much of a pay cut to become a teacher, she eventually \n     would have earned far more if she'd stayed in financial \n     services.\n       She acknowledges that she second-guesses her decision once \n     a month, when she writes a check to pay down $25,000 in debt \n     from graduate school loans. But she is energized by her \n     students. ``I really enjoy their wit and their cleverness,'' \n     she said.\n       Richardson's journey toward teaching began last year, when \n     her mother was dying. She came to live with Richardson for \n     the last four months of her life, during which mother and \n     daughter had many soul-searching talks about careers, family \n     and, above all, happiness.\n       ``She said, `Look, you've got about 20 years [of working] \n     left--you need to do what you think is important and what you \n     want to do.' '' Richardson recalled.\n       Richardson, whose husband is an archivist, has put her two \n     children on strict allowances to reduce household expenses \n     since she quit her high-paying Labor Department job.\n       The worst of it, she said, is being viewed as an \n     inexperienced newcomer at age 46.\n       ``I worry that when I get done with this program, I have to \n     start over and sell myself again,'' she said. ``If I get \n     through this, they should want me!''\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthen Social Security \n     and Medicare Act of 1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) The Social Security system is one of the cornerstones \n     of American national policy and has allowed a generation of \n     Americans to retire with dignity. For 30 percent of all \n     senior citizens, Social Security benefits provide almost 90 \n     percent of their retirement income. For 66 percent of all \n     senior citizens, Social Security benefits provide over half \n     of their retirement income. Poverty rates among the elderly \n     are at the lowest level since the United States began to keep \n     poverty statistics, due in large part to the Social Security \n     system. The Social Security system, together with the \n     additional protections afforded by the Medicare system, have \n     been an outstanding success for past and current retirees and \n     must be preserved for future retirees.\n       (2) The long-term solvency of the Social Security and \n     Medicare trust funds is not assured. There is an estimated \n     long-range actuarial deficit in the Social Security trust \n     funds. According to the 1999 report of the Board of Trustees \n     of the Social Security trust funds, the accumulated balances \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and \n     the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund are currently \n     projected to become unable to pay benefits in full on a \n     timely basis starting in 2034. The Medicare system faces more \n     immediate financial shortfalls, with the Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund projected to become exhausted in 2015.\n       (3) In addition to preserving Social Security and Medicare, \n     the Congress and the President have a responsibility to \n     future generations to reduce the Federal debt held by the \n     public. Significant debt reduction will contribute to the \n     economy and improve the Government's ability to fulfill its \n     responsibilities and to face future challenges, including \n     preserving and strengthening Social Security and Medicare.\n       (4) The Federal Government is now in sound financial \n     condition. The Federal budget is projected to generate \n     significant surpluses. In fiscal years 1998 and 1999, there \n     were unified budget surpluses--the first consecutive \n     surpluses in more than 40 years. Over the next 15 years, the \n     Government projects the on-budget surplus, which excludes \n     Social Security, to total $2.9 trillion. The unified budget \n     surplus (including Social Security) is projected by the \n     Government to total $5.9 trillion over the next 15 years.\n       (5) The surplus, excluding Social Security, offers an \n     unparalleled opportunity to: preserve Social Security; \n     protect, strengthen, and modernize Medicare; and \n     significantly reduce the Federal debt held by the public, for \n     the future benefit of all Americans.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to protect the \n     Social Security surplus for debt reduction, to extend the \n     solvency of Social Security, and to set aside a reserve to be \n     used to protect, strengthen, and modernize Medicare.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS TO FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND \n                   SURVIVORS INSURANCE TRUST FUND AND FEDERAL \n                   DISABILITY INSURANCE TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to assure that \n     the interest savings on the debt held by the public achieved \n     as a result of Social Security surpluses from 2000 to 2015 \n     are dedicated to Social Security solvency.\n       (b) Additional Appropriation to Trust Funds.--Section 201 \n     of the Social Security Act is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(n) Additional Appropriation to Trust Funds.\n       ``(1) In addition to the amounts appropriated to the Trust \n     Funds under subsections (a) and (b), there is hereby \n     appropriated to the Trust Funds, out of any moneys in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated--\n       ``(A) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and \n     for each fiscal year thereafter through the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2016, an amount equal to the prescribed \n     amount for the fiscal year;

However, the long-term \nsolvency of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds is not \nguaranteed. The Social Security trust fund is currently expected to \nbecome insolvent starting in 2034 as the number of retired workers \ndoubles. The Medicare system also faces significant financial \nshortfalls, with the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund projected to become \nexhausted in 2015. We need to take additional steps to strengthen \nSocial Security and Medicare for future generations of Americans.\n  In addition to preserving Social Security and Medicare, the Congress \nand the President have a responsibility to future generations to reduce \nthe debt held by the public. Paying down the debt will produce \nsubstantial interest savings, and this legislation proposes to devote \nthese entirely to Social Security after 2010. At the same time, by \ncontributing to the growth of the overall economy debt reduction will \nimprove the Government's ability to fulfill its responsibilities and to \nface future challenges, including preserving and strengthening Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  The enclosed bill would help achieve these goals by devoting the \nentire Social Security surpluses to debt reduction, extending the \nsolvency of Social Security to 2050, protecting Social Security and \nMedicare funds in the budget process, reserving one-third of the non-\nSocial Security surplus to strengthen and modernize Medicare, and \npaying down the debt by 2015. It is clear and straightforward \nlegislation that would strengthen and preserve Social Security and \nMedicare for our children and grandchildren. The bill would:\n  Extend the life of Social Security from 2034 to 2050 by reinvesting \nthe interest savings from the debt reduction resulting from Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n  Establish a Medicare surplus reserve equal to one-third of any on-\nbudget surplus for the total of the period of fiscal years 2000 through \n2009 to strengthen and modernize Medicare.\n  Add a further protection for Social Security and Medicare by \nextending the budget enforcement rules that have provided the \nfoundation for our fiscal discipline, including the discretionary caps \nand pay-as-you-go budget rules.\n  I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of this proposal.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, October 26, 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url":

TREATY ORGANIZATION AND \n THE EUROPEAN UNION, IN LIGHT OF THE ALLIANCE'S APRIL 1999 WASHINGTON \n        SUMMIT AND THE EUROPEAN UNION'S JUNE 1999 COLOGNE SUMMIT\n\n  Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nSmith of Oregon, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Helms) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 208\n\n       Whereas NATO is the only military alliance with both real \n     defense capabilities and a transatlantic membership;\n       Whereas NATO is the only institution that promotes a \n     uniquely transatlantic perspective and approach to issues \n     concerning the security of North America and Europe;\n       Whereas NATO's military force structure, defense planning, \n     command structures, and force goals must be sufficient for \n     the collective self-defense of its members, capable of \n     projecting power when the security of a NATO member is \n     threatened, and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of \n     willing partners among NATO members to defend common values \n     and interests;\n       Whereas these requirements dictate that European NATO \n     members possess national military capabilities to rapidly \n     deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for \n     extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the United \n     States in high-intensity conflicts;\n       Whereas NATO's military operations against the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in 1999 \n     highlighted (1) the significant shortcomings of European \n     allies in command, control, communication, and intelligence \n     resources; combat aircraft; precision-guided munitions; \n     airlift; deployability; and logistics; and (2) the overall \n     imbalance between United States and European defense \n     capabilities;\n       Whereas this imbalance in United States and European NATO \n     defense capabilities undercuts the Alliance's goal of \n     equitable transatlantic burden-sharing;\n       Whereas NATO has undertaken great efforts to facilitate the \n     emergence of a stronger European pillar within NATO through \n     the European Security and Defense Identity, including the \n     identification of NATO's Deputy Supreme Allied Commander as \n     the commander of operations led by the Western European Union \n     (WEU); the creation of a NATO Headquarters for WEU-led \n     operations; and the establishment of close linkages between \n     NATO and the WEU, including planning, exercises, and regular \n     consultations;\n       Whereas in promulgating NATO's Defense Capabilities \n     Initiative Alliance members committed themselves to improving \n     their respective forces in five areas: (1) effective \n     engagement; (2) deployability and mobility; (3) \n     sustainability and logistics; (4) survivability; and (5) \n     command, control and communications.\n       Whereas on June 3, 1999, the European Union, in the course \n     of its Cologne Summit, agreed to absorb the functions and \n     structures of the Western European Union, including its \n     command structures and military forces, and established \n     within it the post of High Representative for Common Foreign \n     and Security Policy; and\n       Whereas the European Union's decisions at its June 3, 1999 \n     Cologne Summit indicate a new determination of its member \n     states to develop a European Security and Defense Identity \n     with strengthened defense capabilities to address regional \n     conflicts and crisis management: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD NATO.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--The Senate--\n       (1) believes NATO should remain the primary institution \n     through which European and North American allies address \n     security issues of transatlantic concern;\n       (2) believes all NATO members should commit to improving \n     their respective defense capabilities so that NATO can \n     project power decisively with equitable burden-sharing;\n       (3) endorses NATO's decision to launch the Defense \n     Capabilities Initiative, which is intended to improve the \n     defense capabilities of the European Allies, particularly the \n     deployability, mobility, sustainability, and interoperability \n     of these European forces;\n       (4) acknowledges the resolve of the European Union to have \n     the capacity for autonomous action so that it can take \n     decisions and approve military action where the Alliance as a \n     whole is not engaged; and\n       (5) calls upon the member states of NATO and the European \n     Union to promulgate together during their respective \n     meetings, ministerials, and summits in the course of 1999 \n     principles that will strengthen the transatlantic \n     partnership, reinforce unity within NATO, and harmonize their \n     roles in transatlantic affairs.\n       (b) Further Sense of the Senate.--It is further the sense \n     of the Senate that--\n       (1) on matters of trans-Atlantic concern the European Union \n     should make clear that it would undertake an autonomous \n     mission through its European Security and Defense Identity \n     only after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had been \n     offered the opportunity to undertake that mission but had \n     referred it to the European Union for action;\n       (2) improved European military capabilities, not new \n     institutions outside of the Alliance, are the key to a \n     vibrant and more influential European Security and Defense \n     Identity within NATO;\n       (3) failure of the European allies of the United States to \n     achieve the goals established through the Defense \n     Capabilities Initiative would weaken support for the Alliance \n     in the United States;\n       (4) the President, the Secretary of State, and the \n     Secretary of Defense should fully use their offices to \n     encourage the NATO allies of the United States to commit the \n     resources necessary to upgrade their capabilities to rapidly \n     deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for \n     extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the United \n     States in high-intensity conflicts, thus making them \n     effective partners of the United States in supporting mutual \n     interests;\n       (5) the European Union must implement its Cologne Summit \n     decisions concerning its Common Foreign and Security Policy \n     in a manner that will ensure that non-WEU NATO allies, \n     including Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, \n     Iceland, Norway, Poland, Turkey, and the United States, will \n     not be discriminated against, but will be fully involved when \n     the European Union addresses issues affecting their security \n     interests;\n       (6) the European Union's implementation of the Cologne \n     Summit decisions should not promote a strategic perspective \n     on transatlantic security issues that conflicts with that \n     promoted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       (7) the European Union's implementation of its Cologne \n     Summit decisions should not promote unnecessary duplication \n     of the resources and capabilities provided by NATO; and\n       (8) the European Union's implementation of its Cologne \n     Summit decisions should not promote a decline in the military \n     resources that European allies contribute to NATO, but should \n     instead promote the complete fulfillment of their respective \n     force commitments to the Alliance.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator \nRoth, Senator Lugar and other colleagues, a resolution that attempts to \nclarify the relationship between the European Union's new European \nSecurity and Defense Identify, popularly known by its acronym ESDI, and \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues will remember, ESDI has been \ngathering momentum since last December's meeting in St. Malo, France \nbetween French President Chirac and British Prime Minister Blair. It is \npart of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, which \nthe EU sees as essential to its development as ``an ever closer \nunion.''\n  ESDI was discussed in the communique of the April 1999 NATO \nWashington Summit, and it was elaborated on in the communique of the \nJune 1999 EU Cologne Summit.\n  Let me say up front that I believe that ESDI--if it is developed in \nproper coordination with NATO--can serve the national interest of the \nUnited States by becoming a valuable vehicle for strengthening the \nEuropean military contribution to NATO. Put another way, ESDI, if \nhandled correctly, can at long last create more equitable burden-\nsharing between our European NATO allies and the United States.\n  NATO must and will remain the preeminent organization to defend the \nterritory of the North Atlantic area against all external threats, as \nenvisioned in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty of April 4, 1949 \nand restated\n\n[[Page S13431]]\n\non April 30, 1998 by the United States Senate in its Resolution of \nRatification of the enlargement of the Alliance to include Poland, the \nCzech Republic, and Hungary.\n  NATO may also, pursuant to Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, on \na case-by-case basis, engage in other missions when there is consensus \namong its members that there is a threat to the security and interests \nof NATO members. These missions have become known as non-Article 5 \nmissions and were also reaffirmed by the Senate in the April 30, 1998 \nResolution of Ratification of NATO enlargement.\n  ESDI's field of action should be restricted to those non-Article 5 \nmissions in which NATO as an organization does not wish to involve \nitself. In practice, Mr. President, this would mean that at some future \ndate if the need for military action arose in non-NATO Europe and the \nUnited States did not wish to become involved, the European Union could \nundertake the effort, utilizing, in part, NATO assets.\n  Mr. President, I believe that such a situation with a rejuvenated \nEuropean pillar of the alliance could free up forces of this country \nfor possible action elsewhere.\n\n  Let me emphasize, however, that in order for ESDI to accomplish both \nthe goals of the European Union and of NATO, it must be clearly \ndesigned in a way that gives NATO the ``right of first refusal'' on \nnon-Article 5 missions. To repeat--if NATO would not wish to become \ninvolved, then the European Union would have the option of leading the \nmission.\n  In addition, Mr. President, we must be sure that ESDI does not \nduplicate resources or discriminate against non-EU European NATO \nmembers (Norway, Turkey, Iceland, Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary).\n  Mr. President, in my opinion the biggest danger is that ESDI could be \nconstructed as an alternative to NATO for non-Article 5 missions. If \nthis would happen, it could lead to an estrangement of the United \nStates from its European allies.\n  Unfortunately, the June 1999 Cologne EU Summit communique subtly \nmodified the language of the April 1999 Washington NATO Summit \ncommunique in the direction of ESDI as an autonomous EU military organ, \nusing NATO assets, without giving NATO this necessary ``right of first \nrefusal'' for non-Article 5 missions.\n  The European Union is currently involved in internal negotiations on \na further elaboration of ESDI at the December EU Summit in Helsinki. \nThe Sense of the Senate resolution that we are introducing serves as a \nclear message to our friends in the European Union that while we \nrecognize their aspirations for a European Security and Defense \nIdentity, it must complement NATO, not be in competition with, or \nduplicative of it.\n  With that in mind, our Resolution traces the development of ESDI, \nciting both the Washington NATO Summit and the Cologne EU Summit. It \nstresses that the Yugoslav air campaign demonstrated the military \nshortcomings of the European allies and the imbalance with the United \nStates, both of which the allies have pledged to address through the \nNATO Defense Capabilities Initiative.\n  The Resolution then expresses several items that are the Sense of the \nSenate.\n  NATO should remain the primary institution for security issues of \ntrans-Atlantic concern;\n  All NATO members should commit to improving their defense \ncapabilities so that the Alliance can project power decisively with \nequitable burden-sharing;\n  The Defense Capabilities Initiative adopted at the Washington NATO \nSummit is specifically endorsed;\n  The resolve of the EU to have the capacity for autonomous action \nwhere the Alliance as a whole is not engaged is acknowledged;\n  The member states of NATO and the EU should promulgate principles \nthat will strengthen the trans-Atlantic partnership and reinforce unity \nwithin NATO.\n\n  Then, Mr. President, cutting directly to the heart of preventing \nESDI's becoming an alternative to NATO for non-Article 5 missions, the \nResolution offers the Further Sense of the Senate that ``on matters of \ntrans-Atlantic concern the European Union should make clear that it \nwould undertake an autonomous mission through its European Security and \nDefense Identity only after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had \nbeen offered the opportunity to undertake that mission but had referred \nit to the European Union for action.''\n  Further, and directly relevant to the issue of more equitable burden-\nsharing, the Resolution states the Sense of the Senate that ``failure \nof the European allies of the United States to achieve the goals \nestablished through the Defense Capabilities Initiative would weaken \nsupport for the Alliance in the United States.''\n  Addressing the issue of non-discrimination by the EU against non-EU \nNATO members, the Resolution states the Sense of the Senate that ``the \nEuropean Union must implement its Cologne Summit decisions concerning \nits Common Foreign and Security Policy in a manner that will ensure \nthat non-WEU NATO allies, including Canada, the Czech Republic, \nDenmark, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Turkey, and the United \nStates, will not be discriminated against, but will be fully involved \nwhen the European Union addresses issues affecting their security \ninterests.''\n  Finally, the Resolution expresses the Sense of the Senate that the \nEU's implementation of its Cologne Summit decisions should not promote \na strategic perspective on trans-Atlantic security issues that \nconflicts with that promoted by NATO and should not promote unnecessary \nduplication of the resources and capabilities provided by NATO.\n  Mr. President, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains the \ncornerstone of our engagement with Europe. The resolution we have \nintroduced makes clear to our partners that we support the European \nUnion's European Security and Defense Identity as long as it is \ndeveloped in a manner to strengthen NATO, not weaken it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13431-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13431-S13485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      BINGAMAN AMENDMENT NO. 2345\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (H.R. 434) to authorize a new trade and investment policy for \nsub-Sahara Africa; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ____.

MORATORIUM ON ANTIDUMPING AND COUNTERVAILING DUTY \n                   AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Senate is deeply concerned that, in connection with \n     the World Trade Organization (``WTO'') Ministerial meeting to \n     be held in Seattle, Washington, and the multilateral trade \n     negotiations expected to follow, a few countries are seeking \n     to circumvent the agreed list of negotiating topics and \n     reopen debate over the WTO's antidumping and antisubsidy \n     rules.\n       (2) Strong antidumping and antisubsidy rules are a \n     cornerstone of the liberal trade policy of the United States \n     and are essential to the health of the manufacturing and farm \n     sectors in the United States.\n       (3) It has long been and remains the policy of the United \n     States to support its antidumping and antisubsidy laws and to \n     defend those laws in international negotiations.\n       (4) The WTO antidumping and antisubsidy rules concluded in \n     the Uruguay Round have scarcely been tested since they \n     entered into effect and certainly have not proved defective.\n       (5) Opening these rules to renegotiation could only lead to \n     weakening them, which would in turn lead to even greater \n     abuse of the world's open markets, particularly that of the \n     United States.\n       (6) Conversely, avoiding another divisive fight over these \n     rules is the best way to promote progress on the other, far \n     more important, issues facing WTO members.\n       (7) It is therefore essential that negotiations on these \n     antidumping and antisubsidy matters not be reopened under the \n     auspices of the WTO or otherwise.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should--\n       (1) not participate in any international negotiation in \n     which antidumping or antisubsidy rules are part of the \n     negotiating agenda;\n       (2) refrain from submitting for congressional approval \n     agreements that require weakening changes to the current \n     antidumping and countervailing duty laws and enforcement \n     policies of the United States; and\n       (3) enforce the antidumping and countervailing duty laws \n     vigorously in all pending and future cases.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SPECTER (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2347\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nByrd, and Mr. Helms) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nthem to the bill, H.R. 434, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n\n     TITLE ____--PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR DUMPED AND SUBSIDIZED \n                              MERCHANDISE\n\n     SEC. ____01.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING COMPREHENSIVE DEBT \n                   RELIEF FOR THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The burden of external debt has become a major \n     impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many \n     of the world's poorest countries.\n       (2) Until recently, the United States Government and other \n     official creditors sought to address this problem by \n     rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt \n     reduction.\n       (3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of \n     the world's poorest countries continued to grow beyond their \n     capacity to repay.\n       (4) In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the \n     International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor \n     Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the \n     international community that all multilateral and bilateral \n     creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, \n     would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.\n       (5) The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to \n     address concerns raised about country conditionality, the \n     amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings \n     realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that \n     the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and \n     poverty alleviation in the world's poorest countries.\n       (6) Recently, the President requested Congress to provide \n     additional resources for bilateral debt forgiveness and \n     additional United States contributions to the HIPC Trust \n     Fund.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should work together, \n     without undue delay and in concert with the international \n     community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the \n     world's poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic \n     growth and poverty alleviation;\n       (2) this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief \n     should be designed to strengthen and expand the private \n     sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the \n     development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic \n     growth in benficiary countries;\n       (3) this program of debt relief should also support the \n     adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that \n     benefits are shared widely among the population, such as \n     through initiatives to advance education, improve health, \n     combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental \n     protection;\n       (4) these debt relief agreements should be designed and \n     implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad \n     participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and \n     should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken \n     into account;\n       (5) no country should receive the benefits of debt relief \n     if that country does not cooperate with the United States on \n     terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of \n     the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict \n     or spends excessively on its military; and\n       (6) in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in \n     many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund \n     must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to \n     eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open \n     market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of \n     gold.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            CONRAD (AND GRASSLEY) AMENDMENTS NOS. 2359-2360\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Grassley) submitted two amendments \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, H.R. 434, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 2359\n\n       At the end, insert the following new title:\n\n[[Page S13440]]\n\n  \n\n   TITLE ____--TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS AND FISHERMEN\n\n            Subtitle A--Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974\n\n     SEC. ____01.

and\n       (3) a successful conclusion of the next round of World \n     Trade Organization negotiations is critically important to \n     the United States agricultural sector.\n       (b) Objectives.--The agricultural trade negotiating \n     objectives of the United States with respect to the World \n     Trade Organization negotiations include--\n       (1) immediately eliminating all export subsidies worldwide \n     while maintaining bona fide food aid and preserving United \n     States market development and export credit programs that \n     allow the United States to compete with other foreign export \n     promotion efforts;\n       (2) leveling the playing field for United States producers \n     of agricultural products by eliminating blue box subsidies \n     and disciplining domestic supports in a way that forces \n     producers to face world prices on all production in excess of \n     domestic food security needs while allowing the preservation \n     of non-trade distorting programs to support family farms and \n     rural communities;\n       (3) disciplining state trading enterprises by insisting on \n     transparency and banning discriminatory pricing practices \n     that amount to de facto export subsidies so that the \n     enterprises do not (except in cases of bona fide food aid) \n     sell in foreign markets at prices below domestic market \n     prices or prices below the full costs of acquiring and \n     delivering agricultural products to the foreign markets;\n       (4) insisting that the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Accord \n     agreed to in the Uruguay Round applies to new technologies, \n     including biotechnology, and clarifying that labeling \n     requirements to allow consumers to make choices regarding \n     biotechnology products or other regulatory requirements \n     cannot be used as disguised barriers to trade;\n       (5) increasing opportunities for United States exports of \n     agricultural products by first reducing tariff and nontariff \n     barriers to trade to the same or lower levels than exist in \n     the United States and then eliminating barriers, such as--\n       (A) restrictive or trade distorting practices that \n     adversely impact perishable or cyclical products;\n       (B) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff-rate \n     quotas; and\n       (C) unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions or \n     other unjustified technical barriers to agricultural trade;\n       (6) encouraging government policies that avoid price-\n     depressing surpluses; and\n       (7) strengthening dispute settlement procedures so that \n     countries cannot maintain unjustified restrictions on United \n     States exports in contravention of their commitments.\n       (c) Consultation With Congressional Committees.--\n       (1) Consultation before offer made.--Before the United \n     States Trade Representative negotiates a trade agreement that \n     would reduce tariffs on agricultural products or require a \n     change in United States agricultural law, the United States \n     Trade Representative shall consult with the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Committee on \n     Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Agriculture and \n     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Consultation before agreement initialed.--Not less than \n     48 hours before initialing an agreement relating to \n     agricultural trade negotiated under the auspices of the World \n     Trade Organization, the United States Trade Representative \n     shall consult closely with the committees referred to in \n     paragraph (1) regarding--\n       (A) the details of the agreement;\n       (B) the potential impact of the agreement on United States \n     agricultural producers; and\n       (C) any changes in United States law necessary to implement \n     the agreement.\n       (3) No secret side deals.--Any agreement or other \n     understanding (whether verbal or in writing) that relates to \n     agricultural trade that is not disclosed to the Congress \n     before legislation implementing a trade agreement is \n     introduced in either house of Congress shall not be \n     considered to be part of the agreement approved by Congress \n     and shall have no force and effect under United States law or \n     in any dispute settlement body.\n       (d) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should \n     be the top priority of United States negotiators; and\n       (2) if the primary competitors of the United States do not \n     reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and export \n     subsidies in accordance with the negotiating objectives \n     expressed in this section, the United States should increase \n     its support and subsidy levels to level the playing field in \n     order to improve United States farm income and to encourage \n     United States competitors to eliminate export subsidies and \n     domestic supports that are harmful to United States farmers \n     and ranchers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       CONRAD AMENDMENT NO. 2361\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CONRAD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, H.R. 434, supra;

FINDINGS OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consistent with the rights of the United States under \n     the World Trade Organization, injurious dumping is to be \n     condemned and actionable subsidies which cause injury to \n     domestic industries must be effectively neutralized.\n       (2) United States unfair trade laws have as their purpose \n     the restoration of conditions of fair trade so that jobs and \n     investment that should be in the United States are not lost \n     through the false market signals.\n       (3) The continued dumping or subsidization of imported \n     products after the issuance of\n\n[[Page S13477]]\n\n     antidumping orders or findings or countervailing duty orders \n     can frustrate the remedial purpose of the laws by preventing \n     market prices from returning to fair levels.\n       (4) Where dumping or subsidization continues, domestic \n     producers will be reluctant to reinvest or rehire and may be \n     unable to maintain pension and health care benefits that \n     conditions of fair trade would permit. Similarly, small \n     businesses and American farmers and ranchers may be unable to \n     pay down accumulated debt, to obtain working capital, or to \n     otherwise remain viable.\n       (5) United States trade laws should be strengthened to see \n     that the remedial purpose of those laws is achieved.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Agribusiness Merger \n     Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. ____2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Concentration in the agricultural economy including \n     mergers, acquisitions, and other combinations and alliances \n     among suppliers, producers, packers, other food processors, \n     and distributors has been accelerating at a rapid pace in the \n     1990's.\n       (2) The trend toward greater concentration in agriculture \n     has important and far-reaching implications not only for \n     family-based farmers, but also for the food we eat, the \n     communities we live in, and the integrity of the natural \n     environment upon which we all depend.\n       (3) In the past decade and a half, the top 4 largest pork \n     packers have seized control of some 57 percent of the market, \n     up from 36 percent. Over the same period, the top 4 beef \n     packers have expanded their market share from 32 percent to \n     80 percent, the top 4 flour millers have increased their \n     market share from 40 percent to 62 percent, and the market \n     share of the top 4 soybean crushers has jumped from 54 \n     percent to 80 percent.\n       (4) Today the top 4 sheep, poultry, wet corn, and dry corn \n     processors now control 73 percent, 55 percent, 74 percent, \n     and 57 percent of the market, respectively.\n       (5) A handful of firms dominate the processing of every \n     major commodity. Many of them are vertically integrated, \n     which means that they control successive stages of the food \n     chain, from inputs to production to distribution.\n       (6) Growing concentration of the agricultural sector has \n     restricted choices for farmers trying to sell their products. \n     As the bargaining power of agribusiness firms over farmers \n     increases, agricultural commodity markets are becoming \n     stacked against the farmer.\n       (7) The farmer's share of every retail dollar has plummeted \n     from around 50 percent in 1952, to less than 25 percent \n     today, while the profit share for farm input, marketing, and \n     processing companies has risen.\n       (8) While agribusiness conglomerates are posting record \n     earnings, farmers are facing desperate times. The commodity \n     price index is the lowest since 1987. Hog prices are at their \n     lowest since 1972. Cotton and soybean prices are the lowest \n     they have been since the early 1970's.\n       (9) The benefits of low commodity prices are not being \n     passed on to American consumers. The gap between what \n     shoppers pay for food and what farmers are paid is growing \n     wider. From 1984 to 1998, prices paid to farmers fell 36 \n     percent, while consumer food prices actually increased by 3 \n     percent.\n       (10) Concentration, low prices, anticompetitive practices, \n     and other manipulations and abuses of the agricultural \n     economy are driving family-based farmers out of business. \n     Farmers are going bankrupt or giving up, and few are taking \n     their places; more farm families are having to rely on other \n     jobs to stay afloat; and the number of farmers leaving the \n     land will continue to increase unless and until these trends \n     are reversed.\n       (11) The decline of family-based agriculture undermines the \n     economies of rural communities across America; it has pushed \n     Main Street businesses, from equipment suppliers to insurance \n     sales people, out of business or to the brink of insolvency.\n       (12) Increased concentration in the agribusiness sector has \n     a harmful effect on the environment; corporate hog farming, \n     for example, threatens the integrity of local water supplies \n     and creates noxious odors in neighboring communities. \n     Concentration also can increase the risks to food safety and \n     limit the biodiversity of plants and animals.\n       (13) The decline of family-based farming poses a direct \n     threat to American families and family values, by subjecting \n     farm families to turmoil and stress.\n       (14) The decline of family-based farming causes the demise \n     of rural communities, as stores lose customers, churches lose \n     congregations, schools and clinics become under-used, career \n     opportunities for young people dry up, and local inequalities \n     of wealth and income grow wider.\n       (15) These developments are not the result of inevitable \n     market forces.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Pfizer, \nInc., on its 150th anniversary and to applaud the company for its many \ninnovations in the pharmaceutical industry. The history of Pfizer is \none of risk-taking, confident decision-making, and dramatic medical \nadvances. It is the story of a small chemical company founded in \nBrooklyn, New York, which over 150 years has evolved into one of the \nworld's premier pharmaceutical enterprises.\n  Cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart emigrated to the United \nStates from Germany in the mid-1840s. In New York City, the young \ncousins combined their skills and in 1849 founded a small chemical \nfirm. Charles Pfizer & Company improved the American chemical market by \nmanufacturing specialty chemicals that had not yet been produced in \nAmerica. During its first 75 years, the company made many important \ndiscoveries and marketed popular and effective drug treatments. Union \nsoldiers used Pfizer drugs extensively during the Civil War.\n  However, Pfizer's real emergence as an industry leader was the result \nof a daring risk taken by Pfizer executives in the 1940s. In 1928, when \nAlexander Fleming discovered the germ-killing properties of penicillin, \nhe knew that it could have a profound medical value. Yet, Fleming could \nnot figure out a way to mass-produce the drug. In 1941, following new \ndiscoveries relating to this ``wonder drug'', Pfizer executives put \ntheir own stocks at stake and invested millions of dollars in finding a \nway to mass-produce penicillin. Eventually, they succeeded. The \nbreakthrough came just in time to send penicillin to the front lines of \nWorld War II.\n  From that point forward, Pfizer evolved into an international leader \nin the pharmaceutical industry, opening facilities around the globe and \ndeveloping new and effective antibiotics to combat deadly infectious \ndiseases. Pfizer's products, which treat a variety of diseases and \ndisorders, are now available in 150 countries. The company also has \nthriving consumer health care and animal health care divisions. Pfizer \nnow employs close to 50,000 people in 85 countries, including 4,939 \nemployees in their Groton research facility, which lies in my home \nstate of Connecticut.\n  The desire to live a healthy life is universal. But for millions of \npeople around the world, access to high quality health care remains out \nof reach. Pfizer is committed to bringing its medicines to those in \nneed. Through Sharing the Care, a program started in 1993, Pfizer has \nfilled more than 3.0 million prescriptions--valued at over $170 \nmillion--for more than one million uninsured patients in the United \nStates. The program was cited by American Benefactor, a leading \nphilanthropy journal, in selecting Pfizer as one of America's 25 most \ngenerous companies for 1998.\n  Pfizer today is renowned as one of the world's most admired \ncorporations for the many contributions it has made to our society. I \napplaud Pfizer on its 150th anniversary for its continued efforts to \nmaking this nation and this world a healthier place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13486-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESIGNATION OF WALLY BEYER\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of a true public servant, a fellow North Dakotan, and a \nman I am proud to call my friend.\n  Wally Beyer has served this nation as Administrator of the Rural \nUtilities Service, the former Rural Electric Administration, for 6 \nyears now.\n  Wally is the 12th administrator of the agency originally created by \nFranklin Roosevelt; an agency that has developed as we've developed as \na nation: from providing basic electric and telecommunications needs \nfor America's rural areas, to making sure rural America takes its \nrightful place in the new communication age.\n  Wally has helped steer the RUS toward not only providing the critical \ncontinuing need for clean water and waste water facilities, but into \nnew territory of critical distance-learning and medical links for areas \nthat otherwise might not have access to these important services.\n  Since he was first nominated by President Clinton and confirmed by \nthe Senate in late 1993, Wally's steady hand, professional skill and \npatience has served our Nation well.\n  Whether it was to guide the refinancing of electric borrowers through \nthe high interest years of the 1970's and 80's, or to lead the \nmodernization and stream-lining of rules and regulations at the RUA, \nWally Beyer managed the agency with a careful balancing of the needs of \nrural America and the needs of the American taxpayer.\n  Wally Beyer has served this nation well. As a crew chief for the U.S. \nAir Force air rescue squadron in the Caribbean in the 50's, as an \nengineer for the Verendrye Electric Cooperative bringing electricity to \nnorth central North Dakota, and as head of the reinvigorated RUS.\n  Wally plans to return to our native North Dakota, along with his wife \nPat. With three married children and three growing grandchildren, he \nsays he will stay active and involved in public service. Washington's \nloss will be North Dakota's gain as Wally Beyer returns home to the \nland we both love.\n  In a recent speech announcing those plans, Wally said, ``My season \nhas come. I feel good about it. I've got to get back to North Dakota \nwhere the air is sweet. You won't miss me when I'm gone.''\n  Well Wally. Your legacy at the RUS is in tact, and thanks to your \nhard work is, as you said, ``humming along.''\n  But you are wrong to say you won't be missed. Your selfless service \nto the public good will be missed by many, who will have to continue \nthe restructuring of the electric utility industry without your sure \nhand.\n  You will be missed by those electric consumers in 46 States that were \nwell aware that you, as a rural resident, understood their needs.\n  And you will be missed by those who relied on your friendship and \ngood judgement when seeking to solve the long term problems continuing \nto plague rural America.\n  So, as you take your leave, I know my colleagues in the Senate join \nme in wishing you and your family the very best in what ever path you \nchoose.\n  You have made a lasting impact and a worthwhile contribution to your \ncountry. Wally Beyer, you have made a difference and we are all better \nfor it. Thank you, Mr. Administrator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13486-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13486-S13487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF CAMIE OGREN\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to \nrecognize an outstanding South Carolina athlete, Camie Ogren. In \nAugust, Camie brought home gold medals in the tricks event, the jump \nevent and the team overall competition in the 1999 World Disabled Water \nSki Championships in Windsor, England. This was her fifth trip to the \ninternational competition representing the U.S. Disabled Water Ski \nTeam. In 1998, Camie broke the women's world record for slalom at the \nNational Disabled Championships in Birmingham, Ala., where she also won \nfour gold medals in the leg amputee division.\n  Skiing has been an important part of Camie's life since her childhood \nin Windermere, Florida near Orlando, and in the finest athletic spirit, \nshe continued to pursue the sport after bone cancer claimed her right \nleg more than 10 years ago when she was 15. Two weeks after her leg was \namputated, Camie was back in the water and a few months later she \ncompeted in her first world championship in Australia where she earned \nsecond and third place honors.\n  She moved to Charleston, S.C. a year and a half ago to work with the \nMedical University of South Carolina's Anchors Away program. Operated \nthrough the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Anchors \nAway allows people with disabilities and their families access to boats \nand other recreational activities, mostly on the water. With her \nexpertise, Camie helped Anchors Away form a disabled water ski team \nthat competes in national competitions and has also conducted out-of-\ntown ski clinics in South and North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S13487]]\n\n  Camie is a remarkable person and athlete whose warmth and dedication \nto the sport of water-skiing has endeared her to the Charleston \ncommunity. She serves as a powerful example to persons with \ndisabilities of what they can achieve in the realm of competition. \nSouth Carolina is lucky to have Camie Ogren and her limitless energy in \nadvancing her sport and its athletes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13487-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL BERNT BALCHEN\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Col. Bernt Balchen, A Norwegian-\nborn pilot, became one of America's great Arctic experts of the 20th \nCentury. A patriotic American, he was also a great friend of the State \nof Alaska.\n  Born in Norway on October 23, 1899. Colonel Balchen served in the \nFrench Foreign Legion, and both the Finnish and Norwegian Armies in \nWorld War I; and became a pilot in the Norwegian Naval Air Corps in \n1921.\n  Throughout the 1920's and 1930's Colonel Balchen participated in \nnumerous trans-Atlantic and Arctic expeditions. During 1928-1930, \nBalchen was chief pilot on Admiral Byrd's Atlantic expedition and on \nNovember 29, 1929, he piloted the first airplane, a Ford trimotor \n``Floyd Bennett'' across the South Pole. Congress conferred United \nStates citizenship of Colonel Balchen in 1931.\n  When World War II started in 1939, Colonel Balchen began ferrying \nairplanes to England and Singapore for the British. In 1941, he joined \nthe United States Army Air Corps at the request of General ``Hap'' \nArnold, and was assigned to Greenland to Supervise the Construction of, \nand later command, our famous airbase known as ``Bluie West 8''. His \ncommand is credited with numerous rescue missions saving many pilots \nwhose planes had gone down on the icecap.\n  In 1943, Balchen became chief of allied transportation command for \nNorway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the Soviet Union, operating out \nof a secret base in Scotland. During that period, his command regularly \nflew across enemy-occupied territory to rescue downed allied airmen and \ninsert commandos and intelligence agents behind enemy lines. He also \nled highly secret missions into Norway to resupply underground \nresistance forces for their operations against the German army of \noccupation.\n  After the war, Balchen was recalled to active duty with the United \nStates Air Force in 1948 and assigned to command the 10th rescue \nsquadron at Elemendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. The techniques of Arctic \nRescue that Colonel Balchen developed during this assignment continue \nto save the lives of civilian and military personnel to this day. In \nMay 1949, he flew a Douglas C-54 from Fairbanks, Alaska over the North \nPole to Oslo, Sweden, becoming the first pilot to fly over both Poles.\n  Colonel Balchen was transferred to headquarters, United States Air \nForce in 1951 to participate in developing the Ballistic missile early \nwarning system (BMEWS). Also, he was instrumental in the establishment \nof Thule Air Force base in Greenland and blazed airborne trails to \nassist both commercial and military aviation in the Arctic region. \nAfter retiring from the Air Force in 1956, Balchen continued to serve \non special assignment and as a consultant to the military.\n  Col. Bernt Balchen died on October 23, 1973, and is buried in \nArlington National Cemetery. His lifetime achievements influenced the \ncourse of Aviation, arctic, and military history. His legacy to this \ncountry and to my State of Alaska is a strong northern defense, an \nestablished transpolar aviation system, a better understanding of the \nworld's polar regions, and, of course, the lives of those rescued by \nColonel Balchen and the men and women who continue his work with the \nUnited States Air Force Rescue Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13487-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2000\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have a question of the leader. Will the majority leader \nagree to delete No. 279 from the list of nominations?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator, is that Glenn \nMcCullough of Mississippi, my home State, to be a member of the \nTennessee Valley Authority board of directors?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. No, I will not agree to that. I should point out there are \nsome 27 nominations--25 nominations plus 2 more on which I was going to \nask for agreement on a time limit and a vote, the nomination of Linda \nMorgan to be a member of the Surface Transportation Board--her \nnomination has been held up quite sometime, but I have agreement now to \nproceed to a recorded vote on that one, and also No. 271, the \nnomination of Ronald Gould of Washington to be a U.S. judge for the \nNinth Circuit. We need to request 1 hour of debate and a recorded vote. \nThere are a total of 27 nominations here, including 2 that will have to \nhave a recorded vote. It is a package. They all go or none go.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In light of that, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can be heard briefly on that. I want to \nemphasize this is a very large package of 27 nominations. Most of them \nare people who are supported by Democrats, I guess 23, 24, 25 of those. \nThere are two or three that are Republican positions. One of them is \nfor the Tennessee Valley Authority, which I presume is being objected \nto for an unrelated reason because, clearly, there is no problem with \nthis nominee.\n  I will be back early next week with additional nominations that will \nrun this package up to, I presume, between 34 and 40 nominations. All I \ncan do is get them cleared and then offer them to the Democrats. If \nthey object, then that is their problem.\n  I should also note that included in this group was not one, not two, \nbut three judges, two of them women. One of the women is from \nCalifornia and one of them is from Texas. So for one 6-year \nappointment--I believe it is a 6-year term--to the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority where there is a need for these two directors, they are \nwilling to hold up 27 nominations, including two\n\n[[Page S13488]]\n\nwomen nominated to U.S. district courts.\n  That is not real smart. I do not quite understand it, and I hope the \nleadership and the President will speak to those who object in this way \nbecause I have heard all kinds of rhetoric today about how it is \ndifficult if you are a woman or minority to get your nomination \napproved. In fact, I believe the record will show over the last 3 years \nthis Congress and the previous Congress has confirmed a higher \npercentage of women and minorities than any Congress in history.\n  I do note it is pretty hard to go back and look at all the \nnominations and determine exactly how many minorities were approved \nbecause there is no record. We do not check whether you are a \nminority--African American or Hispanic or Asian. You are a person. All \nwe can tell by your name is if you are a man or woman. Based on just \nthe gender statistic, in fact, since I have been majority leader, I \nbelieve the record will show we have approved a lot more women than \nGeorge Mitchell did when he was majority leader.\n  These accusations that were made today ring hollow. I hate to see the \nSenate stoop to that level. I met with White House officials today and \ntold them we were going to try to clear these 27 nominations, and we \nwill keep trying to move them all. I do not think it is reasonable to \ntry to hold up one 6-year-term nominee to try to get two lifetime \nnominees to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a circuit that already \nhas too many activist judges in it, a circuit that is the most liberal \nin this country, a circuit that is overruled more than any other \ncircuit in the country by the Supreme Court, a circuit basically that \nis out of control. The nominees for these two positions have given rise \nto a great deal of controversy, to serious questions about whether they \nwould be activists on the court, and to grave concerns about their \nrecords.\n  I understand the objection, and hopefully we can clear it up early \ntomorrow or next week.

Mr. President, I was in New York on Monday to hold a \nhearing of the Y2K Committee when Senator Moynihan, a member of that \ncommittee, joined me. I greeted him with the normal good humor that we \ngreet one of our colleagues, but he did not respond in good humor. \nInstead, he said to me: I have very sad news. I was a little surprised \nat that and asked him what was so significant as to cause him to be so \ndowncast. He said: John Chafee died. That was very sad news, indeed.\n  I was stunned, along with my colleague from New York, and had to \nreflect on how recently I had seen John Chafee, spoken with him, found \nhim in good spirits, if not in good health. Indeed, I thought he was in \ngood health.\n  On Friday of last week, I was addressing a group of students from the \nState of Utah answering their questions about the Senate and Senate \nprocedure and Senate life and was interested when I got a question that \nI often get from people outside of the political arena. It was: Tell us \nabout life as a Senator. And specifically this question was: Tell us \nabout the Senators. Then the questioner said: Tell us who your friends \nare.\n  That is always an interesting question. You want to be careful about \nthe answer because you do not want to offend anyone by leaving them \nout. But I said to that group on Friday: I have many friends in the \nSenate, but one of my closest friends is John Chafee.\n  I put those two incidents over the weekend together. On Friday, I am \nciting the name of John Chafee as one of my closest friends, and on \nMonday, one of my other friends in this body tells me of John's \npassing.\n  I have waited until now to take the floor to pay tribute to John \nChafee, partly because of the press of business and partly because I \nwas afraid I could not keep my composure. Those who know me well know \nmy emotions sometimes run very close to the surface. I get dewy-eyed at \nthe dedication of a parking lot. For that reason, an occasion such as \nthis one can be a difficult one. At the same time, however, I want to \nlook at the death of John Chafee from a slightly different perspective.\n\n  We mourn his passing. We become emotional at the thought of his loss. \nBut we should recognize in many ways this is a time for rejoicing.\n  I have had the experience, along with many others, of dealing with \naging parents. My father was 95, my mother 96, when they passed away--\nneither one of them in good health.\n  My mother dealt with an aging parent in her lifetime, a father who \nhad a stroke and then lingered for a number of years thereafter. Mother \nused to say to us: If I'm killed in an automobile accident, rejoice. I \ndon't look forward to going through old age.\n  When people retire, very often they go downhill rapidly. John showed \nno signs of that, but his health was failing. He had been in the \nhospital for a back problem. He was not an old man by my standards. \nSeventy-seven seems increasingly younger as I get closer to it myself. \nBut I think of the possibility of John Chafee running downhill in old \nage. I think we might rejoice that he was spared that.\n  John Chafee left at the top of his game, at the top of his form. He \nwas a Senator's Senator. He was involved in everything. We did not vote \ntogether very often, but when we did, he was always grateful; and when \nwe did not, he was always understanding. I never had an occasion where \nJohn Chafee was disapproving.\n  We stood together on one issue where we were two of four \nRepublicans--one of the occasions where we crossed the line; John did \nthat more often than I--to join with a group of Democrats. That was the \nflag amendment. John and I both had great reverence for the flag of the \nUnited States, but we felt our reverence for the Constitution \noutweighed that and that the Constitution should not be amended to deal \nwith a nonexistent problem because flag burning is no longer going on \nin the United States, except by those who want to goad us into \nattempting to amend the Constitution. At least that is the way I saw it \nand that is the way John saw it. He was always friendly and supportive \nwhen we had those kinds of problems.\n  The thing I will remember the most about John Chafee, as a Senator's \nSenator, was the way he would go after problems and not people, the way \nhe would tackle challenges and not the challengers, the way he would \nmaintain a constant good humor, even in the face of difficulties within \nhis own party or difficulties from across the aisle.\n  It is a time for rejoicing, rejoicing because we had the privilege of \ndealing with this man, right up to the end of his life, and then seeing \nhim spared the long good-bye that we are seeing in others--Ronald \nReagan, for example. I think if John Chafee were given the choice, he \nwould take the choice the Good Lord has given him rather than lingering \non in some crippled fashion. He had a weak heart, weaker than any of us \nknew. The possibility of that kind of situation was perhaps there, but \nI am following the advice of my mother, who, looking at the possibility \nof an old age, said: If I'm taken suddenly, don't mourn. Rejoice.\n  There is very little I think we can add to the accomplishments of \nJohn Chafee's life. We can rejoice that we knew him, served with him, \nand we were with him right up to the moment where he left, as I say, at \nthe top of his game.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to his family. I have \nmet both his wife and his son. I know what fine people they are. I know \nhow desperately they feel this loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13488-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13488-S13489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1999\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I have exercised the prerogative, which is \neach Senator's, to place a hold, which means legislation cannot be \nbrought up without at least referring to and discussing it with the \nSenator who has placed the hold. In this case, I did so on the \nlegislation which is commonly referred to as the tax extender bill. \nThis is legislation which extends the life of a number of current tax \nprovisions. As a member of the Finance Committee, I support this \nlegislation and I will vote for this legislation. I am going to \nannounce publicly that I am withdrawing the hold I had on that \nlegislation. I will give a brief explanation.\n\n  First, I am doing so because I think, in the spirit of comity and the \neffort to get important work accomplished during what I hope will be \nthe relatively few days remaining in this first session of the 106th \nCongress, it is appropriate to allow the Senate to take up this \nlegislation without further delay insofar as it is the product of my \naction.\n  Second, an explanation of why I imposed the hold in the first \ninstance: I supported this legislation. I supported it in large part \nbecause it meets what I think is a fundamental test--it is paid for. \nThis legislation contains increases in certain taxes sufficient to \ncover the cost of the tax relief which will be made available through \nthe extenders. Not to do that would have had the effect of dipping into \nthe surplus. Now that means dipping into the Social Security surplus, \nsince we have already spent the non-Social Security surplus. This bill \nmeets the test of being fiscally prudent.\n  However, I alert the Senate that there was another bill, which in \nmany ways was a companion of the tax extender legislation, voted out of \nthe Finance Committee almost simultaneously with the tax extender \nlegislation. That is legislation which will provide for increases in \nthe reimbursement level to providers of various health care services \nunder the Medicare program. Again, I support the concept that there is \na justifiable case for increasing those reimbursements. We have done \nso, in this legislation that the Senate will possibly soon be \nconsidering, in the amount of approximately $1 billion in fiscal year \n2000, $5 billion in fiscal year 2001, and an additional $9 billion over \nthe next 8 years, for a total of $15 billion.\n  My criticism of that legislation is, unlike the tax extender bill, it \nis not paid for. Therefore, we will be asked to vote for $15 billion of \nadditional spending, which will have to come directly out of the Social \nSecurity surplus. It had been my intention, by holding the tax extender \nbill, to propose an amendment to the tax extender bill which would have \nbeen the additional reimbursement for Medicare providers but with an \nappropriate offset so that there would be $15 billion either of reduced \nspending elsewhere or additional taxes to pay for the additional \nreimbursement for Medicare providers. It had been my thought that by \nmerging these two bills together and using this as an opportunity to \nprovide the offsets for the Medicare reimbursement increases, we would \nbe able to send to the House of Representatives legislation which it \nmight both consider and favorably vote upon.\n  It now appears that, in fact, we are not going to take up the \nincreased reimbursement to Medicare providers, at least not take it up \nas separate legislation. Rather, it will be either delayed to some \nfuture date or taken up as part of the likely end-of-session major \nfinancial compromise.\n  It appears as if there is no purpose to be gained by holding the tax \nextender bill for purposes of offering an amendment to a bill which is \nnot going to be taken up anyway. For those somewhat convoluted reasons, \nbut reasons which I hope will be satisfactory to the Members of the \nbody, my colleagues, I am announcing that I am lifting the hold on the \ntax extender bill. It is my hope that we will soon pass it and that it \nwill serve as a model for other legislation when we decide that it is \nimportant enough to extend a tax benefit to a certain class of \ntaxpayers, or important enough to increase spending in the form of \nadditional appropriations to certain citizens of this country, that we \nwill have the fortitude to make the judgment as to how we are going to \npay for either those reductions in revenue from one source or increase \nin appropriations to another.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Graham pertaining to the introduction of S. 1827 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every Member of our Senate family was\n\n[[Page S13490]]\n\ngripped in sadness and grief when we heard of the death of John Chafee.\n  John Chafee was a giant for many reasons. He was a kind man. He was a \ntruly gentle and a magnificently decent Senator.\n  Time and time again, as towering Senators of the past, John Chafee, a \npragmatist, a moderate, a man of sound judgment and good sense, worked \nto cool the partisan passions in this body and led his colleagues of \nboth parties toward common ground.\n  He was one of those Members to whom Senators looked for advice and \nfor leadership on the host of issues in which he was an expert--health \nissues, environmental issues, transportation, and many issues where he \nwas one of the most knowledgeable and effective leaders of this body.\n  He brought to this body an experience which was invaluable, as a \nmarine, a war hero in two wars, and in the legislative battles of the \nSenate. One frequently sensed in John Chafee the kind of quiet self-\nconfidence and steady determination of somebody who had survived real \ncombat.\n  John Chafee was direct. He was without guile. He did not posture as \nhe ambled about this body. He just talked straight and let his friends \nand his colleagues know what was on his mind and asked how he might be \nhelpful.\n  There were no hidden agendas with John Chafee--just a \nstraightforward, good-natured, decent and kind human being who cared \ndeeply about the people of Rhode Island and of this Nation and who \nshared everything he had with us and with this Nation.\n  I visited often with John Chafee in his office, going there for \nadvice to try to gather from him some of the wisdom which he had \ngathered over the years.\n  I shall miss, as will every Member of this body, his shy smile, his \nspecial integrity. He left an indelible mark on our hearts. I don't \nknow whether his name is carved yet in that desk which has the flowers \nupon it. But he left a very deep mark on all of our hearts, on all of \nour souls, and on all of our spirits.\n  We can only hope his family takes comfort in the certain knowledge \nthat John Chafee will be missed by a legion of friends, by all of his \ncolleagues, and we will be sustained by his memory, by his integrity, \nby his character, and by his good nature.\n  As long as we serve in the Senate, every one of us who had the honor \nand privilege of serving with John Chafee will remember him in a very \nspecial way.\n  Again, I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/28/senate-section/article/S13490-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
