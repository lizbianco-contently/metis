I rise to thank Father Chad Hatfield of the All Saints \nOrthodox Church, Salina, KS, for his encouraging words. Today, it is \nappropriate to honor this man of God by describing his service to the \npeople of Kansas.\n\n  Father Hatfield has served faithfully in the ministry for over 20 \nyears and is presently the senior pastor of an Eastern Orthodox \ncongregation. Before settling in Kansas, he lived in several places \nincluding South Africa during far more difficult days. His duties \nincluded ministering as well as editing a South African theological \njournal. He became an ordained Orthodox priest in January 1994, after \nseveral years in the Episcopal Church.\n  He is a respected theologian, as well as a man of deep faith whose \ntalent lies in pointing people to a relationship with God. He is known \nfor his special events for those exploring Christian Orthodoxy, and \nmany in his congregation are new converts because of his witness.\n  I hope my words capture his strength and wisdom. This is a man who \nhas dedicated himself to the people of his parish, not because it was \nhis job but because they are his flock. His is the work of opening \nGodly mysteries, while serving the needs of those in his community. He \nis a servant to those in trouble involving the persecuted church \noverseas, youth violence at home, reducing teen pregnancy, preserving \nmarriages, and helping promote such projects as Faith Works of Kansas \nwhich links needy families with churches to help people get back on \ntheir feet. His is the work of a true shepherd, and it is work which \nsurely will remain.\n  The Bible says in Psalm 119:105, ``Thy word is a lamp to my feet and \na light to my path.'' Mr. President, I hope you join me in thanking \nFather Hatfield for his prayer and lighting our path for this day.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/14/senate-section/article/S12565-6", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Senate will now proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. 2561, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     2561, have agreed to recommend and do\n\n[[Page S12566]]\n\n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 8, 1999.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 50 \nminutes of debate equally divided, with an additional 10 minutes under \nthe control of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday the House passed the conference \nreport which is before the Senate which accompanies H.R. 2561, which is \nthe fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. It \npassed by a vote of 372-55. All 17 Senate conferees signed this \nconference report which Senator Inouye and I present to the Senate \ntoday.\n  This conference report reflects nearly 4 weeks of discussions and \nnegotiations with the House committee. The conference report before the \nSenate is consistent with the bill passed by the Senate in June and the \narmed services conference report passed recently and signed by the \nPresident.\n  In most areas, we established a compromise figure between the House \nand Senate levels.\n  The excellent work undertaken by the Armed Services Committee \nprovided an essential roadmap and guide for the work of our conference \non most major programs.\n  The first priority of our conference was to ensure adequate funding \nfor military personnel, including the 4.8-percent pay raise for the \nfiscal year 2000. Funding was also provided to implement the \nrestoration of full retirement benefits for military personnel and new \nretention and enlistment bonuses to attract and retain military \npersonnel.\n  The conferees worked to increase needed spending for military \nreadiness and quality of life priorities. More than $1 billion has been \nadded to the President's request for operation and maintenance in the \nDepartment of Defense to make certain the Armed Forces are prepared to \nmeet any challenge to our Nation's security.\n  The conferees faced wide gaps between modernization programs \nadvocated by the House and Senate. This is the first year of many years \nwe have had such major disagreements.\n  The Senate sustained the Department's request for several multiyear \nprocurement initiatives which included the Apache, the Javelin, the F-\n18, C-17, and the M-1 tank. I am pleased to report each of these are \nincluded in the conference report before the Senate today. Those \nmultiyear contracts, in our opinion, do give us better procurement at a \nlower cost.\n  The Senate included funds to meet the Marine Corps commandant's \nforemost priority, the LHD-8 amphibious assault ship. There is $375 \nmillion provided for that vessel at the authorized level.\n  Considerable media attention was focused on the action by the House \nto delete all procurement funding for the F-22. Consistent with the \ndecision in the defense authorization bill, Senate conferees insisted \nthat adequate funding be appropriated for the F-22.\n  Also, legislative authority was provided to execute the existing \nfixed-price contract for the first eight preproduction aircraft.\n  The conference outcome provides funds to sustain the F-22 program at \nthe proposed production rates, with full advanced procurement for the \n10 aircraft planned for the fiscal year 2001.\n  Legislative restrictions on those funds do mandate that during the \nfiscal year 2000, the Department meet its planned review thresholds. We \nare confident that will take place.\n  Language concerning the fiscal year 2001 contract awards by necessity \nwill have to be reconsidered as part of the fiscal year 2001 bill, as \nthis act does not govern appropriations after September 30 of next \nyear.\n  The most important research and development program supported in this \nact is the national missile defense effort. The successful intercept \ntest last week validates the work since 1983 to build and deploy an \neffective national missile defense system.\n  This conference report before the Senate allocates an additional $117 \nmillion from the 1999 omnibus bill to keep this program on track and to \naccelerate deployment as soon as practical.\n  The bill also provides funding for the Third Arrow Battery to assist \nour ally, Israel, in meeting its security needs. When the committee \nreported the defense bill to the Senate in May, Congress had just \npassed an $11 billion supplemental bill to meet the costs of the \nconflict in Kosovo.\n  As a result of the exceptional performance of our air and naval \nforces during that campaign, hostilities ended months earlier than \nprojected in the supplemental bill. That effort afforded the Senate the \noption to apply those funds from the supplemental bill appropriated for \nKosovo to meet the fiscal year 2000 defense needs. This bill utilized \n$3.1 billion in Kosovo carryover funds as it left the Senate. Based on \nextensive consultation with the Department of Defense, the conferees \nagreed to apply $1.6 billion of that sum to meet vital readiness and \nmunitions needs for the fiscal year 2000.\n  Finally, the bill includes two new general provisions that place new \nmaximum averages on defense contract payments. These provisions do not \nreduce in any way the amount the Department will pay to meet its \nobligations but does change the maximum number of days by which such \npayments must be made.\n  The Department must remain fully compliant with the Prompt Payment \nAct, and nothing was done in this act to extend payments beyond current \nlegal limits.\n  As I have observed over the past 5 years, the work of presenting this \nbill and the conference report now before the Senate reflects a total \npartnership between myself and my great friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Hawaii. His wisdom, perseverance, and steadfast \ndetermination to work for the welfare of the men and women of our Armed \nForces and the military preparedness of our Nation assured the \nnonpartisan result of this conference.\n  This bill also contains a provision to commence the formation of a \ncommission to find a suitable national memorial to our former \nPresident, the distinguished general of the Army, President Eisenhower. \nI urge all Members become familiar with that process. It very much \nfollows the commission that was established for a similar memorial to \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  Following the statement of my good friend from Hawaii, to whom I now \nyield, I shall urge adoption of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise this morning to add my support to \nH.R. 2561, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year \n2000. I believe the conference report presents an agreement that is \nvery much in keeping with the bill that passed the Senate and I would \nencourage all my colleagues to support it.\n  This was a tough conference. That is an understatement. The \nrecommendations of the House and the Senate were different in many \nareas. Both sides felt strongly about their respective views. As noted \nby my chairman, nowhere was this more evident than in the case of the \nF-22. For that reason, and because of the importance of this program, I \nwould like to spend a few minutes discussing the situation facing the \nconferees and the final outcome.\n  For 16 years, the Air Force has been researching and developing a new \ngeneration air superiority aircraft, called the F-22. The \nadministration's budget request called for the aircraft to enter \nproduction in fiscal year 2000.\n  The House was divided in its view on this matter. The Defense \nauthorization bill, as passed by the House and the conference agreement \nwhich followed, supported the program without adjustment. The House \nAppropriations Committee took a different view.\n  The committee recommended, and the House concurred in the Defense \nappropriations bill, that production should be ``paused'' for at least \n1 year to allow for additional testing. The House eliminated all \nproduction funding for the program--an amount in excess of $1.8 \nbillion--and reallocated these funds to other programs. Many of these \nwere very meritorious, but they were lower priority in the view of the \nDefense Department.\n\n[[Page S12567]]\n\n  The Senate fully supported the F-22 as requested and authorized. In \nconference, the House was adamant that production should not begin this \nyear. The Senate understood the House's desire for additional testing \non the program, but pointed out repeatedly that there was nothing in \nthe initial phases of this program that would warrant slowing it down \nto await additional testing. In addition, the Senate voted that a pause \nwould be very costly. Contracts would have to be renegotiated. \nSubcontractors expecting to begin production would have to stop work on \nthe project. Restarting it would be costly even if the pause were only \nto last 1 year.\n  The F-22 is a highly sophisticated new aircraft with revolutionary \ncapabilities. Those facts are not in dispute. But, these capabilities \nmake it a very expensive program. The Senate conferees were concerned \nadditional costs caused by delays would be so large as to force the \nDefense Department to cut or even cancel the program. It is ironic that \nafter 16 years just when we are ready to begin production that some \nwould now argue it was time to slow down the program. The differences \nbetween the two bodies were so strongly felt that it was extremely \ndifficult to reach an agreement.\n  Finally, our chairman, acting with the advice of the leadership of \nthe Defense Department, crafted a compromise that all parties embraced. \nThe compromise provides $1.3 billion for the F-22. I for one would like \nto have seen more provided for this program, but that was the maximum \nto which the House would agree.\n  We have been told by the Air Force that this sum is sufficient to \nallow for the program to stay on track in the coming year. The \nconferees understand that the funds will be merged with other research \nand development funding to allow the Air Force to purchase another six \nF-22 aircraft as planned. It will also allow the Air Force to buy \nmaterials to produce 10 additional aircraft in fiscal year 2001.\n  There is language in the agreement that requires the Air Force to get \napproval from the Defense Acquisition Board before proceeding to \npurchase these aircraft. There is also language that would require the \nAir Force to complete certain testing before it purchases aircraft in \n2001. However, that language, as noted by our chairman, would not have \nany effect until after the expiration of this act.\n  The conferees believe the Air Force should conduct adequate testing \nof the aircraft before it goes into full rate production. The precise \nlevel of that testing is an issue to be reexamined at a later date.\n  The Senate owes a debt of gratitude--a great debt of gratitude--to \nour chairman, Senator Stevens. This was a tough conference. Our \nchairman was up to the task of defending the positions of the Senate. \nAt the same time, he was most respectful of the views of the House. He \nworked tirelessly to try to reach an accommodation on this, as well as \nhundreds of other items.\n  A second matter that requires clarification is the overall spending \nin this bill. The Senate bill provided $264.7 billion in budget \nauthority, with the estimated outlays of $255.4 billion. The House bill \nwas nearly $4 billion higher.\n  In conference, the Senate agreed to increase the spending by $3.1 \nbillion in budget authority and $200 million in outlays. The conferees \nalso agreed to label $7.2 billion in budget authority as emergency \nspending. In so doing, the committee was able to reallocate $4.1 \nbillion more than the original Senate allocation and $8.1 billion more \nthan the House allocation for other discretionary domestic programs.\n  Many have stated that this bill is more than $17 billion above the \namount recommended in fiscal year 1999. However, it should be noted \nthat the Congress added $16.6 billion for Kosovo, Bosnia, and other \nemergency requirements in fiscal year 1999 that are not included in \nthat calculation.\n  In comparing ``apples to apples,'' this bill is a little over $1 \nbillion more than provided in fiscal year 1999. I, for one, would argue \nthat this increase is very modest for the coming year. Especially when \none realizes we have provided funding for an expanded pay raise, an \nenhanced retirement system, and additional target pay increases for \nmany members of the military, this increase is very modest, indeed.\n  This is a good conference report. While one can find one or two \nthings one might not support, on balance I believe it is a good \ncompromise package. So I most respectfully urge all my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  In closing, I would like to give a word of commendation for two \nmembers who are not Members of the Senate, but we think they are \nmembers of our family: Steve Cortese and, this man, Charlie Houy. So, \nMr. President, with the help of these two special staff members, we \nwere able to craft this agreement we present today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand under the unanimous-consent agreement I have \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I voted in support of the Defense \nauthorization bill for the fiscal year that began earlier this month. I \nwould have liked to have been able to similarly support the Defense \nappropriations bill. Unfortunately, the unconscionable and noncredible \nbudgeting procedures that are used in this bill are too pervasive, the \nlevel of wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars is too irresponsible for \nme to acquiesce in passage of this legislation.\n  I look at this bill that is larded with earmarks and set-asides for \npowerful defense contractors, influential local groups and officials, \nand with other parochial interests. One can understand the distrust \nwith which the average citizen views the Federal government. The use of \ngimmicks and budgetary subterfuge simply deepens the gulf that exists \nbetween those of us who toil within the confines of the Beltway, and \nAmericans across the Nation who see large portions of their paychecks \ndiverted by Congress for purposes they often do not support.\n  What kind of message are we sending American business men and women, \nespecially the small businesses most affected by telling the Department \nof Defense to purposely delay paying its bills? When the Department of \nDefense fails to pay contractors on time, those contractors often have \nto tell their suppliers, subcontractors, and employees that they will \nhave to wait for their check. The trickle-down effect is felt most by \nthe employees and their families whose budgets often can't absorb a \ndelay of a week in getting a paycheck, much less the 29-day delay \nmandated by this bill.\n  This provision simply pushes off until the next fiscal year the bills \nthat come due in the last month of this fiscal year. Does anyone in \nthis body believe that it will be any easier next year to live within \nthe budget caps? It will be more difficult because, by approving this \ngimmick, we are spending $2 billion of next year's available funding. \nIn fact, we already pushed another $6 billion into the next fiscal year \nby ``forward funding'' programs in the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill. \nIn total, we will have already spent $8 billion out of next year's \nbudget cap before taking up a single fiscal year 2001 appropriations \nbill.\n  And how can we explain the categorization of $2.7 billion for normal, \npredictable operations, training, and maintenance funding as \n``emergency'' spending? Obviously, ongoing operations around the world \ncost money, as does necessary training as well as maintaining the \nadmittedly bloated infrastructure of the Department of Defense. None of \nthis should come as a surprise to the appropriators, and thus, in my \nview, cannot be justified as ``emergency'' spending, other than as a \nclear manifestation of an effort to evade budget caps.\n  This $7.2 billion will come straight out of the budget surplus that \nthe Congress promised just a few months ago to return to the American \ntaxpayers. Together with the ever-increasing $8.7 billion in \n``emergency'' farm aid--some of which is admittedly justifiable--we \nwill have already spent the entire non-Social Security surplus, and \neven a few billion of the Social Security Trust Fund. How can we vote--\nnot once but four times--to put a ``lockbox'' on the Social Security \nsurplus and then turn right around and spend it without blinking an \neye?\n  At the same time, we are funding ships and aircraft and research \nprograms that were not requested by the\n\n[[Page S12568]]\n\nmilitary, and in fact do not even appear on the ever-expanding Unfunded \nRequirements Lists, the integrity of which have been thoroughly \nundermined by pressures from this body.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes $6.4 billion in low-priority, \nwasteful spending not subject to the kind of deliberative, competitive \nprocess that we should demand of all items in spending bills. Six \nbillion dollars--more than ever before in any defense bill in the 13 \nyears I have been in this body.\n  Argue all you want about the merits of individual programs that were \nadded at the request of interested Members. At the end of the day, \nthere is over $6 billion worth of pork in a defense spending bill at \nthe same time we are struggling with myriad readiness and modernization \nproblems. No credible budget process can withstand such abuse \nindefinitely and still retain the level of legitimacy needed to \nproperly represent the interests of the Nation as a whole.\n\n  The ingenuity of the appropriators never ceases to amaze me. In this \ndefense bill, we are spending money on unrequested research and \ndevelopment projects like the $3 million for advanced food service \ntechnology and on activities totally unrelated to national defense, \nsuch as the $8 million in the budget for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard \nResource Preservation.\n  These items are representative of the bulk of the pork-barrel \nspending that is inserted into spending bills for parochial reasons: \nhundreds of small items or activities totaling hundreds of millions of \ndollars. Combine them with the big-ticket items in the bill--like the \n11 Blackhawk helicopters at a cost of over $100 million; the $375 \nmillion in long-lead funding for another amphibious assault ship; and \nthe $275 million for F-15 aircraft above the $263 million in the budget \nrequest--and you have a major investment in special interest goodwill \nat the expense of broader national security considerations. Two of \nthese programs, the amphibious assault ship and the Blackhawk \nhelicopters, are specifically mentioned in the Secretary of Defense's \nletter to the chairmen of the Senate and House Appropriations \nCommittees as diverting funds from ``Much higher priority needs * * *''\n  How long are we going to continue to acquiesce in the forced \nacquisition of security locks just because they are manufactured in the \nstate that was represented by a very powerful former member of this \nbody? Making a bad situation worse, we have extended the requirement \nthat one particular company's product be purchased for government-owned \nfacilities to also include the contractors that serve them, and \nearmarked another $10 million for that purpose. What's next? Are we \ngoing to mandate that these locks be used for the bicycles of children \nof defense contractors?\n  Another distasteful budget sleight of hand was the addition of 15 \nmilitary construction projects totaling $92 million that were neither \nrequested nor authorized. The Appropriations Conference took care of \nthat, however. These projects are both authorized and fully funded in \nthe Conference Report, calling into question the relevance of the \ndefense authorizing committees in the House of Representatives and the \nSenate.\n\n  As someone who is concerned that the Navy, by design, will lack the \nmeans of supporting ground forces ashore with high-volume, high-impact \nnaval gunfire for at least another 10 years, I am more than a little \ntaken aback that the California delegation has placed a higher priority \non accumulating tourist dollars than on preserving one of the last two \nbattleships in the fleet. The $3 million earmarked for relocating the \nU.S.S. Iowa represents a particularly pernicious episode of giving \nhigher priority to bringing home the bacon than to national security \ninterests. Simplistic platitudes regarding the age of these ships \naside, no one can deny that they continue to represent one of the most \ncapable non-nuclear platforms in the arsenal. But, yes, they do make \nfine museums.\n  Also discouraging is the growing use of domestic source restrictions \non the acquisition of defense items. The Defense Appropriations \nConference Report is replete with so-called ``Buy American'' \nrestrictions, every one of which serves solely to protect businesses \nfrom competition. The use of protectionist legislation to insulate \ndomestic industry from competition not only deprives the American \nconsumer of the best product at the lowest price, it deprives the \nAmerican taxpayer of the best value for his or her tax dollar. It \nundermines alliance relations while we are encouraging friendly \ncountries to ``buy American.'' As Secretary Cohen stated, such \nrestrictions ``undermine DoD's ability to procure the best systems at \nthe least cost and to advance highly beneficial armaments cooperation \nwith our allies.''\n  Mr. President, our military personnel will not fail to notice that, \nwhile we are spending inordinate amounts of money on programs and \nactivities not requested by the armed forces, we rejected a proposal to \nget 12,000 military families off food stamps. That is not a message \nwith which I wish to be associated. This bill appropriates $2.5 \nmillion, at the insistence of the opposition of the House, not one \npenny to get the children of military personnel currently on food \nstamps off of them. The cost of the provision I sponsored in the \ndefense authorization bill was $6 million per year to permanently \nremove 10,000 military families from the food stamp rolls. Yet those \nwho fought hard to defeat that measure have no problem finding hundreds \nof millions of dollars to take care of businesses important to their \ndistricts and campaigns.\n  This conference report represents everything those of us in the \nmajority were supposed to be against. We weren't supposed to be the \nparty that, when it came to power, would abuse the Congressional power \nof the purse because we couldn't restrain ourselves from bowing to the \nspecial interests that ask us to spend billions of dollars on projects \nthat benefit them, not the nation as a whole.\n  We were supposed to be the pro-defense party, the party that gave \nhighest priority to ensuring our national security and the readiness of \nour Armed Forces. We weren't supposed to be the party that wastes $6.4 \nbillion on low-priority, wasteful, and unnecessary spending of scarce \ndefense resources.\n  Our Armed Forces are the best in the world, but there is much that \nmust be done to complete their restructuring, retraining, and re-\nequipping to meet the challenges of the future. I support a larger \ndefense budget but I know that, if we eliminate pork-barrel spending \nfrom the defense budget, we can modernize our military without adding \nto the overall budget. Every year, Congress earmarks about $4 to 6 \nbillion for wasteful, unnecessary, and low-priority projects that do \nlittle or nothing to support our military. Because Congress refuses to \nallow unneeded bases to be closed, the Pentagon wastes another $7 \nbillion per year to maintain this excess infrastructure. If we \nprivatized or consolidated support and depot maintenance activities, we \ncould save $2 billion every year. And if we eliminated the anti-\ncompetitive ``Buy America'' provisions from law, we could save another \n$5.5 billion every year on defense contracts. Altogether, these common-\nsense proposals would free up over $20 billion every year in the \ndefense budget that could be used to provide adequate pay and ensure \nappropriate quality of life for our military personnel and their \nfamilies; pay for needed training and modern equipment for our forces; \nand pay for other high-priority defense needs, like an effective \nnational missile defense system.\n  Instead, the Congress continues to squander scarce defense dollars, \nwhile nearly 12,000 of the men and women who protect our nation's \nsecurity, and their families, must subsist on food stamps. It is a \nnational disgrace.\n  Moral indignation serves little practical purpose in the Halls of \nCongress. In the end, we are what we are: politicians more concerned \nwith parochial matters than with broader considerations of national \nsecurity and fiscal responsibility. I do not like voting against the \nbill that funds the Department of Defense, not while we have pilots \npatrolling the skies over Iraq and troops enforcing the peace on the \nKorean peninsula and in such places as Bosnia, Kosovo and even East \nTimor.\n  However, I cannot support this defense bill. It is so full of \nwasteful spending and smoke and mirrors gimmickry that what good lies \nwithin is overwhelmed by the bad. It wastes billions of dollars on \nunnecessary programs, while revitalizing discredited budgeting \npractices. Those of us in the\n\n[[Page S12569]]\n\nmajority correctly rejected the Administration's ill-considered attempt \nto incrementally fund military construction projects--but now we are \nproceeding to institutionalize budgeting practices that warrant even \ngreater contempt.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.\n  Mr. President, the list of add-ons, increases, and earmarks that \ntotal $6.4 billion, can be found on my web site.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know of nothing in this bill that deals \nwith the food stamp issue. I don't understand the remarks of the \nSenator from Arizona. There is a 4.8 percent pay raise in this bill. We \ndid exceed the President's request for the purpose of trying to make \ncertain that all members of the armed services have sufficient funds \nwith which to live. I know of no issue in this bill that deals with \nfood stamps for service people. There are people in the service who are \neligible for food stamps because of their own economic circumstances. \nThat is very unfortunate. We are trying to work out a system whereby \nthat will not happen. One of the ways to do that is to continue to \nincrease the pay so they are comparable with people in the private \nsector and the jobs that they perform.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Florida, \nMr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak, as I did yesterday, on the latest \nappropriations conference report. Yesterday I expressed my concern \nabout the Agriculture conference report, which contained within it $8.7 \nbillion of designated emergency spending. Adding that $8.7 billion to \n$7 billion, which has previously been designated as an emergency, we \nhave now spent almost $16 billion of the $21 billion that was \noriginally estimated to be available as the non-Social Security \nsurplus.\n  We are clearly on the path of exhausting the non-Social Security \nsurplus in a series of incremental decisions, without focusing on how \nwe might use this opportunity of significant surplus for fundamental \nnational policy issues. This legislation contains an additional \nexpenditure of emergency funds in the amount of $7.2 billion. With the \nadoption of this conference report, we will have fully exhausted the \nnon-Social Security surplus and probably will also begin to lap into \nthe Social Security surplus.\n  Mr. President, there was an interesting quotation in the press within \nthe last 2 weeks by a leading figure in the German Government in 1991. \nHe talked about missed opportunities and said that Germany, in 1991, as \npart of reunification, had a national opportunity to deal with some of \ntheir fundamental problems which would have built a stronger nation for \nthe 21st century. But he went on to say: We promised the nation we \ncould do reunification without pain; therefore, we were unable or \nunwilling to ask the country to take those steps that would have built \na stronger Germany for the 21st century.\n  I regretfully say that I believe we are ``in 1991''; we are not in \nGermany, we are in the United States of America, and we are missing a \nsimilar opportunity to take some important steps that will strengthen \nour Nation, for precisely the same reason: We are unwilling to tell the \nAmerican people the truth of what we are about, what the consequences \nare in terms of missed opportunities, and we are attempting to hide all \nof this under a cascading number of gimmicks and unique accounting. In \nmy judgment, this Defense appropriations conference report adds to that \nbook another significant chapter which will make it more difficult for \nus to deal with Social Security solvency, Medicare reform, and debt \nreduction--three priority issues challenging America.\n  What are some of the items in this Defense appropriations bill that \nraise those concerns? I have mentioned $7.2 billion listed as an \nemergency. What are the emergencies? Things such as routine operation \nand maintenance. Since the Bush administration, we have operated under \na definition of what an emergency is which states that an emergency \nshall be ``spending which is necessary, sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and \nnot permanent.'' Those five standards were developed by President Bush, \nnot the current administration. Those are the five standards to which \nthis Congress has adhered. How can anyone declare that operation and \nmaintenance in the Department of Defense is not permanent, is \nunforeseen, and is a sudden and urgent condition?\n  Beyond that, we are also slowing payments to contractors in order to \nmove $1.2 billion of those costs out of the fiscal year in which we are \ncurrently operating into fiscal year 2001. We are advance appropriating \n$1.8 billion for the same purpose. We are offsetting $2.6 billion of \nthis bill's cost by assuming the same level of proceeds from spectrum \nauction sales. This bill relies upon a direction that has been given to \nCBO to change the manner in which CBO estimates outlays so that $10.5 \nbillion will occur after fiscal year 2000.\n  I am about to leave for a meeting of the Finance Committee, and there \nis going to be an effort made there to overturn a congressional statute \nby directing the administration, through the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, to change the method by which Medicare providers are \ncompensated in order to increase spending to those providers by an \nexcess of $5 billion--a violation of congressional statute, a timidity \nof Congress to deal with changing that statute, with the consequence \nthat we are going to take over $5 billion off budget but directly out \nof Social Security surplus.\n  So I regret, as my colleague from Arizona did, I will have to vote \n``no'' on this legislation. But while recognizing the extreme \nimportance of the national defense that is funded through this \nlegislation, I believe it is also important that we exercise fiscal \ndiscipline and that we not commit ourselves to a pattern of accounting \nand budgetary devices which obscures the reality of what we are doing, \nwhich denies us the opportunity to use this rare opportunity of surplus \nto build a stronger America for the 21st century, and which I think \nfails to face the reality of what our long-term commitments are going \nto have to be to secure our national defense.\n  So I regret my inability to support this legislation. I hope this \nwill be a brief period in our American fiscal policy history and that \nbefore we complete the calendar year 1999, we will have an opportunity \nto revisit these issues with that higher standard of directness to the \nAmerican people and a greater sense of importance of our protecting \nthis rare period of fiscal strength and surplus, and we have to assure \nthat America deals with its priorities as we enter the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. While the Senator from Florida is here, I want to point \nout that we did use the spectrum concept in this bill. It was the \nadministration that recommended that approach to the Congress, and we \ndecided to use it in this bill.\n  Regarding the comments made both by the Senator from Florida and the \nSenator from Arizona about the payment schedule set forth in this bill, \nCongress had previously required the Department of Defense to pay \nsooner than required by the Prompt Payment Act. We have not reduced the \namount of payments to be made to defense contractors; we have not \nchanged, in any way, the contracts between those contractors and the \nUnited States. All we have said is the Department of Defense does not \nhave to pay earlier than required by the Prompt Payment Act. It was the \nmandate to pay earlier that was causing a scoring problem, as far as \nthe Department of Defense activities are concerned.\n  As a practical matter, what this does is deal with the average number \nof days within which payments are required under defense contracts. \nThere is no reduction in the amount of money that would be spent, and \nthere is no acceleration or deceleration of the rate at which it is to \nbe spent; there is just no mandate that they have to pay sooner than is \nrequired by the Prompt Payment Act. Under the circumstances, we have \nnot varied the\n\n[[Page S12570]]\n\namount of money that would be spent for these contracts within fiscal \nyear 2000; we have just not mandated that they be spent sooner than \nwould otherwise be required by normal, sound business practices.\n  Having done so, we are dealing with the scoring mechanisms that apply \nto this bill, not how the payments are made to contractors. I do \nbelieve that the comments that have been made concerning the scoring \nmechanisms under this bill do not recognize the fact that it is \nextremely necessary for us to pursue ways in which we can assure the \nmoneys are available to the Department of Defense, notwithstanding the \nextraordinary burdens we faced in this subcommittee on defense coming \nfrom the increased activities in South Korea, increased activities in \nthe Persian Gulf, permanent personnel stationed in both Kuwait and \nSaudi Arabia, from the activities in Bosnia--and we still have forces \nin Bosnia, and now in Kosovo; we have permanent forces now in Kosovo. \nAll of those forces and activities have required enormous funding. We \nstill have forces in Haiti.\n  Under the circumstances, all of these extraordinary burdens on the \nDepartment of Defense require us to find ways in which we can assure \nmoney is there for modernization, maintenance, for increased pay to our \npeople, and for assuring that we will continue with the research and \ndevelopment necessary to assure that this Nation will have a viable \nDepartment of Defense in the next century.\n  I do not deny that there are things in here with which people could \ndisagree. I only wish they had tried to understand them. I would be \nperfectly willing to have any of them visit with us any time if they \ncan show us that we have underfunded the Department of Defense. We have \nadequately funded the Department of Defense, and that was our \nintention. It was our intention to use every possible legal mechanism \navailable to us to assure that there is more money available for the \nDepartment of Defense in the coming year in view of the strains that we \nhave on the whole system because of these contingencies that we have \nfinanced in the past 3 to 4 years.\n  This has been an extraordinary period for the Department of Defense. \nI can think of only one instance where we received a request from the \nadministration to budget for those extraordinary expenses. We have had \nto find the money, we found the money, and we have kept the Department \nof Defense funded.\n  I, for one, want to thank my good friend from Hawaii for his \nextraordinary friendship and capability in helping on that job. I say \nwithout any fear of being challenged on this, I would challenge any \nother two Members of the Senate to find ways to do this better than the \ntwo of us have done it.\n  I, without any question, recommend this bill to the Senate. Those who \nwish to vote against it, of course, have the right to do so. But a vote \nagainst this bill is a vote to not fund the Department of Defense \nproperly in the coming year. If you want to nitpick this bill, you can.\n  The process of putting it together was the most extraordinary process \nI have gone through in 31 years. I don't want to go through a \nconference like that again. And I assure the Senate that we will not.\n\n\n commercial satellite imagery and ground stations to the u.s. military\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Can the Senator from Michigan discuss the importance of \nthis bill regarding commercial satellite imagery and ground stations to \nU.S. military?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The funding provided in this bill for Eagle Vision \nmobile ground stations enables reception of additional commercial high-\nresolution satellite imagery sources and is critical to supporting our \nmilitary forces in peace time and in war. The currently deployed system \nhas proven its worth in U.S. military activities in Bosnia and Kosovo. \nIt has helped our pilots better prepare for critical missions, while \nproviding an extra measure of safety and security for our fighting men \nand women as they head into harm's way.\n  Mr. BURNS. I have heard that the National Reconnaissance Office has \nrecently completed an improved mobile ground station. I believe that it \nwas built for receiving high-resolution commercial satellite imagery, \nsuch as the recently launched Ikonos satellite that is owned by Space \nImaging. Is that correct?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. The most recently deployed Eagle Vision II mobile \nground station has been fielded by the National Reconnaissance Office \nfor use by the U.S. Army. It is a much improved system with even \ngreater capability than the original Eagle Vision System built in 1995. \nIts enhanced mobility ensures rapid deployment and survivability, which \nis critical in meeting the current threats facing our military around \nthe world. I am proud that a company from my state (ERIM International) \nhas been the leader in developing and building this Eagle Vision mobile \nground station capability.\n  The funding in this bill has been sought and provided to ensure that \nadditional Eagle Vision systems will be built with state-of-the art \nmobile capabilities to meet the critical imagery needs of our \nwarfighters in the future. This is an outstanding example of how \nAmerican firms can effectively work in partnership with the U.S. \nmilitary to provide state-of-the-art technology to protect our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                              Section 8160\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my dear friend, \nChairman Stevens, and the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Byrd, for bringing to the floor a conference report \nthat I know was reached through very difficult negotiations.\n  There is no doubt that the conference on the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense \nAppropriations Bill was the most contentious in recent history. As the \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee, I am aware of the difficult \ndecisions that had to be made to reach a consensus with the House, and \nI will vote in favor of the conference report.\n  Despite my over all support of this conference report, I must point \nout one provision in the bill that is fraught with danger. That \nprovision is section 8160 which states: ``Not withstanding any other \nprovision of law, all military construction projects for which funds \nwere appropriated in Public Law 106-52 are hereby authorized.'' As all \nmy colleagues are aware the Armed Services Committee has original \njurisdiction for military construction and authorizes for \nappropriations each military construction project. In fact, the law \nrequires that each military construction and military family housing \nconstruction project be both authorized and appropriated. The projects \nauthorized in this conference report were not authorized in either the \nSenate or House Authorization Bills. The act of authorizing military \nconstruction projects in this conference report has a profound impact \non the legislative process.\n  Senator Stevens and I work closely in developing our respective \nbills. We have directed our staffs to share information and resolve \ndifferences in the bills before the Senate considers them. In fact, \nChairman Stevens commented in his floor statement on the Fiscal Year \n2000 Defense Appropriations Bill that his bill mirrors closely the \nactions of the Armed Services Committee. This conference report is not \nconsistent with that cooperation. It usurps the jurisdiction of the \nArmed Services Committee and may set a terrible precedent.\n  While the rules of the Senate do not allow us to correct this in this \nbill, I trust that Chairman Stevens will acknowledge the jurisdiction \nof the Armed Services Committee over these matters and provide us his \nassurance that this conference report does not set a precedent and that \nmilitary construction and military family housing projects will not be \nauthorized in future appropriations bills.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand Senator Warner's concerns \nand appreciate his support for the conference report. As the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee indicated, this \nwas a very difficult conference. In order to assure the Senate's \nposition on the most important national security issues, we agreed to \nother provisions that the Senate conferees would normally oppose. I \nassure my colleague that I respect the jurisdiction of the Armed \nServices Committee in these matters. I agreed to authorize the military \nconstruction projects only because it was\n\n[[Page S12571]]\n\nnecessary to reach a final agreement. In my view, these actions do not \nset any precedent for future actions on appropriations bills. It is my \nhope and intention that this will not happen again in the future.\n  Mr. WARNER. I appreciate the assurance of my colleague and thank him \nfor addressing this matter.\n\n\n                              section 8008\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFY 2000 contains a provision allowing the Navy to apply up to $190 \nmillion in FY 2000 advanced procurement funding to the DDG-51 multiyear \nprocurement contracts renewed by Section 122 of the same legislation.\n  Are my colleagues, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the \nMajority Leader, and the senior Senator from Mississippi, aware of any \nprovision of the FY 2000 Defense Appropriations Conference Report that \nconflicts with Section 122 of the FY 2000 National Defense \nAuthorization Act?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I can tell the senior Senator from Maine \nthat no provisions of the FY 2000 Defense Appropriations Conference \nReport conflict with the DDG-51 multiyear procurement contracts \nextension or the $190 million DDG-51 FY 2000 advance procurement \nprovisions of Section 122 of the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of the senior \nSenator from Maine initiating this colloquy, and I concur with the \nstatement of the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I fully support the interpretation of my \ncolleagues from Maine, Alaska, and Mississippi. The Navy has cost-\neffectively produced the DDG-51 destroyer program under a very \nsuccessful multiyear procurement, and no provision of the Conference \nReport conflicts with Section 122 of the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank my colleagues for joining me in clarifying this \ncritical shipbuilding matter.\n\n\n                    india/pakistan sanctions waiver\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank Chairman \nStevens for his outstanding leadership during the long hours of debate \nleading to passage of the FY 2000 Defense appropriations bill. I \nespecially thank the chairman for supporting Title IX of the act which \npermanently grants the President waiver authority over sanctions \nimposed on India and Pakistan. American business, workers, and farmers \nappreciate your efforts on this important economic and foreign policy \nprovision.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am very pleased this conference report \nprovides the President permanent, comprehensive authority to waive, \nwith respect to India and Pakistan, the application of any sanction \ncontained in section 101 or 102 of the arms Export Control Act, section \n2(b)(4) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, or Section 620E(e) of \nthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. This authority provides \nneeded tools for the United States to be in a position to waive \nsanctions as developments may warrant in the coming months and years.\n\n\n                          digital mammography\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I commend Senator Stevens for his work on \nthe Defense Appropriations bill, and will support the passage of this \nlegislation. Before the final vote, I would like to get some \nclarification on the Defense Health Science program that is funded in \nthis bill. In the conference report, the Secretary of Defense in \nconjunction with the Surgeons General is to establish a process to \nselect medical research projects. I see that a number of possibilities \nare listed in the bill. Is it the Senator's intent that the Secretary \nof Defense and the service Surgeons General will consider the programs \nlisted in the conference report?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. One of the projects listed is digital mammography \ntechnology development. Advancing second generation imaging technology \nhas the potential of increasing efficiency, reliability and lower \ncosts, but would not be considered basic research. However, it seems \nappropriate that this type of project be reviewed. Is it the intent of \nthe committee that this type of research and development program be \nincluded in the selection process?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Since the Secretary and Surgeons General are charged \nwith setting up a peer reviewed process, it is up to them to determine \nthe specifics of the selection process. However, the Senator is correct \nthat many health benefits are a result from technology development. I \nexpect adjustments in the peer review process could be made, as \nappropriate, to delineate between basic research or technology \ndevelopment programs to account for differences as long as projects are \nin keeping with the ``clear scientific merit and relevance to military \nhealth'' requirement set forth in the report.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman for the clarification, and for his \nefforts to address military health issues.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I will vote for the Defense \nAppropriations Conference Report because there is much in it that I \nstrongly support, especially including funding for the essential pay \nand benefit improvements for our service men and women which had been \ncreated by the Defense Authorization bill. I will also cast an \naffirmative vote as a measure of my admiration and respect for the fine \nwork done by the Senate conferees, who were ably led by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Alaska and the distinguished senior \nSenator from Hawaii. Without the hard work of Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye I would likely have had to oppose the final product of \nthe conference.\n  The reason for my concern, and for my reluctant support for the \nDefense Appropriations Conference Report, is that, because of the \nadamant position of the House conferees, the conference report, in my \njudgment, seriously hampers the rational and cost-effective development \nand production of the Pentagon's highest-priority new weapons system, \nthe F-22 aircraft. The slow-down in production will undoubtedly result \nin increased costs and the House conferees indeed have indicated that \nthe final production level will likely have to be reduced to well below \nthe currently planned 339 aircraft which would precipitously drive up \nthe unit costs. The F-22, which has been under development for 16 years \nand has received close and ongoing testing and Congressional oversight, \nis absolutely critical to maintaining our air superiority into the 21st \nCentury.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Senators Stevens and Inouye for \nproducing the best result for the F-22 that could be obtained, given \nthe position of the House. While the compromise is an impediment to the \nF-22 program, it is not fatal, and with some extra effort, plus some \nshifting of Air Force funding, the delays and higher costs can be \nminimized. Nonetheless, I think all Members of the Senate, especially \nthe 56 other Senators who joined with Senator Coverdell and me in \nwriting to the conferees in support of the Senate's position on the F-\n22, must be on notice that we will face another, and perhaps even \ntougher, fight on the future of the F-22 next year and beyond.\n  In closing, I want to note that the work on this Defense \nAppropriations bill, and the preceding Defense Authorization bill has \nbeen marked by bipartisanship and pragmatism, resulting in the kind of \nnational consensus and resolve which is perhaps the single biggest \nfactor undergirding a nation's security. Unfortunately, this stands in \nstark contrast to what we saw yesterday, with the near-party line vote \nrejecting the Comprehensive Test Ban. I believe both parties bear some \nof the blame for that most unfortunate outcome. What I want to say \ntoday is that, beyond the Test Ban Treaty, beyond any specific dispute \nin national security policy, we in this body, as well as those in the \nHouse, and in the Executive Branch must, I repeat must, work to repair \nthe partisan breach, and begin to recreate a bipartisan consensus on \nnational security policy. I have some ideas along those lines which I \nwill be sharing with my colleagues in the days ahead, but I think we \ncan all take a lesson from the cooperative efforts of Senators Stevens \nand Inouye who have achieved that objective in the critical area of \nDefense Appropriations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the large increase in defense \nspending called for under the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense \nAppropriations bill. The final conference report increases defense \nspending by $17.3 billion over last year's bill--$7.2 billion of\n\n[[Page S12572]]\n\nwhich is declared as emergency spending and will come straight out of \nthe surplus. At a time when Congress is slashing many important \ndomestic programs, I cannot support an increase of this magnitude.\n  I do, however, want to express my strong support for the many good \nprovisions that were included in this legislation. This bill includes \nfunding for a needed pay raise of 4.8 percent for our military men and \nwomen and targeted bonuses to enhance recruitment and retention \nefforts. I was also pleased to see that the bill restores full \nretirement benefits for our personnel.\n  Nevertheless, I think it would have been possible to include these \nimportant provisions without substantially increasing the defense \nbudget. The Department of Defense need only to look within to find \nthese savings.\n  In January, the General Accounting Office found that auditors could \nnot match about $22 billion in signed checks with corresponding \nobligations; $9 billion in known military materials and supplies were \nunaccounted for; and contractors received $19 million in overpayments. \nIn April, a GAO study found that the Navy does not effectively control \nits in-transit inventory and has placed enormous amounts of inventory \nat risk of undetected theft or misplacement. For fiscal years 1996-98, \nthe Navy reported that it had lost over $3 billion in in-transit \ninventory, including some classified and sensitive items such as \naircraft guided missile launchers, night-vision devices, and \ncommunications equipment.\n  This bill also includes many unneeded items. In an effort to provide \nsome fiscal responsibility to the defense budget, I offered an \namendment to this bill that would have denied the Air Force the ability \nto lease six leather-seated Gulfstream executive jets for the regional \ncommanders in chief (CINCs). Even though the military has hundreds of \noperational support aircraft, the main argument against my amendment \nwas that leasing the Gulfstream jets would be cheaper than purchasing \nthe jet favored by the CINC's--the more expensive Boeing 737s.\n  However, the final conference report not only includes the authority \nto lease Gulfstream jets, it also includes a $63 million Boeing 737 for \nthe CINC of the Central Command. A recent article in Defense Week \nprovides the details on how this unrequested jet was added to the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, our men and women in the armed forces do a \ngreat job. From Kosovo to Korea, they prove that they are the best \nfighting force in the world. They deserve the pay raise and other \nimportant benefits that they have earned.\n  However, I cannot support the irresponsible spending that is included \nin this legislation and it is with regret that I must vote against it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      Sidestepping Bosses, Four Star General Lobbied for Jetliner\n\n                           (By John Donnelly)\n\n       The U.S. commander in the Middle East recently went over \n     the heads of his Pentagon bosses by persuading a key lawmaker \n     to buy the military a $63 million jetliner which the Pentagon \n     not only didn't request but explicitly opposed, Defense Week \n     has learned.\n       On several occasions over the last year, Marine Corps Gen. \n     Anthony Zinni told Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.) how U.S. Central \n     Command needs a new, bigger aircraft to replace the aging EC-\n     135 that now ferries Zinni and his staff between their Tampa, \n     Fla., headquarters and places such as Saudi Arabia and \n     Pakistan, according to Murtha's spokesman and several \n     congressional aides.\n       As a result, Murtha--the top Democrat on the House \n     Appropriations Committee's defense panel and, like Zinni, a \n     Marine--made sure money for a new Boeing 737-300 ER was \n     inserted in the fiscal 2000 funding bill the House passed \n     last July, Murtha's spokesman, Brad Clemenson, confirmed.\n       A four-star's advocacy of his command's needs, and a \n     congressman's generosity, may not be scandalous. In fact, \n     Zinni will have retired before the new plane arrives; and the \n     aircraft arguably may be needed. But the incident illustrates \n     one way the Pentagon's budget bloats: a general personally \n     lobbying for money--in this case one of the biggest boosts to \n     this year's Air Force procurement request--to buy a jet his \n     employers had already said costs too much.\n       No 737 for any commander was in the Senate-passed \n     appropriations bill or either the House- or Senate-passed \n     authorization bills. This month, a House-Senate conference is \n     scheduled to reconcile the two appropriations measures and \n     decide whether to buy the 737.\n       Zinni's spokesman said the general did not ask for the 737, \n     but only recounted his requirements in response to \n     congressional queries. But that picture of a passive Zinni \n     contrasts with those painted by numerous House officials, \n     including Clemenson, Murtha's spokesman.\n       ``Zinni did ask for the help, and Mr. Murtha was supportive \n     of the request . . .,'' Clemenson said. ``I don't know if he \n     asked specifically for [a 737-300 ER], but he asked for \n     help.''\n       In the form of a bigger support aircraft? ``Yes.''\n       By sharp contrast, last March, Deputy Secretary of Defense \n     John Hamre and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air \n     Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, in a study for Congress, said a \n     Gulfstream V executive jet, not a 737, is ``the single \n     aircraft most capable of performing the CINC [Commander in \n     Chief of unified combatant commands] support role at \n     significantly reduced costs. . . .''\n       The Joint Staff study conceded that Boeing 737-300 ERs \n     alone meet all the commanders' payload requirements, as the \n     chiefs themselves state them. But the report advocated the \n     Gulfstream V, designated C-37A, because the 737s cost twice \n     as much.\n       ``However,'' the study said, ``on a one-for-one basis, the \n     estimated 20-year total ownership cost . . . for the 737-300 \n     ER is about double that of the C-37A.''\n       If a commander needs a bigger airplane, the Joint Staff \n     said, then one can be provided from ``other DoD resources.''\n       What's more, the Pentagon's Hamre told Defense Week last \n     May how, in internal budget battles, he had fought hard to \n     overcome the regional commanders' desire for jets larger than \n     Gulfstreams to replace their aging fleet of nine aircraft, \n     mostly Boeing 707s. Hamre said he had to convince the 10 \n     generals and admirals (including the boss of the U.N. command \n     in Korea) that the Gulfstream Vs were adequate.\n       ``The CINCs aren't happy they have to live with a 12-\n     passenger aircraft,'' Hamre said of the Gulfstream Vs. Most \n     of the 707s the CINCs now fly seat 45. By comparison, the \n     737-300 can fit up to 128 passengers, depending on the \n     configuration.\n       ``I'll be honest,'' Hamre said. ``It was hard pulling this \n     off. We said [of the Gulfstream, or G-V]: `That's good \n     enough: It can get you to the theater, it can get you back \n     and you'll be in constant communication with your battle \n     staff.' So we sent up a report this spring saying the right \n     answer is a G-V.''\n       Having lost the battle inside the Pentagon, Zinni appears \n     to have sought to win it on Murtha's House panel. If Zinni \n     made a similar case to the other three defense committees, he \n     wasn't successful. If other commanders waged a similar \n     campaign on Capitol Hill, no word of it has emerged.\n\n\n                           response to query\n\n       Lt. Cdr. Ernest Duplessis, a spokesman for the U.S. Central \n     Command chief, or CINCCENT, said: ``Gen. Zinni never made a \n     request for a 737 or any specific aircraft. Nor did he ask to \n     have his own individually assigned aircraft. Rather, he \n     provided his requirements when asked. . . .\n       ``Gen Zinni has said he would accept the Gulfstream V with \n     noted reservations about the suitability of the plane to the \n     CINCCENT mission,'' Duplessis said. ``His shortfalls were \n     identified in response to questions from the House \n     Appropriations Committee.'' Duplessis declined to name any \n     lawmakers involved.\n       However, several congressional aides said that, if Murtha \n     asked Zinni questions, they were likely to have originated as \n     broad queries about overall needs, not questions about CINC-\n     support aircraft. They said Murtha almost certainly didn't \n     ask Zinni out of the blue if Zinni would like a new airplane.\n       According to Clemenson, last Christmas Eve Murtha and Zinni \n     discussed U.S. Central Command's purported need for a larger \n     support aircraft with Secretary of Defense William Cohen \n     during a flight home from Saudi Arabia. In addition, aides \n     said Zinni and Murtha also talked about it last February \n     during a ``courtesy call'' Zinni paid to Murtha's office just \n     prior to the general's annual testimony before the House \n     defense-spending panel.\n       ``It's something that's been talked about in a number of \n     contexts for a number of years here,'' Clemenson said.\n       Regardless of how the subject first came up, Zinni's \n     portrait of the shortfalls of the Gulfstream Vs and the \n     advantages of a larger aircraft ran counter to the Pentagon's \n     hard-fought policy favoring Gulfstream Vs for the commanders, \n     whatever their personal misgivings.\n\n\n                         not a stated priority\n\n       The Joint Staff recommendation in favor of Gulfstreams came \n     after the fiscal 2000 budget request went to Congress in \n     February. The request contained no Gulfstreams, let alone \n     737s.\n       Nor were Gulfstreams or 737s included on any of this year's \n     lists of ``unfunded requirements,'' sometimes called wish \n     lists--programs not in the budget request but ones that the \n     service chiefs consider important.\n       Both the budget request and the wish lists are supposed to \n     include the top requirements of chiefs such as Zinni, though \n     some say the lists don't always include all key needs.\n       Nonetheless, Zinni and Murtha believe the U.S. Central \n     Command chief, based at\n\n[[Page S12573]]\n\n     MacDill AFB, Fla., has a unique requirement for a large \n     aircraft to replace the current EC-135, which is a 1962 \n     airplane. The CINCENT must travel 8,000 miles to his \n     conflict-ridden theater and must have the communications \n     gear, staff and combat equipment to be able to perform a \n     ``full contingency operation,'' Duplessis said. To avoid \n     delays, the aircraft must be able to make it that distance \n     without landing to refuel.\n       The Senate-passed defense-appropriations bill, though it \n     did not fund Gulfstreams or 737s, did give the Air Force \n     legislative authority to lease, not buy, support aircraft, \n     which the Air Force has said means six Gulfstreams.\n       However, even the plan to lease the smaller, cheaper \n     Gulfstreams triggered a controversy on Capitol Hill.\n       Several lawmakers have criticized the purchase or lease of \n     luxury jets for four-stars while, at the same time, many in \n     uniform subsist on food stamps, aircraft are short on spare \n     parts and other needs go unmet.\n       In addition, some in Congress point out that the military \n     already has hundreds of domestic ``operational support \n     aircraft,'' which the General Accounting Office in 1995 said \n     exceed actual needs. In addition to the CINC fleet, the Air \n     Force alone has 11 Gulfstreams, three 727-100s, two 747s, \n     four 757s and 70 Learjets. The other services have their own, \n     smaller fleets. The GAO said the services do not share these \n     assets effectively.\n       Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) believes some of these \n     stateside aircraft, if not needed domestically, should be \n     provided to the CINCs. If a plane's range is not sufficient \n     for intercontinental flight, he says, it should be sold to \n     corporate executives to finance the purchase of any new, \n     larger jets for the four-stars.\n       Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), a member of the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee's defense panel, told Defense Week \n     recently that the need for the existing fleet must be \n     demonstrated before Congress signs up for new aircraft, \n     whether Gulfstreams or 737s.\n       ``Before buying these jets, Congress needs to get a lot \n     more information as to the military's requirements for \n     executive aircraft,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nopposition to the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations \nconference report.\n  Back in June, I lamented the Senate's unwillingness to scrutinize the \nPentagon's profligate spending. During the Senate's debate of the DoD \nappropriations bill, we had exactly two amendments worthy of extensive \ndebate. Two amendments, Mr. President. Here we have a defense policy \nthat perpetuates a cold war mentality into the 21st century, and the \nSenate gave the Defense Department a pass.\n  Now we come to the conference report. I took some satisfaction from \nthe F-22 drama that played out in conference, but the final act was \nrather predictable. Other than the F-22 program, however, did anyone \nquestion the Pentagon's continuing failure to adapt its priorities to \nthe post-cold-war era? Clearly not.\n  And who is left to pay for this $268 billion debacle? Who else but \nthe American taxpayers.\n  The Senate debated recently the wisdom of using across-the-board \nspending cuts as a budget tool.\n  This conference report is the best argument against that strategy. We \nneed look no further than this bill to find billions of dollars in \nwasteful spending that could be cut to avoid reductions in programs \nthat are truly justified--including Defense Department programs.\n  As we did last year, we are again in danger of breaking the spending \ncaps agreed to in 1997, and as the distinguished Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee was reported to have said, military spending \nwill be the force that breaks them.\n  This bloated bill contains billions of dollars in spending that is \nsimply unjustified. It spends even more than was requested by the \nPentagon, a level that was already too high.\n  Let me take just one example--the tactical aircraft programs.\n  My opinion on the Navy's F/A-18E/F program is well known. I have not \nbeen shy about highlighting the program's myriad flaws, not least of \nwhich are its inflated cost with respect to its capabilities.\n  I have to admit, though, that the Super Hornet program can claim to \nbuild on a solid foundation, in the form of the reliable, cost-\neffective Hornet. The Air Force's F-22 program, on the other hand, is a \nbrand new program. It is the most expensive fighter aircraft in the \nhistory of the world and arguably the most complex, yet it completed \njust 4 percent, or about 183 hours, of its flight test program before \nthe Pentagon approved $651 million in production money. The completed \nflight test hours were about a quarter of the Air Force's own \nguidelines. In comparison, the F-15 flew for 975 hours before a \nproduction contract award; the F-16 for 1,115 hours; and even the much-\nflawed Super Hornet had 779 flight test hours before a production \ncontract was awarded. Let me remind my colleagues that the flight test \nprogram hasn't even tested the aircraft's much-touted stealth or its \nelectronics capabilities.\n  My primary concern with this program is its cost. This cold war \nanachronism will cost about $200 million a copy. Add this program's \ncost to the E/F and the Joint Strike Fighter, and we have a $340 \nbillion fiscal nightmare on our hands. We cannot afford this. CBO knows \nit; GAO knows it; the CATO Institute knows it; the Brookings \nInstitution knows it. The Congress, however, cannot seem to figure it \nout.\n  I know that some folks will talk about how this conference report \nputs the program under greater scrutiny and that it delays the \naircraft's production, but let's be honest. Barring the discovery, and \nadmission, of some enormous flaw, this conference report holds off the \ninevitable for just a year. This report postpones production of the Air \nForce's F-22 fighter plane until April 2001, but refrains from \neliminating the program, as was done by the House.\n  The report provides $1.9 billion to purchase up to six planes, under \nthe scope of research and development and testing and evaluation. It \neven spends $277 for advanced procurement. That is something. The \nprogram is supposed to be under a microscope, but we still put up more \nthan a quarter of a billion dollars for advanced procurement. If that \nis not a clear indication of the plane's future, I do not know what is. \nAnd just to cover both ends, the report establishes a $300 million \nreserve fund to cover any liabilities the Air Force might incur as a \nresult of terminating the program's contracts. That's an awfully \ngenerous insurance policy given the trouble we're going through to fund \nother important programs, like veterans health care and education.\n\n  As long as we are talking about money, I would like to take this \nopportunity to Call the Bankroll on the money that has poured into the \ncoffers of candidates and political party committees from the defense \ncontractors who have mounted a huge campaign to keep the F-22 alive.\n  First, we have defense contracting giant Lockheed Martin, the primary \ndeveloper of the F-22. Lockheed Martin gave nearly $300,000 in soft \nmoney and more than $1 million in PAC money in the last election cycle.\n  During that same period, Boeing, one of the chief developers and \nproducers of the F-22's airframe, gave more than $335,000 in soft money \nto the parties and more than $850,000 in PAC money to candidates.\n  Then there are the subcontractors for the F-22, who account for more \nthan half the total dollar value of the project.\n  Four of the most important subcontractors, according to the F-22's \nown literature, are TRW, Raytheon, Hughes Electronics and Northrop \nGrumman.\n  And I guess it should come as little surprise to us to find that \nthese major subcontractors also happened to be major political donors \nin the last election cycle.\n  Raytheon tops this list with nearly $220,000 in soft money and more \nthan $465,000 in PAC money.\n  Northrop Grumman gave more than $100,000 in soft money to the parties \nand more than $450,000 in PAC money to candidates.\n  Hughes gave nearly $145,000 in PAC money during 1997 and 1998, and \nlast but not least, TRW gave close to $200,000 in soft money and more \nthan $235,000 in PAC money.\n  The F-22 program, and TacAir in general, highlights the Defense \nDepartment's flawed weapons modernization strategy. And today I Call \nthe Bankroll to highlight how the corrupt campaign finance system \nencourages that flawed strategy--by creating an endless money chase \nthat asks this body to put the interests of a few wealthy donors ahead \nof the best interests of our national defense.\n  The flawed strategy makes it impossible to buy enough new weapons to \nreplace all the old weapons on a timely basis, even though forces are \nmuch smaller than they were during the cold\n\n[[Page S12574]]\n\nwar and modernization budgets are projected to return to cold war \nlevels. Consequently, the ratio of old weapons to new weapons in our \nactive inventories will grow to unprecedented levels over the next \ndecade.\n  Subsequently, that modernization strategy is driving up the operating \nbudgets needed to maintain adequate readiness, even though the size of \nour forces is now smaller than it was during the cold war. Each new \ngeneration of high complexity weapons costs much more to operate than \nits predecessor, and the low rate of replacement forces the longer \nretention and use of older weapons. Thus, as weapons get older, they \nbecome more expensive to operate, maintain, and supply.\n  Supporting the Defense Department's misguided spending priorities is \nnot synonymous with supporting the military.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I fully support a significant increase in \ndefense spending, and I support the core of the defense appropriations \nbill we're considering today. Indeed, it includes many critical \nprovisions--including pay and benefits changes--that I and my \ncolleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee worked hard to pass \nin the defense authorization bill. For that matter, this bill includes \nmany projects important to the Commonwealth of Virginia that were \nincluded in the authorization bill. But this is simply not the way we \nshould legislate. Tacking extraneous provisions onto necessary \nlegislation is exactly what fuels the cynicism of the American people.\n  I have regularly supported Congressional increases to the defense \nbudget. But this legislation is a perfect example of what's wrong with \nthe Congress. And it reinforces the need for a line-item veto. The bill \ncontains the usual billions of dollars of congressional spending not \nrequested by the Department of Defense. My colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, observed earlier this morning that some $6 billion in \nunrequested pork are part of this bill--perhaps the largest amount of \nunrequested pork ever. This is money that could have gone toward \ndesperately needed improvements in our national defense, including more \ntraining, more spares and ammunition, more maintenance, and better \nquality of life for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.\n  But beyond spending on unneeded projects, the bill employs some \nbudget gimmicks that make a mockery of fiscal discipline. The bill \ndesignates--arbitrarily--$7.2 billion as emergency spending just to \navoid the pain of dealing with the budget caps. I believe we ought to \nmake the tough decisions to keep our spending under control. But if the \nCongress cannot discipline its spending, it ought to be forthright and \nacknowledge what it is doing. Avoiding hard choices with smoke and \nmirrors, however, is not responsible governing.\n  The bill authorizes 15 military construction projects that the Armed \nServices Committee decided not to authorize in its conference report. \nThe authorization of military construction projects is the \nresponsibility of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, I serve as the Ranking Member on the \nReadiness Subcommittee, where military construction matters are \nconsidered. We have been successful in limiting military construction \nspending to projects that meet certain strict criteria--including \nwhether the military plans to build these facilities at some point in \ntheir future years defense plan. The appropriations bill added 15 \nprojects, of which at least half were not even on the Pentagon's books \nfor eventual construction. Only the Armed Services Committee, with its \nlonger-term, policy-oriented focus, can avoid this kind of spending \nthat does little to improve the capabilities of our armed forces.\n  For these reasons, I will reluctantly vote against this bill knowing \nit will pass overwhelmingly. Since I know the bill will pass, my vote \nwill not jeopardize national security. It will not preclude the \nDepartment of Defense from spending the additional funds included in \nthe bill to provide more pay and benefits, more spare parts, increased \ntraining, and better maintenance. As I said before, I have fought long \nand hard to see those increases in the defense authorization bill. And \nif my protest vote would determine the outcome, I would act \ndifferently. But voting against this bill is one of the few means I \nhave available to register my protest forcefully. I simply cannot \nacquiesce to a process which misdirects funds crucial to our national \nsecurity to those who are seemingly more interested in their political \nsecurity. No one should doubt my commitment to a strong national \ndefense, but no one should doubt my commitment to fiscal responsibility \nas well. We cannot continue to squander so much of our scarce resources \non unnecessary pet projects when our needs for improved readiness are \nso great. And as I stated when I voted against the pork-laden Kosovo \nsupplemental earlier this year, just because we have troops in harm's \nway does not give us an excuse to go on a spending binge.\n  Hope springs eternal. Hopefully next year we can stem the pork, avoid \nthe gimmicks, and respect long-standing committee jurisdictions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as a member of the Defense \nAppropriations subcommittee and the conference committee which produced \nthis bill, I am prepared to join with most of my colleagues in voting \nfor its adoption.\n  However, I feel I have a responsibility to raise several serious \nconcerns and reservations about this conference report.\n  First, I am concerned that we as a nation are not allocating our \ndefense dollars as effectively and efficiently as we could to meet \nfuture needs.\n  Defense programs sometimes seem to take on lives of their own. They \nare sustained and even expanded year after year, even if we would not \ninclude them in a truly zero-based budget designed to address our top \npriorities.\n  The Pentagon, and we in Congress, need to ensure that we are giving \ndue priority to real national security needs, particularly \nopportunities to reduce the risk of conflict, the growing scourge of \nterrorism, and emerging threats like chemical and biological weapons \nand cyberwarfare.\n  We need to ask the tough questions, like whether it makes sense to \ndevote billions to accelerating multiple missile defense programs which \ncan be circumvented.\n  My second concern is what I can only describe as budget sleight of \nhand.\n  This bill is within its allocations, but it would not be if the \nCongressional Budget Office was simply allowed to do its job. But the \npolitical maneuvering forced arbitrary changes to paint a prettier, but \nfictional picture. The Budget Committees simply directed CBO to revise \nthe numbers downward. This is far more than a minor accounting issue.\n  CBO indicates that its estimates include a $2.6 billion reduction in \nBudget Authority--the adjustment for spectrum sales--and reductions \ntotaling $13 billion in outlays at the forced direction of the Budget \nCommittees' leadership. We should not fool the public about whether \nthat $13 billion will actually be spent this fiscal year--it will be!\n  We should not be blind-sided by these or other gimmicks through which \nthe majority will claim not to be spending the social security surplus.\n  Earlier this year, many of my colleagues questioned whether certain \nfunding has properly been declared ``emergency'' spending, which means \nit's a unique expenditure not subject to the budget caps that are \nsupposed to control our spending. How do these cynics feel about the \n$7.2 billion in Operations and Maintenance funds which this conference \nreport would declare an emergency?\n\n  This year's Budget Resolution adopted by the majority party which is \nnow in charge even included a requirement that any emergency spending \nbe fully justified in the accompanying report. But the conference \nreport before us simply ignores that requirement. Can anyone with a \nstraight face answer the questions the Budget Resolution would pose? \nWould they say it in front of a group of accountants or financial \nanalysts? Would they tell their sons or daughters to run their finances \nthat way?\n  Is this Operations and Maintenance spending, much of it requested by \nthe President and funded in prior years, ``sudden, quickly coming into \nbeing, and not building up over time''? Is it ``unforeseen, \nunpredictable, and unanticipated''?\n  An emergency designation such as this in another appropriations bill \nwould be subject to review by the Senate which could only be waived \nwith 60\n\n[[Page S12575]]\n\nvotes. However, the majority apparently anticipated this emergency \nbecause they exempted defense spending from the point of order.\n  My third major concern is what we call the top-line, though most \nAmericans would call it the bottom line. This bill weighs in at $263 \nbillion in new budget authority. That is over $3 billion more than the \nDefense Appropriations bill passed by the Senate and over $17 billion \nmore than we spent on defense last year. These numbers come straight \nout of the conference report.\n  I would not deny that we need to address readiness concerns and \nmodernize our armed forces. We live in an uncertain world, a world \nwhich has become more dangerous through this body's rejection of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty last night.\n  Can the dramatic increase in defense spending stand at this level \nwhile we starve other pressing needs in education, crime prevention, \nhealth care, and so many other areas?\n  I am not sure we can. So while I am prepared to vote for this bill \ntoday, I would urge President Clinton not to sign it into law until and \nunless other appropriations bills have reached his desk with sufficient \nfunding levels to meet America's needs.\n  If this can be accomplished without simply resorting to more \nbudgetary sleight-of-hand--and I sincerely hope we can do this--then I \nhope this bill will become law.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, to my knowledge, there is no further \nSenator seeking time on the bill. I ask that we have a quorum call for \na slight period to confirm the report that there are no other Senators \nwishing to speak. But if there are none within the next 5 or 6 minutes, \nI will ask the Senate to defer this matter according to the previous \norder. I will do that at 10:30, unless someone seeks time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to join my good friend from Hawaii \nin thanking our staff. Again, I can't remember in the time that I have \nserved on the Appropriations Committee a more difficult period in terms \nof getting this bill to where it is in order to send it to the \nPresident. We fully expect it to be signed.\n  Without Steven Cortese and Charlie Houy and the people who work with \nthem, both Republican and Democratic staffs on our committee, this \nwould not have been possible. They have worked weekends. They have \nworked into the night. They have been on call at the oddest hours I \nthink we have ever had in terms of dealing with this bill.\n  I sincerely want to thank them all and tell the Senate that this \nstaff is primarily responsible for this bill being before the Senate \ntoday because of their hard work and their determination to make it \ncome out right.\n  I thank them all.\n  I am now told that it has been confirmed there are no requests for \ntime; therefore, I ask unanimous consent that there be no further time \non this bill until the matter is called up for a vote by the leader \naccording to the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time is yielded.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is customary with a piece of \nlegislation when the sponsors of the bill are on the floor they manage \nthe conduct of the legislation and the opposition manages the other. If \nthe Senator from Nevada has other desires, I guess we can worry about \nit later on, but that is the way it has been in this debate.\n  Before I begin my remarks, I recognize a very unusual, incredible and \ngreat American, a true patriot, an incredible woman who is 89 years of \nage, named Doris Haddock.\n  Doris, known to all of us, and now millions of Americans, as ``Granny \nD,'' began her walk months ago, beginning in the State of California. \nShe has now arrived in the State of Tennessee. I believe she represents \nall that is good in America. She, at the age of 89, has taken up this \nstruggle to clean up American politics. We are honored by her presence. \nShe is in the gallery today, and we thank her for her commitment to \nopen, honest government of which the American people can be proud.\n  So, ``Granny D,'' you exceed any small, modest contributions those of \nus who have labored in the vineyards of reform have made to this Earth. \nWe are grateful for you. We ask you not to give up this struggle \nbecause we know that we will prevail.\n  Mr. President, on December 6, 1904, Theodore Roosevelt, addressing \nthe people of the United States, said:\n\n       The power of the government to protect the integrity of the \n     elections of its own officials is inherent and has been \n     recognized and affirmed by repeated declarations of the \n     Supreme Court. There is no enemy of free government more \n     dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption of the \n     electorate. No one defends or excuses corruption, and it \n     would seem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measures \n     to eradicate it. The details of such law may be safely left \n     to the wise discretion of the Congress.\n\n  So said President Theodore Roosevelt in his fourth annual message \ndelivered from the White House on December 6, 1904.\n  On August 31, 1910, Theodore Roosevelt said:\n\n       Now this means that our government, national and State, \n     must be freed from the sinister influence or control of \n     special interests. Exactly as the special interests of cotton \n     and slavery threatened our political integrity before the \n     Civil War, so now the great special business interests too \n     often control and corrupt the men and methods of \n     government for their own profit. We must drive the special \n     interests out of politics.\n\n  That is one of our tasks today.\n  And he goes on.\n  Some things obviously never change, such as the cycles of American \npolitics. In 1907, thanks to the efforts of Theodore Roosevelt, a law \nwas passed in Congress that banned corporate contributions to American \npolitical campaigns. I do not pretend to be as eloquent as Theodore \nRoosevelt was in that campaign against the influences of special \ninterests on American politics. Suffice it to say, he succeeded. He \nsucceeded in getting through Congress a law, which still remains on the \nstatutes, that outlaws corporate contributions to American political \ncampaigns.\n  In 1947, the Republican-controlled Congress of the United States \noutlawed union contributions to American political campaigns. And after \nthe Watergate scandal of 1974, further limitations were placed on the \ninfluence of special interests in American political campaigns.\n  It is now legal in America for a People's Liberation Army-owned \ncorporation in China, with a subsidiary in the United States of \nAmerica, to give unlimited amounts of money to an American political \ncampaign. That is wrong. It is wrong and it needs to be fixed.\n  The pending legislation is very simple. It does only two things: \nfirst, it bans Federal soft money and, second, it\n\n[[Page S12576]]\n\ncodifies the Beck decision. Soft money is the unlimited 6- and 7-figure \ncontributions that now go into American political campaigns.\n  In the past, my colleague from Wisconsin and I have offered \ncomprehensive campaign finance legislation. That measure was widely \ndebated and many on this side of the aisle expressed criticism of \ncertain provisions in the bill. As a result, we have taken a new \napproach, a simpler approach. We only seek to ban soft money, those big \nchecks of ten thousand, one hundred thousand, and even one million \ndollars that powerful special interests use like clubs to make their \nnarrow voices heard so loudly in the great chamber, and to codify the \nBeck decision. We leave all other issues off the table and instead \nwould hope such matters could be dealt with in the amending process. \nAnd as such I implore my colleagues to come down to the floor, debate \nand offer amendments, and let us move forward on this simple, common \nsense and urgently needed reform.\n  I want to express my sincere hope that before this debate is over \nthat we will have either passed this measure or will have come to \nagreement on how to move forward constructively on this very important \nsubject.\n  Before I go on, I want to assure the Senator from Kentucky that I \nrespect his opposition. I neither question his motives nor his \nintegrity. He is a man who is willing to stand up and fight for what he \nbelieves in. The conduct of the debate in previous years has been \ncharacterized by mutual respect for the ideas and proposals of either \nside. I know I speak for the Senator from Wisconsin. I think it is \nimportant we maintain this debate on that level. I know we will do so \nas we have in the past.\n  Mr. President, will the banning of soft money clean up our elections \ncompletely? Of course not. But it is an important first step. Should \nmore be done? Absolutely. For that reason, I hope we can engage in a \nconstructive debate that addresses the concerns of senators from both \nparties who are sincerely interested in achieving genuine reform. We \nhave an obligation--a duty--to at least close the most politically \npernicious loophole in campaign finance law.\n  Let me stress at the outset, before reform opponents falsely charge \nproponents with an assault on the first amendment, that this \nlegislation does not ban political speech, it is in truth about saving \nit. I want to protect the hard earned $100 contribution given by the \nsmall town business owner or union machinist to his or her Congressman. \nI want to protect the contribution of the local supporter, the little \nguy. The hard earned contribution given to a candidate by a voter, with \na firm handshake and an honest look right in the eye and the \nexpectation of good government, not a special corporate tax loophole or \nmillion dollar IOU to a union boss.\n  What this fight is all about is taking the $100,000 check out of \nAmerican politics for good. It's about putting the little guy back in \ncharge, and freeing our system from the corrupting power of the special \ninterests bottomless wallet. It's about forcing our government to pay \nattention to the little guy, those people who actually cast votes to \nelect us, and not just to the richest in corporate America or the \npowerful union bosses.\n  We are blessed to be Americans, not just in times of prosperity, but \nat all times. We are a part of something noble; a great experiment to \nprove to the world that democracy is not only the most effective form \nof government, but the only moral government. And, at least in years \npast, we felt more than lucky to be Americans. We felt proud.\n  But, today , we confront a very serious challenge to our political \nsystem, as dangerous in its debasing effect on our democracy as war and \ndepression have been in the past. And it will take the best efforts of \nevery public-spirited American to defeat it.\n  The threat that concerns me is the pervasive public cynicism that is \ndebilitating our democracy. When the people come to believe that \ngovernment is so corrupt that it no longer serves their ends, basic \ncivil consensus will deteriorate as people seek substitutes for the \nunifying values of patriotism.\n  A poll taken this July found that more than twice a many Americans--\n64 percent--feel disconnected from government as compared to those who \nfeel connected to it. More than half of Americans--55 percent--refer to \n``the government'' rather than ``our government.'' Mr. President, as \nelected officials, we should find this trend alarming.\n  We are a prosperous country, but many Americans, particularly the \nyoung, can't see beyond the veil of their cynicism and indifference to \nimagine themselves as part of a cause greater than their self-interest. \nThis cynicism in younger Americans is particularly acute. Among younger \nAmericans--those 18-34--69 percent feel disconnected from the \ngovernment with one in three of that 69 percent feeling ``very \ndisconnected.''\n  This country has survived many difficult challenges: a civil war, \nworld war, depression, the civil rights struggle, a cold war. All were \njust causes. They were good fights. They were patriotic challenges.\n  We have a new patriotic challenge for a new century: declaring war on \nthe cynicism that threatens our public institutions, our culture, and, \nultimately, our private happiness. It is a great and just cause, worthy \nof our best service. It should not, and neither I nor my friend \nfrom Wisconsin will allow it to, be casually dismissed with \nparliamentary tactics.\n\n  Those of us privileged to hold public office have ourselves to blame \nfor the sickness in American public life today. It is we who have \nsquandered the public trust. We who have, time and again, in full \npublic view placed our personal and partisan interests before the \nnational interest, earning the public's contempt for our poll-driven \npolicies, our phony posturing, the lies we call spin and the damage \ncontrol we substitute for progress. It is we who are the defenders of a \ncampaign finance system that is nothing less than an elaborate \ninfluence peddling scheme in which both parties conspire to stay in \noffice by selling the country to the highest bidder.\n  All of us are tainted by this system, myself included. I do not make \nany claims of piety. I have personally experienced the pull from \ncampaign staff alerting me to a call from a large donor. I do not \nbelieve that any of us privileged enough to serve in this body would \never automatically do the bidding of those who give. I do not believe \nthat contributions are corrupting in that manner. But I do believe they \nbuy access. I do believe they distort the system. And I do believe, as \nI noted, that all of us, including myself, have been affected by this \nsystem.\n  The opponents of campaign finance reform will tell you the voters do \nnot care. They are wrong. Most Americans care very much that it is now \nlegal for a subsidiary of a corporation owned by the Chinese Army to \ngive unlimited amounts of money to American political campaigns. Most \nAmericans care very much when the Lincoln bedroom is rented out to the \nhighest bidder. Most Americans care very much when impoverished Indian \ntribes must pay large sums of money to have their voice heard in \nWashington. If their outrage seems muted, it is only because they have \nresigned themselves to the sad conclusion that this cancer on the body \npolitic is incurable.\n  I think most Americans understand that soft money--the enormous sums \nof money given to both parties by just about every special interest in \nthe country--corrupts both politics and government whether it comes \nfrom big business or from labor bosses and trial lawyers. It seizes the \nattention of elected officials who then neglect problems that directly \naffect the lives of every American. That is something about which each \nof us should care deeply.\n  Americans care deeply about reforming our Tax Code, improving \neducation, reducing the size of Government, about improving our \nnational security, and many other pressing national issues. But, \nfundamental reform is not possible when soft money and special \ninterests demand a higher return on their political investments.\n  Most Americans believe we conspire to hold on to every political \nadvantage we have, lest we jeopardize our incumbency by a single lost \nvote. Most Americans believe we would pay any price, bear any burden to \nensure the success of our personal ambitions--no matter\n\n[[Page S12577]]\n\n how injurious the effect might be to the national interest. And who \ncan blame them when the wealthiest Americans and richest organized \ninterests can make six figure donations to political parties and gain \nthe special access to power such generosity confers on the donor.\n  The special interests will tell you that the fight to limit soft \nmoney is an attack on the first amendment. They are wrong. They are \nentirely wrong. The courts have long held that Congress may \nconstitutionally limit contributions to campaigns and political \nparties.\n  In the 1976 Supreme Court case Buckley versus Valeo the Justices \naffirmed Congress' right to uphold contribution limits in the name of \npreventing, and I quote, ``corruption and the appearance of corruption \nspawned by the real or imagined coercive influence of large financial \ncontributions on candidates' positions and their actions.''\n  The Roger Tamrazes of the world, big tobacco, the labor unions, the \ntrial lawyers, the corporate giants, and the endless number of special \ninterests that grease their agenda with soft money know precisely what \nthe court was saying.\n  Stopping corruption and the appearance of corruption was why in 1907, \nunder the leadership of Republican President Teddy Roosevelt, \ncorporations were barred from giving directly to political campaigns. \nLabor unions were similarly bound in 1947. Both of these bans have \nsurvived all court challenges and remain the law of the land--which is \nwhy claims that corporate and labor soft money is constitutionally \nprotected are so absurd.\n  Stopping corruption and the appearance of corruption was why, in \n1974, individual political action committee donations were limited. \nShould these amounts--and those limits on individual donors--be raised \n25 years after they were enacted? Yes, they probably should. But that \nis reason for us not to engage in filibuster and obstruction and \ninstead engage in constructive dialogue and the normal amendment \nprocess.\n  Stopping corruption and the appearance of corruption is why we must \nnow close the loophole that allows unlimited amounts of soft money to \noverflow political coffers. Without the big dollar ``quid'' of soft \nmoney in the electoral process, there can be no legislative ``pro quo'' \nthat neglects the national interest in favor of big donors. That is \nprecisely what the Supreme Court had in mind in Buckley versus Valeo.\n  Some of my fellow Republicans have criticized my campaign finance \nreform proposals because they believe it leaves unaddressed the problem \nof union dues being used for political purposes against the wish of \nindividual workers. I agree this is a problem that should be addressed, \njust as we should address the issue of corporate money being used for \npolitical purposes against the wish of stockholders. This legislation \ndoes seek to address that issue. First, as I have noted, the \nlegislation codifies the Beck decision. And second, when we ban soft \nmoney, we are also banning union soft money. Let me emphasize this \npoint. When we ban soft money, we are also banning union soft money \nspending which will have a dramatic effect on union influence in \nelections. Unions spend a great deal of soft money, most of it directed \nto elect Democrats and defeat Republicans. This bill will reduce that \nspending.\n  I have advocated codifying the Supreme Court's landmark Beck decision \nin which the court affirmed the right of nonunion workers to bar union \ndues they are forced to pay from being used for political purposes and \nto have that money returned to them. The Clinton administration has \nissued regulations that emasculate this rule. I believe it should be \ncodified and enforced.\n\n  What could be more un-American, what could be more antithetical to \nthe tenets of free political speech, than forcing workers to pay dues \nfor election and political activities they oppose. The Beck decision \nshould be codified, enforced, and even expanded. I would strongly \nsupport a commonsense expansion of Beck. And at the same time, we \nshould find some mechanism to ensure that corporate contributions \nreflect the wishes of individual stockholders in a manner that mirrors \nwhat we do for unions.\n  If we can come to an agreement regarding the consideration of \ncampaign finance reform in a fair manner, I am confident we could do \nmuch more to address the problems associated with labor union \ninvolvement in the political process.\n  If my colleagues believe more needs to be done, I would be pleased to \nentertain any legitimate ideas. However, to be clear, I will oppose any \nideas that are meant merely to poison--or kill--any real possibility of \nenacting into law election reforms.\n  The sponsors of this legislation claim no exclusive right to propose \ncampaign finance reform. We have offered good, fair, necessary reform \nbut certainly not a perfect remedy. We welcome good faith amendments \nintended to improve the legislation.\n  But I beg my colleagues not to propose amendments designed to kill \nthis bill by provoking a filibuster from one party or the other. If we \ncannot agree on every aspect of reform; if we have differences about \nwhat constitutes genuine reform, and we hold those differences \nhonestly--so be it. Let us try to come to terms with those differences \nfairly. Let us find common ground and work together to adopt those \nbasic reforms we can all agree on. That is what the sponsors of this \nlegislation have attempted to do, and we welcome anyone's help to \nimprove upon our proposal as long as that help is sincere and intended \nto reach the common goal of genuine campaign finance reform.\n  In closing, I reiterate that I believe we can work together. I \nbelieve the majority of the Members of this body realize that reform is \nnecessary. I think we now have an opportunity to amend, to debate, and \nto come together. I hope we can achieve that goal.\n  In closing, I again thank my friend from the State of Wisconsin. My \nfriend from the State of Wisconsin recently has felt a certain sense of \nloneliness because he has attempted to move this process forward in a \nfair, equitable, and reasonable fashion. The Senator from Wisconsin has \nshown his political courage. It has been a great honor and privilege \nfor me to have the opportunity of working with him, and many others, in \nthe cause of campaign reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate is once \nagain going to consider campaign finance reform.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Arizona. We have been at this effort \nnow for almost 5 years. He has done so much, particularly in the last \nyear, to raise this issue, not only within this body but throughout \nAmerica. It has made an incredible difference in terms of the public's \nunderstanding, particularly of the problem soft money causes.\n  I also take note of one other Senator. There are many who have worked \nso hard on this, but I simply have to note the extreme dedication, hard \nwork, and effectiveness of the Senator from Maine, Susan Collins, who \nhas devoted herself to this cause as well.\n  This is not only a crucial issue to the health and future of the \nCongress but also for our democracy itself. My colleagues know it is my \nstrong belief that this issue affects virtually everything we do in \nthis Chamber.\n  I have spoken about the need for reform numerous times this year--15 \ntimes. Today is the 16th--on the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill. I call this the ``calling of the bankroll'' on specific campaign \ncontributors with an interest in the bills we have considered.\n  Now the Senate has finally a chance to act. I am hopeful, as we begin \nthis debate, that we can reach a consensus during the next few days and \npass a campaign finance reform bill the House can accept and the \nPresident can sign.\n  This debate will undoubtedly be difficult and unpredictable. Unlike \nin past years, though, I hope this will not be a scripted debate where \neveryone basically knows the outcome in advance. We do not know exactly \nwhat is going to happen. We apparently are going to have the \nopportunity to offer and vote on amendments. We are going to legislate, \nnot just make speeches for a couple of days and use parliamentary \ntactics to block reform. We are going to actually try to pass a bill.\n  I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to keep an open \nmind and remember that what we are doing here\n\n[[Page S12578]]\n\nwill affect all Americans. Every one of our constituents, every citizen \nin this country, has an interest in the health of our democracy. We \nhave a great responsibility here, and I hope we are up to it.\n  There are many things wrong with our current campaign financing \nsystem. I hope this body will grapple with that system in a \ncomprehensive way at some point--sooner rather than later.\n  For me--and I do not speak for anyone else--I believe ultimately we \nshould move to a system of public financing of elections to free \ncandidates from the demands of fundraising and free the legislative \nprocess from the influence of special interests.\n  I favor giving candidates more access to the airwaves at reduced cost \nso they can get their messages out to the public without having to \nspend all this time raising money. I believe the groups that run ads \nthat attack candidates within a month or even a few days of an election \nshould have to report their contributors and their expenditures, just \nas a campaign committee has to do.\n\n  This is the key point: It is clear that this Senate--I emphasize, \nthis Senate--will not pass a comprehensive bill to deal with all or \neven most of the problems with the current system. We have known this \nfor some time. In fact, the bill we considered in the last Congress was \neven significantly narrower than the comprehensive bill Senator McCain \nand I first introduced in 1995. But during our 5-year effort, it has \nbecome more and more clear that soft money is the biggest loophole in \nthis system and perhaps the most corrupting aspect of the system.\n  Soft money has exploded during those 5 years to the point where many \nAmericans believe--and I share their belief--that the loophole has \nswallowed the election laws. In fact, the best statement I have heard \non this was by the third cosponsor of the original McCain-Feingold \nbill, the Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, Fred Thompson, who said plainly, without any legal \njargon and all the other language we tend to use out here: Mr. \nPresident, we really don't have a campaign finance system anymore. That \nsaid it all. That captured the impact of soft money on our system.\n  So the bill that Senator McCain and I have introduced and that we \nconsider today essentially asks a very simple question: Will the Senate \nban political party soft money or not? It is that simple.\n  This bill is a soft money ban, pure and simple. At this point it says \nnothing--nothing--about issue ads, nothing about disclosure or even \nenforcement. It does codify the Beck decision on union dues. It has \nminor changes with regard to certain aggregate limits on hard money \ncontributions. But otherwise it leaves the status quo intact, except \nfor one simple and crucial reform: This bill prohibits the political \nparties from accepting unlimited contributions from corporations, \nunions, and wealthy individuals.\n  This is what it says to the political parties: Stop the charade. \nForget about the loophole that has swallowed the law. Live under the \nlaw Congress passed in 1974. Raise your money primarily from \nindividuals, not corporations or unions, in amounts of $20,000 per year \nor less.\n  It is soft money that brought us the scandals of 1996--the selling of \naccess and influence in the White House and the Congress, the use of \nthe Lincoln Bedroom and Air Force One to reward contributors, the White \nHouse coffees. All of this came from soft money because, without soft \nmoney, the parties would not have been tempted to come up with ever \nmore enticing offers to get the big contributors to open their \ncheckbooks. It just would not be worth it to do all of that under the \nhard money limits. It is only the unlimited opportunity for the \nunlimited check that creates that kind of a temptation.\n  But today, both parties aggressively engage in this big money \nauction. It is an arms race where the losers are the American people. \nSoft money causes Americans, time and time again, to question the \nintegrity and impartiality of the legislative process. Everything we do \nis under scrutiny and subject to suspicion because major industries and \nlabor organizations are giving our political parties such big piles of \nmoney. Whether it is the telecommunications legislation, Y2K liability, \nthe bankruptcy bill, defense spending, or health care, someone out \nthere is telling the public, often with justification, in my view, that \nthe Congress cannot be trusted to do what is best for the public \ninterest because the major affected industries are giving us money \nwhile those bills are pending in committee or debated on the floor.  I \nhave tried, over the past few months, to highlight the influence of \nmoney on the legislative process through the calling of the bankroll. \nTime and time again, I have found that increasingly, the really big \nmoney, the money that many believe now has the biggest influence here, \nis soft money.\n\n  We have to clean our campaign finance house, and the best way to \nstart is to get rid of soft money. Let us make rules that protect the \npeople again in this country. With soft money, there are essentially no \nrules and no limits. With this bill, we can begin to restore some \nsanity to our campaign finance system.\n  To be candid--I don't like to admit it--when I came to the Senate, I \nwasn't even sure what soft money was, or at least I didn't know \neverything that could be done with it. After a tough race in 1992 \nagainst a well-financed incumbent opponent who spent twice as much as I \ndid, I was mostly concerned with the difficulties of people who are not \nwealthy in running for office. My commitment to campaign finance reform \nwas honestly forged from that experience.\n  But something has happened since I got here. Soft money has exploded, \nwith far-reaching consequences for our elections and the functioning of \nCongress. I truly believe--and I didn't necessarily feel this way 3 or \n4 years ago--if we can do nothing else on campaign finance reform in \nthis Congress, we must stop the cancerous growth of soft money before \nit consumes us and ultimately the remaining credibility of our system.\n  I want to take a few minutes to describe to my colleagues in concrete \nterms, instead of talking about large sums of money in general, the \ngrowth of soft money over the past 6 years, all since I first came to \nthe Senate not so long ago. It is a frightening story. I hope my \ncolleagues, staff, and people watching will listen to these numbers \nbecause they are staggering.\n  As this chart shows, soft money first arrived on the scene of our \nnational elections in the 1980 election, after a 1978 FEC ruling opened \nthe door for parties to accept contributions from corporations and \nunions that are barred from contributing to Federal elections. The best \navailable estimate is that parties raised, in that 1980 cycle, that \nfirst cycle, under $20 million in soft money. By the 1992 election, the \nyear I was elected to this body, soft money fundraising by the parties \nhad gone from under $20 million to $86 million.\n  Obviously, $86 million already was a lot of money. It was nearly as \nmuch as the $110 million the two Presidential candidates were given in \n1992 in public financing from the U.S. Treasury. There was already real \nconcern about how that money was spent. Despite the FEC decision that \nsoft money could be used for activities such as get-out-the-vote and \nvoter registration campaigns without violating the Federal election \nlaw's prohibition on corporate and union contributions in connection \nwith Federal elections, the parties sent much of their soft money to be \nspent in States where the Presidential election between George Bush and \nBill Clinton was close or where there were key contested Senate races, \nnot necessarily connected to the purposes for which that money was \nsupposedly allowed to be used.\n  Still, soft money, in 1992, was far from the central issue in our \ndebate over campaign finance reform in 1993 and 1994. Then in 1995, \nwhen Senator McCain and I first introduced the McCain-Feingold bill, \nour bill did include a ban on soft money, but it wasn't even close to \nbeing the most controversial or important provision of our bill. As far \nas we knew, no one paid any attention to it. I have my own original \nsummary of our first bill. It is numbered 9 out of 12 items. We \nmentioned all other kinds of things first. It is just above ``ban on \npersonal use of campaign funds,'' which was already essentially \nrequired by the FEC anyway. I am saying, I didn't realize, when I \nintroduced this bill with Senator McCain, what was about to happen.\n\n[[Page S12579]]\n\n  Indeed, the Republican campaign finance bill introduced in the Senate \nin 1993, cosponsored by the Senator from Kentucky and many other \nopponents of reform on the Republican side, actually contained a ban on \nsoft money. In 1993, they were very comfortable with the implications, \nconstitutional issues and others, connected with stopping soft money. \nApparently not today.\n  Then came the 1996 election and the enormous explosion of soft money \nfueled by the parties' decision to use the money on phony issue ads \nsupporting their Presidential candidates. Remember those ads that \neverybody thought were Clinton and Dole ads but were really run by the \nparties? I remember seeing them for the first time in the Cloakroom. \nThat was the moment when soft money began to achieve its full \ncorrupting potential on the national scene.\n  As you can see on this chart, again, total soft money fundraising \nskyrocketed as a result. Three times as much soft money was raised in \n1996 as in 1992. Let me say that again. Soft money tripled in one \nPresidential election cycle. What was the effect of this explosion of \nsoft money, other than millions of dollars available for ads supporting \nPresidential candidates who had agreed to run their campaign on equal \nand limited grants from Federal taxpayers? The total dollars raised, as \nshown on this chart, don't tell the whole story. This talks about the \ntotal amounts. This talks about the campaign side of this problem of \nsoft money. There is a whole other story, and that is the impact of \nthese contributions on what we do here.\n  Soft money is raised primarily from corporate interests that have a \nlegislative ax to grind. So the explosion of soft money brought another \nexplosion--an explosion of influence and access in this Congress and in \nthis administration. Consider these statistics on this chart. I hope \npeople will note these figures. They amaze me. As long as I have been \ninvolved with this issue, they have amazed me.\n  In 1992, there were a total of 52 donors who gave over a total of \n$200,000 to political parties. In 1996, just 4 years later, 219 donors \ngave that much soft money. Over 20 donors gave over $300,000 in soft \nmoney contributions during the 1992 cycle. But in 1996, 120 donors gave \ncontributions totaling $300,000 or more. What about over 400,000? In \n1992, 13 donors gave that much soft money. But in 1996, it was all the \nway up to 79 donors giving $400,000 per person or interest. Whereas \nonly 9 donors in 1992 gave $500,000--a half million dollars, Mr. \nPresident; people giving a half million dollars--by 1996, 50 donors \ngave a half million dollars.\n  Does anyone think those donors expect nothing for this act of \ngenerosity? Does anyone think those donors get nothing for their \ngenerosity? Does anyone think the principle of one person/one vote \nmeans anything to anyone anymore if somebody can give a half million \ndollars?\n  Here is another amazing statistic: This is even worse, to me. In \n1992, only 7 companies gave over $150,000 to each of the political \nparties--double givers, we call them, who made contributions to both \nparties. In 1996, the number of these double givers was up to 43: \nForty-three companies or associations gave $150,000 or more to both the \nDemocrat and the Republican Party. I would suggest there is no \nideological motive. This is not about their passion for good \ngovernment. These donors are playing both sides of the fence. They \ndon't care about who is in power. They want to get their hooks into \nwhoever is controlling the legislative agenda.\n  Here are some of the companies in this rather exclusive group. We \nknow they have a big interest in what Congress does: Philip Morris, \nJoseph Seagram & Sons, RJR Nabisco, Walt Disney, Atlantic Richfield, \nAT, Federal Express, MCI, the Association of Trial Lawyers, the \nNational Education Association, Lazard Freres & Co., Anheuser Busch, \nEli Lilly, Time Warner, Chevron Corp., Archer Daniel's Midland, NYNEX, \nTextron Inc., Northwest Airlines. Mr. President, it is a who's who of \ncorporate America. These are the big investors in the U.S. Congress, \nand no one can convince the American people that these companies get no \nreturn on their investment. So we have an ever-increasing number of \ncompanies that are participating in this system, trying to make sure \ntheir interests are protected and their lobbyists' calls returned.\n  There is another effect of this explosion of soft money, and that is \nthe increasing participation of Members of this body in raising it.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues are actually picking up the \nphones across the street in our party committee headquarters to ask \ncorporate CEOs for soft money contributions. But no one here can deny \nthat our parties are asking us to do this. It is now simply expected \nthat United States Senators will be soft money fundraisers.\n  Consider the soft money raised in recent off-year elections. In 1994, \nthe parties raised a total of $101.7 million dollars. Only about $18.5 \nmillion of that amount was raised by the congressional and senatorial \ncampaign committees. In 1998, the most recent election, soft money \nfundraising more than doubled to $224.4 million. And $107 million of \nthat total was raised by the congressional and senatorial campaign \ncommittees. That's nearly half of the total soft money raised by the \nparties.\n  Half the soft money that the parties raised in the last election went \nto the several party campaign committees for members of Congress, as \nopposed to the national party committees.\n  When you hear all this talk about how the parties need this money \ngenerally, that is why they need soft money, and an awful of lot is not \ngoing to the parties generally. And I and many of my colleagues know \nfrom painful experience that much of that money ended up being spent on \nphony issue ads in Senate races. The direct contribution of corporate \nmoney to federal candidates has been banned in federal elections since \n1907, but that money is now being raised by Senators as soft money and \nspent to try to influence the election of Senators. It is spent to try \nto influence the election of Senators. To me, this is a complete \nobliteration of the spirit of the law. It is wrong. It must be stopped.\n  The growth of soft money has made a mockery of our campaign finance \nlaws. It has turned Senators into panhandlers for huge contributions \nfrom corporate patrons. And it has multiplied the number of corporate \ninterests that have a claim on the attention of members and the work of \nthis institution.\n  Mr. President, there is broad and bipartisan support for banning soft \nmoney. Former Presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford believe that soft money \nmust be eliminated, as does a large and distinguished bipartisan group \nof former Members of Congress, organized last year by former Senator \nand Vice President Walter Mondale, a Democrat, and former Senator Nancy \nKassebaum Baker, a Republican. Their effort has been joined at last \ncount by 216 former members of the House and Senate. Senators Mondale \nand Kassebaum published an opinion piece in the Washington Post that \neloquently spells out the rationale and the critical need to enact this \nreform.\n  They state that a ban on soft money would ``restore a sound principle \nlong held to be essential. That bedrock principle, developed step by \nstep through measures signed into law by presidents from Theodore \nRoosevelt to Gerald Ford, is that federal elections campaigns should be \nfinanced by limited contributions from individuals and not by either \ncorporate or union treasuries. Neither candidates for federal office, \nnor the national political party committees whose primary mission is to \nelect them, should be dependent on the treasuries of corporations or \nunions that have strong economic interests in the decisions of the \nfederal government.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full article by these \ntwo very distinguished former members of this body be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As I mentioned, Mr. President, Senators Mondale and \nKassebaum Baker put together a group of former members 216 strong who \nwant to end soft money. One of those is former Senator Bill Brock, who \nalso served as Chairman of the Republican Party. In an op-ed last year, \nSenator Brock dispelled the myth that the parties cannot survive \nwithout soft money. He stated: ``In truth, the parties were stronger \nand closer to their\n\n[[Page S12580]]\n\nroots before the advent of this loophole than they are today.'' He \nadds: ``Far from reinvigorating the parties themselves, soft money has \nsimply strengthened certain specific candidates and the few donors who \ncan make huge contributions while distracting parties from traditional \ngrassroots work.''\n\n  Those are not just my sentiments; they are the sentiments of former \nSenator Brock, and he has it exactly right.\n  Our national political parties should be the engines of democracy, \nthe organizers of individual donors and volunteers who care about big \nideas and are willing to work for them. Instead they have become \nfundraising behemoths, obsessed with extorting the biggest chunks of \ncash that they can from corporate and wealthy donors. This is not what \nthe two great political parties should be about Mr. President. Soft \nmoney has changed our politics for the worse Mr. President. And I think \neveryone in this body knows that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement from Senators \nMondale and Kassebaum-Baker that contains excerpts from a number of \narticles written by former Members of Congress on the topic of banning \nsoft money be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the bill the Senate is now considering \naccomplishes a ban on soft money in four simple ways. First, and most \nimportant, it prohibits the national political parties from raising or \nspending money that is not subject to the limits of the federal \nelection laws. Second, it prohibits federal officeholders and \ncandidates from raising money that is not subject to the election laws, \nexcept for appearing as a speaker at a fundraising event sponsored by a \nstate or local political party. Third, to prevent soft money from being \nlaundered through state parties and making its way back into federal \nelections, it requires state and local parties that spend money on \ncertain federal election activities to use only money that is subject \nto the federal election laws. And finally, it prohibits the parties \nfrom soliciting money for or contributing money to outside \norganizations.\n  The amendment also makes some changes in the contribution limits of \ncurrent law in a recognition of the new difficulties that parties may \nface as they are forced to go ``cold turkey'' in giving up soft money. \nIt increases the amount that individuals can legally give to state \nparty committees from $5,000 per year to $10,000 per year. And it \nincreases the amount that an individual can give to all parties, PACs, \nand candidates combined in a year from $25,000 to $30,000.\n  This provision is tough, but it is fair. It allows federal candidates \nto continue to help raise money for their state parties by appearing at \nfundraisers. It permits the state parties until four months before an \nelection to use non-federal money to conduct voter registration drives \nthat will obviously benefit federal candidates as well.\n  Mr. President, I truly believe that we must do much more than ban \nsoft money to fix our campaign finance system. But if there is one \nthing more than any other that must be done now it is to ban soft \nmoney. Otherwise the soft money loophole will completely obliterate the \nPresidential public funding system, and lead to scandals that will make \nwhat we saw in 1996 seem quaint. And the number of investors in this \nbody will continue to skyrocket, with untold consequences on the work \nof this body and the confidence of the American people in their \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, we have some momentum. I was delighted this week to \nhave us get another cosponsor on this bill, the Senator from Kansas, \nSam Brownback, and to also have the endorsement of one of the leaders \nfrom the other body, Congressman Asa Hutchinson. So we have had good \nmomentum this week. I am pleased with that. I especially felt the \nmomentum when last Friday I had a chance to go to Nashville, Tennessee, \nand I had the good fortune to meet an extraordinary woman, who is in \nWashington today. I'm speaking of Doris Haddock, from Dublin, New \nHampshire. Doris has become known to many people throughout the country \nand around the world as ``Granny D.''\n  She is 89 years old. On January 1st of this year, she set out to walk \nacross this country to call attention to the need for campaign finance \nreform and call on this body to pass the McCain-Feingold bill. As she \nsaid last week, voting for McCain-Feingold is something our mothers and \ngrandmothers would want us to do. And coming from Granny D, this is not \njust a polite request--it is a challenge and a demand from one of the \ntoughest and bravest advocates of reform I have ever had the pleasure \nto know.\n  I joined Granny D on the road last week, and as we walked together \nthrough the streets of Nashville, shouts of ``Go Granny Go'' came from \nevery corner--from drivers in their cars, pedestrians on the sidewalk \nand construction workers on the job.\n  The response she got that day, and the support she gets every day on \nher walk across America, speak volumes about where the American people \nstand on this issue. They are fed up with a campaign finance system so \nclogged with cash that it has essentially ceased to function; they are \nfrustrated by a Congress that has stood by and watched our democracy \ndeteriorate; and today they are demanding that the U.S. Senate join \nGranny D on the road to reform by passing the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Granny D and countless Americans like her are demanding, here and \nnow, that this body act to ban soft money and begin to clean up our \ncampaign finance mess. Granny has been walking across this country for \nmore than nine months now--from California to Tennessee, in the \nsweltering heat and now in the growing cold, over mountains and across \na desert. At age 89, she has braved all of this. And all she is asking \nU.S. Senators to do in return one simple thing.\n  What she's asking is not anywhere near as strenuous, and it won't \ntake anywhere near as much time as what she has endured.\n  All she is asking the members of this body to do is lift their arm to \ncast one vote--a vote to ban soft money.\n  That's what she's asking, and I urge my colleagues not let her down. \nThe time has past for the excuses, equivocations and evasions that \nmembers of this body have employed time and again to avoid passing \ncampaign finance reform legislation. The time has come to put \npartisanship aside, to put our own ideal reform bills aside and finally \nput our democracy first--let's join Granny D on the road to reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 17, 1998]\n\n                    Campaign Reform: Finish the Job\n\n            (By Nancy Kassebaum Baker and Walter F. Mondale)\n\n       The House's finest moment of this Congress will soon become \n     the Senate's great opportunity. The House's action on \n     campaign finance reform is a demonstration of courage, \n     conviction and bipartisanship. It shows that clear majorities \n     of both houses, when permitted to vote, want to remove the \n     blight of soft money from our national politics. Now it's up \n     to the Senate to complete the job.\n       Soft money, the flood of corporate and union treasury funds \n     and unlimited donations from individuals to national \n     political committees that swamped the 1991 elections with a \n     quarter-billion dollars, undermines protections built by the \n     Congress over the course of a century. Each major safeguard \n     skirted by soft money, beginning with the 1907 ban on \n     corporate treasury donations, resulted from efforts to \n     protect the integrity of American elections.\n       No less is at stake now. The significant House vote cannot \n     be allowed to become just a gesture. The Senate's task--\n     supported by principle and an appreciation of experience, \n     priority and responsibility, is to ensure that this singular \n     achievement of the House becomes a large stride toward \n     enactment of campaign finance reform in this Congress.\n       Principle. A ban on soft money would not introduce any new \n     principle into the law. It would, instead, restore sound \n     principle, long held to be essential. That bedrock principle, \n     developed step by step through measures signed into law by \n     presidents from Theodore Roosevelt to Gerald Ford, is that \n     federal election campaigns should be financed by limited \n     contributions from individuals and not by either corporate or \n     union treasuries. Neither candidates for federal office nor \n     the national political party committees whose primary mission \n     is to elect them, should be dependent on the treasuries of \n     corporations or unions that have strong economic interests in \n     the decisions of the federal government. As for individuals, \n     who should always be the center piece of our national \n     politics, the law should encourage the broadest participation \n     possible, while establishing reasonable limits to avoid \n     disproportionate power by those who can write the biggest \n     checks.\n\n[[Page S12581]]\n\n       Experience. Nearly every major controversy and excess of \n     the last election was related to soft money. If earlier \n     Congresses were unaware of the full consequences of the soft-\n     money loophole, our experience in 1996 and the investigations \n     by this Congress have removed ignorance as a defense for \n     inaction. Legislators are often challenged by the uncertainty \n     of future developments. But to see the future of American \n     elections, one only needs to look at the present and \n     multiply. Soft money in the first year after the 1996 \n     election was raised at twice the rate it was raised four \n     years ago. We are on the way to a half-billion dollars or \n     more in soft money in the 2000 elections.\n       Priority. The urgency of action is clear. Congress should \n     use the shrinking window of time this year to safeguard the \n     next presidential election. In response to the trauma of a \n     president's fall in Watergate, this country struck a bargain \n     with its presidential candidates. Accept public funding in \n     the general election and forgo private fund-raising. Three \n     presidential elections--in 1976, 1980 and 1984--were faithful \n     to that bargain. Now the American taxpayer provides public \n     funding while presidential candidates and their parties \n     engage in an unlimited soft-money arms race. No matter who \n     wins, the country will be diminished if this continues to be \n     the way our presidents are elected.\n       Responsibility. Without authorization by Congress, the \n     Federal Election Commission cracked open the door through \n     which corporate, union and unlimited individual soft-money \n     contributions have poured. But Congress can no longer avoid \n     the responsibility for making the fundamental choice about \n     the basic rules that should govern the financing of federal \n     election campaigns. It should vote to either approve the \n     soft-money system or end it. Either way, to borrow Harry \n     Truman's phrase, Congress must know that the public \n     understands that the buck, literally, stops on Capitol Hill.\n       In sum, this is a time for the Senate to recognize the \n     force of the observation of one of its noted leaders, Everett \n     McKinley Dirksen, who opened the path to enactment of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 by reminding senators of the \n     strength of an idea whose time has come. The time has come--\n     as former presidents Ford, Carter and Bush, hundreds of \n     former members of both parties and majorities in both Houses \n     firmly believe--for Congress to protect the integrity of our \n     national elections. Our common purpose should be no less than \n     to allow the nation to look forward with pride to the \n     character of the new century's first presidential election.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n   Campaign Finance Reform--A Statement by Nancy Kassebaum Baker and \n                             Walter Mondale\n\n                             June 15, 1998\n\n       A year ago, we released an open letter to the President and \n     Congress calling on the Executive and Legislative Branches to \n     debate and act on meaningful campaign finance reform. We \n     included in the open letter our initial recommendation for \n     several reforms--beginning with an end to ``soft money'' \n     contributions to the national parties and their campaign \n     organizations--on which agreement, in our view, could be \n     attained.\n       Now, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of supporters of \n     reform within and outside of the Congress, the House stands \n     at the threshold of an important opportunity. And no one \n     should underestimate how important and urgent its task is.\n       The issue of reform goes to the very heart of American \n     democracy--to the trust and respect citizens can have in \n     elections. Removing soft money will help restore the letter \n     and spirit of existing campaign laws and reassure voters that \n     they can again be the most important participants in \n     elections.\n       Without action by this Congress on soft money, at the \n     current fundraising rate, the 2000 presidential election will \n     have more than a half billion dollars in soft money, double \n     the amount of 1996.\n       Since our June 1997 open letter, we have been joined by \n     hundreds of distinguished Americans who have helped to bring \n     us all to this juncture. Foremost among them are former \n     Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford, and also the 216 former \n     Members of Congress who have signed a joint statement calling \n     for reform.\n       Beyond lending their names to this effort, the former \n     Presidents and former Members, in letters, guest editorials, \n     and statements, have convincingly set forth the urgency and \n     case for reform. The following brings together some of the \n     main ideas that we and others have shared over the last year.\n\n\n  The Primacy of Individual Voters and Their Confidence in Government\n\n       As we wrote in the Los Angeles Times (September 22, 1997), \n     ``Progress on reform is perhaps the most important step that \n     can be taken to restore voter confidence in the ability of \n     all citizens, regardless of wealth, to participate fully in \n     elections. The failure of Congress to act will only deepen \n     voter despair about politics.''\n       In a letter last June, former President Bush said, ``We \n     must encourage the broadest possible participation by \n     individuals in financing elections.'' Former Presidents \n     Carter and Ford, in a joint article in The Washington Post \n     (October 5, 1997) said, ``We must redouble our efforts to \n     assure voters that public policy is determined by the checks \n     on their ballots, rather than the checks from powerful \n     interests.''\n       Former Senator and Republican National Committee Chairman \n     Bill Brock underscored that point in a guest editorial in the \n     Hill (April 29, 1998). ``The basic intent of the campaign \n     finance laws that Congress enacted in the past is quite \n     clear,'' he wrote, ``It is that campaigns should be funded by \n     individuals (not corporations and unions). . . . Because \n     Americans have long believed in individual responsibility as \n     the best antidote to the threats of excesses of wealth and \n     institutional power.'' And, as former Republican Senator Mark \n     Hatfield wrote in the Washington Times (March 26, 1998). \n     ``These prohibitions on corporate and union contributions \n     reflect a basic idea: Individuals should be the dominant \n     force in our political process.''\n       Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times (March 24, 1998), former \n     House Republican Leader Bob Michel and former Representative, \n     Judge, and White House Counsel Abner Mikya, made the point \n     that ``[t]he cost to confidence in government of this \n     breakdown in campaign finance regulation is high.'' Raising \n     soft money, they explained, ``requires the sustained effort \n     of elected and party officials, often one-on-one with donors, \n     to raise--indeed, wrest--the large sums involved in soft \n     money contributions. The entities and people from whom soft \n     money is sought often have enormous economic stakes in \n     government decisions. Corporate and other soft money donors \n     frankly say they feel shaken down.''\n       Former Presidents Ford and Carter forcefully noted that \n     soft money ``is one of the most corrupting influences in \n     modern elections because there is no limit on the size of \n     donations--thus giving disproportionate influence to those \n     with the deepest pockets.''\n\n\n                        Impact on the Presidency\n\n       As former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter \n     expressed, it is vital for Congress ``to seize this \n     opportunity for reform now so it can improve the next \n     presidential election.''\n       Writing last week in the San Francisco Chronicle (June 3, \n     1998), former Representative and White House Chief of Staff \n     Leon Panetta described the bargain the nation struck with its \n     presidential candidates in 1974: in return for public \n     financing of presidential elections, candidates would forego \n     fundraising in general elections. ``. . . the elections of \n     1976, 1980 and 1984 elections showed that national elections \n     could be run with fidelity to that bargain.''\n       Time is of the essence. As Leon Panetta observed, ``As \n     difficult as the chances may seem, this Congress remains the \n     best hope for enabling the nation to begin the new century \n     with a presidential election of which it can be proud.''\n       As former Reps. Bob Michel and Abner Mikva observed about \n     the coming House debate, ``Either [the House] will act to end \n     the scourge of soft money'' or it ``will do nothing about \n     letting the next presidential election become the biggest \n     auction the country ever has know.''\n\n\n                     Restoring Congressional Intent\n\n       ``Congress never authorized soft money. ``Bill Brock wrote \n     as he called on Congress to ``restore the spirit and the \n     letter of election laws dating back decades,'' Reps. Michel \n     and Mikva said, ``Congress never agreed to the creation of \n     soft money. The loophole is a product of exceptions allowed \n     by the Federal Election Commission that were expanded by \n     aggressive fund-raising by both parties.''\n       Congress should decide whether it supports reforms dating \n     back to the beginning of the Century. ``It's time for \n     lawmakers to say whether soft money is good or bad for the \n     system,'' Brock said.\n\n\n                         strengthening parties\n\n       Bill Brock, writing from the perspective of a former party \n     chairman, dispelled the myth that soft money strengthens \n     parties. ``In truth, parties were strongest and closer to \n     their roots before the advent of this loophole than they are \n     today.'' Far from reinvigorating the parties themselves,'' he \n     observed, ``soft money has simply strengthened certain \n     specific candidates and the few donors who can make huge \n     contributions, while distracting parties from traditional \n     grassroots work.''\n       Or, as we wrote in Roll Call (February 26, 1998), ``no one \n     can seriously say more people vote or participate because of \n     soft money. In fact, as soft money has skyrocketed, voter \n     turnout has continued to decline.''\n       ``Without soft money,'' we continued, ``the parties will \n     have to work harder to raise money. But the benefits gained--\n     by increasing the public's faith in democracy and reducing \n     the arms race for cash--will far outweigh the cost.''\n\n\n                         focusing on priorities\n\n       A consistent theme of our efforts, together with the former \n     Presidents and other former Members, is that it is essential \n     to take a first step toward reform, even while recognizing \n     that further steps will need to be taken in the years ahead. \n     Thus, as we wrote last July in The Washington Post (July 18, \n     1997), Congress ``should not delay action on those measures \n     that can pass now.'' Or, as former Senator Al Simpson wrote \n     in The Boston Globe (February 24, 1998), ``[Banning soft \n     money] won't solve all the problems, but it sure will be a \n     start, and it may even provide a sensible and responsible \n     foundation on which many additional thoughtful reforms can be \n     built. . . .''\n       And as the statement of more than 200 former members \n     elaborates, ``we believe it is time to test the merits of \n     different or competing ideas through debate and votes, but\n\n[[Page S12582]]\n\n     that any disagreement over further reforms should not delay \n     enactment of essential measures, beginning with a ban on soft \n     money, where agreement is within reach.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, here we are again. I think it is \nappropriate to say that campaign finance is a clinical term for \n``constitutional freedom.''\n  Make no mistake, the essence of this debate is indeed freedom--\nfundamental first amendment freedom of speech and association \nguaranteed to every American, citizen group, candidate, and party. That \nis the view of the U.S. Supreme Court, the view of the American Civil \nLiberties Union, and the view of most Republicans. Soft money, issue \nadvocacy, express advocacy, PACs, and all the rest are nothing more \nthan euphemisms for first-amendment-protected political speech and \nassociation means of amplifying one's voice in this vast Nation of 270 \nmillion people.\n  It is important to remember that Dan Rather and Peter Jennings have a \nlot of speech, and the editorial page of the New York Times has a big \naudience. But the typical American citizen and the typical candidate, \nunless he or she can amass the resources to project their voices to a \nlarger audience, just simply doesn't have as much speech as the press. \nSo the means to amplify one's voice in this vast Nation of 270 million \npeople is critical and constitutionally protected. It is no more \ncomplicated than that and no less vital to our democracy than the \nfreedom of the press, which has taken a great interest in this issue.\n  Just thinking of the New York Times editorial page, for example, I \nthink they have had 113 editorials on this subject since the beginning \nof 1997. That is an average of about one every nine days--issue \nadvocacy, if you will, paid for by corporate soft money, expressing \ntheir view, which they have a right to do, on this important issue \nbefore us.\n  But as we look at this long odyssey of campaign finance reform, we \nhave come a long way in the last decade, those of us who see through \nthe reform patina--from the push 10 years ago for taxpayer financing of \ncongressional campaigns and spending limits, and even such lunacy as \ntaxpayer-financed entitlement programs for candidates to counteract \nindependent expenditures, a truly bizarre scheme long gone from the \ncongressional proposals but now echoed, interestingly enough, in the \ncampaign reform platform of Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, who \nadvocates a 100-percent tax--a 100-percent tax on issue advocacy. So if \nyou were so audacious as to go out and want to express yourself on an \nissue, the Government would levy a 100-percent tax on your expression \nand give the money to whoever the Government thought was entitled to \nrespond to it--a truly loony idea.\n  That was actually in the campaign finance bills we used to debate in \nthe late 1980s and early 1990s and now is in the platform of one of the \ncandidates for President of the United States, believe it or not.\n  So it was just 2 years ago that spending limits were thrown overboard \nfrom the McCain-Feingold bill and that the PAC and bundling bans were \nthrown overboard as well. Now the focus becomes solely directed at \ncitizens groups and parties, which is the form McCain-Feingold took \nlast year. Now, this month, the McCain-Feingold odyssey has arrived at \nthe point that if it were whittled down any further, only the effective \ndate would remain. As it is, McCain-Feingold now amounts to an \neffective date on an ineffectual provision.\n  Obviously, it is not surprising that that is my view. But it is also \nthe view of the League of Women Voters, which opposes the current \nversion of McCain-Feingold.\n  To achieve what proponents of this legislation profess to want to \nachieve--a reduction of special interest influence--if you want to do \nthat, I think that is not a good idea at all, it is blatantly \nunconstitutional and the wrong thing to do. But if you wanted to do it, \nyou would certainly have to deal with all the avenues of participation, \nnot just political parties. Nonparty soft money as well as party soft \nmoney, independent expenditures, candidate spending--all of the \ngimmicks advanced through the years in the guise of reform--all would \nhave to be treated, if you truly wanted to quiet the voices of all of \nthese citizens, which is what the reformers initially sought to do.\n\n  The latest and leanest version of McCain-Feingold falls far short of \nthat which would be needed if you were inclined to want to do this sort \nof thing to limit special interest influence. As the League of Women \nVoters contends--mind you, there is the first time I have ever agreed \nwith them on anything--as they contend, you would have to treat all of \nthe special interests if you were truly interested in quieting the \nvoices of all of these Americans who belong to groups.\n  It could not be more clear that this sort of McCain-Feingold-light \nthat is currently before us is designed only to penalize the parties \nand to shift the influence to other avenues. That is precisely what it \nwould do. It could not be more clear. Prohibiting only party soft money \naccomplishes absolutely nothing. It is only fodder for press releases \nand would make the present system worse and not better.\n  That is quite aside from the matter of unconstitutionality and \nwhether the parties have less first amendment rights to engage in soft \nmoney activities than other groups. If this were to be enacted, that \nissue would surely be settled by the Supreme Court, which is, of \ncourse, the Catch-22 of the reformers. The choice is between the \nineffectual unconstitutional and the comprehensively unconstitutional. \nA younger generation would call that a choice between ``dumb and \ndumber.''\n  For reality ever to square with reformer rhetoric, the Constitution \nwould have to be amended and political speech specifically carved out \nof the first amendment scope of protection.\n  There are those in this body who have actually proposed amending the \nConstitution. We had that debate in March of 1997. And, believe it or \nnot, 38 Senators out of 100 voted to do just that--to amend the first \namendment for the first time in 200 years to give the Government the \npower to restrict all spending, and in support of or in opposition to \ncandidates. The ACLU calls that a ``recipe for repression.'' But that \ngot 38 votes. You could at least give those people credit for honesty. \nThey understand that in order to do what the reformers seek to do, you \nreally would have to change the first amendment for the first time in \n200 years.\n  So what the McCain-Feingold saga comes down to is an effort to have \nthe Government control all spending by, in support of, or in opposition \nto candidates, with a little loophole carving out the media's own \nspending, of course.\n  That this effort is allowed to be advanced as reform is one of the \ntragedies of our time. Fortunately, enough Senators on this side of the \naisle have had the courage to forestall this assault on freedom for the \npast decade and have proven by example that there is a constituency for \nprotecting constitutional freedom.\n  Let me just say there is an excellent letter from the American Civil \nLiberties Union--a group that is an equal opportunity defender for an \nawful lot of Americans but is truly America's experts on the first \namendment--to me, which I just got yesterday, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The ACLU is writing to express its \n     opposition to the new, seemingly watered-down McCain-Feingold \n     bill. While it is true that the most obvious direct \n     legislative attacks on issue advocacy have been removed from \n     this bill, S. 1593 continues to abridge the First Amendment \n     rights of those who want to support party issue advocacy. The \n     soft money restrictions proposed in S. 1593 are just another, \n     less direct way to restrain issue advocacy and should \n     therefore be opposed.\n\n\n           Concerns About Soft Money Restrictions in S. 1593\n\n       Soft money is funding that does not support express \n     advocacy of the election or defeat of federal candidates, \n     even though it may exert an attenuated influence on the \n     outcome of a federal election. In other words, everything \n     that is not hard money (express advocacy dollars) is soft \n     money. Thus, soft money includes party funds and issue \n     advocacy dollars.\n       Party soft money sustains primary political activity such \n     as candidate recruitment,\n\n[[Page S12583]]\n\n     get-out-the-vote drives and issue advertising. While \n     candidate-focused contributions and expenditures and \n     ``express advocacy'' can be subject to various restrictions \n     or regulations, the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 \n     U.S. 1 (1976) held that all speech which does not ``in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate'' shall remain free from the same \n     regulations that apply to hard money. ``So long as persons \n     and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate \n     the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, \n     they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the \n     candidate and his views.'' 424 U.S. at 45 (emphasis \n     supplied).\n       Indeed, the unrestricted use of soft money by political \n     parties and non-party organizations like labor unions has \n     been invited by Buckley and acknowledged by the Supreme \n     Court. In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. \n     Federal Election Commission, 116 S.Ct. 2309 (1996), the Court \n     upheld unlimited ``hard money'' independent expenditures by \n     political parties on behalf of their candidates.\n       In Colorado, the Brennan Center provided the Court \n     extensive charts and graphs detailing large individual and \n     corporate soft money contributions to the two major \n     parties that they asserted threatened the integrity of the \n     FECA's federal contribution restrictions. (Brief, p. 8) \n     Notwithstanding this `'evidence,'' the Court stated:\n       ``We recognize that FECA permits individuals to contribute \n     more money ($20,000) to a party than to a candidate ($1,000) \n     or to other political committees ($5,000). . . . We also \n     recognize that FECA permits unregulated ``soft money'' \n     contributions to a party for certain activities, such as \n     electing candidates for state office . . . or for voter \n     registration and ``get out the vote'' drives. . . . But the \n     opportunity for corruption posed by these greater \n     opportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated.'' \n     Id. at 2316.\n       Restricting soft money contributions alone will only force \n     more dollars into other forms of speech beyond the reach of \n     campaign finance laws. Soft money restrictions also give even \n     more power to the media to influence voters' choices and to \n     characterize candidate records. If S. 1593 is adopted, less \n     money will be available to parties to assert the platform \n     embraced by candidates and non-candidate party members. A \n     soft money ban will not solve the problem that candidates now \n     have, which is the dearth of hard dollars available to run \n     competitive campaigns. Because contribution limits have \n     remained unchanged since the 1970's it is no wonder that \n     other avenues (party soft money and issue advocacy soft \n     money) have been exploited to influence the outcome of \n     elections.\n       Te goal of the Common Cause-type reform advocates is to \n     find all sources of money that may conceivably influence the \n     outcome of elections and place them under the control of the \n     Federal Election Commission. It is not possible within our \n     constitutional framework to limit and regulate all forms of \n     political speech. Further, it seems rather arrogant that some \n     members of Congress believe that the candidates and the press \n     alone should have unlimited power to characterize the \n     candidates and their records. The rest of us must be silent \n     bystanders denied our First Amendment rights to have our \n     voices amplified by funding issue and party speech. \n     Disclosure, rather than limitation, of large soft money \n     contributions of political parties, is the more appropriate \n     and less restrictive alternative.\n       Rather than assess how the limit driven approach caused our \n     current campaign finance woes, we are asked to believe the \n     fiction that the incremental limits approach in S. 1593 is \n     the solution. The ACLU is forced to agree with the League of \n     Women Voters who wisely withdrew their support for this \n     legislation (albeit for different reasons) and asserted, ``. \n     . . the overall system may actually be made worse by this \n     bill.''\n\n\n                  concerns about potential amendments\n\n                      Issue advocacy restrictions\n\n       Because issue ads generated from party and non-party \n     sources have provoked the consternation of many members of \n     Congress and so-called reform groups, it is likely that \n     Senators will have the opportunity to vote on amendments that \n     restrict issue advocacy. We urge the Senate to reject \n     restrictions on issue advocacy because they violate the \n     Constitution.\n       The Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo well understood the \n     risks that overly broad campaign finance regulations could \n     pose to electoral democracy. The Court said, ``[discussion of \n     public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates \n     are integral to the operation of the system of government \n     established by our Constitution.'' 424 U.S. at 14. The Court \n     recognized that ``the distinction between discussion of \n     issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of \n     candidates may often dissolve in practical application. \n     Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to \n     public issues involving legislative proposals and \n     governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the \n     basis of their positions on various public issues, but \n     campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.'' \n     424 U.S. at 43. If any discussion of a candidate in the \n     context of discussion of an issue rendered the speaker \n     subject to campaign finance controls, the consequences for \n     free discussion would be intolerable and speakers would be \n     compelled ``to hedge and trim,'' Id., quoting Thomas v. \n     Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 535 (1945).\n       The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to \n     safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even \n     though such discussion might influence the outcome of an \n     election. The doctrine provides a hard, bright-line, \n     objective test that protects political speech and association \n     by focusing solely on the content of the speaker's words, not \n     the motive in the speaker's mind or the impact of the \n     speaker's opinions, or the proximity to an election, or the \n     phase of the moon. The doctrine marks the boundary of \n     permissible regulation and frees issue advocacy from any \n     permissible restraint.\n       The Buckley Court could not have been more clear about the \n     need for that bright line test which focuses solely on the \n     speaker's words and which is now an integral part of settled \n     First Amendment doctrine. It was designed to protect issue \n     discussion and advocacy by allowing independent groups of \n     citizens to comment on and criticize the performance of \n     elected officials without becoming ensnared in the federal \n     campaign finance laws. And it permits issue discussion to go \n     forward at the time that it is most vital in a democracy: \n     during an election season.\n       Although not as sweeping as other proposals, we believe \n     that the Snowe-Jeffords amendment restricting issue advocacy \n     should be opposed for the reasons stated above.\n\n           Specific Problems with the Shays-Meehan Substitute\n\n       It is our understanding the Sen. Tom Daschle (D, SD) and \n     Sen. Robert Torricelli (D, NJ) will offer the House passed \n     version of Shays-Meehan, H.R. 417. We urge Senators to vote \n     against this measure. Shays-Meehan has a chilling affect on \n     issue group speech that is essential in a democracy. H.R. 417 \n     contains the harshest and most unconstitutional controls on \n     issue advocacy groups.\n       This bill contains a permanent year-round restriction on \n     issue advocacy achieved through redefining express advocacy \n     in an unconstitutionally vague and over-broad manner. The \n     Supreme Court has held that only express advocacy, narrowly \n     defined, can be subject to campaign finance controls. The key \n     to the existing definition of express advocacy is the \n     inclusion of an explicit directive to vote for or vote \n     against a candidate. Minus the explicit directive or so-\n     called ``bright-line'' test, what will constitute express \n     advocacy will be in the eye of the beholder, in this case the \n     Federal Election Commission (FEC). Few non-profit issue \n     groups will want to risk their tax status or incur legal \n     expenses to engage in speech that could be interpreted by the \n     FEC to have an influence on the outcome of an election.\n       It requires a two-month black-out on all television and \n     radio issue advertising before the primary and general \n     elections. The bill's statutory limitations on issue advocacy \n     would force groups that now engage in issue advocacy--\n     501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s--to create new institutional \n     entities--PACs--in order to ``legally'' speak within 60 days \n     before an election. Groups would also be forced to disclose \n     or identify all contributors to the new PAC. For \n     organizations like the ACLU, this will mean individuals will \n     stop contributing rather than risk publicity about their \n     gift. The opportunities that donors now have to contribute \n     anonymously to our efforts to highlight issues during \n     elections would be eliminated. (This is a special concern for \n     groups that advocate unpopular or divisive causes. See NAACP \n     v. Alabama 357 U.S. 449(1958).) For many non-profits, being \n     forced to establish PACs entails a significant and costly \n     burden, one that can change the very character of the \n     organization. Separate accounting procedures, new legal \n     compliance costs and separate administrative processes would \n     be imposed on these groups--a high price to exercise their \n     First Amendment rights to comment on candidate records. It is \n     very likely that some groups will remain silent rather than \n     risk violating this new requirement or absorbing the \n     attendant cost of compliance. The only entities that will be \n     able to characterize a candidate's record on radio and \n     television during this 60-day period will be the candidates, \n     PACs and the media. Yet, the period when non-PAC issue groups \n     are locked out is the very time when everyone is paying \n     attention! Further, members of Congress need only wait until \n     the last 60 days before an election (as it often does now) to \n     vote for legislation or engage in controversial behavior, so \n     that their actions are beyond the reach of public comment \n     and, therefore, effectively immune from citizen criticism.\n       Shays-Meehan contains a misleading exception for candidate \n     voting records. The voting records that would be permitted \n     under this new statute would be stripped of any advocacy-like \n     commentary. For example, depending on its wording, the ACLU \n     might be banned from distributing a voting guide that \n     highlights members of Congress who have a 100 percent ACLU \n     voting records as members of an ``ACLU Honor Role.'' Unless \n     the ACLU chose to create a PAC to publish such guides, we \n     would be barred by this statute even though we do not \n     expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. \n     Courts have clearly held that such a result is an \n     unacceptable or unconstitutional restraint on issue-oriented \n     speech.\n       It redefines ``expenditure,'' ``contribution'' and \n     ``coordination with a candidate'' so that heretofore legal \n     and constitutionally protected activities of issue advocacy \n     groups would become illegal. Let's say, for example, that the \n     ACLU decided to place an ad\n\n[[Page S12584]]\n\n     lauding, by name, Representatives or Senators for the \n     effective advocacy of constitutional campaign finance reform. \n     That ad would be counted as express advocacy on behalf of the \n     named Congresspersons under H.R. 417 and would be effectively \n     prohibited. If the ACLU checked with key congressional \n     offices to determine when this reform measure was coming to \n     the floor so the placement of the ad would be timely--that \n     would be an ``expenditure'' counted as a ``contribution'' to \n     the named officials and it would be deemed ``coordinated with \n     the candidate.'' An expanded definition of coordination \n     chills legal and appropriate issue group-candidate \n     discussion.\n       If these very same restrictions outlined above were imposed \n     on the media, we would have a national First Amendment crisis \n     of huge proportions. Yet, newspapers such as the Washington \n     Post, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and other \n     media outlets relentlessly editorialize in favor of Shays-\n     Meehan--a proposal that blatantly chills free speech rights \n     of others, but not their own. Let's suppose Congress \n     constrained editorial boards in a similar fashion. Any time \n     news outlets ran an editorial--60 days before an election or \n     otherwise--mentioned the name of a candidate, the law now \n     required them to disclose the author of the editorial, the \n     amount of money spent to distribute the editorial and the \n     names of the owners of the newspaper of the FEC, or risk \n     prosecution. The media powerhouses would engage in a frenzy \n     of protest, and you could count on the ACLU challenging such \n     restraints on free speech. Yet, the press has as much if not \n     more influence on the outcome of elections as all issue \n     advocacy groups combined. Some voters are more likely go to \n     the polls with their newspaper's candidate endorsements \n     wrapped under their arm than carrying other issue group \n     literature into the voting booth.\n       The Shays-Meehan bill contains misguided and \n     unconstitutional restrictions on issue group speech and only \n     works to further empower the media to influence the outcome \n     of elections. None of the proposals seek to regulate the \n     ability of the media--print, electronic, broadcast or cable--\n     to exercise its enormous power to direct news coverage and \n     editorialize in favor or against candidates. This would be \n     clearly unconstitutional. It is equally unconstitutional to \n     effectively chill and eliminate citizen group advocacy. It is \n     scandalous that Congress would muzzle issue groups in such a \n     fashion.\n       Finally, the ACLU has to be especially watchful of the \n     Federal Elections Commission because it is a federal agency \n     whose primary purpose is to monitor political speech. If \n     Congress gives the FEC the authority to decide what \n     constitutes ``true'' issue advocacy versus ``sham'' issue \n     advocacy, the FEC is then empowered to become ``Big Brother'' \n     of the worst Kind. Already, it has been, far too often, an \n     agency in the business of investigating and prosecuting \n     political speech. The FEC would have to develop a huge \n     apparatus that would be in the full-time business of \n     determining which communications are considered unlawful \n     ``electioneering'' by citizens and non-profit groups. \n     Further, Shays-Meehan contains harsh penalties for failure \n     to comply with the new laws.\n\nRestrictions on the First Amendment Rights of Legal Permanent Residents \n                                 (LPRs)\n\n       Lawful permanent residents are stakeholders in our society. \n     They send their children to our schools, pay taxes on their \n     worldwide income, and like citizens, must register for the \n     draft and serve if the draft is re-instituted. In fact, \n     nearly 20,000 lawful permanent residents now serve \n     voluntarily in the military. By no stretch of the imagination \n     is their money ``foreign money.'' Lawful permanent residents \n     must reside in the U.S. or they forfeit their green cards and \n     right to remain. Moreover, the courts have repeatedly held \n     that non-citizens in the United States have First Amendment \n     rights, and this should include the right to make campaign \n     contributions.\n       The Shays-Meehan campaign finance bill was amended to bar \n     campaign contributions and expenditures from lawful permanent \n     residents. It virtually guarantees that candidates and their \n     campaign organizations will discriminate against new \n     Americans because it threatens them with substantial \n     penalties if they accept a donation they ``should have \n     known'' came from a non-citizen. We urge you to reject any \n     amendment to the McCain-Feingold bill that would bar such \n     contributions.\n\n                 Internet Political Speech Restrictions\n\n       We urge the Senate to support an amendment by Senator \n     Robert Bennett (R, UT) that would prohibit the FEC from \n     imposing restrictions on Internet commentary on candidates \n     and their positions on issues. Attached is an ACLU press \n     release that illustrates the draconian nature of FEC \n     restrictions on free expression on the Internet.\n\n                         Our Proposed Solutions\n\n       The ACLU believes that there is a less drastic and \n     constitutionally offensive way to achieve reform: public \n     financing.\n       If you believe that the public policy process is distorted \n     by candidates' growing dependence on large contributions then \n     you should help qualified candidates mount competitive \n     campaigns--especially if they lack personal wealth or cannot \n     privately raise large sums of money. Difficult questions have \n     to be resolved about how to deal with soft money and \n     independent expenditures. Some of these outcomes are \n     constrained by constitutionally based court decisions.\n       But notwithstanding the nay-sayers who say public financing \n     is dead on arrival, we should remember that we once had a \n     system where private citizens and political parties printed \n     their own ballots. It later became clear that to protect the \n     integrity of the electoral process ballots had to be printed \n     and paid for by the government. For the same reason the \n     public treasury pays for voting machines, polling booths and \n     registrars and the salaries of elected officials. In \n     conclusion, we take it as a fundamental premise that \n     elections are a public not a private process--a process at \n     the very heart of democracy. If we are fed up with a system \n     that allows too much private influence and personal and \n     corporate wealth to prevail then we should complete the task \n     by making public elections publicly financed.\n           Sincerely\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director, Washington Office.\n     Joel Gora,\n       Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School and Counsel to the \n     ACLU.\n     Gregory Nojeim,\n       Legislative Counsel.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me read some of the letter.\n\n       The AFL-CIO is writing to express its opposition to the new \n     seemingly watered down McCain-Feingold bill. While it is true \n     that the most obvious direct legislative attacks on issue \n     advocacy have been removed from the bill, S. 1593 continues \n     to abridge the first amendment rights of those who want to \n     support party issue advocacy. The soft money restrictions \n     proposed in S. 1593 are just another less direct way to \n     restrain issue advocacy and therefore should be opposed.\n\n  I think that, plus the balance of the letter, sums up the \nconstitutional arguments against the latest version of McCain-Feingold.\n  Earlier it had been my hope there would be an amendment offered by \nthe other side. Seeing that is not the case, I am prepared to move \nforward and lay down the first amendment of this debate in which we are \nengaged.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2293\n\n    (Purpose: To require Senators to report credible information of \ncorruption to the Select Committee on Ethics and amend title 18, United \n  States Code, to provide for mandatory minimum bribery penalties for \n                           public officials)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

BRIBERY PENALTIES FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS.\n\n       Section 201(b) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting before the period at the end the following: ``, \n     except that, with respect to a person who violates paragraph \n     (2), the amount of the fine under this subsection shall be \n     not less than $100,000, the term of imprisonment shall be not \n     less than 1 year, and such person shall be disqualified from \n     holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the \n     United States''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin is here. We \nwant to talk a little bit in the course of this debate on the amendment \nthat I sent to the desk about the issue of corruption. There have been \na lot of charges of corruption both on and off the floor. I think these \nare very serious charges and I think they warrant some discussion, not \nonly for our colleagues but for the members of the public who are \ninterested in this issue.\n\n[[Page S12585]]\n\n  My colleague from Arizona gave a moving speech in Bedford, NH, a few \nmonths ago to kick off his Presidential campaign. In that speech, my \nfriend from Arizona laid out his vision of America with strong, and I \nmust say, compelling statements about what he firmly believes to be \ncorruption in American politics. If there is one thing that is often \nsaid about our colleague from Arizona, it is that he is a straight \nshooter and that he calls it as he sees it. I certainly wouldn't argue \nwith that.\n  Based on the Senator's speech in New Hampshire and his remarks about \nhis legislation, I assume I am correct in inferring that the Senator \nfrom Arizona believes the legislative process has been corrupted. I \nthink he said that in the Wall Street Journal today. I don't believe I \nam misquoting him. I hope I am not. I see his staffer on the floor. I \ndon't want to be talking about your boss in his absence, and I hope I \nam not misquoting him. I certainly hope he will come back to the floor \nfor this debate.\n  What I will do is run through a few of the recent statements of the \nSenator from Arizona about corruption to be sure that the Senate fully \nunderstands his strongly held views on this subject.\n  Again, I encourage my friend from Arizona to come back to the floor \nbecause I certainly don't want to be talking about him in his absence, \nalthough I will say these quotes are quite precise and I assure him \nthat I am not misquoting his observations in any way.\n  The Senator from Arizona, in discussing the subject of campaign \nfinance reform in Bedford, NH, on June 30 of this year said:\n\n       I think most Republicans understand that soft money, the \n     enormous sums of money given to both parties by just about \n     every special interest in the country, corrupts our political \n     ideals, whether it comes from big business or from labor \n     bosses and trial lawyers.\n\n  Quoting further from my friend from Arizona, he says:\n\n       In truth, we are all shortchanged by soft money, liberal \n     and conservative alike. All of our ideals are sacrificed. We \n     are all corrupted. I know this is a harsh judgment, [says \n     Senator McCain] but it is, I'm sorry to say, a fair one.\n\n  So the principal quote from my friend from Arizona is that ``We are \nall corrupted.''\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Pork barrel spending is a direct result of unlimited \n     contributions from special interests.\n\n  My friend from Arizona, also on CNN Early Edition, July 1 of this \nyear, said:\n\n       We have seen debasement of the institutions of government, \n     including the corruption of Congress because of the influence \n     of special interests.\n\n  Further, my friend from Arizona said:\n\n       Soft money is corrupting the process.\n\n  Then on Fox News, Sunday, on June 27 of this year, my friend from \nArizona said:\n\n       I talked to Republicans all over America, including up here \n     in New Hampshire, and when I tell them about the corruption \n     that exists they nod their heads.\n\n  My friend from Arizona goes on:\n\n       I think that Americans don't hold us in the esteem and with \n     the respect that the profession deserves and that's because \n     the profession has become permeated with special interests, \n     which have caused corruption, which have then caused them to \n     lose confidence in government.\n\n  And the Senator from Arizona went on:\n\n       I'm trying to eliminate the soft money which has corrupted \n     our legislative process, and I think soft money has permeated \n     American politics. It has corrupted the process and it has to \n     be eliminated.\n\n  And then in New Hampshire on July 3:\n\n       Young people think politicians are corrupt. Know what? We \n     are [said the Senator from Arizona] all corrupt.\n\n  Then on This Week on ABC, October 3, 1999, George Will said to the \nSenator from Arizona:\n\n       Have you ever been or can you name a Republican who has \n     ever been corrupted by the Republican National Committee?\n\n  The Senator from Arizona said:\n\n       Not by the Republican National Committee, but all of us \n     have been corrupted by the process where big money and big \n     influence--and you can include me in the list where big money \n     has bought access which has bought influence. Anybody who \n     glances at the so-called 1996 Telecommunications Reform Act \n     and then looks at the results--which is an increase in cable \n     rates, phone rates, mergers, and lack of competition--clearly \n     knows that the special interests are protected in Washington \n     at the public. And the public interest is submerged.\n\n  George Will said:\n\n       This is soft money to parties, that itself leads to \n     corruption of Republicans?\n\n  And the Senator from Arizona says:\n\n       Of course it does, George, and you work there and you see \n     it.\n\n  Now my colleague from Arizona, on the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \nsaid:\n\n       During hearings for the 1996 Telecommunications Act, every \n     company affected by the legislation had purchased a seat at \n     the table with soft money.\n\n  Now that was in a Bedford, NH, speech of June 30 of this year.\n  Referring now to the web site of my colleague from Arizona, there are \ncharts that list accusations and lists of projects. Let me quote from \nthe web site:\n\n       In the last several years while Republicans have controlled \n     Congress, special interest earmarks in appropriations bills \n     have dramatically increased. The rise in pork barrel spending \n     is directly related to the rise of soft money, as Republicans \n     and Democrats scramble to reward major donors to our \n     campaigns.\n\n  Straight from the web site, ``It's Your Country.'' And then there are \nprojects listed as examples of projects presumably inserted into bills \nas a result of soft money contributions.\n  There is $26 million to compensate fishermen, fish processors, and \nfishing crews negatively affected by restrictions on fishing in Glacier \nBay National Park, and $70 million for expanding a livestock assistance \nprogram to include reindeer, both those projects in Alaska, projects \nwhich--I assume the allegation is--were inserted in a bill as a result \nof a soft money contribution, which, as we all know, can only go to \npolitical parties.\n  In the State of Utah, the site lists $2.2 million for sewer \ninfrastructure associated with the 2002 winter games in Utah as an \nexample of an appropriations insertion, presumably as a result of some \nsoft money contribution to a political party.\n  Then it lists the State of Washington, $1.3 million for the WTO \nMinisterial Meeting in Seattle, WA, and an exemption for the Crown \nJewel Mine, in Washington, to deposit mining waste on land adjacent to \nthe mine.\n  Further, on September 26, 1999, the Daily Outrage from the web site \nsays:\n\n       The largest producer of ethanol, Archer-Daniels-Midland \n     Corporation, who gave lavishly to both political parties--for \n     their contribution, ADM recently received an extension of \n     ethanol subsidies totaling $75 million. It also suggested \n     that ADM also benefits from sugar support programs that keep \n     the price of corn syrup artificially high. This sweetheart \n     deal gets ADM another $200 million a year.\n\n  Then today in the Wall Street Journal, the Senator from Arizona says:\n\n       In the past several years, while Republicans controlled \n     Congress, earmarks in appropriations bills have dramatically \n     increased. The reason for this pork barrel spending is that \n     Republicans and Democrats are scrambling to reward major \n     donors to their campaigns.\n\n  The Senator from Arizona, I see, is on the floor. I am just \ninterested in engaging in some discussion here about what \nspecifically--which specific Senators he believes have been engaged in \ncorruption.\n  I know he said from time to time the process is corrupted. But I \nthink it is important to note, for there to be corruption, someone must \nbe corrupt. Someone must be corrupt for there to be corruption.\n  So I just ask my friend from Arizona what he has in mind here, in \nsuggesting that corruption is permeating our body and listing these \nprojects for the benefit of several States as examples.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Recently there was a book written by Elizabeth Drew \ncalled ``The Corruption of American Politics.'' I commend it to the \nreading of the Senator from Kentucky. In chapter 4 titled ``The Money \nCulture,'' she says:\n\n       Indisputably, the greatest change in Washington over the \n     past twenty-five years--in its culture, in the way it does \n     business, and the ever-burgeoning amount of business \n     transactions that go on here--has been in the preoccupation \n     with money.\n\n[[Page S12586]]\n\n       Striving for and obtaining money has become the predominant \n     activity--and not just in electoral politics--and its effects \n     are pernicious. The culture of money dominates Washington as \n     never before; money now rivals or even exceeds power as the \n     preeminent goal. It affects the issues raised and their \n     outcome; it has changed employment patterns in Washington; it \n     has transformed politics; and it has subverted values. It has \n     led good people to do things that are morally questionable, \n     if not reprehensible. It has cut a deep gash, if not \n     inflicted a mortal wound, in the concept of public service.\n\n  That is basically what Elizabeth Drew, who has been around this town \nfor many years, said in her book. She states:\n\n       Private interests have tried to influence legislative and \n     administrative outcomes through the use of money for a long \n     time. The great Daniel Webster was on retainer from the Bank \n     of the United States and at the same time was one of its \n     greatest defenders in the Congress. But never before in the \n     modern age has political money played the pervasive role that \n     it does now. By comparison, the Watergate period seems almost \n     quaint.\n       There was a time when people came to Washington out of a \n     spirit of public service and idealism. Engendering this \n     spirit was one of John F. Kennedy's most important \n     contributions. Then Richard Nixon, picking up from George \n     Wallace, and then Ronald Reagan, in particular, derided \n     ``federal bureaucrats.'' The spirit of public service was \n     stepped on, but not entirely extinguished.\n       But more than ever, Washington has become a place where \n     people come or remain in order to benefit financially from \n     their government service. (A similar thing could be said of \n     journalists--and nonjournalists fresh out of government \n     service--who package themselves as writers, television \n     performers, and highly paid speakers at conventions.)\n\n  I have for many years had a set of criteria indicating that which I \nhave said we cannot, should not, abide. Perhaps a lot of it is because \nI am a member of authorizing committees. I took the floor here just a \ncouple of hours ago to talk about $6.4 billion that was added to the \nDefense appropriations bill. I will have to get the statement again to \nrefresh myself with the specific numbers, but $92 million was for \nmilitary construction projects which had not been authorized--no \nhearing, nothing whatsoever that had to do with the authorizing \nfollowed by the appropriating process.\n  I worked with a number of organizations: Citizens Against Government \nWaste, Citizens For A Sound Economy, and other organizations in \nWashington that are watchdog organizations. We developed a set of \ncriteria. Those criteria have to do with: Whether it was requested in \nthe President's budget, whether there was an authorization, whether \nthere was a hearing, et cetera. There are a number. They are on their \nway over, the criteria I have used for many years.\n  Because when you bypass the authorizing and appropriating process, \nyou obviously do not, No. 1, abide by the prescribed way we are \nsupposed to do business around here; but then it opens up to improper \nprocedures.\n  We have 12,000 enlisted families on food stamps. Yet we will spend \n$92 million, and other funds, on programs that the Secretary of Defense \nsays specifically are not of the priority on which to be spending \nmoney:\n\n       I have said for 10 years I have reviewed annual \n     appropriations bills to determine whether they contain items \n     that are low priority, unnecessary, or wasteful spending. In \n     this process I have used five objective criteria to identify \n     programs and projects that have not been appropriately \n     reviewed in the normal merit-based prioritization process.\n       These criteria are: Unauthorized appropriations, \n     unrequested locality-specific earmarks, research-facility-\n     specific earmarks, and other earmarks that would circumvent \n     the formal competitive award process, budget add-ons that \n     would be subject to a budget point of order, transfer or \n     disposal of Federal property or items under terms that \n     circumvent existing law, and new items that were added in \n     conference that were never considered in either bill in \n     either House.\n\n  The web site goes on to say:\n\n       Senator McCain's criteria are not intended to reflect a \n     judgment on the merits of an item. They are designed to \n     identify projects that have not been considered in an \n     appropriate merit-based prioritization process.\n\n  I do not intend to let this debate, which is about banning soft \nmoney, get into some kind of personal discussion here. I simply will \nnot do it, except to say that Elizabeth Drew has it right. Many other \npeople who judge this town have it right. The fact is, there is a \npernicious effect of money on the legislative process.\n  I refuse to, and would not in any way, say that any individual or \nperson is guilty of corruption in a specific way, nor identify them, \nbecause that would defeat--\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to finish.\n  That would defeat the purpose because, as I have said many times \nbefore, this system makes good people do bad things. It makes good \npeople do bad things. That is to go around the process which is \nprescribed for the Senate--the Congress of the United States--to \noperate under.\n  When I go to San Diego and I meet enlisted people who are on active \nduty who are required to stand in line for food, for charity, and we \nare spending money on projects and programs that are unwarranted, \nunnecessary, and unauthorized, I will tell my friend from Kentucky, I \nget angry.\n  I do not know much about the background of the Senator from Kentucky \nor his priorities, but I have mine. One is that I am not going to stand \nby without getting very upset when young Americans who are serving this \ncountry are on food stamps while we are wasting $6.4 billion in pork \nbarrel projects.\n  All I can say to the Senator from Kentucky, if he wants to engage in \nthis kind of debate, I think it will be a waste of our 5 days of time. \nBut I believe, as Elizabeth Drew has said, this system is wrong, it \nneeds to be fixed, and the influence of special interests has a \npernicious effect on the legislative process.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is entitled to his view that he does not \nagree with that, or obviously the Senator from Utah. That is my \nconsidered opinion. But I will state to the Senator from Kentucky now, \nI am not in the business of identifying individuals or attacking \nindividuals. I am attacking a system. I am attacking a system that has \nto be fixed and that has caused 69 percent of young Americans between \n18 and 35 to say they are disconnected from their Government, that \ncaused in the 1998 election the lowest voter turnout in history of 18- \nto 26-year-olds. Those 18- to 26-year-olds were asked: Why didn't you \nvote? And they said they believe we do not represent them anymore, \nbecause they have lost confidence. They say they will not run for \npublic office, that they believe we are corrupt.\n  It is the appearance of corruption that is causing young Americans to \ndivorce themselves from the political process, refuse to run for public \noffice, and there is poll after poll and data that will so reflect.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield for question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. By the way, I only quoted the Senator's comments and \neverything was quoted accurately. I raised the Senator's own words in \nthe debate, words he has used as a justification for this bill that is \ncurrently before us.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona, how can it be corruption if no one is \ncorrupt? That is like saying the gang is corrupt but none of the \ngangsters are. If there is corruption, someone must be corrupt.\n  On the Senator's web site, he names some projects that he \nspecifically says are in these bills as a result of soft money \ncontributions which, of course, as we all know, cannot be received by \nanybody who votes anyway; they are given to a party.\n  I repeat my question to the Senator from Arizona: Who is corrupt?\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I have already responded to the Senator \nthat I will not get into people's names. I will, indeed, repeat, again, \nto the Senator from the web site from which he is quoting. Here it is:\n\n       For 10 years, Senator McCain has reviewed the annual \n     appropriations bills to determine whether they contain items \n     that are low priority, unnecessary, or wasteful spending. In \n     this process, he has used five objective criteria.\n\n  And I go on to list them. That is why----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does that equal corruption though?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator from Kentucky will not accept that answer, \nthere is no point in me continuing to answer. I have already answered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I heard the answer, but the answer, I gather, deleted \nthe word ``corruption.'' The suggestion is that these were inserted as \na result\n\n[[Page S12587]]\n\nof some corrupt act by someone; is that right?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No, that is not right. It is a system. It is a system \nthat has violated the process and has therefore caused the American \npeople to lose confidence and trust in the Government.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator agrees ``corruption'' may not be \nappropriate. If there is no individual he can name who is corrupt, then \n``corruption'' may not be the appropriate word; would the Senator \nagree?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would not, I say to the Senator from Kentucky. He is \nentitled to his views, his opinions, and his conclusions. I am entitled \nto mine.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I see the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask if the Senator from Arizona will yield further for \na question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I will be glad to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am holding a copy of the web site in which the Senator \nfrom Arizona is quoted as follows:\n\n       In the last several years, while Republicans controlled \n     Congress, special interest earmarks in appropriations bills \n     have dramatically increased. The rise in pork barrel spending \n     is directly related to the rise of soft money, as Republicans \n     and Democrats scramble to reward major donors to our \n     campaigns.\n\n  Immediately adjacent to that statement, as an example which ``will \ngive you an idea of what laced this most recent trichinosis attack,'' \nagain a direct quote from the web site:\n\n       . . . $2.2 million for sewer infrastructure needs \n     associated with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah.\n\n  I plead guilty. I am the Senator who approached the Appropriations \nCommittee to ask for that earmark.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona if he can identify for me from the \nwords he has used in the web site, ``the rise of soft money'' that came \nto me that caused me to approach the Appropriations Committee to ask \nfor that money; specifically, I am going to ask the Senator from \nArizona to identify the source of the money, the amount of the money, \nthe recipient of the money that produced that which he describes on his \nweb site as a direct result of, presumably, the money that was \nreceived.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to respond to the Senator from Utah. In \nSeptember 19, 1997, I wrote a letter to the Senator from Utah. I never \nreceived an answer. A year later, I came to the Senator from Utah and \nhanded him a copy of the letter. The Senator from Utah never answered.\n\n  Let me read parts from the letter to the Senator from Utah to remind \nhim because he never answered the letter:\n\n       September 19, 1997, Honorable Robert F. Bennett, United \n     States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I am writing about the recent efforts to add \n     funds to appropriations measure for the 2002 Winter Olympics \n     in Salt Lake City. By my count, the Senate has approved \n     earmarks in three of the appropriations bills, earmarking \n     $14.8 million for next year alone to fund various activities \n     related to planning and preparation for the Utah Olympics. \n     These funds were not included in the FY 1998 budget request, \n     and many were not considered during the Appropriations \n     Committee's review of the bills.\n       Bob, you are aware of my long history of opposing location-\n     specific earmarks of taxpayer dollars. We discussed several \n     of these amendments when they were offered, and I explained \n     why I was particularly opposed to earmarking funds for the \n     Olympics.\n       I have to say that I am disappointed with the approach \n     being taken to earmark funding for the Utah Olympics. In \n     light of the Republicans' long-fought efforts to balance the \n     budget and provide relief to American taxpayers, and with all \n     of the concerns about lack of federal resources to ensure \n     that our children and less fortunate citizens are not unduly \n     harmed as we reduce government spending, I am surprised that \n     you would earmark millions of dollars for a sporting event. \n     And I fear this is just the beginning--\n\n  And those fears in 1997 were well justified.\n\n     --if the experience of the Atlanta Olympics is any \n     indication.\n\n       Of course, I understand your desire, and that of your \n     constituents, to ensure that transportation, security, \n     communications, and other support for the 2002 Olympics is \n     completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner. However, \n     I find it disturbing that adding money for the Olympics would \n     be your highest priority, at least according to your staff.\n       Randomly adding millions of dollars to the appropriations \n     bills, without benefit of appropriate Administration or \n     Congressional review, is not the way business is done in the \n     Senate, nor is it an appropriate way to ensure we spend the \n     taxpayers' dollars wisely. That is why I have opposed \n     unauthorized and location-specific earmarks in an \n     appropriations bill, whether for the Olympics or for any \n     other defense or domestic expenditure.\n       If this process, to which I am unalterably opposed, \n     continues and these funds do not go through the normal \n     authorizing and appropriating process, then I will have to \n     use whatever parliamentary means are available to me to \n     prevent further unauthorized expenditures of taxpayer \n     dollars, for whatever purposes.\n       Again, Bob, I recognize that proper preparation for the \n     Olympics is vital to the success of the games. It seems to \n     me, though, that the best course of action would be to \n     require the U.S. Olympic Committee, in coordination with the \n     Administration and Congress, to prepare and submit a \n     comprehensive plan detailing, in particular, the funding \n     anticipated to be required from the taxpayers for this event. \n     As you may know, the Commerce Committee, which I chair, has \n     jurisdiction over the activities of the U.S. Olympic \n     Committee. I am willing to work with you, the Administration, \n     and the Olympic Committee to devise such a plan, and I will \n     hold hearings in the Committee as expeditiously as possible \n     to review the plan and provide appropriate authorization for \n     appropriations in support of an approved plan.\n       Please call me so that we can start work immediately to \n     establish some predictability and rationality in the process \n     of preparing for Olympics events in our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain.\n\n  That was written to you in September of 1997, a little over 2 years \nago. Since I received no response whatsoever, a year later I handed you \na copy of this letter asking for a response. I know how busy you are, \nbut I never got an answer.\n  But what I did see was exactly what I was warning about in 1997; that \nis, these unauthorized, unappropriated moneys going into an \nenterprise--which since then we have found out has maybe had some other \nproblems associated with it, which my committee is going to have \nhearings about.\n  So my answer to you, sir, is that even in light of the fact that I \nwrote you a letter and then personally handed you a copy and beseeched \nyou to go through the normal process of authorization and appropriation \nas prescribed by the rules of the Congress of the United States, you \nrefused to do so; therefore, I identified it on my web site as not \nmeeting the criteria that I mentioned before.\n  Now, I will repeat again what Elizabeth Drew wrote in her book that \nthis process of money has done great damage to all of us and has had a \npernicious and corrupting effect on the process.\n  But for you to say that this clearly unauthorized, unacceptable \nprocedure, at least as far as my taxpayers are concerned, because the \npeople of Arizona would at least like to have a hearing before their \ntax dollars go to the State of Utah--this is, in my view, something \nthat we have to obviously fix.\n  I do not know if we will ever stop this practice of earmarking and \npork barreling, but I will never stop resisting it. And I will never \nstop trying to see that the taxpayers of America receive an open and \nfair hearing before--I have forgotten. We will total it up for the \nRecord later on how much you stuffed into the appropriations bills \nwithout a single hearing. We will total it up. In fact, I think it \nwas--oh, yes, the GAO estimates that the Federal funding and support \nplan for the 2002 Olympics and Paralympics in Salt Lake City totals \nmore than $1.9 billion in Federal funding.\n  I am on the oversight committee. We have never had a hearing on that \noversight because it has never been requested. It has been stuffed into \nan appropriations bill, sometimes even in a conference report. I would \nthink that the Senator from Utah might think that is not a good way to \ndo business in the Congress of the United States, and it then gives \nrise--then gives rise--to the suspicion that young Americans have about \nthe way we do business and whether they are well represented.\n  I go to schools in Arizona. I say to the schoolchildren, Do you know \nthat $1.9 billion of your money and your parents' money is going to \nsupport the 2002 Olympics and Paralympics, without a hearing, without a \ndecision as to whether it is needed or not, without any kind of \nscrutiny; that there is a Senator who goes through the appropriations \nprocess, puts it in an appropriations bill, and it is a line item that \nwe read about?\n  Then maybe you can understand a little better why there is this \nsuspicion, I would say to the Senator from\n\n[[Page S12588]]\n\nUtah. In fact, I would hope the Senator from Utah would, as a result of \nthis dialogue, understand why people to whom I talk all over America \nare so upset about the way we are doing business here in Washington.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. May I respond?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. At some future point, Mr. President, I shall be happy to \ndebate the appropriateness of Olympic appropriations with the Senator \nfrom Arizona. That was not my question.\n  The Senator from Arizona has not answered my question. And Elizabeth \nDrew is not capable of answering my question because Elizabeth Drew did \nnot make the accusation.\n  The accusation is made on the web site ``It's YOUR Country.com'': \n``The rise in pork barrel spending is directly related to the rise of \nsoft money.'' And one example of that is the $2.2 million appropriation \nfor sewer and infrastructure associated with the Winter Olympics.\n  My question to the Senator from Arizona was--and remains--not, is the \nappropriation for the Olympics appropriate or not? My question for the \nSenator from Arizona is, who gave the soft money? How much was it? And \nwhere did it go that resulted in my actions being taken?\n  Now, let me point out that it is possible to answer those questions \nwith respect to corruption. I sat as a member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee that examined what happened in the 1996 election.\n  I will give you three examples that I want to apply to this context. \nThen if the Senator from Arizona will give me an answer, I will yield \nto him for an answer to my question.\n  Example No. 1: Who gave the money? is the question. The answer is: \nRoger Tamraz, a fugitive from justice from many countries in the world.\n  Second question: How much? $300,000.\n  Third question: To whom? The Democratic National Committee.\n  Fourth question: What did he get for it? The answer is he got invited \nto the White House, a dinner with the President and a conversation with \nthe President, that which is facetiously referred to as ``face time,'' \ndespite the fact that the National Security Council told the White \nHouse that Roger Tamraz should not be allowed in the White House \nbecause of his background.\n  There are the four elements: Who gave the money? How much was it? \nWhere did it go? And what was the quid pro quo? All four are \nidentifiable. I would be willing to say that constitutes corruption.\n  Roger Tamraz gave $300,000 to the Democratic National Committee to \nearn entry into the White House and ``face time'' with the President, \nin spite of the warning by the National Security Council that he should \nnot do that.\n  Example No. 2. The Riady family. Who gave the money? The Riady \nfamily. They were the largest single contributor to the Clinton \ncampaign in the 1992 election. How much? I don't have that total. It \nwas in the millions. To whom was it given? Soft money. It went to the \nDemocratic National Committee.\n  What was the quid pro quo? The quid pro quo was the placing of John \nHuang in the Commerce Department where he could become, in the words of \nthe Riadys--of James Riady--``My man in the U.S. Government.''\n  There are the four elements: Who gave the money? The Riadys. How much \nwas it? In the millions. Where did it go? The Democratic National \nCommittee. And what did they get? An appointment of their individual \nburied inside the administration.\n  No. 3, not quite as clear, but nonetheless the four elements are \nthere. The Indian tribe that was approached by the Democratic National \nCommittee, an Indian tribe that was one of the most impoverished in the \nUnited States.\n  What did they want? They wanted the return of what they considered to \nbe ancestral lands. They were told, if they gave hundreds of thousands \nof dollars to the Democratic National Committee, they would receive the \nlands that had been taken away from them decades prior. They raised the \nmoney.\n  Where did the money come from? It came from the Indian tribes. How \nmuch was it? It was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Where did \nit go? It went to the Democratic National Committee. What did they get \nfor it? In fact, they got nothing because the administration was unable \nto return the lands. That was the case of a scam, in my opinion, that \nis corrupt.\n  So I come back to this question to the Senator from Arizona, or \nanyone else who can answer it: With respect to the $2 million that was \nappropriated for sewer infrastructure in Utah, I want to know, who gave \nthe money? How much was it? Where did it go? And where was the quid pro \nquo that I delivered on?\n  I am unaware of any money that was given by anybody in any amounts \nthat influenced my action here. But I have been accused on a web site, \nfor the entire world to see, of caving into soft money. I have been \naccused of being corrupt. I have been accused of doing something in \nthis body solely because--and I quote--``The rise in pork barrel \nspending is directly related to the rise of soft money.'' As I say, I \nwill engage in a debate over the wisdom of Federal support for the \nOlympics in another time and in another venue. The issue has nothing to \ndo with that question. The issue is whether or not a Member of the \nSenate, when he is accused of corruption, has a right to know the \ndetails of the corruption; whether a Member of the Senate has the right \nto know, when his young people are told by one of his colleagues that \nhe is corrupt and, therefore, the young people in his State may be \ndiscouraged from running for public office or may feel ill about the \nsystem, because they are told their Senator is corrupt, he has the \nright to know the details of that corruption accusation. I believe that \nis a fundamental right of every Member of this body.\n\n  I am asking the Senator from Arizona to answer those questions: Who \ngave the money? How much was it? Where did it go? How did it affect my \nactions with respect to the Appropriations Committee?\n  I am prepared to yield to the Senator from Arizona for an answer to \nthat, if he wants to do it now, or I will give him a chance to research \nit, if he prefers. It has nothing to do, in my view, with Elizabeth \nDrew or with actions within the Appropriations Committee so much as it \nhas to do with the accusation that has been made about me personally, \nto which I take personal offense.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield for one observation before \nSenator McCain responds, Senate rule XLIII seems to be the rule that \napplies here. It says: The decision to provide assistance may not be \nmade on the basis of contributions or services, or on promises of \ncontributions or services, to the Member's political campaigns or to \nother organizations in which the Member has a political, personal, or \nfinancial interest. That is Senate rule XLIII relating to constituent \nservice, which appears to be the applicable Senate rule in this \nsituation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield to the Senator \nfrom Arizona to respond if he wishes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Utah for yielding and I \nunderstand his anger and anguish about this specific allegation. I do \nnot wish to comment on the details other than to say I have complete \nrespect for the integrity of the Senator from Utah and have witnessed \nit in my time here.\n  My question is this: Given all of the examples he has mentioned, some \nof which he thinks are conclusive cases--first I think it was three, \nand then he said the fourth was maybe a little less conclusive\n  Mr. BENNETT. Two and then three.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Excuse me. The two he said were conclusive and the third \npossibly conclusive. The allegations that he feels, at least in my \njudgment, correctly, wounded about, don't all of these questions and \nparticularly the cases that the Senator has laid out--and I am not \ncommenting on whether I agree with his cause and effect--make as strong \na case as we have seen for passing some campaign finance reform? \nDoesn't it importune the gentleman from Utah, and so many others in \nthis Chamber, that we pass something because all of these allegations \nfly\n\n[[Page S12589]]\n\naround? And in fairness to the Senator from Arizona, when I heard his \nresponse, he was talking about appearances as opposed to realities, but \nappearances that are damaging to the body politic, whether there is \nreality or not.\n\n  My question to the good Senator from Utah is, once again, don't the \ninstances that he has outlined, the ones not referring to himself but \nthe ones he believes fervently about the Democratic National Committee, \nmotivate him to fight very hard that we pass something, not allow a \nfilibuster to prevent us from passing it, and do something good for \ncampaign finance reform? It seems to me the logic is sort of \ninexorable, as inexorable as the logic of the Senator's piercing \nquestions about his specific case.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding and ask him to respond.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to respond. If I were convinced the \nlegislation before us would achieve the result that is claimed for it, \nI would vote for it happily. My concern with the legislation before us \nis that it, in fact, would make things worse rather than better. We can \ndiscuss that and those details at an appropriate point in the debate.\n  I don't want to dodge it because I think the point the Senator from \nNew York is making is a legitimate one, and his logic is, indeed, \ninexorable. The one hole I see in it is his assumption that this bill \nbefore us would work. My conviction, after reading it carefully, is \nthat it not only would not work but would do serious damage to our \nfirst amendment rights.\n  I come back to the fundamental question we are dealing with in terms \nof the spirit of this debate and the spirit in which it is cast. This \ndebate is being cast in the national press and over the Internet and, \nindeed, in the Presidential campaign as a debate between the incorrupt \nand the corrupt. I have been labeled as being on the side of the \ncorrupt, and I don't like it.\n  If I am, I want to be identified in such a way that makes it clear \nthat I am, instead of in a broad brush kind of way. One of the things \nwe all try to avoid is tarring people with broad brushes. This is not a \nbroad brush. This is a specific charge that then is drawn over into the \nbroad brush of ``we are all corrupt.'' I want to know from whom did the \nmoney come, how much was it, and to what organization did it go that \ncaused me to take the action I took.\n  In the absence of being able to produce those statistics, I think the \ncharge that I am corrupt should be withdrawn. That is what I am saying. \nThat is what I am going to continue to say as a matter of personal \nprivilege until we get this thing resolved. It has nothing whatever to \ndo with the merits or demerits of funding for the Olympics on the \nFederal level. It is a question of my position, of personal integrity, \nthat, in my view, has been impugned on a web site available to the \nentire country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will yield for a response to my question. If it means \nyielding the floor, I am happy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't want to keep the Senator from Arizona from \nresponding, if he is ready to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like the floor to respond.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, the Senator is incorrect. I \ndid not accuse him of being corrupt. No apology or withdrawal is \nwarranted.\n  Secondly, the Senator engaged in a continuous practice of violating \nthe rules of the Senate, which require authorization and then \nappropriation, for several years now. I hope that the Senator, as a \nproduct of this debate, will seek an authorization for the $1.9 billion \nwhich the GAO has identified as going to the Olympics. The Olympics \nhave had a lot of problems in addition to that. I hope the Senator will \naddress those as well.\n  The third point is, indeed, banks and securities gave $14 million in \nsoft money. They got, in the last tax cut, $38 billion in tax breaks.\n  Restaurants and hotels gave $3 million in soft money; they got $14 \nbillion in tax breaks.\n  The oil and gas industry gave $19 million in soft money; they got $5 \nbillion in tax breaks.\n  Between 1991 and 1997, the chemical, iron, and steel manufacturing \nindustries gave $22.2 million in soft money to the political parties. \nThe 1999 tax bill included a provision to eliminate the alternative \nminimum tax, which will allow these industries to completely eliminate \ntheir tax liability in any one year. If the bill had not been vetoed, \nthis single change would have saved these industries $7.9 billion over \nan 8-year period or almost $1 billion a year.\n  Over the last decade, the oil industry has given $22 million in soft \nmoney donations to the political parties. What did they get? The 1999 \ntax bill included a provision to remove the current limit of 35 percent \non Federal tax credits that oil companies can take for taxes they pay \nto foreign countries. If the bill had not been vetoed, the provision \nwould have allowed oil companies to take much larger credits against \ntheir tax liability, saving them $800 million a year; return on \ninvestment, 3,600 percent.\n  Between 1995 and 1998, the restaurant and hotel industry gave $4.3 \nmillion in soft money to the political parties.\n  The 1999 tax bill included a provision to increase tax deductibility \nof business meals to 60 percent, although the industry wanted 100 \npercent. If the bill had not been vetoed, this provision reviving the \nthree-martini power lunch would have cost taxpayers $4 billion over the \nnext 10 years. The list goes on and on, I say to the Senator from Utah.\n  Now, the specific language says in the appropriations bill:\n\n       Special interests unlimited campaign contributions were a \n     key ingredient in the pork stew that is choking the American \n     people.\n\n  They were a key ingredient in all of these that I described. Perhaps \nthey were not in the case of the Senator from Utah. Perhaps the Senator \nfrom Utah just decided to violate the rules of the Senate, and he is \nfree to do that, although I will do everything in my power to see that \nthis $1.9 billion is restrained.\n  Now, I finally want to mention an incident. I was in the Republican \ncaucus when a certain Senator stood up and said it was OK for you not \nto vote against the tobacco bill because the tobacco companies will run \nads in our favor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has not named \nthe Senators who were allegedly responsible for inserting all of the \nprovisions that he listed in various and assorted bills, which he \nsuggests were inserted as a result of soft money contributions to \npolitical parties.\n  So the question remains: Who were the Senators?\n  There was, however, at the end of his remarks, a not-so-veiled \nreference to this Senator, to which I would like to respond. Senator \nMcCain suggested, I assume, as I heard him correctly a few moments ago, \nthat as a result of the tobacco debate last year--and I might mention \nto my colleagues I have 45,000 tobacco growers; before the Clinton \nadministration, I had 60,000 tobacco growers, and they are falling \ndaily. These are the hard-working farmers engaged in producing a legal \ncrop that representatives of Kentucky, regardless of party, seek to \ndefend.\n  In any event, Senator McCain brought up the way the tobacco debate \nended last year, and there were allegations in the paper that this \nSenator, the Senator from Kentucky, had said to everyone: Don't worry \nabout defeating the tobacco bill, the tobacco companies will be out \nthere doing issue ads.\n  As a result of that assertion, there was a complaint filed against \nme, and I want to refer to a letter from the Justice Department of \nJanuary 29, 1999, to Chairman Orrin Hatch:\n\n       I am writing in further response to your letter of \n     September 8, 1998, regarding the complaint filed with the \n     Federal Election Commission by the National Center For \n     Tobacco-Free Kids. Consistent with the Department's \n     longstanding practice, we deferred any inquiry until issues \n     arising under the Federal election laws have been reviewed by \n     the FEC. We did, however, agree to review the portions of \n     that complaint related to 18 U.S.C. 201 [which is a criminal \n     statute]. After careful examination, the criminal division \n     has concluded that there is insufficient\n\n[[Page S12590]]\n\n     evidence to warrant a criminal investigation.\n\n  So the suggestion that the Senator from Arizona was making was that \nI, representing 45,000 tobacco growers, was somehow trying to defeat a \ntobacco bill because of some alleged assistance by the tobacco industry \nto political parties. I might say to the Senator from Arizona, I am \ndeeply offended by that. I don't know who are the most important and \nlargest number of constituents in Arizona that he works for, but I try \nto help the 45,000 tobacco growers in my State. I try to defeat tobacco \nbills when they come before the body, as did Wendell Ford of the \nDemocratic Party when he was here all those years. I don't need any \ncontribution from anybody to myself, to the National Republican \nSenatorial Committee, any of our parties, or anybody, to stand up and \ndefend the 45,000 tobacco growers from my State.\n\n  So I repeat to the Senator from Arizona, the question before us is \nnot reading a list of what he considers to be inappropriate projects. \nThat is not the issue. The issue is, where is the corruption? You \ncannot have corruption unless somebody is corrupt. There is not \ncorruption without somebody being corrupt. You can't say the gang is \ncorrupt and none of the gangsters are. If the Senator from Arizona \nbelieves there is corruption, he has an obligation, under the Senate \nrules and the Federal bribery statute, to name the people. Who is being \ncorrupt? Who are the people putting all of these items in these bills? \nWhat was their impetus for doing it? Who made the contribution, as the \nSenator from Utah said, and to whom? Where is the corruption?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have responded. It is time to move on. \nIf the Senator from Kentucky has an amendment concerning this issue, I \nwill be glad to address it. I have responded, and I will continue to \nrespond. I am trying to change a system that corrupts all of us. I \nbelieve there is ample evidence, as I have cited, of this system's \npernicious effect, in my view, and in the view of most objective \nobservers. I am not going to let this debate, in the few days we have, \nget bogged down on this issue. It is time we move on with the amending \nprocess. I have responded. I have said to the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Kentucky that I am fighting a system here. I will continue \nto fight that system, with its pernicious effects on the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes that the priority of \nrecognition is determined, first, by Senator Lott, the majority leader; \nsecond, the distinguished Democratic leader; third, by the manager of \nthe bill; and also the designee of the minority leader; or by service \non the committee of jurisdiction in order of seniority.\n  In that regard, I recognize the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are not bogged down; we are just getting started. \nWe just took the bill up a few moments ago. At the heart of this whole \ndebate--elevated now to a Presidential campaign--are allegations of \ncorruption.\n  All I am asking is a very simple question: Where is the corruption? \nThe Senator from Utah is trying to get an answer to his question, and I \nhaven't heard it yet. I know the State of Washington is also listed on \nthe web site. I wonder if the Senator from Washington would also like \nto take the floor. I ask my colleague from Washington if he has also \nnoted the web site that we were discussing earlier, in which a couple \nof projects from Washington are referred to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may I make an inquiry?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have a question; that is all it is.\n  I ask my colleague from Kentucky, for those of us who want to debate \nthis larger question, how long will you continue with this attack of \nSenator McCain on the floor? How much longer is that going to happen?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota for \nhis question.\n  I now turn to the Senator from Washington and ask him if he noted on \nthe web site the suggestion about $1.3 million for the World Trade \nOrganization's ministerial meeting in Seattle, WA, the Senator's State, \nand an exemption for the Crown Jewel mine in Washington State to \ndeposit mining waste on additional land adjacent to the mine. Listed on \nthe web site of Senator McCain are examples of ``pork barrel spending \nis a direct result of unlimited contributions from special interests.''\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. There are \nquotations from Senator McCain's web site. There are two that I thought \nparticularly bizarre coming from one of my closest friends in the \nSenate.\n  The first of those two is----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the Chair, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I wonder how a Senator can ask another Senator to yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I understand it, seniority is a \nfactor in the floor recognition. If I yield the floor, the Senator from \nWashington would be the senior Senator on the floor to be recognized \nfirst.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I don't believe one Senator can ever yield the floor to \nanother Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator yields the floor, it is the \njudgment of the Chair to recognize whichever Senator would rise to his \nfeet and be recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe the Senator from Washington would surely----\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask the Senator from Kentucky to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Washington for a question.\n  Mr. GORTON. In the web site to which the Senator from Kentucky has \nreferred, there is the statement by the primary sponsor of this bill \nthat ``pork barrel spending is a direct result of unlimited \ncontributions from special interests.''\n  The first example in the----\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is incorrect. Will the Senator yield? The \nSenator is incorrect. He is incorrect in his statement. The statement \nsays ``a key ingredient''--the ``key ingredient.'' It doesn't say that \nit is the cause of it. So I hope the Senator will at least quote my web \nsite accurately.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am reading from what I believe is the web site. I think \none sentence in the paragraph that doesn't have----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senator from \nKentucky has the floor, and the Senator is posing a question to the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. GORTON. I pose a question to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yielded to the Senator from Washington for a \nquestion. Is that permissible?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. To the best of my knowledge, I say to the Senator from \nKentucky, I am reading from a web site of the Senator from Arizona, \nwhich includes the sentence that says, and I quote, ``Pork barrel \nspending is a direct result of unlimited contributions from special \ninterests.''\n  In this particular list, entitled ``The List Goes On and On,'' the \nvery first example is a $1.3 million earmark for the World Trade \nOrganization ministerial meeting to be held in Seattle, WA.\n  Just what pork barrel spending is and just how that spending is a \nresult of unlimited contributions from special interests is a matter \nthat the Senator from Washington fails totally and completely to \nunderstand.\n  I say to the Senator from Kentucky that the appropriation was the \nresult of a request made by the U.S. Trade Representative in what I \nbelieve is a Democratic administration to the two Senators from \nWashington for assistance in financing a governmental operation--a U.S. \ngovernmental operation--the U.S. Trade Representative's participation \nin that World Trade Organization meeting to be held in Seattle.\n  I ask the Senator from Kentucky, since the Senator from Arizona has \nrefused to answer these questions of him,\n\n[[Page S12591]]\n\nor similar questions from the Senator from Utah, how in the world can \nan appropriation to a unit of the U.S. Government to conduct trade \nnegotiations be either pork barrel spending or the result of unlimited \ncontributions from special interests? Can the Senator from Kentucky \nenlighten me on an answer to that question?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Washington that I am \nmystified. I do not recall a situation where you have corporate \ncontributions to the government that might then--it is a mysterious \nthing to think that kind of a proposal could be a result of soft money. \nIt is important to remember that candidates for office can't receive \nsoft money anyway. The contribution is to a party, and parties don't \nvote. I am astonished by the allegation. I am not sure I can answer the \nquestion because it is a mystery.\n  Mr. GORTON. A second question: There is a second accusation on \nanother portion of the web site: The part that ``This `Pork Delight' \ntook the form of the 1999 emergency supplemental appropriations bill. \nSpecial interest unlimited campaign contributions were a key ingredient \nin the pork stew that is choking the American people.''\n  One of those is, ``An exemption for the Crown Jewel mine in \nWashington State to deposit mining waste on additional land surrounding \nthe mine, even though other mines were denied similar permission.''\n  First, I ask the Senator from Kentucky, I don't see any \nappropriations or any use of the taxpayers' money in that connection. I \nhave checked with the mining company in question that tells me they \nhave never made a soft money contribution to any party or any group \nwhatsoever.\n  I have letters from the county commissioners of the county in \nquestion praising this action--in fact, from a labor union that is \nusually not a supporter of the Senator from Washington on the same \naccount--because this is one of the most poverty-stricken counties in \nthe State of Washington, the Federal Government having closed almost \nall the timber harvests on public lands, other organizations having \nbought up other timberlands to prevent their harvest, and the \nadministration being in the process of cutting off irrigation water to \nfarmers. After 7 years of study and $80 million in complying with every \nsingle environmental law in the State of Washington, or for that matter \nthe Federal Government, this company was denied its permit after a 100-\nyear policy by a single bureaucrat.\n  I ask the Senator from Kentucky, in the absence of an answer from the \nSenator from Arizona, isn't this what we are supposed to do, represent \nour constituents? What soft money contribution could possibly have \ninfluenced this? One may certainly disagree with the policy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Washington that it is \ninconceivable to me how a soft money contribution to a political party \nwould have anything to do with a project for a Senator's home State. I \nam mystified by the connection. It is astonishing.\n  We have here rampant charges of corruption and yet no names are \nnamed, no transactions are named. You know it is not unusual for the \nnewspapers looking to sell copies or talking heads looking for air time \nto point to an alignment of interests among member parties, issue \ngroups, and contributors and speculators maybe even going so far as to \ninfer that official actions were taken in exchange for campaign \nsupport.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for another question.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Arizona said he wants to get back to the \nissues involved. I assume the Senator from Kentucky would agree with me \nthat reasonable Members can differ on questions of high public policy, \non the way in which we finance political campaigns, on how the \nConstitution of the United States with its unequivocal demand that \nCongress shall pass no law respecting the freedom of speech should be \ninterpreted; that all of these are appropriate matters for debate, but \nthat they are far better debated upon the merits, and, in general, \naccusations of a corrupt system, and rather specific examples pointed \nat individual Members without the slightest degree of proof, without \nevidence at all that they were related in any respect whatsoever to \nthis matter--that these are separate questions but they are related \nquestions when the proposition----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call for regular order.\n  Mr. GORTON. Should result from--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor and \nhas yielded for a question.\n  Mr. GORTON. These unproven allegations.\n  Does the Senator from Kentucky agree that these are separate but \nhighly related and relevant questions?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I agree completely with the Senator from Washington. \nWhat we have here suggests that there can be corruption but no one is \ncorrupt.\n  How can there be corruption unless someone is engaging in corrupt \nactivity? I say to my friend from Washington, as I said earlier in this \ndebate, that is similar to saying the gang is corrupt but none of the \ngangsters is.\n  It is shocking to have these allegations when there are no specifics.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In response to my comment, the Senator from Arizona said \nI was violating the rules of the Senate in terms of what I was doing. \nHe said he had not accused me of corruption. The Senator from Kentucky \nhas been in the Senate longer than I and been on the Appropriations \nCommittee longer than I. I ask, have my actions been violative of the \nrules of the Senate?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Utah, no rule of which I am \naware.\n  What we really are talking about in this particular debate on this \nparticular amendment, which I will describe in a moment and have not \ndescribed yet, is the whole notion that there is corruption. Yet no one \nis named. Somebody is alluded to, as the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Washington were, yet there is no proof.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I could ask an additional question, is the \nappropriations process, as it has been followed in this Congress and \nprevious Congresses under Republican leadership and democratic \nleadership, in and of itself, demonstrative of corruption if there is \nan appropriations action that is not authorized?\n  The Senator is the chairman of the Ethics Committee, and I see the \nother member of the Ethics Committee leadership on the floor in the \nform of Senator Reid. I ask, is this process, as it is being practiced \nand handled, virtually on a routine basis, violative of the rules of \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If to appropriate an unauthorized sum of funds were a \nviolation of Senate rules, there would be a lot of Senators in trouble \naround here. We try to do it through the authorization and then \nappropriations process, but to suggest that it is somehow unsavory or \ninappropriate behavior for there to be an appropriation without an \nauthorization I think is stretching the matter quite a distance. There \nis certainly nothing improper about it.\n  We can have a policy argument about whether every single item ought \nto be authorized--and most of them are--but it certainly would not be \nappropriate to cast aspersions on the integrity of a Member of the \nSenate for trying to deliver something for his or her home State that \nmight have at some point not been authorized by an authorizing \ncommittee.\n  What is new is Senators who serve here, walking these Halls every \nday, who meet with their fellow Senators every day, who watch their \nfellow Members take official actions every day, go before the American \npeople and declare openly and with great conviction that votes are \nbeing bought in the Halls of the U.S. Capitol. When Senators make those \nkinds of allegations about their colleagues, I think we are suggesting \nthey ought to back it up. They ought to back it up.\n  There are specific rules in the Senate that prevent taking an \nofficial action in order to reward somebody for a contribution. In \naddition to that, we have bribery statutes involving public officials:\n\n       Any public official who ``directly or indirectly,'' \n     corruptly, demands, seeks, receives,\n\n[[Page S12592]]\n\n     accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value \n     personally or for any other person or entity, in return for . \n     . . being influenced in the performance of any official act . \n     . . shall be fined under this title . . . or imprisoned for \n     not more than 15 years, or both, and may be disqualified from \n     holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the \n     United States.\n\n  We have suggestions of violations not only of Senate rules but of \nFederal bribery statutes, without specifics. That is unfair to the \nMembers of this body who are doing their very best to represent their \nconstituents who are honest, hard-working, and good citizens. It is \nunfair to the Members of the Senate to have these aspersions cast on \ntheir honor and the honor of this institution.\n\n  There is an amendment at the desk which is the subject of this \ndebate. Let me describe what it would do. It is an amendment that would \namend the Senate Code of Conduct to create an affirmative duty for all \nSenators who report any credible information of corruption directly to \nthe Ethics Committee. As a former chairman of the Ethics Committee, I \nam familiar with Ethics Committee rule 3 that requires every member of \nthe Ethics Committee to report credible information of corruption to \nthe committee.\n  The charges of corruption that are being made in this body require \nMembers to extend the Ethics Committee rule to the full Senate. In the \npast, there has been an affirmative duty on the part of members of the \nEthics Committee to report information about corruption directly to the \ncommittee. I think that now should be extended to the whole Senate \nbecause we have a number--at least two Members of the Senate--who have \nbeen alleging corruption. They have an affirmative duty, if this \namendment passes, to report that corruption to the Ethics Committee so \nwe can all get to the bottom of it because these allegations demean the \nentire Senate.\n  The message of this amendment is simple. If any Member of this body \nknows of corruption, he or she must formally report it to the Ethics \nCommittee. In addition, the amendment also amends the Federal Criminal \nCode to establish mandatory minimum penalties for public officials who \nengage in corruption.\n  Our criminal law is full of mandatory minimum penalties already. We \nhave imposed them for a variety of different offenses over the years. \nFor example, arson on Federal property requires a mandatory minimum \npenalty of 5 years in prison; special immigration attorneys disclosing \nclassified information requires a mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years \nimprisonment; bribery involving meat inspectors requires a minimum of 3 \nyears imprisonment; bribery involving harbor employees requires a \nminimum of 6 months imprisonment.\n  We have mandatory minimum penalties for bribery involving harbor \nemployees and meat inspectors. Surely it is not too much to ask we \nestablish mandatory minimum penalties for bribery involving public \nofficials.\n  My amendment establishes that a conviction involving bribery of \npublic officials as set forth in 18 USC 201 triggers a mandatory \nminimum penalty of $100,000, 1 year imprisonment, and disqualification \nfrom holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United \nStates.\n  As Henry Clay once stated, ``Government is a trust and the officers \nof the government are trustees.'' I believe that principle to be true. \nThese amendments firmly establish the principle in our Senate Code of \nConduct in our criminal law.\n  Before we pass laws that restrict the free speech rights of every \nAmerican citizen, we should restrict ourselves. Let's regulate the 100 \nmen and women who cast votes in this great body before we regulate the \nspeech of more than 250 million Americans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know the Senator is aware, but for clarification, on my \nweb site I state the general proposition that soft money creates pork \nbarrel spending. I then identify a recent appropriations bill as an \nexample of how big the problem of pork barrel spending is. Nowhere \nshould it be interpreted that every single one of those pork barrel \nprojects are as a result of soft money. But they are a result of a \nviolation of criteria that I have held for 10 years, which the Senator \nfrom Utah seems to think is OK, which bypasses the authorizing process. \nI am sure the Senator from Wisconsin appreciates it.\n  Who is corrupted by this system? All of us are corrupted by it \nbecause money buys access and access is influence. The object is not to \nget into a vendetta about who is corrupted and who is not because the \nsystem is what needs to be fixed. We would never fix the system if I \ngot into a business of finger pointing, name calling. For 10 years I \nhave identified pork barrel spending which violates a process and \ncriteria set up, not by me, but by the Citizens Against Government \nWaste, Citizens For a Sound Economy, National Taxpayers Union, and \nother objective and respected watchdog organizations.\n  Finally, I would say I hope the Senator from Wisconsin will ask the \nSenator--I am ready to accept his amendment by voice vote. I hope the \nSenator from Kentucky appreciates the fact that we entered into this \nagreement and did not hold up the Senate so we could have an amending \nprocess going back and forth on both sides of this issue. I hope that \nis what will be adhered to.\n  I also would say it is customary in this body to recognize one Member \non this side of the aisle and another Member on the other side of the \naisle, with the exception of the distinguished majority leader and \nDemocrat leader. So I hope we could get some comity in this process, as \nwe had intended to do at the beginning as part of the agreement.\n  I ask my friend from Wisconsin if he agrees with that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his question. I \ncertainly do agree with it. I appreciate the way he said it.\n  I think we all agreed early on we would easily accept an amendment \nsuch as this. I want to make a couple of comments before we go forward \nwith it.\n  I think a serious omission has been made in this conversation about \nwhat the standard is with regard to corruption. The Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo did not just speak of corruption, which is the \nstandard the Senator from Kentucky insists on. It also clearly refers \nto the appearance of corruption. So any suggestion that we have to \ndemonstrate in this case or that case that there is actual corruption \nflies directly in the face of what the law of the land is under Buckley \nv. Valeo. So there is not a problem with the amendment itself. I \nquestion how much it has to do with the debate before us. I think it is \nirrelevant unless the Senator from Kentucky believes we do not have \nbribery laws, but I don't see any problem with it.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will in a moment. I want to make a few comments \nbecause it was very difficult to get the floor, given the method of \nrecognition used this morning.\n  But the irony of this amendment, even though it certainly is \nacceptable, is that the corruption that is so evident is evident as a \nmoral matter; it is a matter of governance. It is not recognized by the \ncurrent law--except perhaps in cases I don't know about--as\n\n[[Page S12593]]\n\nactual legal violation or a crime. The corruption our bill seeks to ban \nnow is perfectly legal. That is the point. It is perfectly legal and it \nwould not be reached as a legal matter by this amendment. This \namendment would not reach the kind of soft money contribution we are \ntalking about.\n  The Senator from Kentucky knows this very well and almost revels in \nthe loophole that would swallow the law. It is very important to \nrecognize because I hope someday this gets before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  The Senator from New York said: Well, we already have a record of at \nleast the appearance of corruption as provided by the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Remember, our bill doesn't just affect congressional soft money; it \nalso affects money used in Presidential elections, and thanks to the \nSenator from Utah, we now have on the record for the Justices to \nexamine, his conclusion--which I believe is a fair statement--that you \nat least believe there was an appearance of corruption with regard to \nthe Mr. Tamraz situation and the Indian tribe situation.\n  I have to tell you, when I saw the TV show about the contributions \nwith regard to the Indian tribe, it was one of the saddest things I \nhave ever seen. Just as a citizen of this country, not as a Senator, if \nthat didn't have the appearance of corruption, I don't know what would.\n  To suggest there is a connection between soft money and an appearance \nof corruption is very legitimate, and I thank the Senator from Utah for \nputting on the record three examples of what I think easily qualify as \nappearances of corruption. Certainly, the American people regard it as \nthe appearance of corruption. That is the standard. The standard is not \nwhat the Senator from Kentucky is trying to make the standard, that we \nhave to walk in here with documented corruption that is tantamount to \nbribery. There are laws on the books for that. The whole point is these \npractices are perfectly legal and nobody should be in trouble under the \nlaw for doing something that is perfectly legal.\n  Let me read from Buckley v. Valeo because this is the central \nconfusion on this whole debate this morning, that somehow the standard \nis that Senator McCain or I or somebody else has to walk in here with \nevidence of corruption. In fact, it would probably be a violation of \nrule XIX of the Senate if we did. But that is not even our point. It \ndoesn't have to do with individual Members of the Senate; certainly not \nanything I have tried to do. Let me read from what the Court said. The \nCourt specifically pointed out that you don't have to prove bribery in \norder to have a justification for some kind of limits on campaign \ncontributions. The Court said:\n\n       Laws making criminal the giving and taking of bribes deal \n     with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those \n     with money to influence governmental action. And while \n     disclosure requirements serve the many salutary purposes \n     discussed elsewhere in this opinion, Congress was surely \n     entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial \n     measure and that contribution ceilings were a necessary \n     legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or the \n     appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting \n     unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities \n     of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions \n     are fully disclosed.\n\n  This is where the Senator from Kentucky is not properly stating what \nthe Court asked for. The Court does not say it must be only the reality \nof corruption. The Court says it may be the appearance of corruption, \nand that is often going to be in the eyes of the beholder. And Senators \ncan disagree about what is the appearance of corruption and can amass \nevidence for the record of what may be the appearance of corruption, \nand that is what I have done by my calling of the bankroll and nobody \nobjected for 14 times when I pointed out what appears to be a \ncorrupting influence of multihundred-thousand-dollar contributions. It \nis not only the appearance of corruption, but that this is inherent, \naccording to the Supreme Court, it is of the nature of large \ncontributions. So this bar that the opponents of reform raise for us, \nthat somehow we have to come in here with a pile of evidence of what \neverybody knows is true; that is, that soft money has a very \ninappropriate influence on our legislative process--I reiterate, not an \nillegal influence. That is why we need a law. That is why we are here. \nWe need to make these kinds of unlimited contributions clearly illegal \nonce again.\n\n  Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with accepting the \namendment, having had the opportunity to express my view that this \ndebate, thus far, was not directly related to the issue of soft money. \nBut I will be happy to yield for a question from the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by my \nfriend, and I ask him if, in his opinion, the appropriation of funds \nthat are not authorized is an automatic appearance of corruption.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. What is it again? I did not hear the question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The question is, When the Appropriations Committee \nappropriates money that has not been previously authorized, is that \nprima facie an appearance of corruption?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I do not think it is possible for anyone to determine \nfor everyone else what an appearance of corruption is. It is our \nresponsibility as a legislative body to look at the total record of \nwhat is going on in our campaign finance system and to determine \nwhether the American people believe the various things we do have an \nappearance of corruption and whether there is a remedy for it.\n  I do not think it has anything to do with any particular part of the \nprocess. I think any part of the process can be perfectly clean at any \npoint, but if there is an abuse at some point, a very large \ncontribution at the wrong time, it is not about whether technically it \nis legal. It is about whether a large body of the American people would \nconsider--for example, a $200,000 contribution given 2 days after the \nHouse marked up a bankruptcy bill by MBNA. OK, it is not illegal. \nConceded. Maybe it is not even corrupt, but it certainly has an \nappearance of corruption to me and I think to many people. That would \nbe a concrete example of where the appearance of corruption may occur.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for that example because he named a \nname, the source, and he named an amount, the $200,000. He did not name \nthe recipient. Was it to the Republican National Committee?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I believe it was the Republican Senate campaign \ncommittee----\n  Mr. BENNETT. National Republican Senatorial Committee?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes. On the 16 occasions I came to the floor and read \nout these contributions, I was careful to identify both sides. In my \nopening statement, I identified not only groups that would be more \nlikely to support Republicans but Democrats, and in every instance I am \nreferring to an appearance of corruption that the American people may \nsee in looking at this. I am not making any allegation of illegality. \nBut the issue here is the appearance of corruption under Buckley v. \nValeo.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for that because, as I say, he has \nresponded with things I have requested with respect to the allegations \nthat I was under the appearance of corruption which I have not yet \nreceived.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me ask, in response, when you became aware of the \nallegation against yourself?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It was several days ago when my attention was called to \nit on the web site. I wrote to the Senator from Arizona and told him I \nwas going to raise this on the floor because I did not want him to be \nblindsided by it. I wanted to be as courteous as possible. But in my \nletter to the Senator from Arizona, I told him I was disturbed, indeed \noffended, by this and intended to raise it. Therefore, I have kept my \nword to the Senator from Arizona.\n  My question still goes to the response that I have had which is that \nthe appearance of corruption comes from appropriations that are \nunauthorized. I want my friend to address this directly because he has \nbeen the outspoken advocate of this appearance of corruption question.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As I said earlier, it is perfectly possible on an \noccasion that the kind of procedure the Senator has talked about could \ngive rise to an\n\n[[Page S12594]]\n\nappearance of corruption. It is not something one can sort of determine \nby a series of court rulings. The question is, Do we as legislators \nfind that our constituents see that sort of thing as appearing corrupt \nand, therefore, do we legislate a response to it? That is the standard \nfor legislatures, not the standard for the court which is trying to \nconvict someone of a crime.\n  Mr. BENNETT. But the standard I am trying to understand that has been \nraised in this debate today is that any time a Senator achieves an \nappropriations--as I say, I plead guilty. I make no attempt to hide \nthis. I plead guilty as having been the Senator who approached the \nAppropriations Committee in request of this particular item.\n  It has been raised here that by virtue of the fact that I did that on \nan item for which there was not a previous appropriation, that in and \nof itself is an appearance of corruption, and I am asking the Senator \nif he agrees with that characterization.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I simply cannot say for the general public on that \nparticular example how they would react. That is not my role. My job as \na representative is to react to what people respond to when you point \nout various things that have been done. I do not know what the response \nwould be to the particular incident.\n  Some people might, obviously, as you say, think you were successful \nin doing something for your constituents. I know from my own experience \nas a Senator that you have to be very careful about the appearance as \nyou move forward with something, not for purposes of our debate but for \npurposes of how it might look to your constituents. So you look to your \nconstituents and you look to your sense of what people are feeling \nabout the system for an answer to your question.\n  In answer to your question, there is no automatic connection between \nevery time a Senator does something for an interest and corruption--of \ncourse not--or the appearance of corruption. But the question is, How \ndo the American people feel about the process?\n  What I am saying is, what this debate is about, because we got into \nthe issue of soft money, is whether there is a level of contribution, \nwhether the dollars get so high that the Supreme Court's language of it \nbeing inherently appearing corrupt comes into play. I suggest when you \nget into high numbers of contributions, you cannot avoid the appearance \nof corruption. You may avoid actual corruption, but you cannot avoid \nthe appearance of corruption when we increasingly have the reality of \npeople giving $500,000 apiece.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I can ask the Senator an additional question--and I \nappreciate his comments; I think we are getting somewhere--will the \nSenator agree that the appearance of corruption would be much lower if \nthere were no contribution identified at all, which is the case in the \ncircumstance that I have raised? There has been no contribution \nidentified from anyone connected with this in any form. Does the \nSenator not agree, therefore, that the appearance of corruption here \nwould be pretty low?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Again, I do not know the specifics of the case the \nSenator is discussing. Obviously, given the issue we are raising about \nsoft money, the strongest case is made if you demonstrate large soft \nmoney contributions. That is most likely to lead to an appearance of \ncorruption.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware this is a straw man because what I \nsaid, and I repeat for about the tenth time:\n\n       Special interests and unlimited contributions were a key \n     ingredient--\n\n  And then I listed a whole bunch. I have listed for 10 years on my web \nsite unauthorized appropriations to which I have taken great offense. I \nhave argued that they are wrong. I will continue to argue they are \nwrong, and if the Senator from Utah wants to somehow interpret the fact \nthat soft money is a key element or is not a key element in his \nparticular appropriation, that is fine. I am telling the Senator from \nUtah that I listed a lot of projects. Some fall into the category of \nunauthorized appropriations.\n  I have said it now about five times, and I hope we can move forward. \nWe only have 5 days of debate. I hope we can move forward with various \namendments and allow other Members to make statements; otherwise, we \nrapidly approach the appearance of a filibuster which was not the \nagreement that Senator Feingold and I entered into with the majority \nleader when we began. There are Senators who have been waiting to give \nstatements. There are Senators who have been waiting to give \nspeeches. And we have massaged this issue rather significantly.\n\n  Again, I ask the Senator from Wisconsin if he agrees with me, the way \nwe usually function in the consideration of legislation is proponents \nof the legislation have an amendment and then opponents have an \nopportunity to propose an amendment. We had understood that would be \nthe way we would proceed.\n  Is that the perception of the Senator from Wisconsin of this \nagreement, which was really a gentleman's agreement?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly agree with the Senator's \nsuggestion of how we are going to proceed. And to reiterate, when I \nstarted on the floor on May 20, 1999 and talked about various changes \nin the mining law that were prevented under the emergency supplemental \nappropriations conference report, as the Senate suggested, I was not \ntalking about a particular contribution to any particular Member. It \nwas a process with many factors. One of the factors was the $10.6 \nmillion the mining interests gave over a 6-year period. To me, that is \nof such a high level that it raises an appearance of corruption.\n  I think that is exactly what the Senator from Arizona is getting at, \nand exactly what he was trying to do in the case before us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe we are ready to vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask my friend from Kentucky a \nquestion as to how we are going to proceed. I think the discussion has \nbeen important, but it has taken several hours. I do not know when we \nstarted on this, but I think it was at 10:30 or a quarter of 11. It is \nnow 1:30. I have a list of nine Senators on the Democratic side who \nwish to give statements on the general bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Nevada, I wanted to start last \nnight and no one wanted to stay past 7:30. Many of us believe this is a \nvery important amendment. We have spent a couple of hours on it. But it \nis important. We are now ready to vote.\n  I agree with the suggestions that have been made that we go back and \nforth. As you know, this is not a straight party-line issue. So I think \nback and forth means people who are generally in sympathy with this \nlegislation offer an amendment; people who are not do not offer an \namendment. The people who are not just offered one, which we are about \nto approve on a voice vote. My view is, you are next.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Kentucky, we will be happy to give \nevery consideration to alternating amendments. That seems to be a \nthoughtful suggestion. However, prior to our offering any amendments, \nwe want to be able to speak on the underlying bill. That is the normal \nprocedure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is fine.\n  Mr. REID. We have people who have requested time from 5 minutes to 30 \nminutes, reasonable requests for time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. We agree with the Senator from Kentucky, this is an \nimportant issue. But people have been waiting over here for a long time \nto discuss the issue.\n  So we are ready to vote on this matter at this time. It is going to \nbe, I understand, by voice; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2293.\n  The amendment (No. 2293) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S12595]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am going to take a couple minutes, and then I will \nyield the floor. I know the Senator from New York has been waiting \npatiently.\n  The debate we just had has been an effort--toward the end of it--to \nshift it in a different direction. We are going to come back to this \nover and over again for the next 3 or 4 days.\n  We are not just talking about the appearance of corruption. What the \nSenator from Arizona has repeatedly said is things such as, ``corrupts \nour political ideals,'' ``we are all corrupted,'' ``the corruption of \nCongress,'' ``soft money is corrupting the process.''\n  These have been allegations of corruption, which is a violation of \nSenate rules and a violation of Federal bribery statutes.\n  I would suggest to all of our colleagues, in our exuberance to pursue \nour different points of view on this issue, do not suggest corruption \nunless you have evidence of corruption. It demeans the Senate, and in \nthe instances of Senators Bennett and Gorton, it demeans a specific \nSenator. It is clear from this debate, there is no evidence--none \nwhatsoever--of corruption.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask to address the Senate for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair and all of my colleagues.\n  Before I get into the substance of the bill, I think many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, in this last debate, are \nmissing the forest for the trees. In fact, in my judgment, the Senators \nfrom Kentucky and Utah and Washington have helped make the case for the \nbill, not only in the specifics that I talked about with the Senator \nfrom Utah before, but everyone in this Chamber, all three, in my \njudgment, all three have felt compelled, in a certain sense, to explain \nthemselves. All three are very honorable people. I tend to be \nsympathetic. If I were listed, I would feel the same way.\n  But there is a cloud hanging over the Senate. There is a cloud \nhanging over this Capitol Dome and all of Washington. In good part, it \nhas been caused by the way we finance campaigns.\n  So even when Senators have the purest of motives, they are called \ninto question. The good Senator from Utah felt his integrity was \nquestioned. The Senator from Washington felt his integrity was \nquestioned. The Senator from Kentucky was defending the honor of his \ncolleagues.\n  Why was that necessary? It is necessary because with the system we \nuse today, there is such mistrust that no action--no action--no matter \nhow purely done, is perceived that way.\n  Obviously, there are many gradations. Pick Senator A and Senator B; \nSenator A is a lifelong believer in the pro-life movement and receives \nmoney from a pro-life PAC. Nobody questions that--or pro-choice.\n  But how about if Senator C believes strongly that a certain facility \nor company needs dollars to bring jobs to his area and receives \ncontributions closely related to that? Everyone doubts it.\n  I would argue to you that those two cases, at least on a factual \nbasis, are not distinguishable. But every--every--move we make in \nWashington is now under a cloud. It is under a cloud because of the \nsystem by which we finance campaigns. We must change it.\n  This is the most important vote we are facing in this whole year of \nCongress, period. I know we have had important ones. But the very \nroots, the foundations of this democracy, are being eaten away by \npublic cynicism. In good part, that public cynicism is caused by our \nsystem of financing campaigns.\n  The great debates we have had this year--whether it be on impeachment \nor guns or Patients' Bill of Rights--over every one of them, the cloud \nof how we finance campaigns hung over it. The debate is vitiating by \nthat cloud, and because of this system people feel further and further \naway from the Government that is theirs.\n  So those who argue for the status quo, saying nothing is wrong, or \nother issues that predominate, sort of befuddle me. I am surprised at \nthe advocacy of the first amendment by some on the issue of financing \ncampaigns, when that advocacy on other issues--freedom of artistic \nexpression--does not seem to be there. I find that befuddling.\n  But, to me, there is no higher value that we can create than trust \nbetween the people and their Government. If that trust continues to \ndecline, I don't know if this system of Government survives. So to \nargue whether the Senator from Utah or the Senator from Washington was \nmaligned in a specific and wrong way, misses the point. To argue that \nevery Senator is maligned fairly or unfairly by a system that the \npublic perceives--and their perception is not out of cloud 9; their \nperception has many bases in reality--is making that Government further \nand further removed from their reach, that is what we are talking \nabout.\n\n  This proposal is a minor proposal in the broad scheme of what we must \ndo. It is, to me, a disappointment. I would have liked to have gone a \nlot further. I do not hold my colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin \nresponsible for that. They are trying to go as far as this body will \nlet them go.\n  One thing I believe we cannot do--one thing we try to do too often--\nis let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The McCain-Feingold \nproposal will make some good, positive changes. Will it advantage one \nparty or the other? I don't know. I don't think any of us can predict. \nWill it advantage one race, one person in a political race over \nanother? Maybe yes; maybe no. We know one thing. We know it will begin \nthat first step of rebuilding trust between the people and their \nGovernment. It will begin the first step so the kind of debate that \noccurred on the floor a few minutes ago won't be necessary, because the \npublic will have the kind of faith they had in their elected officials \nin decades and centuries past.\n  We must move forward. Can we improve on the proposal before us? Yes. \nI am going to offer a proposal, most likely with the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel, to say that when there are independent \nexpenditures and when there are independent committees, the financing \nthere must be disclosed. That will help a little bit more without \nvitiating the chances of passing this bill. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport that. We will be talking about it.\n  The bottom line is, we have a tremendously serious problem. We have a \npoison that is in the roots of this great tree of democracy. It is \nspreading day by day, week by week, and month by month. That poison is \ncynicism. That poison is a view of the average citizen, rightly or \nwrongly--and in many cases, it is right--that the average person \ndoesn't have the influence of a person or a company or a group of great \nwealth. We have to begin to change it. In a complicated world, where \ndecisions are not so clear and not so black and white, we cannot afford \nto have every decision, difficult as they are on the merits, be held in \naskance or even contempt by average citizenry because they don't think \nthey have a fair shot at influencing their legislator.\n  I ran for office at the age of 23, right out of law school. It is \nbecause I believed in our system of government. There were tens of \nthousands of young men and women, Republicans and Democrats, who threw \nthemselves into government because they believed. We had seen good \nthings happen in terms of World War II, getting out of the Depression, \nthe prosperity of the 1950s, the civil rights movement, and the \nprotests, angry at times, that changed our course in Vietnam. People \nbelieved.\n  My guess is that there are far fewer 23-year-olds today who are \nmaking the sacrifices it takes to go into government because of the \ncynicism, because of the mistrust, because of the problems of financing \ntheir own campaigns. If we can no longer get our best young people \ngoing into government, whether it be elected or appointed, and if we \ncan no longer have the citizens believe, when this body debates an \nissue, that the debates are being divided by firmly held beliefs rather \nthan by who is manipulating, controlling, or contributing to whom, then \nwe can't survive as a democracy. That fatal distance between people and \ntheir government will get larger and larger and larger. We will wake up \none morning and say: We don't have the kind of democracy that the \nJeffersons and the Madisons and the Washingtons and the Jays believed \nin and put together for us.\n\n  This is not a trivial debate. The bill is smaller than many of us \nwould like. But it is a debate that goes to the core\n\n[[Page S12596]]\n\nof whether this Government will ultimately survive.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to look at the \nspecific details of ``this provision is in'' and ``that provision is \nout,'' but to look at the broad, in general, anger, hostility, \ncynicism, skepticism, and impotence that the public believes they have \nin relation to their government; then ask what can be done about it.\n  My guess is, one of the few things we actually can do as Senators is \npass the bill the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin have put \ntogether. It is an important debate. I am glad we are getting to debate \nit on the floor. I hope and pray that at the end of the day we will not \nwalk out of this Chamber emptyhanded and end up being worse off than we \nwere before the debate started, as the public will believe this \nGovernment has finally pulled totally out of their reach and influence.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My colleague, Senator Durbin, is in order. I ask \nunanimous consent that he be allowed to speak now. I have the floor, \nbut I don't want to jump ahead of him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  This debate on campaign finance reform is certainly not a new topic \nfor any Member of this Chamber. I start by saluting my colleague, \nSenator John McCain of Arizona. He has been my friend since we served \ntogether in the House of Representatives many years ago. We have \ndiffered from time to time, which is not unusual in politics, but I \nhave the greatest respect and admiration for the leadership he has \nshown on this and so many important issues, such as tobacco and others, \nthat are near and dear to my heart. I thank him. I know that sometimes \nit is a lonely task to be a leader on an issue. I respect him very much \nfor what he has done.\n  My colleague, Senator Russ Feingold, deserves similar accolades, and \nmore, for the leadership role he has taken on this issue. Senator \nFeingold, in his race for reelection in the State of Wisconsin, \ndemonstrated rare political courage when he said he would live by the \nstandards he preached when it came to campaign finance reform. It is a \nreal test for every one of us in public life to be held to that \nstandard. I am glad the people of the State of Wisconsin not only \nrespected his decision but said they wanted him to continue as their \nspokesman in the Senate. I am happy to count him as a colleague and a \nfriend.\n  I find this debate to be absolutely critical when it comes to the \nfuture of our Nation. I don't think what is at stake in this debate is \njust a question of money and where it comes from. It is about much \nmore. What is at stake in this debate is the future of this democracy. \nWe expect politicians to be hyperbolic, to say things that sound so \nsweeping, they can't be true. But in my heart, I really believe what I \nhave said is true. I am honestly, genuinely, and personally concerned, \nas a Member of the Senate, a former Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, and as a person who, for better or worse, has devoted \nhis adult live to public service, about the fact that the people I \nrepresent and we represent are losing interest in their Government. The \nclearest indication of that loss of interest is in their declining \nparticipation in elections.\n\n  Why is it, at this moment in the history of the United States of \nAmerica, in the closing days of 1999, as we anticipate a new century \nand a new millennium, as we see the end of the so-called American \ncentury, when we swell with pride when hearing our national anthem and \nseeing our flag and appreciating what this country is all about, when \nwe watch as leaders from around the world in burgeoning democracies \ncome here to the United States to validate their pursuit of democratic \nideals--why is it now that the people of the United States of America \nhave decided they are basically not going to be involved in the most \ncritical single decision any citizen can make, which is the decision to \nvote for the man or woman of their choice for public office?\n  I have tried to analyze this, and I have to say it is interesting \nthat this problem, in my mind, relates to this debate on the floor. \nThis is a debate about political campaigns, money, and voters.\n  I have a bar graph I would like to display which shows in fairly \ngraphic terms what I think this debate is all about. If you look at \nthis, you will notice that, in 1960, in the Presidential election \ncampaign, both candidates spent the relatively meager sum of $175 \nmillion. And then, if you will fast forward to the estimated \nexpenditures of the 1996 campaign--a span of 36 years--it went from \n$175 million to $4 billion.\n  What happened in between to cause this dramatic increase in spending \non campaigns? Certainly inflation was part of it, but this is more than \ninflation. What happened is that candidates--myself included, and \nvirtually every Member of the Senate--decided that to win a vote or \nentice a voter, they had to spend money in record amounts--on \ntelevision, on radio, direct mail, bumper stickers, pocket combs.\n  I carry a comb in my pocket given to me by a friend named Craig \nLovett who ran for Congress and lost. About the only thing remembered \nof Craig's campaign is these wonderful combs, which I have carried \naround for over 20 years. He was a great fellow, and he has passed \naway. Sometimes that is all that is left of a campaign. We spend money \non things such as that, as candidates, in trying to reach the voters, \ntouch the voters, convince them we are worth voting for. If you look at \nthem, you have to ask, as we plow more money into our political system \nof elections, is it working? The honest answer is that it is not.\n  There is another part of this graph that is worth noting, too. The \nstatistics here indicate voter turnout in Presidential elections. Look \nat what is happening. When we spent $175 million in 1960, 63.1 percent \nof the eligible voters turned out. Then we started piling on big time \nall the money we could find and raise legally in the system. And what \nhappened? There was a steady decline in voter interest and \nparticipation to 49.1 percent in 1996. We have lost 14 percent of the \neligible electorate as we have plowed massive amounts of money into the \nsystem.\n  Some people on the other side of this debate have argued that the \nweakness in the American political system is not enough money. If we \ncan just jam this blue bar up in the next campaign to $5 billion, $6 \nbillion, and beyond, they will tell you, in their way of thinking, that \nis how democracy works. I have heard political spokesmen such as George \nWill talk about money being free speech, and if we had more free \nspeech--that is, more money--then we would be living up to our \nconstitutional ideal, and that is what we should be all about. But the \nfacts don't bear that out. The more money we plow into it, the fewer \npeople turn out to vote. I think that is significant because I think \nsomething is happening here that really is worth our observation.\n\n  Look at what happened on November 5, 1996--or perhaps what didn't \nhappen. I think it represented the single most dangerous and tragic \nthreat to our democracy, the outcome of that election campaign--not the \ncandidates, but from the voters' point of view. One need not look \nbeyond the voter turnout in the last Presidential election to recognize \nthe degree of public disillusionment in America. It is perplexing that \nthis very same election cycle that spawned skyrocketing revenues and \noutlays in campaign dollars generated only a 49.08-percent turnout at \nthe polls.\n  The 1996 Presidential campaign had the lowest national average \nturnout for a Presidential election in 72 years. The money was there; \nthe voters weren't. If one accounts for the flood of new voters in 1924 \nwith the passage of women's suffrage, it may have been the lowest \npercentage turnout of eligible voters to vote for President since mass \npopular balloting was introduced in America in the 1830s, in the 160-\nyear history of the United States. And by 1996, the voters of the \nUnited States said: None of the above; we don't care; a majority will \nstay home.\n  The average voter participation rate in Presidential elections \nbetween 1948 and 1968 was 60.4 percent. This dropped to a 53.2-percent \naverage turnout from 1972 to 1992. Campaigns are too long,\n\n[[Page S12597]]\n\ntoo expensive, too negative, and a majority of self-respecting people \nhave said: We don't want to sully our hands by even voting. And they \nvote with their feet; they stay home.\n  The decline in the exercise of the basic right of citizenship is a \ngrave concern. More than 100 million Americans of voting age don't \nparticipate. I don't think this is an accident. Despite the fact that \nwe tend to register more voters--an increase of some 8 million eligible \nvoters, resulting in 4 million being registered--fewer Americans cast \ntheir ballots in the most recent election, the 1998 mid-term, than in \n1994's similar election, plunging voter turnout to the lowest level in \nover 50 years.\n  I think the message here is clear. Americans have watched this \nelectoral process, and an estimated 119 million of them have decided to \navoid the ballot box like a root canal. That is the largest number in \nAmerican history. If you look at the United States in terms of other \ncountries around the world and all the things we point to with pride in \nthis country, we cannot point to voter participation with pride.\n  According to data compiled by IDEA, the United States ranked 114 out \nof 140 countries the voter turnout of which has been assessed since \n1945. Despite all the money, we don't see the participation we have \ncome to expect.\n  The life of a Senator is a wonderful life in many respects. I am so \nhonored to represent a great State such as Illinois and to be able to \nstand in this Chamber and use my best judgment on my votes to try to \nhelp them. But the path to the Senate, for someone who is not \nindependently wealthy, is a path that takes you to many small offices, \nmany desks, many telephones, and many telephone calls to perfect \nstrangers, begging for money.\n\n  When I was a Member of the House of Representatives running for the \nSenate, I used to take off during the course of a day, drive about a \nblock away to a little cubicle I had rented, where I could sit and \nlegally make fundraising calls. I would take every available minute to \ndo it. When I received my beeper notification, I would race back to the \nfloor of the House of Representatives to cast a vote and then back to \nmake more phone calls and raise more money. Of course, it is going to \nhave an impact on your private life, and it had an impact on my public \nlife, too. I can remember, to this minute, the day I left to race over \nand make a vote on the floor of the House. As I cast my vote, I looked \nup and thought of the list of potential contributors I was now about to \ncall. But there were two or three of them I could not call. I just \nvoted against them. You know, when that becomes part of the \ncalculation, it takes something away from your judgment.\n  I don't point the finger of blame to any of my colleagues in this \nChamber. I think they are, by and large, to my knowledge, some of the \nmost honorable people I have come to know in life, and they are really \nconscientious in the job they do. But the system as it is currently \nconstructed is a system that, frankly, is going to lead all of us to \nmake conclusions and make decisions which may not be the right ones.\n  The argument on the other side against Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold is the suggestion that more money into this system is going to \nmake it better. This is not a new argument. We have seen it in several \nother iterations.\n  I can recall the debate over guns in America. The National Rifle \nAssociation is for a concealed carry law. What does it mean? It means \nall of us would be able to carry a gun around in our pockets or, for \nwomen, in their purses, taking them into shopping malls, restaurants, \nchurches, and high school basketball games. It is their belief that \nthis proliferation of guns in America will make us safer.\n  Yesterday, we had a vote on a nuclear test ban treaty. Many of us \nbelieve that we have all the nuclear weapons in the world we will ever \nneed and that we should have passed that treaty to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons in those countries that possess them. The treaty was \ndefeated. Those who wanted fewer nuclear weapons lost. Those who \nbelieve we shouldn't have a limit on testing and, therefore, the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons around the world prevailed. They \nbelieve, obviously, that more nuclear weapons around the world make us \nsafer. I don't share that belief.\n  But a similar argument is at hand. There are those who argue that \nmore money going into the political system will somehow result in \nbetter men and women being elected to Congress and to other offices. I \ndon't believe that is the case.\n\n  In 1996, the Republicans raised $548 million; the Democrats raised \n$332 million. The Republicans outraised us 65 percent more than we did \nin 1996. In 1992, both parties had only raised $507 million. So you can \nsee the numbers going up dramatically.\n  Part of the resistance to campaign finance reform reflects the \nreality that the incumbent Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate does not want to put an end to a good \nthing. I can understand that. It makes sense to me as a political \nperson that some might take that position, with notable exceptions such \nas Congressman Shays from Connecticut, the Republican who supports \ncampaign finance reform, and others on the Republican side.\n  Centuries ago, Machiavelli wrote his famous book, ``The Prince,'' and \noutlined some ideas and principles of politics. I have always said that \nif he did not have a chapter in his book on the subject, he should, and \nit should be entitled ``If you have the power, for God's sake, don't \ngive it away.'' The power now is in the money. And many on the \nRepublican side of the aisle who are capable of raising more money than \nwe do on the Democratic side of the aisle do not want to surrender that \nadvantage.\n  It is similar to handing a weapon to your enemy, as they see it. That \nis an understandable conclusion by some. But thank goodness for Senator \nMcCain and others who have risen above it and said it is an empty \nvictory to continue the status quo, the current system of campaign \nfundraising, if in fact we are losing credibility and losing the \nrespect of the American people. What good does it do for us to be \nelected and supposedly lead this country when the American people do \nnot give us the respect for the office or the job we do? It has a lot \nto do with the campaign finance system.\n  This bill in its particulars addresses many issues, and one of them \nprimarily in the focus of this debate is on the question of soft money. \nIn 1996, the Republican national party committees tallied soft money \nreceipts of $141 million; in 1998, an off year, $131.6 million. That \nwas the dramatic increase over the prior off-year election. The \nDemocratic side raised $122 million in soft money in 1996 and, in 1998, \n$92.8 million. That was a 89-percent increase over the summer election \ncycle just a few years before.\n  Much time and energy has been spent in the aftermath of the 1996 \nFederal election cycle, launching accusations about questionable \npractices that occurred. I sat through Senator Thompson's hearings \ninvestigating the Presidential campaign for a year. There were \ncertainly irregularities and embarrassments involved in that campaign. \nI am certain as I stand here that similar irregularities and \nembarrassments happen on both sides--Democrat and Republican.\n  You cannot deal with these massive sums of money from people whom you \ndon't know as well as you might a member of your family and not run \ninto embarrassing circumstances. I have. There have been times when I \nhave received checks in my campaign and have taken a hard look at them \nand said, ``Send them back.'' It just raises too big a question as to \nwhether my values and principles are being compromised. Think about a \nnational party raising millions of dollars under similar circumstances \nand wondering if any single check is tainted or raises questions about \nyour honesty.\n  What we learned from investigating the Presidential campaigns is that \nsome of the most reprehensible and unseemly tactics are perfectly legal \nunder the law today. Several loopholes in the law allow funds to be \nraised and spent in ways that do not violate the letter, although they \nmight violate the spirit, of the law. Chief among them is soft money \ndonations.\n  It is an arcane world for the average American to try to figure out \nthe difference between hard money and soft money, caps on spending, and \nthe like. I can tell you, there are certain things that can basically \ndifferentiate them.\n\n[[Page S12598]]\n\n Hard money is limited as to how much you can raise with each \nindividual. You are limited as to the sources and individuals as well \nas PACs. You are limited in how much they can give, and everything is \ndisclosed.\n  Hard money is a reform that really tried to clean up the system by \nsaying, if we limit those who can give while staying away from \ncorporations, for example, and we limit how much people can give, and \nthen we have full disclosure, we will have a more honest system. I \nthink the premise was sound.\n  Soft money violates basically all these rules. Soft money doesn't \nlive by these limitations. The sources, the amounts, and the \ndisclosures in many cases just aren't there.\n  That is what this debate is about. Senators McCain and Feingold have \nsaid put an end to this soft money and the problems it creates for our \nelectoral system.\n  There are several items and issues that will come up, I am sure, \nlater in the debate. I am going to hold back from going into some of \nthem. One of them has to do with issue ads. I am looking forward to \nthat because I think my greatest fear is that if we ban soft money, we \nwill create vehicles for more and more independent so-called \n``independent organizations'' to appear and become part of this \nprocess.\n  Let me close by saying this: I have supported the McCain-Feingold \nbill as originally written. It embodied a number of reforms that I \nthink are essential to restore confidence in this electoral process. I \nhave been disappointed by some sponsors. I understand their political \nrealities. But I have been disappointed in the fact that we have over \ntime lost some of the major reform provisions in the bill and we are \nnow focusing on just one--the abolition of soft money. There are many \nother parts of that bill which deserve to be enacted into law if we are \ngoing to have real reform.\n  I will close on this note. I hope this Congress--particularly this \nSenate--can muster the political courage to vote for this reform. I \nhope that will happen. I am skeptical as to whether that will be the \noutcome.\n  We have seen demonstrated in American political history time and time \nagain that it takes a major overwhelming scandal for this Congress to \nact to enact real reform. The Watergate scandal is one example, and \nothers have shown up in our history. We are not dealing with such a \nscandal today in specifics, but we are dealing with a scandalous \nsystem, a system which really troubles me the most, that so many \nAmericans have given up on us. We can't allow that to happen. We can't \nafford it.\n  For those who argue that we have to allow the very wealthiest in \nAmerica to be articulate in our political process by writing checks for \nthousands--$10,000, $20,000, $50,000, or $100,000--I think on its face \nis laughable. To think we would give up on working people, average \nfamilies, and businesses making modest amounts and disclosing \ncontributions and instead turn this process over to the wealthiest in \nAmerica is to give up on the very basis of this democracy. It will \ncontinue to push away from the average American that interest they \nshould have in this most fundamental system of representative \ndemocracy.\n  I rise in support of McCain-Feingold.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think we will alternate sides.\n  I ask my colleague from Tennessee, if we are going to rotate, could I \nask unanimous consent I be allowed to follow the Senator from \nTennessee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation as amended. I do so based upon the premise that it is our \nresponsibility in this body, it is our responsibility as a Congress, to \naddress the issues concerning the election of Federal officials. I can \nthink of nothing more appropriate to address than how we elect Federal \nofficials and the way in which we elect them. It is not up to the \nFederal Election Commission to do this for Congress. It is not up to \nthe Attorney General to do this for Congress, nor the lower courts. It \nis for Congress to state precisely what kind of system we want--or no \nsystem, if we don't want a system--to state that clearly and be willing \nto stand up and make a case.\n  This is a balancing process, one that has been endorsed by the \nSupreme Court of the United States. I think the purists on both sides \nof this issue probably have missed the boat. It clearly does cost more \nnow to run campaigns than it used to cost. In my opinion, the $1,000 \nlimitation, for example, is clearly too low. It needs to be adjusted \nfor inflation. On the other hand, those who say there is not enough \nmoney in politics and that we should be able to donate unlimited \namounts of money to parties for the benefit of those who are running \nfor office I think miss the boat, also. Surely, we can strike some kind \nof a balance wherein we can address the legitimate costs of running for \noffice and the fact that we are not going to be able to eliminate money \nfrom politics on the one hand with certain reasonable limitations that \ndo not cause public cynicism and do not cause questions to be raised \nconcerning the motivations of those who write the laws in this country.\n  Both history and common sense demonstrate beyond any purview of a \ndoubt there is something inherently problematic with giving large \namounts of money to people who write the laws, especially when donors \nof that money are affected by the laws that are being written. That is \nnot a novel concept. That is something historians back in the 19th \ncentury were talking about. They were talking about the downfall of the \nRoman Empire, something that the Venetians addressed seven centuries \nago when they placed strict limits on what could be given to elect the \nofficials. Under their system, if one was going to ask elected \nofficials for any favors, one couldn't contribute to them at all.\n  We have recognized that in this body. Senator Barry Goldwater, who is \none of my heroes, has been called Mr. Republican; he has been called \nMr. Conservative over the years. He is the conscience of the \nconservatives. It is one of the things that caused me to want to get \ninto politics. I admired his courage. I also admired what was on his \nmind. He was always a man of integrity and always willing to look a \nlittle bit further than the end of his nose, look a little bit further \nthan things that affected him.\n  He said in 1983 about big money:\n\n       It eats at the heart of the democratic process. It feeds \n     the growth of special interest groups created solely to \n     channel money into political campaigns. It creates the \n     impression that every candidate is bought and owned by the \n     biggest givers, and it causes elected officials to devote \n     more time to raising money than to their public duties. If \n     the present trends continue, voter participation will drop \n     off significantly--\n\n  I might ask parenthetically if that sounds familiar--\n\n     public respect will fall to an all-time low--\n\n  I ask the same question--\n\n     and political campaigns will be controlled by slick packaging \n     artists, and neglect of public duties by absentee officials \n     will undermine government praises.\n\n  That was Barry Goldwater in 1983. I am disappointed some of my \ncolleagues on the Senate floor did not have an opportunity to question \nhim and interrogate him and try to get him to name names as to those \nwho are corrupt. That is what Barry Goldwater said in 1983.\n  It is not just statements made here that recognize this inherent \nproblem to which there is no one answer--I might add, an inherent \nobvious problem--and has been with us over the centuries. It is based \non human nature. In response to that, we do such things as pass a gift \nban. If there is no problem with the giving of things to public \nofficials and to candidates for office, why have we passed the gift ban \nrule? But we did. So we have the rather curious situation now where an \nindividual cannot buy a Member dinner, but he can give a Member $1,000 \nfor his campaign. Or he can bundle $100,000 for you. Or if he is rich \nenough, he can give $1 million to your party for your benefit, but he \ncannot buy you dinner.\n  We recognize this basic question in the laws that we pass. In 1907, \nwe banned corporate contributions. In 1943, we banned union \ncorporations. In 1974, we passed limits on amounts of money that could \nbe given to individual candidates. We passed limits on amounts of money \nthat could be given to political parties. We set up a system\n\n[[Page S12599]]\n\nof partially funding Presidential campaigns--the idea being if the \ntaxpayers funded the Presidential campaigns, the Presidential \ncandidates would not have to go out and raise private money.\n  Why were we concerned about that if it is the same old answer--the \nthings we have been talking about for the last few minutes. We set up \nthat system. I might say, since that was passed and has been in effect \nsince 1976, until the last Presidential campaign, we have had no real \nproblems in terms of scandals. The Presidential candidates each spent \nabout the same amount of money; sometimes Republicans won, sometimes \nDemocrats, sometimes incumbents, sometimes challengers. That is what we \nhad until recently.\n  This balance that was struck--not impeding first amendment rights but \nrecognizing this inherent question, this inherent historical century-\nold problem--the balance that was struck was upheld by the Supreme \nCourt. The Supreme Court acknowledged we were placing limitations on \nindividuals, perhaps involving the first amendment in some ways, but \nthe Supreme Court said in striking a balance between that legitimate \nconcern on the one hand and the concern over the corruption or \nappearance of corruption on the other hand was a decent one to strike \nand was permissible to strike. So we set up a system of limitations and \ndisclosures.\n  This is not a personal matter. This does not have to do with \nindividual Members. It is not about Members as individuals as we \nconsider this in the Senate and the Congress. We haven't been here for \nvery long when considering the course of history, and none will be here \nvery much longer. What we are supposed to do is look past that and do \nwhat is necessary and beneficial for the country.\n  I have been distressed in watching this morning, that all of the \nconcern supposedly has not been on the merits of campaign finance but \nattacks on the Senator from Arizona because he has raised these \nquestions--the same ones that Barry Goldwater raised. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to get back and debate the issues as to whether or not our \ncurrent situation is a good one.\n  I was thumbing through some material. I haven't been able to catch up \non my reading lately. I suggest we direct our attention to what people \nare saying--not the Senator from Arizona, not Common Cause, not the \nACLU, not the advocates we all are on the issues.\n  Congressional Daily was put out by the National Journal on October 7. \nThis journal is primarily a discussion of the legislative issues, what \nis happening and what is going to happen. In this article written by \nBruce Stokes, I was struck by this passage that probably didn't raise \nany eyebrows because it is so common nowadays. This man wrote:\n\n       More importantly, the China WTO issue may loom large in \n     some congressional primaries not because voters will care but \n     because candidates on both sides of the issue will use it to \n     raise money from business and labor, a milk cow Members of \n     Congress may be reluctant to cut off by actually voting on \n     the issue.\n\n  That is not something I would say. I do not know that to be true at \nall. But this is what people writing for the National Journal are \nsaying. I suggest we ought to be concerned about that. We ought to be a \nlittle bit more concerned about the message and not so much concerned \nabout the messenger. So maybe we can get back to the issue, as we \nproceed these next few days, as to whether or not we have a good \nsituation in this country today.\n  I suggest it is not about the total amount of money in politics. \nPeople argue there is too much money in politics; there is not enough \nmoney in politics. How long is a piece of string? I am not here to say \nthere is too much or too little money in politics per se. People point \nout Procter & Gamble spends more on advertising soap than we spend on \npolitics. But I would say a couple of things about this.\n  No. 1, I draw a distinction between what we do and soap making. I \nhope it would be fairly obvious but perhaps not.\n  Second, the problem, again, is the age-old question: What do we do \nabout the necessity for money in politics and political campaigns on \nthe one hand and the inherent problem of giving large sums of money to \nindividual politicians, to individual legislators, or to individual \nparties which will inure to the benefit of those legislators? Procter & \nGamble has nothing to do with that. The advertisers who place those \nads, the people who run those ads, do not conduct public policy in this \ncountry, but we do.\n  So why are we here today? Why does this keep coming back? Because, as \nI have said, we have not addressed this legislatively. The answer is, \nwe are going to have to strike a new balance. We are going to have to \nreaddress what we have done in this country on campaign finance and \nwhat we have learned over the last few years because having set up a \nsystem that, for better or for worse, whether you agree with it or not, \nstruck that balance in terms of letting money in, letting people have \nenough money to run but not being overwhelmed by money so it looks as \nif your vote is based on something other than the merits--that has been \ntotally done away with, basically. We do not have that system anymore.\n\n  You say: When did Congress change it? Congress did not. Congress \nreally did not do anything to change that system. That system was \nchanged by, basically, the Federal Election Commission and by \ninterpretations of the Attorney General. Now soft money can, in large \nmeasure, do what hard money used to do. The gates have been opened. \nPresumably, after learning the lessons of the last Presidential \ncampaign and the interpretations that the highest law enforcement \nofficer in the country has placed on it, which presumably is the law \nwhich presumably is going to be the pattern candidates for both parties \nare going to be following, a candidate can now go out and raise \nmillions of dollars of soft money, run it through the State parties, \ncoordinate its expenditures, and run television ads, as long as he \ndoesn't say, ``Vote for me.'' That is basically the system we have \ntoday.\n  The system we have now is not what we want. It is not what we ever \nvoted for before. It is not the system we have had before. But because \nof FEC interpretations and the Attorney General, that is the system we \nhave now.\n  As we often have to do in this body, we have to readdress fundamental \nissues. You seldom fix anything for the duration of eternity. Sometimes \nyou can do pretty well for a couple of decades, as we did in 1974. \nPeople say it didn't work. I think it worked pretty well in most \nrespects. Certainly, in the Presidential campaigns it has worked well. \nIt has now been proven the hard money limits are too low. That is one \nof the things we have learned. What do we do? Throw the whole thing out \nor do we raise the hard money limits? I think we ought to raise the \nhard money limits in light of the reality we have learned since the \nlast time we addressed this issue.\n  We have a system now where basically there are no practical \nlimitations on any amount of money anybody wants to give to effect \npolitical campaigns. If that is what we want, an argument can be made \nthat is a good thing. It has never been made as far as I know. It has \nnever been voted on in this body. Do we want that? If we do not want \nthat, we ought to say so. If we do, we ought to say so.\n  How did we get into a situation where, without this body lifting a \nfinger, we went from a system where people were mightily concerned \nabout the $5,000 PAC check, by the $1,000 individual check--from that \nsystem, that is the last time we addressed it, to a system whereby now \nyou are not a player unless you are giving $100,000?\n  It started in 1978, the FEC rule that parties could send certain \nmoneys to the State parties; the Federal party could send to the State \nparties for party-building activity. Then in 1991, they said they could \nfund certain voter drive costs with soft money, up to a percentage: It \nis 35 percent in a nonelection year, 40 percent in an election year. In \n1995, for the first time the FEC said you can use soft money for \ntelevision. Then, Mr. Morris over at the White House showed the \nPresident how he could take the matching money, certify that \nhe wouldn't raise any money himself, go out and raise all of this \nadditional $44 million in soft money, while being able to say, ``I am \nnot raising this money for my campaign; I am raising it for the \nparty.''\n\n  So the President raises all this additional money, the President sits \nin the Oval Office and coordinates all of it,\n\n[[Page S12600]]\n\ntells what kind of ads to put on, where to put them on, how much, and \nhow much money to spend. That is the procedure that Attorney General \nReno put her stamp of approval on. Until some court or somebody--or \nthis body--says otherwise, that is the way it is.\n  Now a President or a Presidential candidate, and if so, a \ncongressional candidate, can raise unlimited amounts of soft money, run \nit through the proper party, coordinate the ads, and have ads run as \nlong as they qualify as issue ads.\n  I am not even arguing the merits of that now. I am saying that is \nwhat we have today, and I do not think a lot of people realize it. We \ndid not realize it until recently. The problem we have is that we want \nto castigate the President for opening up the floodgates. But instead \nof leaving it at that, we want to do it, too, because the system we \nhave now has been the one that has been developed by the FEC, Mr. \nMorris, the President, and the Attorney General. Those are the \nstandards we are now operating under. Those are the standards which \nMembers of this body are fighting to preserve.\n  Not only have we discovered it because a few years ago soft money did \nnot play much of a role at all, and what was there went for party-\nbuilding activities, not for what we see now--not only have we \ndiscovered it, or the President discovered it for us, we discovered it, \nwe like it, it now has constitutional protection, and we would have \npolitical disaster if we did not have it anymore. We haven't had it \nvery long, but now that we have it, it would be absolute political \ndisaster if we had to do away with it.\n  Back in 1990, for a 2-year cycle, both parties raised $25 million in \nsoft money. In 1996, under Mr. Morris and the President and their new \nplan--their Plan B, they called it--they raised $261 million. That is \nfrom $25 million at the beginning of the decade to $261 million. For \nthe first 6 months of 1999, the parties have raised $55 million and the \npredictions are, by those who do this sort of thing and have been \ncorrect in the past, that by November of 2000 we will have raised $525 \nmillion of soft money, which is more than double 1996. The year 1996 \nwas the high-water mark because that is when it was discovered; that is \nwhen it was perfected; that is when the doors were opened.\n  By November of next year, the predictions are we will double that. \nThe question is, How long will this go on? How long should it go on?\n  I suggest that we are in need of a new balance. We need to \ndrastically cut back or eliminate soft money, but we need to raise the \nhard money limits to comport with inflation.\n  It is true--and the promoters of reform need to understand this--that \nwe are developing a system whereby only the rich or the professional \npolitician can participate anymore because those limits are so low. \nThey have not kept up with inflation. If $5,000 were indexed for \ninflation today, it would be, what, $32,000, or something of that \nnature. The costs are much more. It is becoming much more time \nconsuming. We need to raise those hard dollar limits across the board, \nand then we would not need that soft money as much, for one thing, and \na lot of that soft money, I think, would come into the hard money \nsystem.\n  That would be consistent with our long history of concern on this \nmatter and our long history of legislating on this matter.\n  What are the arguments? I would have hoped by now we would have heard \na little bit more about the merits and the arguments of this case \ninstead of the personalities. But as I understand the arguments, No. 1, \nall this soft money--it is true that the floodgates have been opened. \nIt is true that in every election cycle, we will be doubling the amount \nof money next time. We will be up there with good old Procter & Gamble \nbefore long.\n  The answer is, this just goes to parties; it does not go to \ncandidates, so it cannot have a corrupting influence. I am wondering, \nif that is the case, why are we spending so much time raising it. I am \nwondering why President Clinton spent so much time raising it in the \nWhite House? Did he really enjoy having coffee with all that many \npeople because the money was going to the Democratic National \nCommittee? And yet he continued to raise it.\n  Do the national committees have no relationship at all to the \nmembers? I do not think we want to try to convince the American people \nof that. Roger Tamraz met with Don Fowler when he was chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee. Tamraz agreed to contribute $300,000 to \nthe DNC. He had an oil pipeline he wanted to build in the Caspian Sea \nregion.\n  To make a very long story short, he was able to set up a meeting with \nthe Vice President. To the Vice President's credit, he canceled that \nmeeting. He kept working. He got Mr. Fowler to call the National \nSecurity Council for him. He got Mr. Fowler to call the CIA for him. \nTamraz attended six events with President Clinton in 9 months. Sullivan \nover at the Democratic National Committee prepared two memos \nsummarizing Tamraz's hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions \nto various Democratic institutions. Four days later, he attended a \ncoffee with the President, talked about the pipeline with Mr. McCarty, \nand McCarty later enlisted Energy Department officials to lobby for the \npipeline, officials who were aware of Mr. Tamraz's contributions to the \nDNC.\n  I do not think anyone would contend that Mr. Fowler, who was chairman \nof the DNC at that time, had no influence with regard to the members of \nhis own party and the members of this administration. Some people say \nMr. Tamraz did not get what he wanted. Is that cause for great comfort \nto find out in a situation such as this, a pitiful situation such as \nthis, that this individual did not in this instance get what he wanted? \nBesides, I raise the question, if there had not been a courageous young \nwoman by the name of Ms. Heslin at the National Security Council who \nwas raising red flags about all of this, I do not know whether or not \nMr. Tamraz's luck would have been different.\n\n  The same principles are involved with soft money contributions as \nthey are with hard money contributions. This is not an easy thing to \ndiscuss. This is not something where anybody wants to be holier than \nthou. We all raise money. We all know we have to raise money. We all \ntry to strike a balance in terms of amounts, in terms of appearances, \nbut if we really are trying to strike a proper balance to come up with \nsomething that may not necessarily be the best in the world for us as \nan individual politician but really is something the country is going \nto have to move toward, if we really do our jobs, we are going to have \nto do that.\n  Let's not kid ourselves: We are not casting aspersions on any \nindividual. It is not enough for us to stand up and say: OK, who here \nis a crook? I see no hands; therefore, there is no problem. Let's go \nhome.\n  We are talking about something that is supposed to pertain for all \ntime and something that, hopefully, will deal with appearances as well \nas reality, appearances that the Supreme Court recognizes as a valid \nconcern and has been recognized as a valid concern throughout history.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield to me for one question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Utah, the \nargument I made both on my web site and today is that I believe that \npart of the problem--indeed, a key ingredient of wasteful spending and \nspecial interest tax breaks--is the effect of soft money on the \nlegislative process. Not that every bit of pork that Members secure is \ncaused by soft money, but in the aggregate, wasteful spending is caused \nby, among other things, soft money.\n  Let me offer my colleagues a definition of ``corruption'' from \nWebster's dictionary. Corruption: The impairment of integrity, virtue, \nor moral principle.\n  Note, this definition does not say that corruption occurs only when \nlaws are broken. I have already cited, as has the Senator from \nWisconsin, the large amount of soft money given to both parties by \nvarious industries and the aggregate amount of tax breaks those \nindustries receive. I believe, even if some of my colleagues do not, \nthat these amounts have impaired our integrity. I believe that as \nstrongly as I believe anything. Unlimited amounts of money given to \npolitical campaigns have impaired our integrity as political parties \nand as a legislative institution.\n  As the Senator from Wisconsin has noted, we are not accusing Members \nof\n\n[[Page S12601]]\n\nviolating Federal bribery statutes. No, we are here because there no \nlonger is a law controlling the vast amounts of money that I believe \nare impairing our integrity. In the immortal words of the Vice \nPresident: ``There is no controlling legal authority.''\n  I watched very closely as the 1996 telecommunications deregulation \nbill became everything but deregulatory and led to far less competition \nthan it was intended to engender and the consequent increase in cable \nrates, telephone rates, et cetera. I believe soft money played some \nrole in that; again, not in a way that fits within a legal definition \nof ``bribery,'' but in a way the vast majority of Americans believe is \nan impairment of our integrity, and I include myself in that \nindictment.\n\n  That is the problem I am trying to address in this legislation and no \nattack, no amount of head-in-the-sand pretense that soft money does not \naffect legislation will cause me to desist in my efforts.\n  I will close with one observation. If special interests did not \nbelieve their millions of dollars in donations buy them special \nconsideration in the legislative process, then those special interests \nthat have a fiduciary responsibility to their stockholders would not \ngive us that money, would they?\n  Those interests enjoy greater influence here than the working men and \nwomen who cannot buy our attention but are sometimes affected adversely \nby the laws we pass.\n  To me that seems to be a good working definition of the impairment of \nour integrity which, as I noted, is Webster's definition of \n``corruption.''\n  My question to the Senator from Tennessee is, indeed, is there \nanything that would be a violation of law that we do in any way in our \npursuit of money today?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Is there any way you can violate the law under our \ncurrent system today? Yes, I can think of ways. A clear quid pro quo \nwould be a violation of the law. But you have to prove a quid pro quo, \nwhich is a very high standard. That is under the bribery statutes.\n  But under the campaign part of it, as long as you disclosed it, \nraising unlimited amounts, I see no effective limitation.\n  There is even a controversy as to whether or not foreign soft money \ncontributions are now legal. A lower court held they were legal. I had \na discussion with Attorney General Reno in one of our hearings, when \nshe was trying to excuse what was going on over in the White House and \nthe fact that the President was sitting over there coordinating \nmillions of dollars of soft money for his personal ads to benefit his \ncampaign, and she said: Well, soft money is not regulated.\n  I said: Soft money is not regulated. What about soft money that came \nfrom China or Indonesia or somewhere?\n  She said: Well, that would be illegal.\n  I said: Logically, it wouldn't be. If soft money is soft money, it \ndoesn't say anything about a source.\n  Sure enough, a Federal judge agreed with my analysis. Now the court \nof appeals has overturned that lower court. So goodness knows where we \nare. But the whole question of foreign soft money is at issue now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I listened carefully to the statement of my friend \nfrom Arizona. I am still trying to understand it. I know the Senator \nfrom Tennessee has the floor, so I don't know if I should pose this \nquestion to him or the Senator from Arizona.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will take it and pose it to him.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. OK. Is the Senator from Arizona saying, then, it is \npossible to have corruption and that no one is corrupt? You can have \ncorruption and yet there isn't anybody actually responsible for it?\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I answer?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Kentucky, either the Senator from \nKentucky did not listen to what I said or doesn't care about what I \nsaid.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would you say it again?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I repeat again, the definition of ``corruption'' from \nWebster's dictionary: The impairment of integrity, virtue, or moral \nprinciple.\n  I repeat again, we have impaired our integrity when we convey to the \nAmerican people the impression that soft money distorts the legislative \nprocess, such as it did, in my view, in the 1996 Telecommunications \nDeregulation Act, with the protection of special interests, which \ncaused increases in cable rates, phone rates, and led to mergers rather \nthan competition in the industry.\n  So this system has impaired our integrity. That does not mean bribery \nlaws were broken necessarily. They may have been. I don't know. But I \ndo know that our integrity has been impaired. And whether that is the \nview of the Senator from Kentucky or the view of the Senator from Utah \nor my view, it is the view of the American people. That is \nsubstantiated by polling data and personal experience.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So let me get this right. All of our integrity is now \nimpaired--all of us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will repeat again. I believe that a system of unlimited \nsoft money in the American political process has impaired our integrity \nbecause we are now held in such low esteem by Americans because they \nbelieve we no longer respond to their hopes and dreams and aspirations.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Let me reclaim the floor, if I can. I won't be very \nmuch longer.\n  But listening to the discussion, it looks as if we need to take a \nstep back and look at it as others have from the outside.\n  What makes me angry is reading things such as the article in the \nNational Journal. To me--this is my view; you know what I think about \nthe system--I think things such as this article in the National Journal \nand others portray a situation that is worse than it is. But it is \nportrayed that way because so many people believe that.\n  Our problem is this--this is no aspersion on anyone, but I am not \ngoing to shrink from it because you ask me to name names--our problem \nis this: When big bills come up and major industries are affected--\nwhether it be telecommunications, whether it be banking, whether it be \nhealth care, or anything else--and the tremendous hard money \ncontributions start coming into our respective parties, Democrat and \nRepublican, I think people take a look at that and think there is a \nconnection.\n  Do they think that we are necessarily being bribed? I would hope not. \nBecause I know that not to be the case. But it is, at a minimum, an \nappearance problem that has been with us historically. We have always \nrecognized there is this tradeoff we are having to deal with. What we \nare trying to do is strike a proper balance.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will. But I would also like--now or later--to pose \nthis: I was looking through this list, and in the first 6 months of \nthis year, 37 companies, corporations, gave $50,000 or more to both \nparties--both parties. I would ask the Senator why he thinks they did \nthat.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am grateful they did because it gave us an \nopportunity to compete with the newspapers and the special interest \ngroups that have a constitutional right to participate in the political \nprocess. I am extraordinarily grateful that all of these disclosed \ncontributions--and this is why my friend from Tennessee knows who \ncontributed--extraordinarily grateful that these companies are giving \nus the opportunity to engage in vote buying, engage in getting out the \nvote, engage in issue advocacy, and the other things that benefit our \nparties.\n  I am extremely grateful they do that. And anybody who wants to make \nan issue out of it, it is fully disclosed, which is why my friend from \nTennessee has the list.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Most of these things we are talking about are \ndisclosed, and that does allow us to have the debate.\n  But to follow up on that for a moment, conceding, for a moment, we \nare using the money for noble purposes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I assure you we are. Winning elections is a noble \npurpose for a political party.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. We are talking about motivations. The Senator brought \nthis up. It caused me to think about this. Again, I ask you, why do you \nthink these corporations and unions contributed that much money to both \nparties?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't know of any labor unions contributing to my\n\n[[Page S12602]]\n\nparty. But I assume the reason they are contributing is they believe in \nthe principles that you stand for, which they have a constitutional \nright to do.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Principles of both parties simultaneously?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think you have the right to be duplicitous in this \ncountry if you want to. I think it is not uncommon for people to \ncontribute to both sides.\n  May I ask the Senator a question?\n  The Senator from Arizona was talking--again, I am trying to \nunderstand what he said and you said, I say to Senator Thompson--that \nthe appearance is the problem and not the reality. I guess the argument \nthen is, based on appearance, we should enact legislation. Appearance \nwe can only ascertain by looking at polls, so let me----\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Partially the basis of Buckley v. Valeo, you would \nagree.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me give you poll data of how people feel about \nnewspapers and see if the Senator thinks we ought to legislate based on \nthe appearance there to restrict the activities of newspapers.\n  A poll taken in September of 1997 indicated that 86 percent of the \nAmerican people believe newspapers should be required to provide equal \ncoverage of congressional candidates; 80 percent want restrictions \nplaced on the way newspapers cover political campaigns; 68 percent \nbelieve newspaper editorials are more influential than a $1,000 \ncontribution; 70 percent believe reporter bias influences the coverage \nof politics; 61 percent believe the candidate preferred by a reporter \nwill beat the candidate with more money; and 42 percent believe \nnewspaper editorial boards should be required to have both Republicans \nand Democrats.\n\n  This is the public's perception of the newspapers, which operate \nunder the first amendment, just as American citizens and parties do.\n  If the argument is that we should pass legislation restricting first \namendment rights based upon perception, I am wondering if the Senators \nalso believe we ought to eliminate the newspaper exemption from the \nFederal Election Campaign Act and react to the public perception that \nnewspapers need a bit of this Government regulation of speech as well?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I just----\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I may, in the first place, the perception of \npotential corruption is one of the bases for Buckley v. Valeo. The \nSupreme Court took a look at that and they said that is a valid reason \nfor legislating in this area. And because of that, because of that \ndecision, what we are talking about today is not a restriction on \nanybody's first amendment rights.\n  I think in times past Senators had a decent point with some \nprovisions. What we are talking about today does not impinge on the \nfirst amendment because it in some way restricts somebody to spend some \nmoney somewhere. Because they are limited in donations does not impinge \non the first amendment. Buckley v. Valeo holds that also.\n  In answer to my friend, I am aware of erroneous public perceptions as \nwell. They don't trust used car dealers much. My father was one for 50 \nyears in the same little town. I know about all that. But I answer that \nwhen newspapers start voting, when they are sent up here and trust and \nconfidence is placed in them to come up here and vote for the American \npeople on these issues, then they subject themselves to the same \nlimitations the Supreme Court says can be placed on us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware that, at least in the words of the \nSenator from Utah, it isn't just the appearance of corruption. The \nSenator from Utah pointed out three cases--I can recall two: Mr. Tamraz \nand the Indians. Mr. Tamraz said: Next time I am going to pay \n$600,000--where, at least if I understood the comments of the Senator \nfrom Utah, there were actual acts of corruption.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Isn't that against the law now?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As far as I know, it is not against the law.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. There are lots of things we used to think were against \nthe law.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It should be against the law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It should be against the law. The point is, apparently it \nis not because Mr. Tamraz was not prosecuted, at least under this \nJustice Department.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That might say something about the prosecutor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is not just the fact that there is the appearance of \ncorruption. I think most Americans believe that there was actual \ncorruption in that case and the Indian case. What we are fighting \nagainst here in the soft money is not only against allegations but also \nreality. Those examples the Senator from Utah pointed out are how \nterrible the situation can become. When a poor, impoverished Indian \ntribe is asked to give money in order to have their voice heard in \nWashington, I hope that would compel the Senator from Kentucky to \nrethink his position concerning soft money.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That should be illegal, should it not? That is against \nthe law now, isn't it?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The real question is, if you prove a quid pro quo, \nwhich reminds me of some of the old corruption laws we have had on the \nbooks for many years, under which there has never been a prosecution, \nyou have to prove the high standard of a quid pro quo, which is very \ndifficult. I think we can all agree that it is improper, whether or not \nit is illegal.\n  I think it raises a further question, the basic question, which is \nkind of the converse of the well-stated point I think the Senator from \nKentucky made. The converse of that is, do appearances matter at all? \nSuppose we know we are trying to do the right thing, but we are seeing \nthis tremendous influx of money at times from industries with which we \nare dealing on legislation. Should we be concerned about that? Perhaps \nwe should go out and explain to the American people how that is \nunrelated, how the patriotic spirit of these companies and unions just \nhappened to peak at certain times coincidentally. I am not saying that \nappearances should rule, but I do ask the question whether or not they \nshould matter.\n  I yield for the purpose of an answer to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that I may make a comment \nwithout the Senator losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't \nthink I will, but I have been here since early this morning. It depends \nupon how long my colleague from Utah wants to respond.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I shall respond within 2 minutes or less.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. My only response to my chairman, when I served as a \nmember of his committee, we talked about Roger Tamraz, the Riadys, and \nthe Indian tribes not being illegal. It has the appearance of \nimpropriety. I think it is only not illegal in the opinion of the \ncurrent Attorney General. I think there are others for whom it clearly \nwould be considered illegal and that indictments might be brought. The \ncurrent Attorney General has decided in her wisdom that it is not \nillegal.\n  I want to be clearly on record as disagreeing with her on that and \nbelieving that indictments should have been brought and that this is, \nin fact, a violation of existing law. Being unburdened with a legal \neducation, I think perhaps I can make that kind of comment without \nhaving to back it up. Nonetheless, it is my opinion with respect to her \nopinion on these particular cases.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I couldn't agree more with my colleague from Utah on \nthat point. It points out another difficulty for those who would try to \nsit down and apply some kind of commonsense analysis to this and think \nabout what it ought to be, maybe 10 years after we have left this body, \nsomething we can be proud of. We sat there, the Senator from Utah and \nI, for almost a year and saw the most egregious violations of \npropriety, ethics, what ought to be illegal--some clearly was illegal. \nAnd many of our colleagues who are now calling the loudest for reform \nwere definitely silent on those occasions. It really grieves me. I \nthink it is extremely unfortunate that so many of us have lost our \nability to take the high ground on this issue because of that.\n\n  Now we see a succession of semiprosecutions where nobody gets any \njail time. Everybody gets a slap on\n\n[[Page S12603]]\n\nthe wrist. Nobody is forced to testify against anybody else. The \nAttorney General gives her stamp of approval on something that nobody \nin their wildest imaginations thought would have been legal a few years \nago. That is kind of a sidebar.\n  What I am trying to do is not let my anger over that and having \nwatched that and gotten damn little cooperation during it cause me not \nto be able to try to figure out what would be best for us as a system \nas we go forward.\n  Briefly--I have taken too long--on the constitutional issue, I do not \nbelieve the constitutional concerns that have been expressed heretofore \nare with us now. We do limit hard money. Under prior law, 1974, we \nlimited hard money to both individuals and to parties in this country. \nWe actually prohibit unions and corporations from contributing in this \ncountry. That has been upheld as constitutional. It would not make any \nsense to me to say that we can limit a $1,000 contribution in hard \nmoney but we cannot limit or do anything with a million-dollar \ncontribution in soft money when it is going for the same purpose. I \nthink the constitutional points that were made previously no longer \napply.\n  In summary, allusion has been made to perception. My concern on that \nis not what a public opinion poll one day or the next might say but a \nconsistent trend of objective analysis--the Pew Research people are \nsome that come to mind--that shows that in this time of prosperity, \nthis time of peace, we have increasingly cynical views toward our \nelected officials in this country and toward our institutions. This is \nespecially true with regard to the young people.\n  This is a generation of young people who did not experience \nWatergate, who did not experience Vietnam, who did not experience the \nassassinations we all went through as a nation. What reason do they \nhave to be cynical? They are more prosperous than young people have \never been before. Yet the numbers indicate they are more cynical about \nus and what we are doing than ever before. That is what concerns me, \nnot these petty personality disputes we have around here.\n  In 1968, 8 percent of the American people contributed to elections of \nany kind--Federal, State, national, local. By 1992, it had dropped to 4 \npercent. I don't know what it is today. But talking about \ncontributions, that is 4 percent of the American people. So as the soft \nmoney doubles, the amount of people contributing is halved; voter \nturnout declines.\n  Thomas Paine, the famed agitator for the American Revolution and \nauthor of Common Sense, said this: A long habit of not thinking a thing \nwrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right and raises at \nfirst a formidable cry in defense of custom.\n  Let's not lock ourselves into the defense of this custom. Let us look \nbeyond ourselves for a moment and ask ourselves: Is what we are doing \ngoing to make for a stronger country? Will it engender respect for our \ninstitutions and for this body? Will it give the average citizen more \nor less confidence in the integrity of his or her government? I think \nwe know the answers to those questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Before the Senator from Tennessee leaves, I want to \nsay I don't think he was on the floor too long, and I think his \ncomments were very important. I appreciate what he had to say.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, as we go back and forth, that \non the Democratic side Senator Boxer be allowed to speak when it comes \nback to our side, followed by Senator Cleland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have some prepared remarks. I don't \nknow how much I will pay attention to it because I have been listening \nto the debate about corruption. Let me try a different definition, \nwhich my colleague from Kentucky, who is very skillful, may want to \nchallenge. But this is at least the way I look at this question.\n  The kind of corruption I think we are talking about is actually much \nmore serious than the wrongdoing of an individual office holder. That \nis not what I will focus on. I gather that is what some of my \ncolleagues have focused on and questioned. I say it is much more \nserious. I say it is a systemic corruption, and it is a systemic \ncorruption when there is a huge imbalance between too few people with \nso much wealth, so much power, so much access, and so much say, and the \nvast majority of people in the country who don't make the big \ncontributions, aren't the heavy hitters, aren't the investors, and who \nbelieve that if you don't pay, you don't play: I think that is the \ncorruption.\n  I think the corruption is that the standard of a representative \ndemocracy that says each person should count as one, and no more than \none, is violated. If any Senator--Democrat or Republican--should go \ninto any cafe in Minnesota, or around the country, and try to make the \nargument that, as a matter of fact, because of this system we have--\nwhich I think is really a failure when it comes to any standard of \nrepresentative democracy--if we were to try to argue, no, it is not \ntrue that people who are the investors and make these big contributions \ndon't have too much access and too much say, I think 99 percent of the \npeople in the country would say you are not credible. Of course, that \nis what is going on. Of course, people make contributions for a variety \nof different reasons, one of which is to have access and a say.\n  I say to my colleague from Utah, I think it is a bipartisan problem. \nWe don't need to talk about individual cases. And I understand the \ncomments he has tried to make. I see it on both sides of the aisle. \nLook, both parties will talk about special gatherings we will have with \nthe business community here, or the high-tech community there, or the \nlabor community there. We will have gatherings where big contributors \ncome. That is what is done. We have big dinners, and we are told to \ncome to the dinners. What is the purpose of those dinners? These \ndinners are with the big contributors. We are told to come, to be \nthere. It seems as though, if you don't come, you have no interest.\n  Both parties give these lectures at caucuses to all of us. And we go. \nThe reason we go is, we believe, given the system we have, people have \nto raise money, and if you don't come and you are not up for \nreelection, you believe, when you are up--you hope, given this rotten \nsystem we have--there is enough money raised for you, so now you go to \nhelp other people.\n\n  But the truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people in \nthe country don't come to these dinners. The vast majority of people \naren't invited to special gatherings and special sessions. The people \nwho are invited by both parties are the big contributors. They are the \ninvestors.\n  Come on. You are not going to try to argue on the floor of the Senate \nthat we don't have a problem with systemic corruption, where we have \njust too few people who make these big contributions, who, as a result, \nperhaps have too much access and too much say.\n  Let me go out on a limb. It is not just a question of perception. The \nvast majority of people in our country today believe their concerns \nabout themselves and their families and their communities are of little \nconcern in the corridors of power or the Halls of the Congress in \nWashington, DC. Do you know what. We have given them entirely too much \njustification for having that point of view. They are not necessarily \nwrong.\n  I am not going to have somebody, all of a sudden, ask me to yield for \na question and take my head off because it looks as if I am making an \nindividual accusation. I am not going to do that. But I will tell you \nsomething right now. I am fully prepared, as a Senator from Minnesota \nand a political scientist, to tell you I see certain people, who also \nhappen to be the big contributors, who have way too much access here. I \ndon't know whom we think we are kidding.\n  When we debated the telecommunications bill, the anteroom outside the \nChamber was packed with people. I could not find truth, beauty, and \njustice anywhere. Everybody was representing billions of dollars here \nand billions of dollars there. And when we had a debate about the \nwelfare bill--whatever you think about the welfare bill--where were the \npoor mothers and children? Where was their powerful lobby? They were \nnowhere to be found.\n\n[[Page S12604]]\n\n  When we decide where we are going to make deficit reduction and make \nthe cuts, and when we do tax policy, and when we do a lot of other \npolicy, it just so happens that certain folks and certain interests \nseem to be much better represented than others. I think that is true. I \nthink we can make it better. I think we can do a lot better job of \nreaching the standard that each person should count as one and no more \nthan one.\n  Certainly, we have corruption, but it is not the wrongdoing of any \nindividual office holder that I know of; it is systemic. When you have \nthis frightening imbalance of power between the elites, the few who \nmake the big contributions and are so well connected, and the majority \nof the people who basically feel locked out--and they have every reason \nto feel locked out--that is the problem.\n  I smile at the proposal, which may be one of the amendments to this \nbill, to raise the contribution limits. I think it is about two-tenths \nof 1 percent of the top population, or less, who can afford to make a \ncontribution of $1,000 or more. I am not supposed to look up in the \ngalleries, and I certainly do not invite comment from people in the \ngalleries--that would go against the rules--but I bet most of the \npeople in the galleries observing our debate would probably think to \nthemselves: We don't make $1,000 contributions.\n  The fact is, two-tenths of 1 percent are able to make those kinds of \ncontributions. Some people want to now raise it to $3,000. If you want \nto further skew the imbalance of power, where some people are counted \non even more to make the big contributions and most regular people feel \nleft out, then pass that kind of amendment. We will look like fools to \npeople in the country. They will say: My God, the Senate took up reform \nand today passed an amendment that raised the individual contribution \nfrom $1,000 to $3,000--actually from $2,000 to $6,000 through the \nprimary and general election. Most people will scratch their heads and \nask: This is the Senate's definition of reform? I don't know, but I \nthink people are being foolish if they don't think that campaign \nfinance reform is an idea--with apologies to Victor Hugo--whose time \nhas long passed.\n\n  We have seven Republicans supporting this piece of legislation, the \nMcCain-Feingold legislation. It will take only eight Republicans more \nto assure that we can pass a bill and to stop this effort to block all \nreform. I hope there will at least be eight Republicans, if not more, \nwho will find the courage to basically vote for reform, who will find \nthe courage to no longer be a part of this effort to block reform, to \nexpand democracy.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, \nin the spirit of friendship and honesty, this bill, in its present \nform, is a mere shadow of its former self. I don't think it lights up \npeople around the country. I don't think it is going to bring people to \nthe reform barricade. I don't think it is going to galvanize people or \ncause people to rise up and really put the pressure on Senators. I wish \nit were more comprehensive. That is what I am saying. I wish it were \nmuch more comprehensive.\n  I think we would be much better off talking about clean money and \nclean elections and getting as much of this interested big money out of \npolitics and bringing as many people back into politics as possible. I \nthink issue advocacy ads are phony.\n  While I have the floor of the Senate to talk about my experience, \nespecially in 1996, I worry about the ways in which money will shift \nfrom one source to the other. I think we can do better, although I will \ntell you that if we could ban the soft money, the unregulated money, \nthe under-the-table money, the money where there is essentially no \naccountability in this system, we would still be taking an important \nstep forward.\n  I want to express my fear, and then I want to express my hope.\n  Fear: What could happen is that none of the amendments to strengthen \nthis bill will pass. But there will be a number of amendments to what \nis a very water-downed version, a very almost timid piece of \nlegislation, but it represents a step forward. I would be proud to \nsupport it. But you will get some additional amendments raising the \namount of money people can contribute. Gosh knows what else. Then we in \nthe Senate will announce that we did campaign reform for the new \nmillennium, and let's go forward with our special interest parties.\n  I am going to worry that we may end up getting a bill that will have \nsome fine sounding acronyms, such as ``PEOPLE,'' or something like \nthat, which actually won't represent hardly any step forward at all.\n  On the other hand, we have this bill right now, and if we can just \ndeal with the soft money ban, we would be making a real step forward.\n  I want to speak a little bit to this whole question of freedom \nbecause it has come up a lot and is raised by a number of colleagues. I \nwant to simply draw from an important book by Eric Foner called, ``The \nStory of American Freedom.'' He talks about what freedom has meant to \npeople in our country over the years. Freedom is way beyond the kind of \ndefinition that we have been given of it. Freedom means the ability to \nparticipate. Freedom means to have a place at the table. The definition \nof freedom of speech is larger than the absence of a regulation that \nwould say we are going to try to put up some kind of framework that \ndoesn't undercut representative democracy.\n  If you think about it, union organizers in the 1930s and working \npeople were talking about freedom to be more involved in the economic \ndecisions that affected their lives. That was the kind of freedom on \nwhich they were focused.\n  Then we had a fight for political freedom which began with our own \nAmerican Revolution. Also, an important part of our history was the \nemancipation of slaves during the Civil War, then the passage of the \n13th, 14th, and 15th amendments--again, a broad definition of freedom; \nin the 1950s and 1960s, freedom which had to do with desegregating our \nschools and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1965. Each time the kind \nof freedom we were talking about was the freedom to participate in the \npolitical life of our country, or the economic life of our country, or \nthe community life of our country.\n  Let me share with you the words of Dr. Gwendolyn Patton at a recent \nconference at Howard University sponsored by the National Voting Rights \nInstitute. She said:\n\n       We thought we had scored a people's victory when we ushered \n     in the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Our movement of great numbers \n     of ``street heat'' feet wrought a structural change that \n     fundamentally expanded democracy. But we know now that it \n     wasn't enough. Ridding the system of private, special \n     interest money is the unfinished business of the voting \n     rights movement. This movement, like that one, is a \n     revolutionary movement--it is not just a tactical question. \n     It is an ideological struggle, not only for black folks, but \n     for all Americans. We are engaged, to borrow Lincoln's words, \n     in ``a great civil war.''\n\n  She goes on to say, that while much was achieved through voter \nregistration of African Americans, Latinos, and others.\n\n       As a result of these victories we entered the political \n     arena by the millions--but as passive voters. Soon we began \n     to realize that we had to become active participants by \n     running for office if we were going to enact laws and \n     implements policies that would make a change for the better \n     in our lifetime. That's when we discovered another barrier, \n     and while it's not as directly life threatening, it's \n     certainly as formidable as any we have faced before. That's \n     the barrier of money.\n\n  Dr. Gwendolyn Patton is talking about basically what we have right \nnow, which is a wealth primary. What we are really saying is the very \nquestion of who gets to run, the very question of who is likely to get \nelected, the very question of what issues quite often get considered, \nthe very question of what legislation we are able to pass, the very \nquestion of who has access to the political process and who doesn't, is \nall too often determined by money. The vote is undermined by the \ndollar. Our elections have become auctions.\n  Some of my colleagues want to talk about raising the contribution \nlimits. Let me just give you some figures.\n  This is a picture of those who contribute the vast majority of money \nto candidates under the current contribution limits. Believe me, this \nis a picture that is not a broad slice of America. It is overwhelmingly \nwhite, it is overwhelmingly male, and it is overwhelmingly wealthy. \nThese are people who have contributed over $200, and some colleagues \nwant to go from $1,000 to $3,000.\n\n[[Page S12605]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Minnesota, in his opening statement, \nused the word ``systemic corruption'' associated with the present \ncampaign finance system. Since I have been challenged on comments such \nas that, would the Senator mind defining what he is saying there?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Arizona, I thank him for \nhis question. I would be pleased to be challenged by anybody on the \nfloor on this comment. I made a comment that I think is quite similar \nto what the Senator from Arizona has been trying to say, that we have a \nsystemic corruption that is, unfortunately, far more serious than the \nwrongdoing of individual office holders--far more serious. It is a \ncorruption when you have a huge imbalance of power between too few \npeople who have so much wealth and money, who make these large \ncontributions, and who have so much more access and influence, versus \nthe majority of people who have concluded that either you pay, and \ntherefore you can play; but if you do not pay, you don't play. They \nfeel locked out. They feel left out. They are disillusioned. They do \nnot believe the political process belongs to them.\n  That is a fundamental corruption of representative democracy. And I \nsay to my colleague it violates the most important principle--that in a \nrepresentative democracy each person should count as one and no more \nthan one. That is being undermined.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator respond to an additional question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for his eloquent answer.\n  Secondly, would the Senator be willing to name names as to examples \nof that corruption?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would not want to name names, and I \ndon't need to name names because the kind of corruption that I am \ntalking about goes way beyond any one officeholder. It is systemic; it \nis endemic; it is structural; and it is very serious. The fact is big \nmoney has hijacked representative democracy. It undercuts \nrepresentative democracy, and it violates the very principle that each \nperson should count as one and no more than one.\n  Therefore, I would be proud to be included in the ranks of my \ncolleague from Arizona as a Senator who is not naming names.\n  Let me go forward and just present some figures.\n  A study conducted of donors in the 1996 election found the following \ncharacteristics of such donors.\n  Ninety-five percent--these are people who contributed over $200--were \nwhite; 80 percent were male; 50 percent were over 60 years of age; 81 \npercent had annual incomes of over $100,000.\n  The population at large in the United States had the following \ncharacteristics:\n  Seventeen percent were nonwhite; 51 percent were women; 12.8 percent \nwere over 60; and 4.8 percent had incomes over $100,000.\n  Eighty percent of the people who make contributions of over $200 have \nincomes over $100,000. And that represents exactly 4.8 percent of the \npopulation. If the hard money contributions are increased, as some of \nmy colleagues have suggested, then the picture is going to become even \nmore skewed.\n\n  If money equals speech, as some have suggested, we can clearly see \nwho is doing all the talking. If money equals speech, then we can \nclearly see who is doing all the talking. At least those folks are \nbeing listened to. The hopes and the dreams and the concerns of the \nvast majority of the American people are going unheard because the \nbullhorn of the $1,000 contribution drowns them out.\n  For those who want to raise the limits, why make the bullhorn bigger \nand louder? Why give greater access and more control to those people \nwho already have too much access and too much control?\n  Again I issue this challenge in anticipation of what might happen. If \nwhat we do on the floor of the Senate in a couple of days is raise the \ncontribution level from $1,000 to $3,000--even given the sometimes too \nlow opinion they have of the Senate--people in the country will become \neven more disillusioned; they won't believe it. I certainly hope we \ndon't do that.\n  I want to talk about the distrust and the dissatisfaction. Mr. \nPresident, 92 percent of all Americans believe special interest \ncontributions buy votes of Members of Congress--92 percent; 88 percent \nbelieve those who make large contributions get special favors from \npoliticians; 67 percent think their own representatives in Congress \nwould listen to the views of outsiders who made large political \ncontributions before they would listen to their own constituents' \nviews; nearly half of the registered voters in our country believe \nlobbyists and special interests control the Congress.\n  I will go out on a limb and not antagonize, but perhaps prompt, some \nresponse from colleagues. All politicians love children, but we do \nprecious little for them. One of the reasons we have done so little for \nor about poor children in America--who, by the way, constitute the \nlargest group of poor citizens in our country--might be that they and \ntheir parent or parents don't contribute much by way of big \ncontributions and don't have much access.\n  One of the reasons we have done very little to close the gulf between \nthe rich and the poor, one of the reasons we have done so little to \ncombat homelessness, and one of the reasons we have done so little to \nrespond to the concerns of hard-pressed Americans even in these flush \neconomic times is that these are the people who don't pay and don't \nplay.\n  Perhaps the same argument can be made why we have been so generous in \nproviding special breaks for oil companies; we have been so generous in \nmaking sure the tobacco industry continues to rule; we have been so \ngenerous in making sure we dare not take on the pharmaceutical \ncompanies, we dare not take on the insurance industry.\n  With all due respect, I don't know who is kidding whom, but I call \nthis a very serious kind of corruption. I will keep using the word. It \nis not the wrongdoing of individual office holders, but we have \ndeveloped a severe, serious imbalance of power in a representative \ndemocracy so that the very few in the country dominate the political \nprocess and all too often have their way and get exactly what they want \nand what they need, and the vast majority of people think their voice \nis not heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator familiar with the tax bill of $792 billion \nthat passed through the Senate, and then there was going to be a tidal \nwave of public opinion that would force the President of the United \nStates to sign it?\n  Does the Senator remember there were a number of special tax breaks \nin that bill--one for a corporation that turns chicken litter into \nenergy and another for oil and gas, and even for people who make tackle \nboxes?\n  Does the Senator remember that those tax breaks would take effect \nimmediately upon the signature of the President of the United States \nand that there were provisions to repeal the marriage penalty and \nothers that would help average working Americans who don't make big \npolitical contributions, yet those tax breaks would not kick in until \nwell into the next century?\n  Is the Senator familiar with those provisions of the tax bill, and, \nif so, what conclusions does he draw?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will not draw one-on-one conclusions \nabout each and every one of those provisions, and I will not make the \nassumptions that Senators vote one way or the other each and every time \nbecause of campaign contributions that a particular Senator may \nreceive, but the overall bias is so much in favor of those large \ninterests that are able to control and invest so much of the money in \nthe political process. That is the problem.\n  One can allow on any one vote for Senators to honestly disagree, and \nwe can't each time say it is because of money, but overall, I don't \nknow anybody in the world who could argue that we don't have a serious \nproblem.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Did the Senator dare to use the word ``corruption''?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have deliberately used the word ``corruption''\n\n[[Page S12606]]\n\nabout 10 times because I think that is exactly what we are talking \nabout: systemic corruption, not the wrongdoing of individual \nofficeholders but the kind of corruption that exists when there is such \na huge imbalance and few people have too much wealth and power and the \nmajority of the people are left out of the picture.\n  Let me conclude in two different ways. One, I make a political \nscience point; and, two, I want to make a personal point. I think what \nwe are talking about, in the words of my hero journalist, Bill Moyers, \nis the soul of democracy. My premise is that political democracy--and I \nam pleased to be challenged on this if my colleagues choose--has \nseveral basic requirements.\n  First, we need to have free and fair elections. It is very hard to \nsay we have them now. That is why people stay at home on election day. \nThat is why they don't participate in the process. Incumbents outspend \nchallengers 8 or 10 to 1 on average. Millionaires spend their personal \nfortunes to buy access to the airwaves, and special interests buy \naccess to the Congress, all of which warps and distorts our democratic \nprocess.\n  That is what is going on. A millionaire can run and spend their own \nmoney--and many do, and there are millionaire Senators who are great \nSenators. Again, it is not a personal point I am making. However, most \npeople ought to be able to run for office even if they are not a \nmillionaire. If you are an incumbent--and I certainly hope this debate \nis not, in the last analysis, a debate between ins and outs--if you are \nan incumbent and you are an ``in,'' this system is wired for \nincumbents. We can go out and raise a lot of money. It is much harder \nfor challengers to raise that money. This is a system that warps and \ndistorts the democratic process, and we do not have free and fair \nelections.\n\n  The second criterion: A representative democracy requires the consent \nof the people. The people of this country, not special interests-big \nmoney, should be the source of political power. Government must remain \nthe domain of the general citizenry, not a narrow elite.\n  We have two-tenths of 1 percent of the population that makes \ncontributions of $1,000 or more. I don't know what percentage that is \nof the overall money we raise--60 percent? I could be wrong, but it is \nreally skewed.\n  Let me put it this way. When I was teaching a class about the \nCongress, I remember I would talk about the Senate. I did not know \npeople, and I have had a million pleasant surprises. In another speech, \nanother debate, I will talk about all the pleasant surprises. But I \nmade the argument: If you look at who the people are in the Senate, by \nbackground characteristics, by their income, by who they are, they \ncertainly are not truly representative of the American population. But \nthe more serious problem is, if you then look at the people back home, \nthe constituents who are the relevant constituents, who can most affect \nour tenure or our lack of tenure, they are the people with the money. \nThey are the people who can make the contributions so we can then put \nthe ads on television in these hugely expensive, capital-intensive \ncampaigns. The vast majority of people in the country know that and \nthey feel left out. We should hate it.\n  I hope it is OK to say this about my conversation with my colleague \nfrom California. Jump up if I am wrong. We were talking about this. I \nthink all of us should hate this system. We should all hate it. On the \none hand, I say to myself: I get this. I know why a lot of colleagues \ndo not want any reform, even this modest step of this legislation, \nwhich gets at a lot of the unregulated money, the soft money. I say to \nmyself: I can figure this out because it is wired for incumbents. This \nis not a debate about Democrats versus Republicans, although all the \nDemocrats are going to support this bill, and I hope we will have \nenough Republicans to pass it and stop the people who are blocking it. \nMaybe this is a debate between ins and outs and the ins don't want to \nchange it. They don't want to change it because it is wired for us.\n  But then I think to myself: This cannot be because it is degrading \ngetting on the phone calling strangers, people you do not even know. I \ndon't know what is worse, I say to my colleague from California. I \ndon't know what is worse.\n  I am having a little fun on the floor right now. I am on a roll, so I \nhave to talk a little longer.\n  I don't know what is worse, when I call someone up, a perfect \nstranger, and I call them five times and they never return the call, or \nI call them up and they say no--I don't know whether that is worse, or \nif it is worse when they make a contribution, but I don't know them and \nthey don't know me and I don't know why they made a contribution. I am \nnot sure which is worse.\n  The only thing I know is it is torture. It is torture to have to get \non this phone and beg and beg and beg for money. It is degrading.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased. Can I make one brilliant point \nbefore I take my colleague's question?\n  On this ins versus outs, I think all of us ins should be supporting \nthe McCain-Feingold legislation and more, for one other reason. The \nother reason is, when we are up and it is our cycle, we can't do a good \njob of representing people because every day we have to spend 2 and 3 \nhours on the phone. We miss debate that we should be involved in; we \nmiss committee work we should be involved in; we miss a lot of work \nthat we should be doing, representing the people of our States. We \nshould want to change this for that reason as well.\n  I will be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator think if he had a more pleasing \npersonality and shaved his beard he would get a more positive response?\n  Mrs. BOXER. They can't see the beard on the phone, though.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am speechless. That doesn't happen \nthat often.\n  Mr. President, I want to finish up. I said that three times. I will \nfinish up.\n  The last criterion is political equality. Everybody ought to have an \nequal opportunity to participate in the process. That means the values \nand preferences of citizens, not just those who get our attention \nthrough the large contributions, should be considered in the debate. \nOne person, one vote; no more, no less; one person, same influence. \nEach person counts as one, no more than one. That is the standard. That \nis what it is all about. That precious principle, that precious \nstandard of representative democracy, is being violated.\n  I have spoken about why I am going to oppose with all my might \nefforts to raise the limits on contributions. I want to speak about one \namendment that I will introduce, which I think is a good amendment, I \nsay to my colleague from Arizona. It is a States rights amendment. It \nholds harmless--no State certainly could go below the standards we have \nin Federal campaign finance law, but it would allow States which want \nto move toward clean money, clean elections, to do so. Arizona has done \nthat; Massachusetts has done that; Maine has done that; Vermont has \ndone that. There are going to be other votes in other States. It would \nsay to those States: If you want to get much of the interested money \nout and you want to have clean money and clean elections and the people \nin your State vote for it, you should be able to apply it in Federal \nelections.\n  If we are not at the point yet where we have the political will so \nthat we can pass more far-reaching reform, I say people in our States, \nif they are willing to apply this to Federal elections, should be \nallowed to do so. There is a lot of steam and there is a lot of \nmomentum and a lot of enthusiasm for the clean money/clean election \noption. I think it is a very important one.\n  Finally, I have to say this because I forgot to mention this earlier. \nThis is the part of the McCain-Feingold legislation that I think is \nperhaps most important. I remember the 1996 election. I think these \nissue advocacy ads are a nightmare. I think all of us should hate them. \nI very much would like to apply this to independent expenditures as \nwell. I want to be clear about it. But in Minnesota, it was a barrage \nof these phony issue advocacy ads, where they do not tell you to vote \nfor or against; they just bash you and then they say: Call Senator So-\nand-so.\n  They are soft money contributions with no limits on how much money is\n\n[[Page S12607]]\n\nraised, no limits on how the money is raised. It could be in $100,000 \ncontributions, $200,000 contributions, and make no mistake about it, \nthis is in both parties. These big soft money contributors have a \ntremendous amount of access and way too much influence in both parties.\n  So with one stroke, it would be a wonderful marriage. We could get \nsome of this poison politics off television. We could get some of these \nphony ads off television. We could build more accountability, and we \nwould make both political parties, I think, more accountable to the \npublic.\n  This debate is about whether or not something we all value and love, \nwhich is our representative democracy, is going to continue to be able \nto function. It is the most important debate we are going to have. That \nis the core question, the core issue, the core problem. I hope there \nwill be a vote for McCain-Feingold. I hope we can strengthen it. I hope \nthose who oppose reform and continue to block efforts will not be \nsuccessful. I think people in our country are counting on us to vote \nfor democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2294\n\n      (Purpose: To increase reporting and disclosure requirements)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2294.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I will say to my colleague from California \nI will be very brief on my statement on the amendment. I know she has \nbeen waiting a long time and has shown patience. I will be brief on \nthis amendment because I know she wants to speak on this important \nissue. I will take about 2 minutes to explain the amendment.\n  Mr. President, the amendment is simple. It simply calls for greater \ndisclosure of campaign funds. I begin this discussion by noting this is \nnot an original idea. It is language borrowed directly from legislation \noffered in the House of Representatives by our colleague, Congressman \nDoolittle.\n  Specifically, this amendment requires campaign contribution \ndisclosures made by political committees under State or local law to \nalso be submitted to the FEC. Additionally, all campaign contributions \nmade to political committees within 90 days of an election must be \nreported within 24 hours of receipt and the campaign contribution \nreports then be made available on the Internet by the FEC.\n  These provisions ensure the public knows who is contributing to \ncampaigns in the closing days of an election and how much is being \ncontributed. These added protections will allow the voting public to \ndecide for themselves whether a campaign or an election is being unduly \ninfluenced by special interests.\n  I do not think these disclosure provisions will pose any unnecessary \nhardship on political parties or committees. This amendment provides \nsimply for additional information about State and local elections to be \nmade available quickly through the Internet and by the FEC. It ensures \na common data bank of information about contributions so that \ninterested voters can get updated information in one place and, as an \nelection draws near, with close to realtime disclosures.\n  I firmly believe the public has a right to know, and tighter \ndisclosure requirements will provide important information to the \nvoters which will allow each voter to draw his or her conclusion about \nwhether the effect of the contribution is--dare I say it? --corruption. \nBut unlike the Doolittle bill, I believe these provisions add to the \nunderlying bill and should not be considered a substitute. The \namendment makes the bill better, and I hope my colleagues will support \nit.\n  In summary, the Internet has done enormously beneficial things. As \nfar as the political process is concerned, it has provided a tremendous \nway for us to receive on-time information. We can, hopefully, utilize \nthis incredible technological marvel to allow Americans who are \ninterested to know literally within 24 hours of a contribution whom it \nwas from and the amount of it.\n  I also believe we can do the same thing at a later time on \nexpenditures as well because the Internet has provided us a great \nopportunity. Knowledge and information is obviously power and will help \nour voters understand the issues to make a more informed judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, a Democrat should be \nrecognized. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I assure my friend from Utah, I will not be long. I \nwas looking at my statement, and even if I get enthusiastic and go off \nit, I think he is looking at 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I may, I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia. I was under the impression it would be by position rather \nthan by party, but I am more than happy to listen to her for 10 to 15 \nminutes because I am making notes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate that, and I am sure my friend will find \nadded comments after he listens to mine.\n\n[[Page S12608]]\n\n  Mr. President, I want to start off by thanking Senators McCain and \nFeingold for their leadership on this issue. It is nice to see this \ncooperation across the aisle. I like it. It is healthy for the system, \nit is good for the system, and we gain more respect as an institution \nwhen we work together as opposed to constantly being on opposite sides. \nPeople get suspicious; they say: Why is it they always are fighting \neach other? This is good, and the subject is so important and gets \nright to the heart and soul of who we are as a people.\n  I also point out that it is very difficult around here to challenge \nthe status quo. Some of us saw Senator McCain getting fairly well \ngrilled this morning. It is every Senator's right to grill another \nSenator. But it is very lonely sometimes to take on the status quo.\n  I have noticed in all my years in politics--and it has been a long \ntime--what a legislature likes to do most is nothing, because it is \neasy, because if you keep it the same, you do not make waves, you do \nnot disturb anybody, and it is comfortable. Certainly campaign finance \nreform is comfortable for many of us who have been in this for a long \ntime.\n\n  Ever since I have been in politics, I have been supporting reforms in \ncampaign finance. I have been in politics, in elected office, for 23 \nyears. That is most of my adult working life. I started in local \npolitics. It was an issue then. Then I went to the House in 1983. It \nwas an issue then, and it has been an issue in the Senate during the 7 \nyears I have served.\n  It is fair to ask: Why is Senator Boxer in favor of the most far-\nreaching campaign finance reform we can get? I can sum it up with three \nmain reasons. Maybe there are 10 or 12, but I want to give the Senate \nthe three main reasons.\n  First of all, the system is bad for ordinary people; and I will \nexpand on that. Secondly, the system has the appearance of corruption; \nand I will expand on that. And thirdly, the system is stealing precious \ntime from public officials who are elected to do a job; and I will \nexpand on that.\n  First, the system is bad for ordinary people. Let me tell you why. \nOrdinary people feel disenfranchised. Ordinary people who cannot afford \nto make contributions to campaigns feel left out. Even if they were \nwrong on that--and I would tell people in my State, regardless of \nwhether they make a campaign contribution or not, they are important to \nme. We all say that, and we mean that. They do have the vote. They are \nimportant to us. They do not believe it. They do not believe they \ncount. They believe the people who count are the people who give $100, \n$500, $1,000--soft money contributions.\n  How do we know they feel this way? They have shut us out. They do not \nbelieve us when we talk. They believe we are motivated by people who \ngive us the big dollars, and, sad to say, they are not voting. I look \nat the turnout of voters, and it is sad when we see in many elections \n25 percent of the electorate votes, 40 percent of the electorate votes, \nand there are people all over the world literally dying to stand in \nline to vote in countries that are struggling to get the franchise. \nOrdinary people feel left out. That is a danger.\n  Secondly, the system has the appearance of corruption. Let me talk \nabout the fight I waged on oil royalties. I do not know anyone who \nstood up in that debate who did not believe big oil companies were not \npaying their fair share of royalties.\n  Everyone agreed; even the key opponent of my perspective that we \nought to do something about it said it is true, they are not paying \ntheir royalties. I know it to be the case when the person who stands up \non this floor, whoever that might be--and in another case it could be \nme; in this case it was another Senator--and fights for the status quo \nfor one particular industry and the newspapers write a story that that \nindividual got more money from that industry than anyone else; even if \nthe motives were as pure as the driven snow--and I have no reason to \nbelieve otherwise--people lose faith. They do not want to believe us if \nwe stand up and fight for an industry and we are the biggest recipient \nof the industry's funds.\n  We are not talking about a thousand bucks; we are talking about big \nbucks. The appearance of corruption, if I may use the word, is out \nthere.\n  I don't care what Senator, on either side of the aisle, stands up and \nstamps his or her foot and says: That's a terrible word. Don't use it; \nthe appearance of corruption is out there. Maybe you don't think so, \nbut ordinary people think so. We know it. It is another reason they are \nturned off. It is another reason they do not vote.\n  And the third reason: The system is stealing precious time from \nelected officials. Look, let's be honest. A person who comes from \nCalifornia, who takes the oath of office, would have to raise $10,000 a \nday, 7 days a week, for 6 years, in order to have the resources to run \nfor reelection.\n  Let me repeat that--for 6 years, $10,000 a day, 7 days a week, in \norder to have the assets that are needed to run for reelection in \nCalifornia, where there are 33 million people and the highest TV rates \nin the country.\n  How do you think that happens? Do you think that individual in the \nSenate can possibly do all that and still do the best job that she can \ndo? It is impossible.\n  Let me make a confession on the floor of the Senate. Having run for \nthe Senate twice from that great State, I did every single thing I \ncould to raise as much money as I could within the law. I don't want \nanyone to think I am holier than thou because I am not. If I was, I \nwould have said: I'm not going to take the PAC money. I'm not going to \nask people for soft money. I'm going to demand they take the issues ads \noff when they help me.\n  I am not holier than thou. I am a user of the system, and the system \nis wrong. I think the Senators from California who know what it is like \nto do this in some ways have more credibility than Senators from small \nStates to talk about the evils of this system. The system is broken, \nand we have to clean up our act. It is very simple.\n  I am willing to do it in a baby step, which is what I consider this \nstripped-down bill to be, or I am willing to do a much larger step, \nwhich I think Shays-Meehan is in the House. I like it better. I will do \nwhat it takes to get something out of this Senate that speaks to \nreform.\n  Soft money, unlimited dollars, it does not matter what it is. It \ncould be any amount going to the parties. Did it help me? Oh, yes. It \nhelped me a lot. In some ways, I was in a better position than my \nopponent. He spent a fortune. I was able to raise more.\n  Why am I standing here? I know how to work the system. I have been at \nit a long time. It is in my benefit to keep it the way it is. Even a \nwell-heeled opponent that I had and I faced, with all the support of \nthe Republican Party, could not go toe to toe with me because I know \nhow to work the system. But the system is broken, and we have to clean \nup our act. We have a chance to do it.\n  I hope people in this Senate who know this system inside out will do \nwhat they can to change it. Doing away with soft money is a step in the \nright direction. Do we need other steps? You bet we do.\n  We need to expand disclosure requirements, and I am going to read \nSenator McCain's amendment with great interest. It seems to me we can \ndo that in this bill because many times the special interests will wait \nuntil the last minute to dump big money into their candidate's \ncampaign, hoping it will not be found out until after election day. \nWith the computers the way we have them today, we ought to be able to \nknow it pretty much on a real-time basis.\n\n  We need to ensure that these issue ads become a thing of the past. \nWhat a phony deal that is. That is as much an ad as the ad I put on for \nmyself. How is this for an issue ad? ``Senator X has just cast a vote \nagainst a particular bill. It is a disaster for our country. Call \nSenator X and tell her she is wrong.'' That is an issue ad? No. That is \na personal attack.\n  ``Senator Y has supported a bill that is going to hurt our country's \neconomy. Call Senator Y. Here are the three reasons he is wrong on \nthat,'' and you mention the Senator's name over and over. By the way, \nyou can even show the Senator's face.\n  That is not an issue ad. That is a direct attack ad. Was it done \nagainst my opponent? Yes, it was. Was it done against me? Yes, it was. \nIt is uncontrolled. It brings in other issues that\n\n[[Page S12609]]\n\nthe two candidates themselves do not even want to talk about. It \nunbalances the whole debate in the campaign. It has to be a thing of \nthe past.\n  ``Free speech,'' my colleagues say on the other side. I will tell \nyou, I never heard anyone more eloquent on the point than the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. The Supreme Court was divided 5 to 4 on the issue of \nfree speech. I tell you, they are wrong because when you say money \nequals speech, you are demeaning the Constitution; you are demeaning \nthis democracy.\n  How is it free speech if candidate A is a billionaire and can buy up \nevery inch of time on the TV and the radio and the other candidate, \ncandidate Y, is a poor candidate and has to go raise money? By the time \nhe gets the money, he goes to the TV stations and the radio stations, \nand they say: Oh, sorry, candidate Y. There is no time left for you to \nbuy. That is an infringement on his speech.\n  I had an interesting situation at the end of my last campaign. A lot \nof money came in toward the end of my campaign. I sent it over to the \nTV stations. I just got it back with a big refund. By the time we got \nit over there, there was no more time.\n  So how do you say that money equals speech if one candidate has it; \nthe other one has a harder time getting it, and they cannot get the \nprime time? This speech argument is a debasement of everything that I \nbelieve in. I believe that our Founders would roll over in their graves \nif they knew that when they fought and died for free speech, it now \nmeans money, and you cannot tell a wealthy candidate you can only put X \ninto your campaign, because it is a violation of free speech. But what \nabout the poor candidate? He does not have the money. What about his \nspeech?\n  So this argument on speech, to me, is nonsensical. I am one of these \npeople who believe the Supreme Court ought to take another look at that \nBuckley v. Valeo because I think it is off the wall.\n  So here I am standing in front of my colleagues admitting that I have \nused this system to the ultimate, that I have benefited from it because \nI understand it, that I am good at it. I have had, in the course of my \ncampaigns, thousands and thousands and thousands of contributors. There \nis not a day that goes by that I do not thank them for their support \nbecause I would not be here; I could not have gotten my message out. \nBut they understand, in their heart of hearts, and one of the reasons \nthey wanted me to be here, I will stand up and fight against this \nsystem.\n  So I am doing it again in the hopes that maybe this time, with this \nstripped-down bill, we can pick up enough votes from the other side of \nthe aisle to ensure that we will have some reform.\n  I beg my colleagues--we have had some bitter debates, very partisan \ndebates, and it has not been a pretty thing to watch--maybe we can make \nthis a pretty thing to watch. So far it has been kind of contentious.\n  In the end, if we can get the 60 bipartisan votes to shut off debate, \nmaybe we will get a bill, maybe we can be proud of something we did in \nthis Congress. They did it in the House.\n  I urge my colleagues, let us follow the lead of Senators McCain and \nFeingold. Let us reach across the aisle, do something right for the \npeople, restore their faith in this system. Maybe they will start \nvoting again and feel good about who we are and, frankly, about this \ncountry, if they think we are moving toward a truer democracy. We have \na chance to do it. I hope we will.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, a Republican is to \nbe recognized at this time. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from California. I know there has been a lot of \nfrustration about campaigns, campaign financing and having to run for \noffice and ask for money. I am not good at it and don't like to do it. \nIt is a humbling experience. Sometimes people won't give you money. If \nenough people won't give you money to run your campaign, it may be an \nindication you are not as good a candidate as you think you are. But if \nyou have a message and people care about it and want to give to it, \nthat is what happens in this country.\n  I guess what I want to say is, there are frustrations. Part of it, \nfor those who wish this system weren't the way it is, is the first \namendment to the Constitution. It provides for free speech. In the \nprimary, when I ran in Alabama in 1996, for the Senate--I have only \nbeen here since then--there were two individual candidates who ran \nagainst me in that primary who personally put in over $1 million of \ntheir own money into that race. I spent $1 million in my race and \nraised it by every way I could. I had two kids in college and was \nliving on a government salary. I didn't have a million dollars, but I \nwon the race. And there are instances of people spending tens of \nmillions and losing.\n  The Supreme Court has said you cannot deny, under the free speech \nclause of the Constitution, an individual citizen the right to go on \ntelevision and say, I have a dream for America or Alabama and I want to \ncarry it out and listen to me. You can't prohibit that. That is free \nspeech. I wish it wasn't so. They have things such as, well, you can do \nit except for the last 60 days before the election. They said that one \ntime. I suspect we will have an amendment a little later on on this \nbill that goes back to that, saying you can have free speech, but not \nfor 60 days before the election. That dog won't hunt, as they say. When \ndo you want to speak most intently, if it isn't during the election \ncycle?\n  We have a serious problem, when we try to contain by Federal law the \nright of individual Americans to come together to put money in a pot \nand to campaign for or against a no-good or a great candidate for the \nSenate or the Congress or anything else. That is what we are talking \nabout. We are saying people can't get together and actively challenge \nand fight, with every ounce they have, for the beliefs that they share.\n  Two years ago, when I got here, I couldn't believe what was \nhappening. The Chair is an attorney, and he will understand this. We \nactually had an amendment offered in 1997 in this body to amend the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution, the right of free speech and \npress. Thirty-eight Senators out of 100 voted for it. It would have \nbeen the greatest retrenchment of American democracy since the founding \nof this country. I was shocked at it. I guess they are not embarrassed. \nThey have not offered it again. They haven't come back with that \namendment. I have it right here.\n  This was the amendment. Thirty-eight Senators proposed to amend it by \nsaying that Congress shall be able to set limits on contributions in \ncampaigns.\n  I will say one thing about those people, they were honest about it. \nThey were direct about it. They knew that being able to speak out and \nraise money and buy time on television is part and parcel of free \nspeech, and they were willing to pass a constitutional amendment so it \ncould be done. We have problems when we start telling people they can't \nraise money.\n\n  As the Senator from Kentucky says, to speak, to carry your message, \nwhat you are doing is, these politicians, we politicians are going to \nget around here and say who can speak and who can't speak. We are going \nto tend to say the ones who can't speak are the ones who are attacking \nus and don't agree with us. American democracy is a great, great thing. \nSome say, our government is terrible but it is better than all others. \nI suppose that is what we are talking about fundamentally. We have \nlearned over the years that the right of Americans to speak and debate \nand contend for their beliefs is ultimately better than passing laws to \ncontrol it. That is the fundamental choice with which we are dealing.\n  McCain-Feingold originally, as it came forward, was going to stop all \nkinds of activity within days of the election. It was going to do a lot \nof different things on issue advocacy, that sort of thing.\n  Mr. President, I believe I will need unanimous consent to retain the \nfloor following the vote at 4 on the DOD conference report. I ask for \nthat at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we are going to vote at 4, is my \nunderstanding.\n\n[[Page S12610]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Does this unanimous consent request change that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does not.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So we will still vote at 4 on DOD?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This request does not change that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the vote is scheduled for 4? We will be \nvoting at 4?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will simply wrap up by saying there is not an easy \nway around this. The original McCain-Feingold attempted to contain all \ncollections of money outside a political campaign in a lot of different \nways. The effect of that was to say that a pro-choice group, a pro-life \ngroup could not raise funds and speak out on issues, even as it related \nto a particular candidate or campaign. When it became clear, I submit, \nthat would not meet constitutional muster, we now have McCain-Feingold \nlite, as they say. It simply says you can't give but a limited amount \nof money to a political committee, Republican or Democratic committee \nor Republican or Democratic congressional campaign committee and, I \nsuppose, some other party, if they have that much strength and qualify, \nbut basically, political parties can't receive moneys except under the \nlimited powers given. They have had to abandon the goal of prohibiting \nindependent political action groups from receiving money and spending \nit.\n  I had groups against me that had spent money that I am not sure who \nthey were. They were basically fly-by-night groups. I have heard other \nSenators talk about waking up and turning on the television and being \nattacked by some citizens for the environment or citizens for this or \nthat. People put their money into those groups. They run ads, and they \ncall your name. That is not covered by this bill. All it says is you \ncan't give to a political party who may be involved in the election and \nyou are limited in how much money you could give to them. But a \npolitical party is better than these fly-by-night groups. A political \nparty has to be there the next election. If they cheat and lie and \nmisrepresent, you can hold them accountable, and it probably will hurt \nthem in the next election. They have people whose reputations are \ncommitted to those parties.\n  If we are going to control anything, we ought to do these other \ngroups, rather than political parties, because they have an incentive \nto maintain credibility, and this bill would not do anything except for \npolitical organizations.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/14/senate-section/article/S12610-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, there is a difficulty in a free country, one that \nguarantees the right of free speech and the press, to tell a group of \ncitizens they cannot raise money and speak out at any time they choose \nto carry forth the message they believe in deeply. We are not talking \nabout a game here. It is nice to sit around and say: How can we do \nsomething about this money in campaigns? It is such a burden to raise \nmoney. People try to buy influence. It is true people do try to \ningratiate themselves to Members of Congress. How do you stop it? How \ndo you do it, consistent with the great democracy of which we are a \npart?\n  This bill as it is written, the ``McCain-Feingold lite''--the final \nversion that has been altered, as we have gone by--is a feeble, sad \nattempt, really, to control spending in a way that is not going to be \nat all effective. In fact, it is going to be counterproductive and \nunwise, at the same time undermining the great first amendment of our \nConstitution.\n  This bill would fundamentally only ban contributions of soft money; \nthat is, contributions of money of certain amounts that are limited in \nthe statute. If you give more than that to a party, then that becomes \nsoft money. It would ban these contributions to parties or party \norganizations.\n  Parties are good things. A lot of fine political scientists have been \nconcerned over a number of years that parties have begun to lose their \nstrength. But they go out to educate the public. People can call them \nto get information. They help young, inexperienced candidates get into \nthe political fray. They help them fill out their forms right and make \nsure they comply with the campaign laws and the other laws involved in \nthese elections. They serve good purposes. They are, at their \nfoundation, a group of American citizens who share a general view of \ngovernment who desire to come together to further those ends through \ntheir organization. So we are banning money to them. Who does not get \nsoft money or money over the $1,000 contribution limits? Parties cannot \nget it. At the same time, there would be no ban on contributions to \norganizations that are not historic, that will not continue to exist \nfrom election to election. They will go away.\n\n  In Alabama, in 1996, the ad that was voted the worst ad in America \nwas run in our supreme court race. It was a skunk ad, and it was a \ndespicable ad. It was done by money that apparently was given by a \ntrial lawyers' association to an organization. I think the title of it \nwas the ``Good Government Association.'' They raised this money and put \nit into this thing. It had one\n\n[[Page S12611]]\n\npurpose. It didn't register voters, didn't answer the phone, didn't \nproduce literature--it ran attack ads against a good and decent \ncandidate for the supreme court of the State of Alabama. This bill \nwould not stop that kind of thing. That could still go on.\n  That is why I believe it would do nothing to deal with that \nfundamental problem. When people care about an election, they are going \nto speak out. These fly-by-night groups that come together, they have \nno integrity to defend over the years as a political party does. Their \nleaders oftentimes are people you will never hear from again. But a \nchairman of a political party, the candidates and members of that \nparty, Republican or Democrat, have a vested interest in trying to \nmaintain the integrity of their party. I think, in truth, there are \ngoing to be fewer abuses by a political party, frankly, than another \nkind of institution. I will just say these would be legal under this \nbill. It would not deal with the fundamental question with which we are \nmost concerned.\n  We know one of the union labor leaders has promised to spend $46 \nmillion in 35 congressional races to defeat Republican candidates and \ntake over the House of Representatives. He has announced that: Over $1 \nmillion per race. This bill would provide no control over that.\n  What if you are a candidate in Alabama and all of a sudden you wake \nup and you have been targeted and they are spending $2 million--it \ncould be $2 million, maybe $3 million--against you, running attack ads \ndaily? You go around to ask people to raise money to help you and they \ncannot give but $1,000 and you cannot get your message out because you \nhave been overwhelmed. That is not fairness. It would not control that \nkind of immense funding in any way. That is not fair. That is all I am \nsaying. That is not fair. We do not need to do that thing, in my view.\n  If there is a problem in campaign finance and funding, one of the \nmost amazing and aggravating things to me is that a union member who \nfavors me or someone else, another candidate, may have his money taken \nor her money taken and spent for the person they oppose. They have no \nchoice in it whatsoever. They have to work, they have to pay union \ndues, and the money is spent. This bill throws up a figleaf and says, \nif you are not a union member, then you can object, if they are taking \nyour union dues, and maybe get a little bit of it back if you protest \nand demand it back. But as far as dealing fundamentally with the \nfreedom of working Americans to decide who their money is spent on, it \nwould do nothing. That is a wrong, if you want to know what is wrong in \nthis country.\n  I submit this bill is a shell, a pretend bill. It will not stop soft \nmoney. That is so obvious as to be indisputable. It is going to \ncontinue. It is just going to go through organizations other than \npolitical parties. It will not stop unions from spending $46 million on \na few targeted races. It is not going to stop political action \ncommittees with special interests from raising funds, involving \nthemselves in elections. Indeed, how can it? Should it be able to? \nProbably not. How can we stop people from doing that?\n  I don't like it. I don't like people running ads against me and I \nhave had them run against me saying: Call Jeff Sessions and tell him \nyou don't like what he is doing. It is basically an attack ad. It is \nnot going to change.\n\n  What can we do? I can suggest a few things. Let's raise the 1974 \nspending limits. That is way out of date. It is time to bring those up \nto date. Then a person who cares about an election, if he gives $2,000 \nor $3,000, may not believe he needs to carry on by giving money to a \nspecial committee to argue the case further. He may be satisfied with \nthat. That would be natural and normal. It would reduce the pressure \nfor soft money.\n  I believe we need more prompt disclosure. People need to know who is \ngiving this money. It would have been helpful for the voters of Alabama \nto have known that a skunk ad came from defense lawyers, plaintiff \nlawyers, and business interests on one side of that debate. They would \nbe more understanding of what it means and may be able to hold somebody \naccountable in a way they would not otherwise.\n  Frankly, we ought to start enforcing the law. I spent 15 years as a \nFederal prosecutor. We are not doing a very good job, in my view, of \nfinding people who violate existing laws and seeing that people are \nheld accountable. There are going to be mistakes, and I am not talking \nabout witch hunts and trying to disturb honest and decent candidates \nwho have done their best to comply with many regulations, but we really \nneed to watch those cases where we have serious enforcement problems.\n  The Senator from Utah talked about Mr. Tamraz who gave $300,000 to \nthe Democratic Party to meet with the President, and the State \nDepartment people said he is a bad character and they should not see \nhim. But he was invited to the White House and the President saw him \nanyway. That is helpful and may not be an absolute violation of the \nlaw, but that is the kind of thing we ought to know about and stand up \nagainst. But this is freedom fundamentally to speak out.\n  My time is up. Our cure, I am afraid, is more dangerous than the \ndisease. We have a lot of problems in elections and because of them \npeople get upset. But fundamentally in America, today you can campaign \nand get your message out, and the American people accept the results of \nthose elections. We do not have riots when one candidate wins and \nanother one does not. It is because people feel they have an adequate \nopportunity to have their say.\n  This legislation clearly, in my opinion, would weaken the first \namendment right to free press and freedom of speech. It would be \ndangerous because the incumbents will be setting the rules. As Members \nof this body, we are going to set rules which protect and resist \nactivities that we as incumbent politicians do not like. Every now and \nthen, it might be healthy for somebody who wants to raise a bunch of \nmoney and run against some of us. It might be good for us. One can make \nan issue of it if they think it is unfair, but how can we say they \ncannot do that? Many of the rules we are talking about cannot be \nenforced. They will not be enforced or do not even attempt to avoid \ncertain loopholes which we close in a little gate and then the whole \nfence is down when we allow this money to go through other political \ngroups and just barring parties from spending the money.\n  This plan will not work. It will not achieve the goal of the parties \nsubmitting it. It will not do that. It encroaches on the first \namendment and is not good public policy.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, campaign finance reform was the first issue on which I \nchose to speak when I was duly elected to the Senate almost 3 years \nago. I occupied this desk and talked about my understanding of the \nstate of campaign financing in America. I had just gone through one of \nthe most expensive Senate races in the history of the United States \nwhere I was outspent some 3\\1/2\\ to 1. I am lucky to be here.\n  The current status of campaign financing in America is a moral swamp; \nit is full of skunks; it is full of special interests out to buy their \nway into the heart of the American Government. Those of us in this \nSenate, 100 selected, want to make sure the public interest prevails, \nnot special interests. I tip my hand and my hat to two fine Members of \nthis body who day in and day out, year in and year out, have fought the \ngood fight in cleaning up this moral swamp of campaign financing.\n  My dear friend and fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator John McCain, and \nmy seatmate, Senator Feingold, have put together an effort which I \nbelieve has a reasonable chance of succeeding.\n  I can remember sitting here a couple years ago after a whole year of \nsitting on the Governmental Affairs Committee and listening to one \nhorror story after another about problems of campaign financing in \nAmerica, and a majority of our Governmental Affairs Committee decided \nwe needed campaign financing; we needed the McCain-Feingold bill. I was \nan original cosponsor of it and a majority of the Senate supported it, \nbut we could not get 60 votes.\n\n  Senator McCain, in those days, said something like: It is a question \nof time. This Senate will pass campaign finance reform. It is just a \nmatter of\n\n[[Page S12612]]\n\nwhen, and it will be whether or not we are here.\n  I am glad the issue of campaign finance reform is back before this \ndistinguished body, and it is none too late. In 1998, the last general \nelection in this country, we had higher spending, more negativity, \ngreater public cynicism, and not coincidentally, lower voter turnout \nthan at any time in this century. We are at a turning point. I thank \nSenator John McCain and Senator Russ Feingold for offering to us, \nagain, a chance to clean up this moral swamp.\n  My dear colleague from Arizona and I were in the Vietnam war. We have \nbeen shot at before. We have been attacked before. We have been \ncriticized before. But his integrity is still intact. He is \nincorruptible, he is unbought and unbossed, and I am honored to serve \nwith him today.\n  Over the years, opponents of McCain-Feingold have continued to \nconcentrate their spoken criticisms on its alleged violations of free \nspeech, though that is, in my opinion, a flawed equation of money with \nspeech.\n  I look back at the 1976 decision by the Supreme Court which, in \neffect, equated the ability to spend money with free speech. In the \ncampaign finance hearings a couple of years ago, I asked the simple \nquestion: If you do not have any money in this country, does that mean \nyou do not have any speech? Of course not. The problem is we have \nequated money with speech and the ability to get on the air with 30- \nand 60-second spots which make us want to throw up.\n  I share the concern of the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions, about these negative attack ads that come from out of State \nand seem to originate from God knows where. They come in and \nassassinate someone's character. That is not the country for which \nSenator McCain and I fought. That is not the kind of democracy we \nintend to serve. That is one reason why I have bonded with him in such \na close way: to support cleaning up this incredible process.\n  Right now we have a system where every millionaire in America can \nexpect to run for public office. The rest of us will have to take a \nback seat.\n  I would say there is little doubt about the commitment of James \nMadison, father of the Constitution, an architect of the Bill of \nRights, and President of the United States, to the great cause of free \nspeech. Madison was the author of the first 10 amendments to the \nConstitution, the Bill of Rights. In The Federalist Papers, Madison put \nthe challenge of governing this way. He said:\n\n       But what is government itself, but the greatest of all \n     reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no \n     government would be necessary. In framing a government which \n     is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty \n     lies in this: you must first enable the government to control \n     the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control \n     itself.\n\n  We have to control this campaign finance system or it will eat us \nalive. Our system of elections is fast becoming a system of auctions. \nWhile Madison was certainly both a revolutionary and a visionary, he \nnever allowed himself to stray too far from the practical realities of \nthe world in which he lived. To him, the lack of human perfection was \nthus the basis for government and a factor which must be taken into \naccount in providing a government with sufficient powers to accomplish \nits necessary functions.\n  The last time the Senate debated McCain-Feingold, back in 1997, \nSenator Fred Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, delivered a very fine statement on the Senate floor about \ncampaign finance reform and free speech in which he pointed out that, \nin the real world, the debate about campaign finance reform and free \nspeech is not one of absolutes, as some would have it. There is not a \nchoice between a system of unfettered free speech and government \nregulation, for our current system recognizes many instances in which \nthere is a legitimate and constitutional public interest in regulating \nspeech, from slander laws, to prohibitions on the disclosure of the \nidentities of American intelligence agents, to the campaign arena \nitself, with a longstanding ban on corporate contributions and quarter-\ncentury and older limits on other forms of contributions and disclosure \nrequirements.\n\n  So the debate isn't really over whether or not there will be \ngovernment regulation of campaigns but on what form that regulation \nwill take. In the words of Dr. Norm Ornstein, a noted political \nscientist and a witness in the Governmental Affairs hearings, the \nquestion is whether or not we will erect some ``fences'' to prevent the \nworst abuses from recurring.\n  As I have told anyone who has asked me, I love being a Senator. I \ncherish this body. As does Senator Byrd, I cherish its traditions. \nHaving the privilege of representing my State in this body, where such \ngiants as Clay and Webster and Calhoun and Norris and LaFollette and \nDirksen and Russell and Senator Byrd have served with great \ndistinction, is the greatest honor of my life. But, my fellow Members \nof the Senate, I was not honored by the process that I and every other \ncandidate for the Senate had to undergo in order to get here.\n  We have to spend years in raising millions of dollars just to defend \nourselves out there in the marketplace. I have not felt privileged \nsitting here day by day, with evidence continually mounting in \ncongressional hearings, in newspaper reports, of campaign abuses, or \npublic opinion surveys chronicling the loss of public trust in the \npolitical process, or the ongoing massive fundraising which takes place \nall the time in this, the Nation's Capital. The current system is \nbroken, and it cries out for reform.\n  We have heard a lot of talk, and we will hear more talk, about these \nabuses, and about the general topic of campaign finance reform. But the \ntime is coming when we must take action. Certainly the revised McCain-\nFeingold package is not perfect; it is not all that I think needs to be \ndone to remedy our problem, but it is an essential first step, aimed at \ndealing with the worst of the abuses which currently plague our \ncampaign system.\n  It is fascinating how the term ``soft money'' has grown up. It is \nreally not soft money; it is hard money with soft laws. It is now time \nto correct that abuse. The revised bipartisan campaign finance reform \nproposal does not contain spending limits. I wish it did. \nUnfortunately, the Supreme Court has declared that unconstitutional. It \ndoes not contain limits on PACs. The current law does. It does not \nprovide free discounted broadcast air time for Federal candidates. I \nthink we ought to have that. And the bill does not place any \nlimitations on sham issue ads, which we need very badly. We need to \nplace some limitations on that, especially 60 days out from an \nelection.\n  But what the proposal does do is this:\n  One, it bans soft money contributions to and spending by national \npolitical parties and candidates for Federal office. That, in and of \nitself, is an achievement.\n  Two, it curbs soft money contributions to and spending by State \nparties when such activities are related to Federal elections.\n  And three, it strictly codifies the Beck decision concerning the \nright of nonunion members to have a refund of any union fees used for \npolitical purposes to which they object.\n  There are certainly areas where I believe this package should be \nstrengthened, but we must not let the pursuit of a politically \nunattainable ideal prevent us from adopting the very useful and \nimportant provisions in this package.\n  Let us remember that it was soft money which was at the heart of most \nof the egregious campaign abuses uncovered by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's investigation of the 1996 campaign. I sat through a whole \nyear of listening to those horror stories, and it convinced me it is \nlong since time that we act.\n\n  The country is watching what we do on campaign finance reform. Make \nno mistake about that. They are understandably skeptical that we will \ntake action to reform the very system under which we all were elected, \nand, shall we say, expectations are extremely low. Unfortunately, based \non our behavior to date, those expectations are being fulfilled.\n  But this is a real opportunity, the best we will have in this \nCongress to show we can take the hard but necessary steps to help begin \nto restore the public's faith in the workings of our great experiment \nin democracy.\n  Earlier this year, by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, the\n\n[[Page S12613]]\n\nHouse of Representatives approved the Shays-Meehan bill, which goes far \nbeyond the measure currently before the Senate. The President of the \nUnited States stands prepared to sign any reasonable version of either \nof the bills into law. Now the ball is clearly in our court.\n  As we consider the McCain-Feingold legislation, I hope we will at \nlong last be allowed to engage in the normal amendment process whereby \nthe Senate can truly work its will and seek to improve the pending \nlegislation. There are a number of areas in which I think the existing \nbill can and should be improved. For my part, I will be offering a \nseries of amendments related to enforcement of existing laws by \nstrengthening the Federal Elections Commission and campaign disclosure \nrequirements. The FEC is the referee in this ballgame. It is time we \ngave the referee some strength.\n  One of the most glaring deficiencies in our current Federal campaign \nsystem is the ineffectiveness of this referee. The FEC, whether by \ndesign or through circumstance, has been beset by partisan gridlock, \nuncertain and insufficient resources, and lengthy proceedings which \noffer no hope of timely resolution of charges of campaign violations. \nIt is similar to a referee in a football game blowing a whistle and 9 \nmonths later throwing the flag.\n  Thus, the first major element of my amendments is to strengthen the \nability of the Federal Election Commission to be an effective and \nimpartial enforcer of Federal campaign laws.\n  I will be offering amendments to do several things:\n  One, alter the Commission structure to remove the possibility of \npartisan gridlock by adding a seventh member, who would serve as \nChairman and would be appointed by the President --with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate--from among 10 nominees recommended by the \nSupreme Court.\n  Two, require electronic filing of reports to the FEC; authorize the \nFEC to conduct random audits; give the FEC independent litigating \nauthority, including before the Supreme Court; and establish a right of \nprivate civil action to seek court enforcement in cases where the FEC \nfails to act, all of which should dramatically improve the prospects \nfor timely enforcement of our campaign finance laws.\n  Three, provide sufficient funding of the FEC from a source \nindependent of congressional intervention by the imposition of filing \nfees on Federal candidates, with such fees being adequate to meet the \nneeds of the Commission.\n  There is another area to be addressed by my amendments. The area I \nwould like to address is to enhance the effectiveness of campaign \ncontribution disclosure requirements.\n  I have to admit, of all the laws, of all the requirements I have seen \nat the State level and the Federal level, over the years in which I \nhave been dealing with the question of campaign finance reform--and I \nwas the State official in Georgia for 12 years who was the State \nelections officer, and I pushed for campaign finance reform then, and \nnow I am pushing for it as a Senator. Of all the requirements I have \nseen, of all the laws and the rules and regulations, I think the most \neffective brake on abuse in the campaign finance system is disclosure. \nAs Justice Brandeis once observed: Publicity is justly commended as a \nremedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the \nbest of disinfectants.\n\n  This is certainly true in the realm of campaign finance. Let there be \nmore sunlight. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Watergate \nreforms of a quarter century ago is the expanded campaign and financial \ndisclosure requirements which emerged from that tragedy. By and large, \nthose increased disclosure requirements have served us well, but as \nwith everything else, they need to be periodically reviewed and updated \nin the light of experience.\n  Therefore, based in part on testimony I heard during the last \nsession's Governmental Affairs Committee investigation and in part on \nthe FEC's own recommendations for improved disclosure, my amendments \nwould make several changes in current disclosure requirements.\n  Specifically, I am recommending a reform which will make it more \ndifficult for contributors and campaigns alike to turn a blind eye to \ncurrent disclosure requirements by requiring those who contribute $200 \nor more to provide a signed certification that their contribution is \nnot from a foreign national and is not the result of a contribution in \nthe name of another person.\n  In addition, I will offer amendments embodying a number of disclosure \nrecommendations made by the FEC in its reports to the Congress and by \nother campaign finance experts, including, among others: One, requiring \nall reports to be filed by the due date of the report; two, requiring \nall authorized candidate committee reports to be filed on a campaign-\nto-date basis rather than on a calendar-year cycle; three, mandating \nmonthly reporting for multicandidate committees which have raised or \nspent or anticipate raising or spending in excess of $100,000 in the \ncurrent election cycle; again, clarifying that reports of last-minute \nindependent expenditures must be received at the FEC within 24 hours of \nwhen the expenditure is made; and, finally, requiring that noncandidate \npolitical committees which have raised or received in excess of \n$100,000 be subjected to the same last-minute contribution reporting \nrequirements as candidate committees.\n  It is so easy to be pessimistic about campaign finance reform \nefforts. The public and the media are certainly expecting this Congress \nand this Senate to fail to take significant action in cleaning up this \nswamp. The scandalous campaign system, though, under which we all now \nsuffer must be changed.\n  I suggest we cannot afford the luxury of complacency. We may think we \nwill be able to win the next election or reelection because the level \nof outrage and the awareness of the extent of the vulnerability of our \npolitical system have perhaps not yet reached critical mass. I am \nconfident it is only a matter of time, as Senator McCain has said, and \nperhaps the next election cycle, which will undoubtedly feature more \nunaccountable soft money, more sham issue ads, more circumvention of \nthe spirit and, in some cases, the letter of current campaign finance \nlaws, before the scales are decisively tilted in favor of reform.\n  We will have campaign finance reform, Mr. President. The only \nquestion is whether or not this Congress and this Senate step up to the \nplate and fulfill their responsibility to the American public and give \nthem a system in which they can have confidence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of Members, the manager \nof the bill and the minority are trying to work out a time. We expect \nthere will be a vote at 6 on the underlying amendment. All Members \nshould keep that in mind. We don't have it yet, where we can enter a \nunanimous consent request, but we are very close to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today as we begin the debate on \ncampaign finance reform to discuss my thoughts and hopes on the actions \nthe Senate will be taking in the coming days.\n  First, let me thank the sponsors of the legislation, Senators McCain \nand Feingold, for their tireless perseverance to enact campaign finance \nreform. Without their hard work and vast knowledge, we would not be at \nthis important point. I would also like to thank the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, for working with Senators McCain and Feingold to schedule \nthis time for what I hope will be a full and open debate on this \nimportant issue. I look forward to hearing and debating the many ideas \nof my colleagues and believe the Senate should strive over the next \ncouple of days to show why we are considered the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world.\n  Mr. President, I was first elected to Congress following the \nWatergate scandal, right around the time Congress last enacted \ncomprehensive reform of our campaign finance system. I have watched \nwith growing dismay over my almost 25 years in Congress as the number \nof troubling examples of problems in our current campaign finance \nsystem have increased. These problems have led to a perception by the \npublic that a disconnect exists between themselves and the people that \nthey have\n\n[[Page S12614]]\n\nelected. I believe that this perception is a pivotal factor behind the \ndisturbingly low voter turnouts that have plagued national elections in \nrecent years.\n  While some may point to surveys that list campaign finance reform as \na low priority for the electorate, I believe that the public actually \nstrongly supports Congress debating and enacting comprehensive reform \nthis year. It is important to reverse the trend of shrinking voter \nturnout by reestablishing the connection between the public and us, \ntheir elected representatives, by passing comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform.\n\n  As I said earlier, I look forward to a full and open debate on the \nissue of campaign finance reform including the amendments that will be \noffered. At the end of this debate, the Senate should be able to pass \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform. That to me is the most important \naspect of any bill the Senate may pass, it must be comprehensive. If we \nfail to address the problems facing our campaign finance system with a \ncomprehensive balanced package we will ultimately fail in our mission \nof reforming the system. Closing one loophole, without addressing the \nothers in a systematic way, will not do enough to correct current \ndeficiencies, and may in fact create new and unintended consequences.\n  Mr. President, we have all seen first-hand the problems with the \ncurrent state of the law as it relates to sham issue advertisements. I \nhave focused much time and effort on developing a legislative solution \non this topic with my colleague Senator Olympia Snowe, and was pleased \nthat this solution was adopted by the Senate during the last debate on \ncampaign finance reform. I was also proud to cosponsor the \ncomprehensive campaign finance bill Senators McCain and Feingold \nintroduced earlier this year that included this legislative solution.\n  While I understand the rationale my colleagues used in crafting the \nbase legislation that we are debating, I feel strongly that the \nlegislation the Senate must ultimately vote on include some kind of \nchanges to the current law concerning sham issue advertisements. I feel \nthat we have crafted a reasonable, constitutional approach to this \nproblem and will be offering it as an amendment during this debate.\n  That does not mean, though, that we will stop working with our \ncolleagues to craft additional, and perhaps different, ideas to address \nthe problems with the current law on sham issue advertisements. My \nultimate goal is to create a comprehensive campaign finance bill that \nwill garner the support of at least 59 of my other colleagues, and \nhopefully more.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the upcoming full and open debate on \nthis important issue, and pledge to continue working with my colleagues \nto enact comprehensive campaign finance reform into law this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nunderlying amendment occur at 6 o'clock this evening, and that the time \nbe divided equally between the respective parties prior to that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator repeat the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. It is that the vote on the underlying amendment would occur \nat 6 o'clock, there would be no second-degree amendments in order, and \nthat the time between now and 6 o'clock be divided between the \nproponents and opponents of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am also informed--and I believe it is the \ncase--that after the vote at 6 o'clock, there will be 20 minutes on the \nVA-HUD Appropriations bill.\n  That is for the information of Senators. It hasn't been determined by \nthe leaders for sure, but that is what I expect will happen.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me second what the assistant \nDemocratic leader has said. That is the anticipation with regard to the \nVA-HUD.\n  Mr. President, seeing no one on the floor at the moment, I thought I \nmight make a few observations about the debate in which we are \ncurrently engaged.\n  One of the commonly stated myths that we have heard throughout the \nday is that soft money in our current campaign finance system is the \ncause of unprecedented public cynicism about, and distrust of, \ngovernment. The truth is, according to a study published by Oxford \nPress in 1999, which was coordinated by the faculty of the Kennedy \nschool and which benefited from the participation of scholars from the \nUniversity of Michigan, the University of Arizona, and the University \nof Illinois, public trust in government and cynicism about government \npredates not only soft money but also the events that prompted the \noriginal Federal Election Campaign Act. According to this study, public \ntrust in the Federal Government has suffered a fairly steady decline \nsince 1958, when 75 percent of the American people trusted the Federal \nGovernment most of the time.\n  By the end of the Carter administration, this number had dropped to \napproximately 25 percent. This trend was temporarily reversed during \nthe Reagan administration, but during the subsequent administrations, \nit again declined to near pre-Reagan levels of distrust. The fact that \nour campaign finance system and soft money have not caused a \nprecipitous drop in public trust and an unprecedented increase in \ncynicism is confirmed by an even more recent study by two Harvard \nprofessors, which is going to press at the Princeton University Press. \nThis study shows that trust in government did not precipitously decline \nduring the scandal-ridden 1996 Presidential campaign.\n  These studies show that, according to most recent data available to \nthese distinguished scholars, levels of public trust in government are \ncurrently no higher than they were in 1994 or at the end of the Carter \nadministration in 1980. Simply put, the best and most recent \nscholarship establishes that public distrust of government predates our \ncurrent campaign finance system and soft money, and the advent of our \ncurrent campaign finance system and soft money have not accelerated the \nrelatively steady decline in public trust that began in 1958. So it is \nclear that this debate we are having has absolutely nothing to do with \nthe steady decline of confidence in our government.\n\n  Now, the prescription for this steady decline that has been offered \nby a variety of so-called reformers around here has been tried in some \nother democracies.\n  Let's look at Canada, for example. Our neighbors to the north already \nhave passed many of the types of regulations supported by the \nproponents of the various reforms that are before the Senate or have \nbeen before the Senate in recent years. Canada has adopted the \nfollowing regulations of political speech: spending limits that all \nnational candidates must abide by to be eligible to receive taxpayer \nmatching funds. Candidates can spend $2 per voter for the first 15,000 \nvotes they get, $1 per voter for all the votes up to 25,000, and 50 \ncents per voter beyond 25,000.\n  Canada also has spending limits on parties that restrict parties to \nspending the product of a multiple used to account for cost of living \ntimes the number of registered voters in each electoral district in \nwhich the party has a candidate running for office. Right now, it comes \nout to about a dollar a voter.\n  Canada also has indirect funding via media subsidies. The Canadian \nGovernment requires that radio and television networks provide all \nparties with a specified amount of free air time during the month prior \nto an election. The government also provides subsidies to defray the \ncosts of political publishing and gives tax credits to individuals and \ncorporations which donate to candidates and/or parties.\n  That is the prescription in Canada. It is not all that dissimilar to \nthe ones that have been promoted here in recent years, up to and \nincluding the bill we currently have before us.\n\n[[Page S12615]]\n\n  Let's look at the attitude about government in Canada after all of \nthese reforms. The most recent political science studies of Canada \ndemonstrate that, despite all of this regulation of political speech by \ncandidates and parties, the number of Canadians who feel ``the \ngovernment doesn't care what people like me think'' has grown from \nroughly 45 percent to 67 percent. Confidence in the national \nlegislature, after the enactment of all of these speech controls, has \ndropped from 49 percent to 21 percent. The number of Canadians \nsatisfied with their system of government has declined from 51 percent \nto 34 percent.\n  Let's take a look at Japan. According to the Congressional Research \nService:\n\n       Japanese election campaigns, including campaign financing, \n     are governed by a set of comprehensive laws that are the most \n     restrictive among democratic nations.\n\n  After forming a seven-party coalition government in August 1993, \nPrime Minister Hosokawa placed campaign finance reform at the top of \nhis agenda. He asserted that his reforms would restore democracy in \nJapan. In November 1994, his reform legislation passed. After this \nlegislation, the Japanese Government imposed the following restrictions \non political speech:\n  Candidates are forbidden from donating to their own campaigns. Any \ncorporation that is a party to a government contract, grant, loan, or \nsubsidy is prohibited from making or receiving any political \ncontributions for 1 year after they receive such a contract, grant, \nloan, or subsidy.\n  There are strict limits on what corporations and unions and \nindividuals may give to candidates and parties. There are limits on how \nmuch candidates may spend on their own campaigns.\n  Candidates are prohibited from buying any advertising in magazines \nand newspapers beyond the five print media ads of a specified length \nthat the government purchases for each candidate.\n  Parties are allotted a specified number of government-purchased ads \nof a specified length. The number of ads a party gets is based on the \nnumber of candidates they have running. It is illegal for these party \nads to discuss individual candidates.\n  In Japan, candidates and parties spend nothing on media advertising \nbecause not only are they prohibited from purchasing print media ads, \nbut they are also prohibited from buying time on television or radio.\n  The government requires TV stations to permit parties and each \ncandidate a set number of television and radio ads during the 12 days \nprior to the election.\n  Each candidate gets one government-subsidized televised broadcast.\n  The government's election management committee provides each \ncandidate with a set number of signboards and posters that subscribe to \nthe standard government-mandated format.\n  The Election Management Committee also designates the places and \ntimes candidates may give speeches.\n  The government says when candidates may speak, and where they may \nspeak.\n  You may ask: What happened after these exacting regulations on \npolitical speech that amount to a reformer's wish list were imposed in \nJapan? Did cynicism decline? Did trust in government increase? Not so, \nas you notice.\n  Following the imposition of these regulations, the number of Japanese \nsaying they had no confidence in legislators rose to 70 percent.\n  Following these regulations, only 12 percent of Japanese believe the \ngovernment is responsive to the people's opinions and wishes.\n  The percentage of Japanese satisfied with the Nation's political \nsystem fell to 5 percent.\n  Voter turnout continued to decline.\n  Let's take a look at France.\n  In France, there is significant regulation of political speech with \ngovernment funding of candidates, government funding of parties, free \nradio and television time, reimbursement for printing posters, and for \ncampaign-related transportation.\n  In France, they ban contributions to candidates by any entity except \nparties to PACs.\n  Individual contributions to parties are limited.\n  Strict expenditure limits are set for each electoral district in \nplace.\n  Every single candidate's finances are audited by the Commission \nNationale, generally known as CCFP, to ensure compliance with the \nrules.\n  Despite all of these regulations on political speech in France, the \nlatest studies indicate the French people's confidence in their \ngovernment and political institutions has continued to decline. Voter \nturnout has continued to decline.\n  Let's look at Sweden.\n  Sweden imposed the following regulations on political speech: There \nis no fundraising for spending for individual candidates at all. \nCitizens merely vote for parties which assign seats on the proportion \nof votes they receive.\n  The government subsidizes print ads by the parties.\n  Despite the fact that Sweden allows no fundraising or spending for \nindividual candidates, since these requirements have been in force the \nnumber of Swedes disagreeing with the statement that ``parties are only \ninterested in people's votes, not in their opinions'' has declined from \n51 percent to 28 percent.\n  The number of people expressing confidence in the Swedish Parliament \nhas declined from 51 percent to 19 percent.\n  So it is clear that many assertions made by the proponents of \nadditional campaign finance regarding the causal link between the \ncampaign finance system or soft money, and voter turnout, public \ncynicism, national pride, and the health of our democracy are not \nsupported but actually contradicted by the best and most recent \nscholarship and empirical data available from prestigious academics at \ninstitutions such as the Kennedy School at Harvard and the University \nof California System's Center for the Study of Democracy, and contrary \nto the experience of the other industrialized democracies that have \npassed the type of measures desired by proponents of more regulation of \npolitical speech.\n  The rationale for all of this has been that we need to clean up the \nsystem, squeezing out all of these private interests so everybody will \nhave more confidence in the government.\n  That didn't work anywhere overseas. So let's take a look at the \nUnited States.\n  Voter turnout at home: In the end, we don't even have to look at \nother countries to see that speech controls do not increase confidence, \nnor do they increase voter turnout. In 1974, as we all know, the \nFederal Election Campaign Act was expanded to limit the amount of money \nthat Presidential candidates could raise and spend. That is the system \nunder which the current candidates for President operate.\n  So if the reformers premise that limiting speech increases turnout is \ntrue, then surely voting in American Presidential elections would have \nincreased over the last 25 years. Let's look at the statistics.\n\n  In the 1950s and 1960s, before the passage of the Federal Election \nCampaign Act, the average voter turnout was consistently at 60 percent \nor higher.\n  So post-1974 must have been higher, right? After all, we passed the \nFederal Election Campaign Act. After all, the Congress supposedly gave \nus ``comprehensive reform'' for the Presidential system in 1974.\n  But the numbers show the emptiness of the reformers' rhetoric. The \nvoter turnout for every Presidential election postreform has never \nreached 60 percent. In fact, the postreform high was 1992 when voter \nturnout reached 55 percent.\n  Even if one accepts the reformers' notion that voter turnout and \nvoter confidence are problems in America, banning issue speech by \npolitical parties is clearly not the solution. Having less speech, less \ndebate, and less discussion is clearly not going to have a positive \nimpact on voter turnout, and there are simply no statistics--none \nwhatsoever--to substantiate the claim that passing the kind of \nlegislation which is before us today, or the kind that has been before \nus seemingly annually for the last 10 or 12 years, would have any \nimpact whatsoever on reducing cynicism or raising turnout.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we start from the most fundamental of all \npropositions, the first amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates. That amendment reads as it affects this debate, ``Congress \nshall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press''--\n``no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.''\n\n[[Page S12616]]\n\n  The Supreme Court of the United States quite properly has determined \nthat meaningful freedom of speech requires the expenditure of money and \nhas been loathe to accept any restrictions upon the use of money to \nbroadcast one's ideas about political propositions in the United \nStates.\n  At least several speeches that I have heard during the course of the \nday--most notably earlier this afternoon by the junior Senator from \nCalifornia--quarreled with that fundamental proposition in the first \namendment. About 30 of the Members of this body a year or so ago were \ncourageous enough to vote for a constitutional amendment that would \nhave limited first amendment rights. They were wrong, in my view, but \nthey were highly principled to do so. Any meaningful limitation on \npolitical speech, in the view of this Senator, will require an \namendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Parliamentary inquiry: Will the Chair illuminate me on \nwhose time is being used at this time and whose time is remaining so I \nmight understand the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky spoke in opposition \nto the amendment and used 5 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Washington is speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is speaking on the \ntime of the proponents.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry to interrupt the Senator from Washington, but \nI don't quite understand.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Washington is speaking on the same side \nas the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be adjusted accordingly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. The quarrel of the general proponents of these ideas is \nwith the Constitution of the United States and most expressly with the \nfirst amendment. The drafters of that amendment did not say that the \nCongress could attempt to equalize the rights of speech of each \nindividual citizen of the United States. They simply said that \npolitical speech was open and could not be restricted in any way by the \nCongress of the United States.\n  If unlimited or, rather, if the right of some people to communicate \nmore widely than others could be restricted, presumably we could treat \nas soft money the money spent by the New York Times to editorialize on \nthis issue or that of a television network. Obviously, the editorial \ndirector of the New York Times has a stronger voice heard by more \npeople than the average citizen. And so, of course, does a group or a \ncorporation, for that matter, whose rights and money is at risk in \ndebate here in Congress.\n  Those who feel at risk with respect to the policies that we adopt \nhave an absolute right to speak out in that connection. It is a right \nthat the proponents of this bill in general terms don't want to \nrestrict. Few of them, however, have proposed constitutional amendments \nor limits on free speech in the arts or in literature or with respect \nto pornography. We are faced with the paradox in this debate that the \nproponents think the only kind of speech that ought to be limited is \npolitical speech, the kind of speech the first amendment drafters had \nin mind when they wrote the first amendment.\n  In a narrow phase of this bill as it appears before the Senate, the \nonly evil organizations whose activities are to be controlled or whose \ncontributions are to be not limited or banned of a certain kind are the \ntwo major political parties and their organizations. This bill at this \ntime has no limitation on the contribution of soft money to other \norganizations that have political agendas. It cannot constitutionally \nlimit issue advocacy. It can't even limit individual express advocacy \nas long as that advocacy is disclosed.\n  I suppose I find it most paradoxical the proposition that we base \nthese controls on corruption or the appearance of corruption when the \nappearance of corruption is primarily created by those who want these \nlimitations. Presumably, whenever they say that a particular act \ncarries with it the appearance of corruption, that means it is the case \nand that the limits they propose on political speech are, therefore, \nvalid.\n  That simply is not the case. Political controversy in the United \nStates from the time of the first Congress in 1789 and the passage of \nthe first amendment has often been disorderly; it has involved a number \nof outrageous charges as well as careful political thought; it has \nbenefited those who want to put the greatest amount of time and money \nand effort and press into expressing their ideas. It has not been \nregulated by the Congress of the United States and somehow or another \nwe have been successful.\n  The idea that cynicism or opting out of the political process is \ngoing to be improved by passing laws is a triumph of hope over \nexperience. It hasn't happened in connection with any such law here or \nin any other State at any time in the past. We have gotten this far in \nthe history of the United States with its most successful free \ngovernment by prohibiting the control of political speech on the part \nof the Government of the United States. We will survive the next 200 \nyears far better without any such prohibitions than if we grant them.\n  Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. That is \nour command. This is an attempt to cause such an abridgement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute before my \ncolleague from Wisconsin speaks for the purpose of asking unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a letter from the American Bar \nAssociation and a letter from the League of Women Voters. I so ask.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         American Bar Association,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: As the Senate begins consideration of \n     campaign finance reform legislation, I write on behalf of the \n     American Bar Association to urge you to support reform that \n     will strengthen the electoral process; reduce the influence \n     of special interests; allow members and candidates to devote \n     more time to substantive issues, rather than fundraising; and \n     preserve the First Amendment rights of eligible individuals \n     to participate in political campaigns.\n       The American Bar Association (ABA) has long been concerned \n     with campaign finance and electoral issues. In 1973, the ABA \n     created its Standing Committee on Election Law with the \n     purpose of developing and examining ways to improve the \n     federal electoral process. The overriding premise of these \n     efforts has been to support candidate and citizen \n     participation in the electoral process, and to increase \n     public confidence through accountability and disclosure.\n       As you know, campaign finance laws have not been \n     substantially revised by Congress for over twenty years. \n     Changes in campaign finance mechanisms, the infusion of \n     ``soft money'' into the system, the burgeoning use of \n     electronic media, and the emergence of issue advertisements \n     have literally transformed the ways in which campaigns are \n     financed and run. Yet, our laws and regulations have not kept \n     pace with the innovations in campaign activities. The \n     statutory and regulatory framework for campaign finance \n     regulation needs to be modified to address these changing \n     trends in order to ensure the integrity of the campaign \n     finance system.\n       The American Bar Association believes the following \n     principles should be included as part of any campaign finance \n     legislation:\n       Full Disclosure. Disclosure is a vital and necessary \n     component to maintaining the integrity of the campaign \n     finance system. The ABA supports full and timely disclosure \n     of campaign contributions and expenditures in excess of \n     minimal amounts. All contributions to and expenditures by \n     state and federal party committees should be reported \n     publicly and electronically. In addition, the Federal \n     Election Commission should be required to maintain a central \n     clearinghouse with respect to data concerning both \n     contribution and expenditure reports.\n       Reasonable Contribution Limits, Adjusted and Indexed for \n     Inflation. Campaign contributions to candidates and political \n     parties should be limited to reasonable amounts. The current \n     contribution limit was set in 1974, and has not been adjusted \n     to take into account inflation, increases in the size of the \n     electorate and the dramatic rise in campaign costs. Raising \n     the individual contribution limit would allow candidates to \n     spend less time fundraising and more time discussing \n     substantive issues, help level the playing field between \n     incumbents and challengers, and channel money currently being \n     contributed outside the federal system (soft money) back into \n     the regulated process. Therefore, the ABA believes that \n     current individual campaign contribution limits should be \n     adjusted for inflation and indexed thereafter.\n\n[[Page S12617]]\n\n       Soft Money. The ABA opposes the solicitation and use in \n     presidential and congressional campaigns of ``soft money'', \n     i.e., contributions to political party committees in \n     unlimited amounts by corporations, labor unions and \n     individuals, and supports the effort to prohibit such \n     contributions. Soft money has been used as a method by which \n     contribution limits and prohibitions under the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act have been successfully circumvented and \n     has created at least the appearance, if not the reality, of \n     corruption in the political system. This issue must be \n     addressed in order to help restore public confidence in the \n     electoral process.\n       Public Participation--Legal Permanent Residents. Campaign \n     finance laws should not discourage the participation of \n     individuals, political parties, and organized political \n     groups in all aspects of the electoral process. Of particular \n     concern are efforts to restrict the political activities of \n     legal permanent residents. The fundamental rights of free \n     speech and association are an integral part of this nation's \n     democratic process and are not restricted only to citizens. \n     Legal permanent residents, who bear most of the same civic \n     responsibilities as citizens, including paying taxes and \n     registering for the draft, must not be prevented from \n     exercising their constitutional right to participate in the \n     political process. The ABA therefore opposes any diminution \n     of the existing rights of legal permanent residents to make \n     campaign contributions and expenditures to the same extent as \n     U.S. citizens.\n       Public Financing. The ABA supports partial public financing \n     of congressional and presidential elections as a desirable \n     means of providing a floor for campaign funds, promoting and \n     ensuring an effective and competitive electoral process, and \n     minimizing the importance of wealth and the need for large \n     contributions.\n       Reforming campaign finance laws to reflect the foregoing \n     principles will help ensure increased citizen and candidate \n     participation and restored public confidence in the electoral \n     process. We urge you to keep these principles in mind as the \n     Senate debates campaign finance reform legislation.\n       If you would like further information, please do not \n     hesitate to contact either me or Kristi Gaines in the ABA \n     Governmental Affairs Office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D. Evans,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                             The League of Women Voters \n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1999.\n     Re  Campaign finance reform.\n\n     To: Members of the U.S. Senate\n     From: Carolyn Jefferson-Jenkins, Ph.D., President\n       The League of Women Voters urges you not to support the \n     modified version of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance \n     reform legislation, S. 1593.\n       The decision to remove the ``sham issue ad'' provisions \n     from the original bill, S. 26, means that the current system \n     that allows large, undisclosed contributions from corporate \n     and union treasuries and from wealthy individuals to go \n     toward elections advertising will go unchecked. We believe \n     that real reform legislation must address this growing \n     problem rather than ignore it.\n       Proponents of the modified legislation argue that it \n     ``bans'' soft money. This is simply not the case because sham \n     issue ads are a form of soft money. Soft money consists of \n     corporate and union treasury money and funds from wealthy \n     individuals that operate outside the current regulatory \n     regime. Sham issue ads are clearly part of this problem. \n     Because the modified legislation fails to deal with sham \n     issue ads, it fails to fully address the soft money crisis.\n       In fact, the modified bill will drive soft money into sham \n     issue ads, expanding the current loophole. To avoid the \n     provisions of the bill, corporations, unions and wealthy \n     individuals can simply reconstitute their contributions into \n     sham issue ads designed to elect or defeat candidates. In \n     addition, because contributions to sham issue ads are \n     undisclosed while traditional soft money contributions are \n     disclosed, the overall system may actually be made worse by \n     the modified bill. It will transform disclosed contributions \n     into undisclosed campaign money.\n       Sham issue advocacy--campaign ads designed to elect or \n     defeat clearly identified candidates by masquerading as issue \n     advocacy--provides a useful conduit for those with large \n     amounts of money to influence federal elections without \n     leaving any fingerprints.\n       Unlimited, undisclosed money is overwhelming the election \n     system. By running ads immediately preceding an election that \n     savage a candidate's opponent, special interests can provide \n     something of great value to the candidate they support, while \n     avoiding disclosure requirements and contribution limits.\n       In addition, candidates are losing control of their own \n     campaigns. Representative government depends on elected \n     officials being responsible to their constituencies. Unless \n     the sham issue ad loophole is closed, outcomes of elections \n     will more and more be determined by the irresponsible actions \n     of outsiders, unfettered by the need to represent the \n     interests of the citizens of a state or district.\n       Even more troubling is the possibility that foreign donors \n     will exploit sham issue advocacy to influence U.S. elections \n     and public policy. The sham issue advocacy loophole provides \n     a perfect--and perfectly legal--route for domestic or foreign \n     interests to influence our elections and add a corrupting \n     influence to public policy debates.\n       Given current expenditures on issue advocacy, the potential \n     for abuse is enormous. The Annenberg Public Policy Center at \n     the University of Pennsylvania estimates the amount of issue \n     advocacy advertising during the 1996 election season at $150 \n     million, over one-third of the $400 million spent on \n     advertising by all candidates for President and Congress \n     combined. For the 1998 election, the Annenberg Center \n     estimates that $275 to $340 million was spent on issue ads, \n     double what was spent in 1996.\n       The Annenberg studies also demonstrate that issue ads \n     frequently bear more than a passing resemblance to campaign \n     ads. Although issue ads ostensibly have the primary purpose \n     of promoting a sponsor's ideas or policies, fewer than one in \n     five ads from the 1996 campaign directly advocated the \n     sponsor's own position! In addition, nearly nine in ten issue \n     ads referred to a clearly identified candidate for office. \n     Less than five percent advocated support or opposition to a \n     piece of legislation. In the 1998 election cycle, 80 percent \n     of issue ads in the last two months mentioned candidates for \n     office by name.\n       We are strong proponents of closing the ``soft money'' \n     loophole and for campaign finance reform generally. By \n     excluding the provisions developed by Senators Snowe and \n     Jeffords to ensure that funding for sham issue ads is \n     effectively covered by election rules, the modified bill \n     falls too short.\n       The League of Women Voters believes strongly that the \n     Snowe-Jeffords Amendment, or other similar language designed \n     to ensure that funding for ``sham issue ads'' is effectively \n     covered by election rules, is an essential part of campaign \n     finance reform.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the letter is from Mr. Robert Evans, of \nthe American Bar Association:\n\n       I write on behalf of the American Bar Association to urge \n     you to support reform that will strengthen the electoral \n     process; reduce the influence of special interests; allow \n     members and candidates to devote more time to substantive \n     issues. . . .\n\n  They support full disclosure, reasonable contribution limits, \nadjusted and indexed for inflation. The ABA opposes campaigns of soft \nmoney, and also public participation of legal permanent residents.\n  Also, the League of Women Voters, referred to earlier by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, says that Senator McConnell's statement on the floor \nsuggested the League of Women Voters is in support of his position. On \nthe contrary. The League's position is opposite that of Senator \nMcConnell, who in their words ``opposes any meaningful campaign finance \nreform.''\n  They support comprehensive campaign finance reform. In fairness, the \nLeague of Women Voters thinks the Senator from Wisconsin and I are now \ntoo weak in our approach.\n  To assume somehow that as one may have in listening to the statement \nof the Senator from Kentucky this morning that the League of Women \nVoters was in agreement with this position is not the fact as \ndemonstrated in this letter.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from Arizona have an estimate, a guess, an \nobservation of how much this Senator and my opponent spent in the last \ngeneral election I was involved in in Nevada.\n  We spent about an equal amount of money. Does the Senator have a \nguess, estimate, or observation?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Nevada, I am from a neighboring \nState and I paid a lot of attention to that race. It was a very close \nand hard-fought race--I mean this in all due respect--in what is a \nrelatively small State, population-wise, although dynamically growing. \nI think percentage-wise, it is the fastest growing State in America.\n  I believe--I may be wrong--it was about $10 million each.\n  Mr. REID. The State of Nevada had less than 2 million people at that \ntime. The Senator is absolutely right; the two of us spent with State \nparty soft money, plus our hard money accounts, over $20 million. That \ndoes not count the independent expenditures, and we really don't know \nhow much they are because they are hard to track.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my friend, some of the estimates I heard on \nthe independent campaign expenditures were as high as the $20 million \nspent by both you and your opponent?\n\n[[Page S12618]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Probably not; I guess another $3 million.\n  In a small State such as Nevada, is the Senator surprised that $23 \nmillion was spent?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Nevada, it is a compelling \nargument for reform. I have a lot of friends who live in your State. In \nall due respect to the quality of the commercials that were run during \nthat campaign, I heard many friends of mine who live in Nevada say they \nhad enough, considering they were inundated--for how long? The campaign \nwent on for a year and a half?\n  Mr. REID. The campaign went on for a long time. The television money \nwas spent, of course, in a relatively short period of time.\n  I do not know if my colleague is aware that my opponent, John Ensign, \nand I talked on several occasions. Even though there was that much \nmoney spent on the campaign, we never campaigned against each other. \nThere were all these outside interests. We never had a chance to \ncampaign for ourselves.\n  So I would say if there is no other example given on the floor of the \nSenate regarding campaign finance reform, all you have to do is look at \nthe relatively sparsely populated State of Nevada and there is a \ncompelling reason we need to do something about the present campaign \nsystem in America.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it has only been the first day of debate \non this issue. I do note a marked shift in the strategy of our \nopponents. They are not talking so much about how the first amendment \nto the United States Constitution Bill of Rights would be violated by \nour version of the bill, the soft money prohibition. There have been a \nfew comments, but this has not been the main thrust.\n  There is a good reason for it. That is because there is not a \ncredible case that can be made that banning soft money contributions to \nthe political parties is unconstitutional. I think it is useful at this \ntime to lay out a few of the reasons why this is the case, so no one \ncan be confused by the desperate attempt that has been made to label \nany attempt at campaign finance reform, regardless of what its \nprovisions might be, as unconstitutional. It has become a mantra, a \nstandard line, but it does not hold water regarding the bill before us.\n  The first proposition is very straightforward and that is that \nCongress can prohibit corporate and labor contributions. Congress \nprohibited the contributions by corporations in 1907 in the Tillman \nAct, and then in 1947 it prohibited the same kinds of contributions by \nunions under the Taft-Hartley Act. The courts have recognized that \ncorporate treasury money can amount to an undue influence or an unfair \nadvantage. That is why in a couple of key cases the courts have so \nruled.\n  In Massachusetts, Citizen For Life v. FEC, 1984, for example, they \nstated:\n\n       Direct corporate spending on political activity raises the \n     prospect that resources amassed in the economic marketplace \n     may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the \n     political marketplace. Political ``free trade'' does not \n     necessarily require that all who participate in the \n     political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources.\n       Relative availability of funds is after all a rough \n     barometer of public support. The resources in the treasury of \n     a business corporation, however, are not an indication of \n     popular support for the corporation's political ideas. They \n     reflect instead [the court said] the economically motivated \n     decisions of investors and customers. The availability of \n     these resources may make a corporation a formidable political \n     presence, even though the power of the corporation may be no \n     reflection of the power of its ideas.\n\n  Then, after making that very clear with regard to the ability of \nrestricting direct corporate contributions, the Austin case made it \nclear and affirmed this decision, saying:\n\n       We therefore have recognized that ``the compelling \n     governmental interest in preventing corruption support[s] the \n     restriction of the influence of political war chests funneled \n     through the corporate form.''\n\n  It is clear law, indisputable law, that Congress can prohibit \ncorporate and labor direct contributions to candidates or to the \npolitical parties.\n  Furthermore, so there is no confusion because there was a lot of talk \ntoday about somehow we have to demonstrate actual corruption in each \ninstance before we can do something about it, that is not the law with \nregard to our ability to limit individual contributions. The Court has \nbeen clear that we can limit individual contributions either in the \ncase of actual corruption, the reality of corruption, or the appearance \nof corruption. This is the system that was validated in the most \nsignificant ruling of many decades in the area of campaign finance \nreform, Buckley v. Valeo, 1974. Let me put some of the language in the \nRecord from that decision that supports that. The court said:\n\n       By contrast with a limitation upon expenditures for \n     political expression, a limitation upon the amount that any \n     one person or group may contribute to a candidate or \n     political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon \n     the contributors' ability to engage in free communication. A \n     contribution serves as a general expression of support for \n     the candidate and his views, but [the court said, that it] \n     does not communicate the underlying basis for the support. \n     The quantity of communication by the contributor does not \n     increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution, since \n     the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated, symbolic \n     act of contributing.\n\n  Later in the decision the court continued:\n\n       It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose \n     to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption regarding \n     from large financial contributions--in order to find a \n     constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 \n     contribution limitation.\n\n  The Court then said:\n\n       To the extent large contributions are given to security \n     political quid pro quo's from current and potential office \n     holders, the integrity of our system of representative \n     democracy is undermined.\n\n  That had to do with the quid pro quos. And then the Court continued:\n\n       Of almost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro \n     quo arrangements is the impact of the appearance of \n     corruption stemming from public awareness of the \n     opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large \n     individual financial contributions.\n\n  The Buckley case makes it clear you can limit the individual \ncontributions. The Court said:\n\n       We find that, under the rigorous standard review \n     established by our prior decisions, the weighty interests \n     served by restricting the size of financial contributions to \n     political candidates are sufficient to justify the limited \n     effect upon First Amendment freedoms caused by the $1,000 \n     contribution ceiling.\n\n  So these are the court cases. If you do not believe my word on it \nalone, I suggest one take a look at the letter we have from 126 legal \nscholars, constitutional scholars around the country who say \nspecifically that it is entirely constitutional to ban soft money given \nto the parties.\n  These scholars wrote as a group in a letter:\n\n       We believe that such restrictions are constitutional. The \n     soft money loophole has raised the specter of corruption \n     stemming from large contributions (and those from prohibited \n     sources) that led Congress to enact the federal contribution \n     limits in the first place. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme \n     Court held that the government has a compelling interest in \n     combating the appearance and reality of corruption, an \n     interest that justifies restricting large campaign \n     contributions in Federal elections. . . . Significantly, the \n     Court upheld the $25,000 annual limit on an individual's \n     total contributions in connection with federal elections.\n\n  And so on.\n  Mr. President, 126 constitutional scholars have backed up this almost \nobvious notion we can ban the soft money given to the political \nparties.\n  I might add, since the Senator from Kentucky is fond of quoting the \nACLU as one of his allies on this issue, in fact, every living former \npresident, executive director, and legal director of the ACLU all think \nthat it is perfectly constitutional to ban soft money.\n  Finally, if you do not believe any of those folks, I hope you would \nbelieve the Senator from Washington, one of the strongest opponents of \nour bill. Senator Gorton, on this floor, in a candid moment, said:\n\n       In fact, with my own views on where the constitutional line \n     is likely to be drawn, McCain-Feingold restrictions on money \n     to political parties might well be upheld, probably would be \n     upheld, at least in part. It is possible that they would be \n     upheld in their entirety.\n\n  So even one of our most learned and effective opponents on this \nissue, Senator Gorton, has said on this floor that it is perfectly \nconstitutional to ban soft money. That is why you are not hearing much \nabout the constitutional problems in this bill, as you did last\n\n[[Page S12619]]\n\nyear. I think some of those arguments weren't too strong, but they \ncertainly were stronger.\n  This bill would pass constitutional muster quite easily. I believe \nthere is no legitimate authority to contradict that. I believe it is \nimportant to have this in the Record. Perhaps this will be returned to \nlater on, as an argument. I have noticed a strong diminution in the \nreliance on the constitutional argument. There are other arguments \nbeing made: That somehow this is a dagger to the heart of one party or \nanother; the attempt to have Senator McCain answer very specific \nquestions about comments he made in his Presidential campaign. The \nopposition seems very diffused on this point on a number of issues, but \nthe constitutional question is not being very effectively or seriously \nraised.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that is because there is no legitimate \nconstitutional argument against what we are trying to do.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time remaining is on the side of the \nproponents.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 8 minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about \nwhere the so-called constitutional scholars are on the \nconstitutionality of this measure and its other incarnations we have \nhad before us in the last few years.\n  One of the scholars cited by the proponents of this legislation, \nProfessor Robert W. Benson of Loyola Law School, wrote an article \nbefore NAFTA was enacted called, ``Free Trade as an Extremist \nIdeology.'' The article, to put it mildly, is critical of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement.\n  In it, Benson states:\n\n       Ideological extremism . . . is pushing an agenda of radical \n     risk taking in the form of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs.\n\n  He says free trade is ``a classic extremist ideology, just as, until \nrecently, Marxism and Leninism was.''\n  He says the idea of free trade fits ``two criteria that characterize \nextremist ideologies . . . [its] adherents are oblivious to cognitive \ndissonance contradicting their analyses, and (2) . . . [they] are \nwilling to plunge themselves and others into great risks in the name of \nideology.''\n  He argued that enacting NAFTA would ``erode Democratic government in \nthe United States.''\n  This is one of the so-called constitutional scholars on this lengthy \nlist being quoted.\n  He also wrote an article that purported to be about legal theory \nentitled, ``Deconstruction's Critics, the TV Scramble Effect and the \nFajita Pita Syndrome.''\n  Among academics, he is considered an expert on international law. He \nis not a constitutional law professor.\n  Many in favor of campaign finance reform and relying on Professor \nBenson's view of campaign finance reform disregarded Professor Benson's \nwarnings about the North American Free Trade Agreement, an issue within \nhis area of expertise. These Members, of course, include a number of \nthe proponents of this legislation.\n  Another one of the constitutional scholars quoted by the other side \nis Professor Daan Braveman of Syracuse University College of Law. This \noutstanding scholar wrote an article discussing the first amendment----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand the opponents' time is gone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time remaining is for the proponents.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will be happy to yield time to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since I support the amendment, wouldn't that qualify \nme?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator is a proponent of the \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am indeed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Can a Senator speak as both a proponent and opponent of \nan amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not aware of any opponents to this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I believe the Senator from Kentucky previously was \ncounted, with regard to time, as an opponent in this process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator is a proponent----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nthat our time be restored to what it was prior to the remarks of the \nSenator from Kentucky and that we have our full measure of time. I have \nno objection to his having additional time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't want to delay the vote. I will be happy to \nmake my remarks later with regard to the outstanding qualifications of \na number of the constitutional scholars cited by my friend from \nWisconsin. I look forward to going into some of their interesting \nwritings. I am happy to yield the floor, and the vote will occur at 6 \no'clock.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I certainly want the Record to note I had no objection \nto the Senator from Kentucky speaking, as long as it did not come out \nof our time. In fact, I was happy to give additional time.\n  I want to make a comment or two about what he is talking about \nbecause he is launching, apparently, an attack on people who signed the \nletter, 127 constitutional scholars. Apparently there is a problem. One \nof the men who wrote an article about NAFTA--I do not know what it has \nto do with his ability to comment on this.\n  I am surprised to hear Senator McConnell say some of this. Back when \nwe presented this letter, he said he could easily come up with 127 \nscholars on his own who would say banning soft money is \nunconstitutional. He has not done that, and it has been a long time \nsince that time, and I frankly doubt he ever will.\n  Anyone who knows anything about the law and the legal academy would \nagree that instead of picking individual people out of this list and \nattacking them personally, they would have to concede that many of the \npeople on the list are very distinguished law professors. Professor \nErwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern California Law Center, \nProfessor Jack Balkin of Yale Law School, Professor Frank Michelman of \nHarvard Law School, and Professor Norman Dorsen of NYU Law School know \nsomething about the law. In fact, they know more than just about \nanybody in this body.\n  The executive director and the legal director of the ACLU says a ban \non soft money is constitutional. Of course, the ultimate arbiter, the \nSupreme Court, said in the Buckley case that individual contributions \ncan be limited and, in the Austin case, that corporate contributions \ncan be prohibited.\n  If Senator McConnell does not believe these authorities, he should, \nagain, consult with the Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton, one of his \nstrongest supporters on the floor in opposing reform, who has \nessentially conceded that banning party soft money would likely be \nfound constitutional.\n  This notion that the Senator from Kentucky could easily come up with \nhis list of constitutional scholars which we have never seen is a ploy \nthat I, frankly, do not understand. Where is the list? Instead, he \nwants to pick apart one or two people on the list. I question that. \nThese folks gave it their best shot and indicated what everybody \nconcludes with any credibility on this subject, and that is that it is \nperfectly constitutional to ban soft money.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will now proceed to vote on the \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S12620]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Amendment No. \n2294.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to consider the conference report to accompany the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill, it be considered as having been read, and there be \n20 minutes equally divided for debate between the two managers; I \nfurther ask unanimous consent there be an additional 5 minutes under \nthe control of Senator McCain, and 30 minutes under the control of \nSenator Wellstone, with the vote occurring on adoption at 9:15 a.m. on \nFriday, October 15, with paragraph 4 of rule XII being waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     2684, having met have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 13, 1999.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the generosity of the majority \nand minority leaders for allowing us to proceed on the consideration of \nthe Senate conference report to accompany H.R. 2684.\n  I ask that the Chair advise me when 5 minutes have been utilized. I \nwant to save some of my time and be able to yield to my distinguished \ncolleague from Maryland.\n  This has been a very difficult bill, not unlike, as someone \nsuggested, riding a tilt-a-whirl at the county fair. I am glad to say \nthe ride is over. It was fun while it lasted. We are finally on solid \nground with this conference report.\n  We have a bill that meets many priorities of the Members and I think \naddresses fairly a number of concerns of the administration without \ntotally satisfying everyone.\n  First, my sincerest thanks to Senators Stevens and Byrd for helping \nus to reach an adequate allocation. Without their help, this bill would \nstill be a work in progress, and we would not be able to complete it.\n  A very special thanks once again to Senator Mikulski, who worked with \nus to find a good balance in making some very difficult funding \ndecisions. It was a pleasure as always to have her good guidance and \nsound judgment.\n  I believe she will join me in saying a special thanks to the new \nChair and ranking member in the House, Chairman Walsh, and Congressman \nMollohan, who were a tremendous pleasure to work with. We appreciate \ntheir assistance.\n  My thanks to staff on the minority side: Paul Carliner Jeannie \nSchroeder, and Sean Smith; on my side, a very special thanks to Jon \nKamarck, Julie Dammann, Carolyn Apostolou, and Cheh Kim.\n  I believe the bill before the Senate is a very good bill with funds \nallocated to the most pressing needs we face. Total spending is $72 \nbillion in budget authority and $82.6 billion in outlays. It is roughly \nthe same as the President's overall request for the VA-HUD \nsubcommittee, plus FEMA emergency funds.\n  Unlike the President's budget, the highest priority is the \nrecommendation before the Senate for VA medical care, which has \nincreased $1.7 billion above the President's request as directed by \nthis body, and it is fully paid for in the bill. We have also included \nsignificant new funds for 60,000 incremental vouchers, additional funds \nabove the President's request for public housing, capital and operating \nfunds, as well as the President's request for NSF, and an additional \n$75 million for NASA.\n  All of these funding levels have been fully offset. In addition, \nthere has been $2.5 billion in emergency FEMA funding for the victims \nof Hurricane Floyd, to whom our hearts go out.\n  As I noted, the conference agreement provides $44.3 billion for \nveterans funding, which includes a full $1.7 billion for medical care. \nThis is the largest increase ever for VA medical care--clearly the \nhighest priority of this body.\n  I point out that the vouchers we have provided do not create \nadditional housing. There was discussion on this floor that we \ndesperately need to increase the production of affordable low-income \nhousing. In many areas, such as St. Louis in my State, housing is not \navailable for the vouchers that are there. We have had to use budget \ngimmicks suggested by the administration, deferring $4.2 billion of \nsection 8 funding for fiscal year 2000 expiring section 8 contracts \nuntil fiscal year 2001. That will create an additional $8 million \nfunding requirement, or some $14 billion in BA needed in fiscal year \n2000 if we intend to renew all expiring section 8 contracts.\n  To be clear, this means we will go into next year's appropriation \ncycle with a funding shortfall of over $8 billion. We emphasized our \nconcern to the administration for their failure to work with Members on \ndealing with this funding crisis. Last year they promised to help, but \nthe only thing we got this year was a deferral of $4.2 billion. This \nyear, in discussions and negotiations, we reached agreement with Jack \nLew, the Director of OMB, who has personally promised they will work \nwith Members to address the funding shortfall in BA in the section 8 \naccount. We expect Mr. Lew and the administration to live up to that \ncommitment. Nevertheless, we cannot keep writing blank checks on an \nempty account. The outyear projections we have from OMB are for flat \nfunding, which means 1.3 million families kicked out of section 8 \nhousing.\n  To reiterate:\n  Many of us have been hearing from veterans in our state for some time \nabout their concerns with VA's budget. They have been hearing that \ntheir local VA hospital may lose numerous employees, terminate critical \nservices, increase waiting times for appointments, may even shut down \naltogether.\n\n[[Page S12621]]\n\nThe additional $1.7 billion above the President will ensure none of \nthese things happen. VA will be above to expand services and care to \nthousands of additional veterans. VA will be able to accommodate \nincreased costs associated with pharmaceuticals, prosthetics, and pay \nraises.\n  At the same time, we strongly support continued improvements and \nreforms to the VA health care system to ensure VA medical care dollars \ngo to health care for vets, not maintaining buildings and the status \nquo.\n  Other increases in VA's budget include VA research, the state \ncemetery grant program, the state nursing home construction grant \nprogram, and the Veterans Benefits Administration. These are all \ncritical programs and very high priorities.\n  EPA funding totals $7.6 billion, the same as FY99 and $383 million \nabove the President's request. Funding increase were provided for the \nstate revolving funds--which the President had proposed cutting by $550 \nmillion. We have accommodated administration concerns in such areas as \nthe Montreal Protocol.\n  We were forced to make some tough choices and eliminate or reduce \nlower priority, lower risk programs in order to accommodate higher \npriorities. The appropriation protects core EPA programs such as NPDES \npermitting, RCRA corrective action, and pesticides registration and re-\nregistration.\n  FEMA funding totals $870 million, an increase of $44 million over \nFY99. This includes an increase of $10 million for the emergency food \nand shelter grant program, $25 million for the Project Impact grant \nprogram, $5 million in start-up funds for the flood map modernization \ninitiative, and increases in critical programs such as anti-terrorism \ntraining. In addition, we have included $2.5 billion in emergency \ndisaster assistance--funding which is truly needed.\n  We have funded the Department of Housing and Urban Development at \n$27.16 billion, which is some $2.5 billion over last year's level and \nwhich will allow us to put HUD on some very solid ground. Because of \nthe priority needs for our veterans, we had to make some tough choices, \nand in HUD's case, that meant not funding any of HUD's 19 new programs \nand initiatives. Instead, we have focused on funding HUD's core \nprograms, such as public housing, CDBG, HOME, Drug Elimination grants, \nand Homeless Assistance and Section 202 Housing for the elderly. These \nare the key housing and community development programs that make a \ncritical difference in people's lives, and they are programs with a \nproven track record.\n  Also, we funded 60,000 new incremental vouchers. I continue to have \nmajor concerns about this program--vouchers do not produce or assist in \nthe financing of any new housing and we desperately need to increase \nthe production of affordable, low-income housing. In addition, in many \nareas of the country, including areas in my state such as St. Louis, \nvouchers are very difficult to use--the housing which is affordable \nunder the voucher program is just not available. In addition, against \nmy better judgment but because we do not have the funds in our \nallocation to meet the funding needs of our key programs, we have used \nthe Administration's budget gimmick of deferring $4.2 billion of \nsection 8 funding for fiscal year 2000 expiring contracts until fiscal \nyear 2001. This will create an additional $8 billion funding \nrequirement for a total of some $14 billion in BA needed in fiscal year \n2001 if we intend to renew all expiring section 8 contracts--to be \nclear, this means we already have a funding shortfall in the VA/HUD \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 of over $8 billion.\n  I want to emphasize my concern with the Administration's past failure \nto address this section 8 funding crisis; the Administration has \ncreated this hole and up to now has not acted responsibly in meeting \nthese funding requirements. And I have gone to the top. In this year's \nnegotiations on the VA/HUD appropriations bill, Jack Lew, the Director \nof OMB, personally has promised to address the funding shortfall in the \nsection 8 account. I expect Mr. Lew and the Administration to live up \nto this commitment. Nevertheless, this is the same song and dance we \nheard from HUD last year when the Secretary of HUD personally promised \nto address section 8 costs and them responded by pushing much of the \nsection 8 costs into FY 2001 and the outyears. Writing blank checks on \nan empty account is unacceptable, and under the Administration's \noutyear budget projections, section 8 contract renewal funding will be \nflat funded at $11.5 billion which means over the next 10 years some \n1.3 million section families will lose their housing. This is wrong and \nI do not plan to sit by and let it happen.\n  I also want to emphasize several issues of particular importance to \nme. First, I introduced the ``Save My Home Act of 1999'' earlier this \nyear to require HUD to renew expiring below-market section 8 contracts \nat a market rate for elderly and disabled projects and in circumstances \nwhere the housing is located in a low vacancy area, such as a rural \narea or high cost area.\n  The bill also provides new authority for section 8 enhanced or \n``sticky'' vouchers to ensure that families in housing for which owners \ndo not renew their section 8 contracts will be able to continue to live \nin their homes with the Federal government picking up the additional \nrental costs of the units. It is important to preserve this housing, \nand these provisions are included in the VA/HUD appropriations bill as \nwell as other important elderly housing reforms.\n  With respect to NASA, the bill funds the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration at $75 million above the President's request of \n$13.6 billion, including needed funding for the International Space \nStation and the Shuttle. I know NASA funding was a huge concern for \nmany Members because of the House reductions of some $900 million.\n  For the National Science Foundation, the bill includes over $3.9 \nbillion, which approximates the Administration's request. NSF's \nallocation is over $240 million more than last year's enacted level--\nabout a 6 percent increase. This increase in funds continues our \ncommitment and support for the Nation's basic research and education \nneeds.\n  Some of the major highlights of this allocation include $126 million \nin additional funds for computer and information science and \nengineering activities; $60 million for the important Plant Genome \nProgram; and $50 million for the Administration's ``Biocomplexity'' \ninitiative.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Bond, for \nworking with me and producing what I think is an outstanding conference \nthat we bring to our colleagues. We could not have done this without \nthe help of Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, who got the committee \nover some very significant fiscal humps, and also our House colleagues \nwho operated in a spirit of bicameral cooperation. I believe also the \nWhite House played a very constructive role in suggesting offsets to \nmeet key national priorities. We think we come with a very good bill, \nand we are going to urge all of our colleagues to support it.\n  We got started on this bill in the spring. We got started a little \nbit late because of impeachment. Everyone wondered how would the Senate \nproceed after we had been through such a wrenching constitutional \ncrisis. I can say in the VA-HUD subcommittee we did just fine. We moved \nwith a quick step. I believe we probed the fiscal situations of the \nagencies as to what their needs were and, at the same time, how could \nwe meet national priorities within the discipline of the thinking of a \nbalanced budget.\n  I believe we do that. I believe today what we present takes care of \nnational interests and national needs. I am confident this bill will be \nsigned by the President. I am pleased what we were able to do it to \nmeet our obligations to veterans. Promises made are promises kept to \nthe people who saved Western civilization. This conference report also \nserves core constituencies, invests in our neighborhoods and \ncommunities, and creates opportunities for people and advances in \nscience and technology. I believe that is an outstanding \naccomplishment.\n  I am very pleased we were able to provide a significant increase in \nfunding for veterans' health care, $1.7 billion over the President's \nrequest, and not only providing health care as we know it but breaking \nnew ground in creating primary care opportunities out in communities so \nthat our rural\n\n[[Page S12622]]\n\nveterans do not have to drive hundreds of miles for their care. We have \nalso increased the funding for VA medical research, with special \nemphasis on geriatric care, orthopedic research, and prostate cancer. \nAt the same time, we are looking at new and innovative ways to begin to \nfund the compelling need for long-term care, increasing the funds from \nwhat we call the State Veterans Homes, Federal and State partnerships.\n  We are also taking care of America's working families in this bill. \nWe fund the housing programs that help lives. We are going to have $11 \nbillion in all section 8 housing vouchers, including 60,000 additional \nvouchers to enable people to have affordable, decent, and safe housing. \nWe also maintained core HUD programs, we increased housing for the \nelderly by $50 million over the President's request, and increased \nfunding so that more disabled Americans can find housing.\n  We didn't forget about the homeless. This will now be funded at over \n$1 billion. We wanted to make sure local communities have a major say \nin what is going to happen to them, and that of course occurs in the \ncommunity development block grant which will be funded at $4.8 billion.\n  Whether it is improving the funding for community development \nfinancial institutions or empowerment zones, we were able to create \nmore opportunity and yet meet taxpayer obligations.\n  In addition to that, we also wanted to look at where we were heading \nwith our science and our technology. I am pleased our bill fully funds \nNASA and restores the severe cuts made to NASA in the House bill. This \nwill save 2,000 jobs at Goddard Flight Center in Maryland, as well as \nthe Wallops Flight Facility on the Eastern Shore. This legislation will \nfund NASA $13.6 billion. This means we will be looking at Earth \nscience, we will be looking at how to fund the new generation of space \ntelescopes, and at the same time we are going to upgrade the safety of \nthe space shuttle. That means we are going to invest $25 million in the \nupgrading of the space shuttle while we maintain our commitment to the \ninternational space station.\n  We also fully fund the National Science Foundation, where I believe \nthere will be new intellectual breakthroughs, particularly in \ninformation technology research. We also fund the National Service at \n$433 million, which is close to the President's request. This means \nthat 100,000 members and participants across the country right now are \nengaging in community service programs at AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve \nAmerica. We believe that every right has a responsibility, every \nopportunity has an obligation, and this is what National Service does; \nit rekindles the habits of the heart.\n  With regard to our EPA bill, this provides $7.5 billion in funding. \nThis is $384 million over the President's request. At the same time, we \ndeclare an emergency and do $2.5 billion in emergency disaster \nassistance for all of the damage created by Hurricane Floyd. It is not \ntrue when they say: A billion here, a billion there, and that is the \nway Congress works.\n  We focused on how we can meet compelling human need; how, in the last \nappropriations of this century, we wanted to make sure we had veterans' \nhealth care for the people who, five different times, answered the call \nof duty to be able to uphold our national interests around the world; \nto make work worth it by making sure if you are out there and you are \nworking, perhaps at the minimum wage, we are willing to subsidize \nhousing and therefore subsidize work so we could create a true, real \nsafety net for those affected by welfare reform.\n\n  We also know America's genius is in its science and technology. As \nthis century closes, we know we not only planted our flag at Iwo Jima \nand honor our veterans who did that, but we planted our flag on the \nMoon, which shows the United States of America continues to be a nation \nof pioneers. We do not seek to conquer other nations. We seek to win \nwars against cancer. We seek to win the battles of the mind in which we \ncreate new ideas, where we win Nobel prizes and then go on to win new \nmarkets.\n  This is what the VA-HUD bill is all about. I am very pleased to bring \nthis to the Democrats. I thank my colleague, Senator Bond, for all of \nhis courtesies and collegiality.\n  I thank John Kamarck, Carolyn Apostolou, Cheh Kim, and Julie Dammann \non his staff for working so close with my staff. I want to especially \nthank Paul Carliner, Sean Smith, and Jeannie Schroeder, and most of all \nI thank the Senate for all its cooperation in moving our bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague, Senator McCain--I am actually \ngoing to take about 15 minutes at the most--if he wants to precede me?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Then we go to Senator Wellstone for 30 \nminutes. But the Senator from Missouri reserved 5 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The unanimous consent agreement said I had 5 minutes. I \nyielded those 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has yielded his 5 \nminutes.\n  Does the Senator from Missouri yield the remainder of his time?\n  The Chair understands the Senator from Missouri had 10 minutes and he \nspecifically asked to be notified when 5 minutes were up.\n  Mr. BOND. Do I understand the Senator from Arizona is not going to \ntake 5 minutes? He yielded that time?\n  He is not speaking.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and turn to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If my colleague from Minnesota will wait 1 minute, can \nI seek clarification from the Senator from Arizona on one point? The \nSenator from Arizona, did he yield his time or did he just yield his \nplace?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yielded my time. I do not wish to speak on the pending \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. BOND. As do I.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Under the unanimous consent agreement, I have up to 30 \nminutes. I do not think I will need to take that time. I want to \ncomment on the conference report. I thank the Senator from Missouri and \nthe Senator from Maryland for their work. I am going to vote for this \nconference report.\n  Given the constraints they have been working under, and the framework \nthey had to work within, they did a yeoman job, and I thank them.\n  I want to make three comments and I think I can be brief. First of \nall, on the veterans' health care budget, it is true; we went up by \n$1.7 billion above the President's request. But if you look at the last \n3 or 4 or 5 years of flatline budgets, which means really the veterans' \nhealth care budget was not even keeping up with inflation, we are \nessentially still not very far ahead. I believe the veterans \norganizations, AMVETS and VFW and Paralyzed Veterans of America and \nDisabled American Veterans, were right in their independent budget, \nwhich called for us to bump up the President's request, which was \ninadequate, by $3 billion.\n  We had a sense-of-the-Senate vote on that, where every single Senator \nvoted for that recommendation. I think we are going to have to do much \nbetter next year. I think this was progress. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir fine work, but it is my honest to goodness judgment this is \nunderfunded; there are some real gaps. In particular, we have the \nchallenge of a veterans community that is growing older. How are we \ngoing to provide the care for this community? We still have the \nchallenge of too long a waiting list and too long a distance for people \nto drive.\n  I believe we had an amendment on the floor, with Senator Johnson, to \ngo up $3 billion. I wish we had because I think there are still going \nto be some unmet needs. That was my first point.\n  The second point is one about which I feel very strongly. Senator \nMikulski, in particular, has been very helpful. But it is the same \nmoving picture shown over and over again, this time just on a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment.\n  For about 5 or 6 years, I have been talking about the importance of \ngetting some compensation for atomic\n\n[[Page S12623]]\n\nveterans. These are veterans who went to States such as Utah and \nNevada. They went to ground zero. Our Government asked them to be \nthere. Our Government never told them they were in harm's way, didn't \ngive them any protective gear. It is horrible what has happened to \nthem. The incidence of cancer is quite understandable. The incidence of \nillness and disease, not just for these veterans but for their children \nand even their grandchildren, is frightening. It is scary. You cannot \ndo dose reconstruction. There is no way they can prove their case.\n  I cannot understand why the Senate and the House of Representatives \ncannot find it in its collective heart a way to provide some \ncompensation for these veterans just as we did with Agent Orange with \nthe Vietnam vets. We were never able to prove one way or the other the \nconnection between Agent Orange and lung cancer. We said we are going \nto make this a presumptive disease. We are going to argue the \npresumption is this was caused by Agent Orange.\n  I have had amendments passed and then they have been taken out in \nconference committee. This time I wanted to get a good vote on a sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment because I could not legislate on this \nappropriations bill. I got 75 or 76 votes which said, at the very \nminimum, we would include three diseases: lung cancer, colon cancer, \nand tumors of the brain and the central nervous system.\n\n  There are several thousand of these veterans. They are older. They \nfeel so betrayed. This is the classic example of our Government having \nlied to these veterans. I cannot understand, for the life of me, why a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that is all it was--should have been \ntaken out in conference committee.\n  I thank my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, for their support. \nBut I want to say on the floor of the Senate, next year--I think I can \nget the support from Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond and I hope \neverybody here--we will be ready. One way or another, we are going to \nget this through. It has been 6 or 7 years. I do not think we can say \nto these veterans we do not have the resources; we cannot give you any \ncompensation. If we say that, we are just going to say: We don't care \nwhat happened to you. We don't care what happened to you. We don't care \nwhat happened to you. It has been going on year after year after year. \nI wanted to express my outrage that we cannot do better.\n  I will be back next year. Hopefully, we can get better support and \nget this done in authorization and appropriations. It is a matter of \njustice. It has been a shameful history. What we have done to these \npeople is a shameful chapter in the history of our country. I hope we \nin the Senate and the House can find it in our hearts to provide them \nwith compensation. It will mean a great deal to these veterans and \ntheir families.\n  Finally, I thank both colleagues. I do not think they could do any \nbetter with these appropriations bills, given the context. But the \nother issue, because this is VA housing, is, for example, the vouchers \nin a State such as Minnesota. It does not help at all. We have no \nvacancies. The fact is, with the limits on what a family would be \neligible for, right now the housing is so high that what housing is \nthere is above what the voucher plan will cover. It just doesn't help \nus at all.\n  I thank my colleagues because they are trying to do everything they \ncan, everything humanly possible. But I am predicting there are going \nto be a lot of articles over this next year about housing prices. I \nhope they will be front page stories because for so many families, they \njust cannot find any affordable housing. It is just not there. The \nvouchers don't help because it is not there.\n  I will give one example and then finish up. Sheila and I do a lot of \nwork with women who have been victims of family violence, domestic \nviolence. They go to shelters. That is the first courageous step, to \nget out of that home. It is a dangerous place.\n  Then they are in the shelters. Then where else do they go? There is \nno affordable housing. In fact, a lot of the battered women's shelters \ncannot even take some of the battered women because other women and \nchildren who cannot afford housing and are homeless actually call \nshelters and say they have been battered because they are looking for \nshelter.\n  I understand the importance of the vouchers, but in many of the \ncommunities in Minnesota and around the country, it is not going to \nhelp at all. There is no housing. It is not available, so the voucher \ndoes not help. Housing has become so high that the voucher, which \ncovers the difference between the fair market value and 25 or 30 \npercent of their monthly income, will not do any good because the fair \nmarket value is above the value of what the vouchers will cover.\n  We have a real crisis. Both my colleagues know this. It is \nunbelievable how expensive housing is. The lack of affordable housing \nfor families in our country is a huge issue and not just in the cities, \nbut also in the suburbs and in rural areas as well.\n  Next year, we are going to get ourselves out of the straitjacket and \nthe framework and make more of the investment.\n  Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski did a yeoman job. They did \nexceptional work. I thank them. I wanted to lay out these three points. \nI yield the floor.\n\n\n                     environmental data management\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, Chairman Bond, in the Senate report on \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, \nand Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000, the committee \ninstructs EPA to ``establish procedures to engage the public in the \ndevelopment, maintenance and modification of information products it \noffers to the public.'' It is my understanding that the committee does \nnot necessarily intend for this process to consume the time or \nresources that would be involved in a rule-making.\n  I also understand that, in general, the committee intends that EPA's \nobligation to honor the public's right to know and to disseminate to \nthe public information about issues affecting human health and the \nenvironment should be balanced against the expectations discussed in \nthe ``Environmental Data Management'' section of the report.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct in his understanding.\n\n\n    clarification on state funding by epa for the regional haze rule\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the senior Senator \nfrom Missouri, who is also the chairman of the Departments of Veterans \nAffairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies \nSubcommittee responsible for the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill, \nin a colloquy. This colloquy is to clarify the committee's position on \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s funding in fiscal year 2000 \nto implement the regional haze rule. I have concerns about how the EPA \nmay distribute fiscal year 2000 funding provided for this rule.\n  Mr. BOND. I am pleased to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana, who also serves on the Departments \nof Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent \nAgencies Appropriation Subcommittee. Clarifying the committee's \nposition on how EPA should distribute fiscal year 2000 funding to the \nstates to implement the new regional haze rule is an important matter \nto me.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand that in the conference report to the fiscal \nyear 2000 Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and independent agencies appropriations bill, $5,000,000 is \nprovided to help the states and recognized regional partnerships \nimplement the new EPA regional haze rule. Of this total, an unspecified \namount will be provided directly to the Western Regional Air \nPartnership (WRAP) and the remaining portion will be allocated among \nthe states and other recognized regional partnerships. My concern is, \ngiven that 10 states are part of the WRAP, EPA may distribute a major \nshare of the $5,000,000 to the WRAP and not provide any funding to \nthese 10 states since they are involved with the WRAP. In essence, EPA \ncould assume that funding for the WRAP constituted funding for these 10 \nstates. This is not what I believe this report language intended. Thus, \nI believe that we need to ensure that EPA understands that funding for \nthe states includes those states working in the WRAP.\n\n[[Page S12624]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I join with my friend from the State of Montana in \nsupporting this expectation that the states within the WRAP should not \nbe precluded from any distribution of the $5,000,000 provided in this \nfiscal year 2000 appropriation bill. The State of Idaho has new \nrequirements and responsibilities based upon this new regional haze \nrule. These new requirements require Idaho to develop new emissions \ndata and programs which the state doesn't have now. So the State of \nIdaho must develop new internal capabilities to meet the new regulatory \ndeadlines. The WRAP can assist the states in developing some of these \ncapabilities, however, the states have their own unique roles and \nresponsibilities beyond those of the WRAP. Thus, all states need \nadditional funding beyond that provided to the WRAP.\n  Mr. BURNS. The purpose for this conference report language to \ndirectly fund the WRAP was based upon Congressional concerns with \ndelayed funding in fiscal year 1999 to the WRAP. As of the end of \nfiscal year 1999, no funds from EPA had been allocated to the WRAP as \nhad been appropriated. This delay in funding has jeopardized the \nprogram and progress of the WRAP to assist the states in addressing new \nregulatory requirements and deadlines of the regional haze rule. This \ndelay also seems a bit ironic since EPA encourages states to form \nregional partnerships to implement this new law. Since the WRAP is \nfaced with an October 2000 deadline to develop target levels for sulfur \ndioxide emissions and a contingent Market Trading Program for this new \nrule, direct funding in fiscal year 2000 is the most effective way to \nensure the states meet this new rule.\n  Mr. BOND. Funds are to be allocated to the WRAP and all states in an \nequitable manner.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chairman for this clarification. I trust that \nthe Environmental Protection Agency will follow these guidelines in \ndeveloping the distribution of the $5,000,000 to the states in fiscal \nyear 2000.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chairman also for this clarification.\n\n\n                              section 425\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Chairman Bond, I understand that section 425 of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \nIndependent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 is not intended to impede \nfederal grantees or contractors from implementing responsibilities \npermitted under grant agreements.\n  OMB Circular A-122, Cost Principles of Non-Profit Organizations, \nmakes clear that federal funds cannot be used to lobby Congress or \ninitiate litigation against the U.S. government unless specifically \nauthorized by statute to do so. Similar language exists in other cost \nprinciples, as well as Federal Acquisition Regulations affecting \ncontractors. Section 425 is intended to be consistent with these \nprohibitions.\n  When an organization endorses the terms and conditions of a grant or \ncontract, that organization also certifies its compliance with the \nlobbying and litigation prohibitions in the cost principles. Section \n425 makes clear that the signatory agreeing to the grant, contract, or \nother award is to be that of a chief executive officer (CEO) and will \nserve as meeting the requirements of section 425. Once a CEO (or his or \nher delegate) signs the grant, contract or other award, the terms and \nconditions become binding when an audit is conducted to verify that no \nfunds have been used to lobby Congress or initiate litigation against \nthe U.S. government unless specifically authorized otherwise.\n  Additionally, it is my understanding that the language in section 425 \nprohibiting the use of federal funds awarded to grantees and \ncontractors from being used for lobbying and litigating on adjudicatory \nmatters is consistent with current rules that restrict the use of these \nfunds for such purposes. This section is not intended to supercede any \nstatute that specifically authorizes the use of federal funds to \ncompensate parties for legal expenses such as the Equal Access to \nJustice law that allows small businesses and others that sue federal \nagencies for violating the law to recover their legal expenses when the \nagency's action is judged to be unfounded.\n  Section 425 also does not change current practices where federal \ngrantees may be representing low-income or disadvantaged tenants or \nother individuals, such as veterans, in adjudicatory proceedings. For \nexample, under the Housing Counseling program, HUD reimburses federal \ngrantees for representing tenants. This is something that Congress \nstrongly supports and section 425 is not intended to limit or restrict \nsuch programs.\n  Finally, section 425 is not intended to add new restrictions on \nmembership fees or contributions that an individual whose sole income \ncomes from federal benefits appropriated under this bill gives to \norganizations that may use a portion of the fee or contribution for \nlobbying, representing individuals in adjudicatory proceedings, or \nlitigating. For example, the membership fee that a veteran, who has no \nother source of income other than federal support through this bill, \ngives to a veterans service organization should not restrict the VSO \nfrom representing the veteran in a manner that is any different than \ncurrent rules.\n  Let me restate that nothing in section 425 precludes affected \nentities from enforcing rights under federal law, including, but not \nnecessarily limited to the Administrative Procedure Act and the \nConstitution of the United States. Its intent is limited to ensuring \nthat current grant and contract prohibitions are followed, not to \nimpede participation in administrative actions.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct in his understanding of section 425.\n\n\n                        climate change language\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Fiscal Year 2000 VA/HUD Conference \nReport (106-161) contains bill language regarding implementation of the \nKyoto Protocol. This bill language is identical to bill language \nincluded in the Fiscal Year 1999 VA/HUD Conference Report (105-769). I \nwould like to ask the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nVA/HUD Subcommittee two questions to clarify their understanding of \nthis provision.\n  I note that last year, the conferees carefully crafted bill and \nreport language that clearly addressed the concern that the \nAdministration does not implement the Kyoto Protocol through domestic \nregulatory action before the Senate gave its advice and consent to the \nProtocol. At the same time, the conferees clarified that they did not \nintend to jeopardize ongoing, voluntary programs. These voluntary \nprograms have numerous benefits and are consistent with our treaty \ncommitments under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nratified by the U.S. in 1992.\n  In the Fiscal Year 2000 VA/HUD Appropriations bill (S. 1596), the \nSenate included bill and report language that remains consistent with \nlast year's bill and report language. By doing so, the Senate believes \nthat this language provides the necessary consistency and prohibits \nonly funding for proposing or issuing federal regulatory action called \nfor solely to implement the Kyoto Protocol. These programs have long \nhad the support within both the public and private sectors, and thus it \nmakes both economic and environmental sense that we take this course.\n  It is, therefore, my understanding that, like last year, the \nprovision in question is not intended to restrict ongoing, voluntary \nprograms or activities that, in their entirety, help to improve air \nquality standards, increase energy efficiency, develop cutting-edge \ntechnologies, and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Is my \nunderstanding correct?\n  As you also know, the Senate has clearly expressed its bipartisan \nview regarding the Kyoto Protocol in S. Res. 98, adopted unanimously by \nthe Senate on July 25, 1997. That resolution calls on the \nAdministration to achieve commitments from developing countries, \nespecially the largest emitters, as well as protect U.S. economic \ninterests by emphasizing market-based mechanisms and the use of energy \nefficient technologies. Is my understanding correct that this provision \nwould not prohibit the Administration from working to achieve S. Res. \n98?\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \nhis questions. Your understanding is correct. The provision is not \nintended to restrict ongoing, voluntary programs and initiatives such \nas you have described or to limit efforts to meet the conditions of S. \nRes. 98. Rather, it is intended to prevent the Administration\n\n[[Page S12625]]\n\nfrom proposing or issuing administrative rules, regulations, decrees, \nor orders for the sole purpose of implementation of the Kyoto Protocol \nprior to its consideration by the Senate.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator's understanding is correct. The language is \nnot intended to prohibit the United States from supporting ongoing, \nvoluntary programs or activities that are consistent with our treaty \ncommitments under the Framework Convention on Climate Change ratified \nin 1992, have had broad bipartisan support in both the public and \nprivate sectors, and are consistent with the objectives of S. Res. 98.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent \nAgencies for his leadership in steering this bill and its many, diverse \nprovisions successfully through the Senate and conference.\n  One item is noteworthy both for its importance and its ready \nacceptance on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses. This is the \nlanguage prohibiting EPA from spending funds to implement the Kyoto \nProtocol on global climate change, prior to ratification and Senate \nconsent. The bill language on this subject is the same as last year's \nreiterating a strong congressional position.\n  Also important is this year's Senate report language requiring \ngreater accountability in the Administration's climate change proposals \nand initiatives. This language renews and reiterates directives in the \nmanagers' statement in last year's conference report. It also expresses \ndisappointment in the late filing, earlier this year, of agency reports \nexplaining the administration's programs, objectives, and performance \nmeasures.\n  I would ask the Chairman if it is fair to say the committee's intent \nis to put the administration on notice that we fully expect such \nreports to be included, on a timely basis, as part of the President's \nfiscal year 2001 budget submission next year?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator's understanding is correct. The clear intent of \nthis year's Senate report is to carry last year's directives forward \nfor another year. If Congress, and the authorizing and appropriations \ncommittees, in particular, are to make a full and fair assessment of \nthe Administration's programs and proposals, then submission of agency \nclimate change reports with the President's FY 2001 budget is both \nnecessary and expected.\n\n\n                       EDI Special Purpose Grants\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. President, regrettably, the FY2000 conference report contains a \ntypographical error that was made during the final drafting of this \nconference report. Contrary to the intent of the managers and \nconferees, a $1,000,000 earmark for the New Jersey Community \nDevelopment Corporation's Transportation Opportunity Center and a \n$750,000 earmark for South Dakota State University's performing arts \ncenter were accidently deleted from the list of EDI Special Purpose \nGrants due to a computer malfunction.\n  Unfortunately, we are not able to amend this conference report at \nthis point, but I wanted to ask the distinguished chairman, Senator \nBond, if he will work with me, Senator Byrd, and Senator Stevens to \nensure that these typographical errors are corrected in another \nappropriations bill before this session of Congress ends?\n  Mr. BOND. Absolutely. First, I totally agree with distinguished \nranking member of the VA-HUD subcommittee's account of how this \ntypographical error transpired. Second, I agree that this error is \ntypographical in nature and contrary to the intent of the conferees. \nFinally, I will work with Senators Mikulski, Byrd, and Stevens to \nensure that this typographical error will be corrected in another \nappropriations measure before this session of Congress ends.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the distinguished Chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his \ncomments on the lack of available housing. We have been talking about \nthe lack of available housing. Over the years prior to the time my \nranking member and I were leading this committee, we stopped issuing \nlong-term, 15-year section 8 vouchers. Those long-term vouchers were \nsufficient to generate new housing. The 1-year vouchers we now issue \ngenerally under the section 8 program do not create any new housing.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, half the vouchers issued in St. \nLouis County have already been used. We have programs such as the HOME \nprogram, the CDBG program, the section 202 elderly, the section 811, \ndisabled, the hop-up program and HOPE VI programs which do provide \nhousing.\n  We also provided additional assistance to maintain the public housing \nstock that is in danger of falling into disuse and becoming HOPE VI \nhousing. That having been said, part of our discussions with the \nadministration and with the authorizing committee will be the need to \nlook at how we are going to assure there is adequate housing stock. \nThis is a question not just in the appropriations process where we are \nputting in money where we can to create new housing; it is something we \nhave to work on with the Finance Committee to make sure low-income \nhousing credits exist.\n  This is a problem that simply adding some incremental section 8 \nvouchers is not going to solve; that and the budget authority problem \nfor section 8 we will have to deal with next year.\n  The Senator also laid out a good argument for authorizing the \ncommittee to consider expanding veterans' benefits and programs. Again, \nwe are happy to work with the authorizing committee when it gets beyond \nthe appropriations measures and attempts to improve the programs in \naddition to just funding them.\n  Again, my very special thanks to the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland whose guidance, and not just assistance, but guidance and good \nhumor, made this ride on the tilt-a-whirl an enjoyable one, even though \nsomewhat too exciting at times. I thank her. Her help and her \npersuasion, and that of the administration, helped us achieve passage \nof this bill.\n  I reiterate my thanks particularly to Paul Carliner on that side and \nthe great John Kamarck on our side, as well as the other staffers.\n  I yield the floor and yield back my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, thank Senator Bond and his \nstaff, as well as my own. At times, the atmosphere in this institution \ncan be quite prickly and quite partisan. If only we would focus on the \nnational interests the way we have in this bill. Through good will, \ngood offsets, and focusing on national priorities we were able to move \nthis legislation through.\n  I believe Senator Bond is a leader. This legislation would not have \nmoved forward had it not been for his willingness to engage in a dialog \nwith the White House on what their priorities were, insisting, of \ncourse, on the Senate's prerogatives.\n  Again, I thank him, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/14/senate-section/article/S12625-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

WILLIAM CROTTY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to express my \nregret at the loss of Ambassador E. William Crotty, U.S. Ambassador to \nBarbados. Bill assumed his position as ambassador in November 1998, so \nhe had only begun his fine work representing the United States in \nBarbados and six other eastern Caribbean island nations. I am \nconfident, however, that his contributions in service to his country \nwould have continued and multiplied.\n\n[[Page S12626]]\n\n  I had the great fortune of knowing Bill over the years, and I saw \nfirsthand his deep affection for his family and friends, and his fine \nwork for his community, his party and his country. I am very sorry he \nwill no longer be with us, and I send my condolences to his wife, \nValerie, seven children and 14 grandchildren.\n  Bill Crotty was an American success story. He was born in a small \ntown during the Great Depression to a loving family. This set of \nexperiences instilled in him a work ethic and a love of family and \ncommunity that guided his life. Bill graduated from college and law \nschool, succeeded in the business world and spent years giving back to \nhis community and country.\n  I would like to take a moment to cite some examples of Bill Crotty's \nwork in his community that demonstrate the value of his contributions. \nHe was chair of the Capital Fund Drive for Bethune-Cookman College. He \nwas a member of the Board of Counselors of Bethune-Cookman College. He \nwas chair of the membership drive for the Volusia County Society for \nMentally Retarded Children. He was a member of the Board of Directors \nof the United Fund of Volusia County and of the Richard Moore Community \nCenter, Inc. He was a charter member of W.O.R.C., an organization \ndedicated to the rehabilitation of the disabled.\n  I could cite more examples, but these help provide a flavor of the \nkind of person Bill Crotty was. I feel privileged to have known him \nover the years. As a husband, father and grandfather, as a friend and \nas a public servant, Bill Crotty will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to offer a tribute to a great \nFloridian and a great American: Mr. E. William ``Bill'' Crotty of \nFlorida, the United States Ambassador to Barbados and the Eastern \nCaribbean.\n  Bill Crotty died Sunday, October 10, 1999, at Shands Teaching \nHospital in Gainesville, Florida. Funeral mass and burial will take \nplace today in Bill's hometown of Daytona Beach, Florida.\n  Among Bill Crotty's many friends in this world, some of his closest \nfriends are members of this body. On behalf of them and the United \nStates Senate, we offer our heart-felt sympathy to Bill's wife, \nValerie, and to his large and loving family.\n  During his rich and full life, Bill Crotty was many things: a five-\nsport athlete, lawyer, proud parent of seven children, successful \nbusinessman, Irish story-teller and political and civic activist. Above \nall, Bill Crotty was an ambassador. His smile, his laugh, his easy \nmanner and his sense of humor were lifelong gifts to the countless \nindividuals he encountered during his 68 years on this earth.\n  Bill Crotty was an ambassador for his alma mater--Dartmouth College \nin his native New England. He was an ambassador for his adopted home of \nDaytona Beach, and its Bethune-Cookman College and International \nSpeedway. The local Chamber of Commerce declared him Citizen of the \nYear in 1992.\n  Late in life, Bill Crotty was officially certified as an ambassador. \nLast year, after Senate confirmation, he reported to our embassy in \nBarbados. He and Valerie have done an outstanding job representing the \npeople of the United States in this important neighboring region. One \nof their efforts has been to help restore the historic home in Barbados \nwhere young George Washington once lived with his older brother.\n  Like me, Bill Crotty was born during the Great Depression. \nDemographers note that America's birth rate declined during the \nDepression, prompting some social commentators to remark that the \nparents of those born during this troubled era were passionate or crazy \nor both.\n  Bill was born with few material possessions. His strong family, his \nsharp mind, and agile body propelled him to top educational \ninstitutions and success in life.\n  Most importantly, Bill Crotty was my friend. I fondly recall repeat \nvisits to his home in Daytona Beach, and his tradition of preparing \nbountiful breakfasts to start the day. In addition to his cooking \nskills, Bill was rightfully proud of his agility on the tennis court.\n  Mr. President, we mourn the loss of our friend, Ambassador Crotty, \nwhile recognizing and celebrating his many achievements in Daytona \nBeach, in Florida, in America, and throughout our hemisphere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/14/senate-section/article/S12626-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12626-S12628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 1999\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I attend dinners and events to \ncelebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, I have been impressed with the \nenergy that the Latino people are adding to our nation. They are having \nan impact in the work place, the market place, in politics and in our \nculture. Hispanics will surpass blacks as our nation's largest minority \nby the year 2005.\n  For my colleagues who do not understand my own link to the Hispanic \npeople, I would like to remind you, I grew up in an immigrant \nhousehold. My father spoke and wrote Italian. He was fluent in Spanish \nand English, but did not write English. His customers and employees \nwere Hispanics, mainly in the Albuquerque area. He spoke Spanish at \nhome and at work.\n  In the downtown area of Albuquerque, where I grew up, my Hispanic \nfriends spent hours at our family home, and I spent hours in their \nhomes. Personally I understand more Spanish than I speak, despite all \nthe credit I get for being Spanish-speaking. My wife and I are \nenchanted by the Spanish masses in New Mexico. The guitars and singing \nadd a beautiful and clearly Hispanic dimension to a worship service.\n  In my twenty-six years as a Senator from New Mexico, I have only \ngrown in my appreciation for the Spanish influence in my home state. \nAlthough New Mexico is surpassed in absolute numbers of Hispanics by \nstates like California, Texas, Illinois, New York, and Florida, no \nother state has a higher percentage of Hispanic people than New Mexico. \nForty percent, or about 680,000 New Mexicans are of Hispanic origin.\n  Because of our unique history, Hispanics in New Mexico are \ninfluential in all areas of life. There are well educated Hispanics in \nour national laboratories, our universities, in the legal and medical \nprofessions, and in virtually every business, including ranching and \nfarming. Spanish architecture and culture add a significant depth to \nlife in New Mexico.\n  It is clear to me that Hispanics in every state, not just New Mexico, \nwant to be part of the American mainstream. They want to get ahead and \nsucceed. Hispanics want to own businesses and buy their own homes, and \nthey want their children to get a good education. Recent national \nsurveys confirm that Hispanics want what most Americans want. They want \nthe American Dream. They want to earn good money, buy their own homes, \ndrive nice cars, send their children to safe schools, provide for a \ncollege education for their children, and invest in the future.\n  The great majority of Hispanics are working class Americans who work \nhard. For most Hispanics, the American dream is a reality or \napproaching reality. About one in four Hispanics remains in poverty, \ntwice the national poverty rate. Recent studies show slight declines in \nthe Latino poverty rates. This is good news, but it could be better, as \nI will discuss soon.\n  Latinos are forming their own businesses at the highest rates in the \nnation. The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) reports \nthat the 1.4 million Latino businesses in 1997 represent a 232 percent \nincrease over 1987.\n  Two years later, in 1999, there are more than 1.5 million Latino \nbusinesses in the United States, with projections for reaching 3 \nmillion businesses by the year 2010. Hispanics were a major force in \nthe California economic recovery, where it is now estimated that \n400,000 Latino businesses are established and growing. The most common \nname of home buyers in Los Angeles is Garcia, followed by Gonzales, \nRodriguez, Hernandez, Lopez, and more Spanish names. Los Angeles has 6 \nmillion Latinos, more than the total population of most states.\n  In 1997, national Hispanic business receipts were estimated at $184 \nbillion or 417 percent higher than 1987, and employment in these \nbusinesses was up 464 percent over 1987.\n  The first Hispanic business in America exceeded one billion dollars \nin annual revenues this year. This important milestone was accomplished \nby MasTec Inc of Miami, a large construction firm headed by Jorge Mas \nJr. whose father was a Cuban exile leader.\n\n[[Page S12627]]\n\n  As a Time magazine article about Hispanics concluded a few years ago, \n``Hispanics are coming and they come bearing gifts.'' In July, of this \nyear Adweek observed in a paraphrase of the Time comment, ``Hispanics \nare here and they come bearing profits.''\n  Besides becoming home owners as fast as they can and starting \nbusinesses faster than any other ethnic group, Hispanic consumers are \nalso a growing market force.\n  The impact of Latinos in our domestic and international markets is \nhuge. Alert executives have welcomed these new markets and profits by \nserving the needs of Latino consumers right here in the United States. \nAdweek recently made this observation about this growing market force, \n``Many of the top American companies are already courting the market \nintelligently and aggressively. Procter & Gamble, Sears & Roebuck, \nWestern Union, Colgate-Palmolive, McDonalds, Allstate and many more are \nalready profiting from the Hispanic market. It's because Hispanics are \nsmart consumers who are loyal to the brands that serve them best and to \nmanufacturers who ask for the order.''\n  Recent headlines report the impact of Latino activities on the \nmainstream culture. Major magazines this year have has such headlines \nsuch as: ``Young Hispanics Are Changing America'' and ``Latino Power \nBrokers are Making America Sizzle.''\n  This month, the Albuquerque Tribune had a story with the headline, \n``Hispanic Influence, Power on the Rise.'' Sammy Sosa's home runs are \nfeatured in sports headlines, and Ricky Martin and ``La Vida Loca'' win \nGrammy awards while Latin music is a $12.2 billion industry.\n  There are other major indicators of the growing Hispanic or \n``Latino'' influence in our markets, our labor force, and in our \nschools. Some of these indicators are:\n\n       --31 million Hispanics now live in America. This is nine \n     million more than the 22.2 million Hispanics reported in the \n     1990 census.\n       --Latinos account for over 11% of our national population--\n     one in nine Americans is Latino. It is predicted that one in \n     four Americans will be Latino by the year 2050.\n       --Hispanic buying power in America has increased 65% since \n     1990 to almost $350 billion today, more than the entire GNP \n     of Mexico.\n       --4.3 million Hispanics voted in 1996 and 5.5 million are \n     expected to vote in the year 2000 elections. Over 12 million \n     Latinos are eligible to vote.\n       --Spanish-speaking America is already the world's fifth \n     largest Hispanic nation. In ten years, only Mexico will have \n     a larger Hispanic population.\n       --Spanish-speaking America is already the world's fifth \n     largest Hispanic nation. There are 400 million Hispanics in \n     the western hemisphere.\n       --There are proportionally more Medal of Honor winners \n     among Hispanics than any other ethnic group in America.\n\n  It is no wonder that George W. Bush and Al Gore are speaking their \nbest Spanish to Latino audiences. Some are even asking, ``Who is \nassimilating whom?\n  Some say we need ``English Only'' as a protection from the growing \nnumbers of Spanish speakers. I say we need to apply ``English Plus'' \nother languages like Spanish. Our nation will be better prepared for \nthe future by adding Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, and other \nlanguages to our national strengths. I will oppose movements like \n``English Only'' that are so brazenly aimed at Hispanics and Hispanic \nculture. ``English Plus'' is a much more healthy approach to our \neconomic and cultural future.\n  Hispanics are proud to remind us that they are represented among \nMedal of Honor winners more than any other ethnic group in our country. \nNames like Lopez, Jimenez, Martinez, Rodriguez, Valdez, Gonzales, and \nGomez are among the recipients of our nation's highest military honor. \nMany are New Mexico Hispanics who were over-represented in the infamous \nBataan Death March of World War II.\n  Having surveyed the major indicators of Hispanic growth and economic \npotential over the past decade and the important prospects for further \ngrowth and influence, I must now stress to my colleagues that Hispanic \npeople in America today still face two major obstacles that I see.\n  First, capital is the key to growing business in our great country, \nand Hispanics do not have sufficient access to capital that their \nnumbers and ideas might indicate. Second, and even more important for \nour future, the drop-out rate of Hispanics is unacceptably high. Let me \nelaborate.\n  As Hector D. Cantu observed in his Hispanic Business Column (July 1, \n1999) for Knight Ridder News, ``Put Latino entrepreneurs in any room \nand they soon start talking about capital. Or rather, the lack of it. \nSo many business plans, they might say, and so few banks willing to \nlend them money.''\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in a June 22, 1999, study of \nsmall business finance in two Chicago minority neighborhoods, found \nthat ``Black and Hispanic owners start their businesses with less \nfunding than owners in the other ethnic groups. Black and Hispanic \nowners also depend on personal savings for a higher proportion of their \nstart-up funding and are more likely to use personal savings as their \nonly source of start-up funding.''\n  This study also noted that with the following baseline \ncharacteristics: ``eating/drinking place, high school education, \nproficient in English, no previous experience as an owner, aged 37 \nyears, male, and business started 12 years ago,'' ``A White owner . . . \nstarts with 167 percent more funding ($54,564) than a comparable \nHispanic ($20,414); and Asian owner starts with 32 percent more \n($26,921); and an owner in the Other category starts with 49 percent \nmore ($30,479).'' A Black owner in this study started with ``an \nestimated 46 percent smaller pool of funds ($11,104) than a comparable \nHispanic.''\n  To help remedy situations like this all around the country, the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) gave us some good news last month \nabout business loans to Hispanics throughout the nation. They reported \nthat SBA-backed loans (bank loans guaranteed by SBA) have more than \ndoubled from $286 million in FY 1992 to about $635 million in FY 1999. \nThis represents more than 21,000 loans worth about $3.7 billion in \nloans to Hispanic-owned businesses in this seven year period.\n  Even with these impressive improvements in SBA participation and \ngrowth rates of 232% in Hispanic-owned businesses in the last decade, \nHispanics still own only about 5 percent of the businesses in the \nUnited States.\n  As Hispanic influence is felt in our markets, I will encourage \ncontinued SBA support for improving bank lending. I would like to note \nfor my colleagues that, on the private sector side of the ledger, \nMerrill Lynch is reportedly seeking more Hispanic mortgage lending, \neconomic empowerment initiatives, and small business lending.\n  Merrill Lynch has launched a $77 million pilot called the Southern \nCalifornia Partnership for Economic Achievement. In his article about \nthis on April 8, 1999, Hector D. Cantu (Knight Ridder) noted that a \nvice president of Merrill Lynch in California made this observation \nabout his company: ``The history of Merrill Lynch has been a company \nthat has prided itself on being one step ahead of the competition and \npositioning itself where great wealth is being created.'' He noted that \nafter World War II, ``We saw great wealth being created in the suburbs. \nIn the 1980s, we saw worldwide economic explosions. We went to Japan \nand Europe to be positioned globally as we saw capitalism breaking \nout.''\n  ``To this list, Merrill Lynch is now adding the U.S. Hispanic \nmarket.'' ``It's not a trend that started last year. It's something \nthat has been decades in the making. We see it reaching critical mass \nin very specific ways. In small business creation. In home ownership. \nIn pure demographics.''\n  With this kind of economic future and solid demographics to back the \nHispanic markets, there is still a disturbing weakness in the \nunderbelly of these numbers and hopes.\n  As many have noted during Hispanic Heritage Month, education is key \nto Hispanic success in America. I feel that the break-down in our \npublic education system affects minorities and Hispanics more than \nothers.\n  Federal programs that reach our public schools and universities \naccount for about 7 percent of all their resources. A disproportionate \nshare of these federal resources reaches minority students in such \nprograms as Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n(ESEA). Yet, the effectiveness of this federal investment is still \nquestionable for many reasons, mainly significant and continuing lags \nin educational attainment and drop outs. Clearly, these are related.\n\n[[Page S12628]]\n\n  Bilingual education is most often funded with federal support, even \nthough two-thirds of Spanish-speaking Latinos in our country are \neducated in English only classrooms. The federally funded TRIO programs \nhelp to identify and tutor minority students bound for college, and \nfederally subsidized student loans help to keep students in college.\n  In an era when we face competition from countries all around the \nworld like Mexico and China, we need to do all we can to keep our \nnational competitive advantage, especially in the scientific and \ntechnical fields. There is no question that the required formal \neducation is now higher for these fields, and it is disheartening to \nsee so many Latinos dropping out of high school.\n  I will personally be looking more closely at successful programs like \n``Cada Cabeza Es Un Mundo'' (\"Each Mind Is A World\") in California and \nAspectos Culturales (Cultural Aspects) of Santa Fe, New Mexico. As we \ndebate ESEA reauthorization, I will encourage more locally based \nefforts to include parents and other role models to participate in \nimproving the educational environment for all students, especially \nthose most likely to drop out.\n  Dropout rates among newer Latino immigrants are the highest among all \nethnic groups with the exception of American Indians, who make up less \nthan one percent of our population. Current reports by the \nCongressional Research Service (CRS) place the drop-out rate for \nHispanics who are born outside the U.S. at 38.6%.\n  For first generation Hispanics the drop-out rate is 15.4%. For \nHispanics beyond the first generation in America, the drop-out rate is \nslightly higher at 17.7%. Overall, including foreign born Latinos, the \nHispanic drop-out rate is 25.3% compared to 7.6% for whites and 13.4% \nfor blacks.\n  We cannot tolerate drop-out rates like these.\n  As our economy demands higher education, and jobs are not being \nfilled for lack of education or experience, the critical value of \nachievement in education becomes an issue for all of us in the Congress \nto note. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) \nreleased an important report documenting the strong link between \neducation and employment for Hispanics. It is entitled, \n``Education=Success: Empowering Hispanic Youth and Adults.''\n  We have federal programs that address virtually every aspect of \neducation, from Headstart to advanced degrees in science. Yet too many \nLatinos are being left behind at a time when we pride ourselves in an \neconomy that is surging ahead. We need to make our great American \nadvancements in mathematics, science, and engineering more available to \nall striving students, especially Latino students who drop out more \noften than most students.\n  Bill Gates recognized this problem. He recently announced his recent \nbillion dollar donation to minority education, much of which will go to \nLatino children. He saw the importance of reaching and inspiring \nLatinos, Blacks, and other minorities to attain higher degrees in \nscience and mathematics. He put his foundation money behind this idea.\n  It is time to refocus and re-energize our federal efforts to help \nLatinos and others in need of educational assistance. This is not a \ntime to see more and more Latinos falling behind in school just when \nmore formal education is essential to job market participation.\n  When we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month in the year 2000, \nI hope to be able to report more progress in private lending to \nHispanic businesses and better federal support for Hispanic education. \nNow that Hispanic Americans have become a new economic, cultural, and \npolitical force among us, we need to recommit our efforts to see that \nour financial institutions treat them fairly and that Hispanics are \nsuitably educated for a future we will all live and prosper in \ntogether.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Hispanic \ncommunity. As we commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to \nrecognize the contributions made by millions of Latinos in our nation. \nCalifornia is truly a multi-cultural state and I am honored to help \nrepresent this community in the United States Senate.\n  This month we celebrate a community that shares the common goals of \nother Americans of freedom, opportunity and a chance to build a better \nlife. In pursuing these aspirations, they have made important \ncontributions to life in the United States in the fields of business, \npolitics, science, culture, sports, and entertainment. Latinos have \nserved in the armed services with bravery and courage and many have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in giving their lives for the common good \nof our country.\n  Today, I honor these brave Americans and their families. I also honor \nLatino heroes and heroines like the late Julia de Burgos, Arturo \nAlphonso Schomburg, Roberto Clemente, and Cesar Chavez. These teachers, \nadvocates, athletes, and activists have brought pride to their \ncommunity, enriched our country, and provided role models for all of us \nto emulate.\n  Indeed, Latinos are changing the way America looks at itself. Today \nthere are 31 million Hispanics in the U.S. By 2050, the population is \nprojected to hit 96 million--an increase of more than 200 percent. \nLatinos are making their mark, Sammy Sosa leading the great American \nhome-run derby. Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, and Carlos Santana \ntopping the pop music charts. Salma Hayek, Jimmy Smits, Andy Garcia, \nEdward James Olmos, and Rita Moreno are making great contributions to \nthe entertainment industry.\n  I commend the Latino community for its courage and persistence and \nwant to warmly acknowledge the contributions and vitality this \ncommunity brings to our nation. I thank the leaders of this community \nfor leading by example and for promoting a national policy agenda which \nhighlights basic human necessities that should be the right of every \nAmerican.\n  Between 1984 and 1998, Latino voting jumped nationwide in midterm \nelections by 27 percent, even as overall voter turnout declined by 13 \npercent. In my own state of California, Latinos are participating and \ncontributing to civic life. For the first time in the California State \nLegislature's history, two of its three highest offices are occupied by \nLatinos, Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante and Speaker of the Assembly \nAntonio Villaraigosa.\n  A democratic and prosperous society should not step back from a \nnational commitment to provide assistance to those who strive to \nachieve the American dream, despite the odds. In particular, I want to \nemphasize the importance of a quality education for the success of \nLatino children. Our Latino young people are a great source of strength \nand hope for the future of this nation and they should be able to \nparticipate fully in the American experience.\n  I am proud to honor California's Hispanic community and to have the \nopportunity to ensure that Latino contributions and sacrifices do not \ngo unnoticed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/14/senate-section/article/S12628-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12628-S12631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there are many important Constitutional \nresponsibilities of United States Senators, but none is more important \nthan providing ``Advice and Consent'' for treaties with other nations. \nAnd among treaties, those involving control of nuclear arms, which \ncontinue to be the only instruments capable of threatening the physical \nsurvival of the United States, must top the list of our concerns.\n  Since the landmark Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963, every American \npresident, no matter his party affiliation, has recognized the value of \nresponsible and verifiable arms control agreements in making the arms \nrace less dangerous and the American people more secure. And each time \nan American president has entered into negotiations, concluded a treaty \nand then sought ratification by the United States Senate, the debate in \nthe Senate and in the country has been remarkably similar. For example, \nwhen President Kennedy announced the signing of the Limited Test Ban \nTreaty on July 16, 1963, he responded to the concerns and criticisms \nthen being directed at that proposed first step in the effort to \ncontrol nuclear weapons:\n\n       Secret violations are possible and secret preparations for \n     a sudden withdrawal are\n\n[[Page S12629]]\n\n     possible, and thus our own vigilance and strength must be \n     maintained, as we remain ready to withdraw and to resume all \n     forms of testing if we must. But it would be a mistake to \n     assume that this treaty will be quickly broken. The gains of \n     illegal testing are obviously slight compared to their cost \n     and the hazard of discovery, and the nations which have \n     initialed and will sign this treaty prefer it, in my \n     judgment, to unrestricted testing as a matter of their own \n     self-interest. For these nations, too, and all nations have a \n     stake in limiting the arms race, in holding the spread of \n     nuclear weapons and in breathing air that is not radioactive. \n     While it may be theoretically possible to demonstrate the \n     risks inherent in any treaty--and such risks in this treaty \n     are small--the far greater risks to our security are the \n     risks of unrestricted testing, the risk of a nuclear arms \n     race, the risk of new nuclear powers, nuclear pollution and \n     nuclear war.\n\n  Now, thirty-six years later, the United States Senate is being asked \nto give its advice and consent on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a \ngoal first formulated in the Eisenhower Administration. The Treaty \nitself was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in September \nof 1996 by a vote of 158 to 3, and signed by President Clinton later \nthat same month. As of today, 153 nations have signed the treaty, with \n47 of those formally ratifying it.\n  Today, in spite of the long history of the treaty's development, in \nspite of the fact that we now have over a third of a century of \nexperience in negotiating, implementing and monitoring arms control \nagreements, in spite of the long list of current and former military \nleaders have endorsed the treaty and in spite of the treaty's \nwidespread support among the American people and other nations, we \nstill confront the same doubts and fears that President Kennedy sought \nto address so long ago.\n  While I have heard legitimate concerns voiced about certain aspects \nof the treaty, I reject the notion that the test this proposal must \npass is one of perfection. Rather, in this world of imperfect men and \nwomen and laws, the test must be a less absolute one--Will the people \nof the United States, on balance, be better off if this treaty enters \ninto force than if it doesn't? In other words, is it an acceptable \nrisk, realizing that no possible course is risk free?\n  In my opinion, this agreement appears to be very much in the best \ninterests of the United States and its ratification will inhibit \nnuclear proliferation, enhance our ability to monitor and verify \nsuspicious activities by other nations, assure the sufficiency of our \nexisting nuclear deterrent, and inhibit a renewal of the nuclear arms \nrace.\n  Speaking on behalf of the unanimous view of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told us on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee last week that:\n\n       The Joint Chiefs support ratification of the CTBT with a \n     safeguards package. This treaty provides one means of dealing \n     with a very serious security challenge, and that is nuclear \n     proliferation. The CTBT will help limit the development of \n     more advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability \n     of more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. In short, the \n     world will be a safer place with the Treaty than without \n     it, and it is in our national security interests to ratify \n     the CTBT Treaty.\n\n  In other words, what the Joint Chiefs are telling us is that the \nfewer fingers on the nuclear trigger, the better.\n  As reported in an October 8, 1999 New York Times article about a \nrecent conference organized by the United Nations on the CTBT:\n\n       Several delegates seemed mystified that hawkish Republicans \n     oppose the treaty. It was negotiated by a Republican \n     president, and polls show that 82 percent of Americans \n     support it. It would freeze the arms race while the United \n     States enjoys a huge lead. And instead of paying 100 percent \n     of the cost of the world's second-most-sophisticated nuclear-\n     test detection system (the current American one), they said, \n     the United States would pay only 25 percent for the world's \n     most sophisticated one, with sensors deep inside Russia, \n     China, Iran and other nations where the United States is not \n     normally encouraged to gather data.\n\n  Most of this debate has centered on questions like these, related to \nthe risks of ratifying the treaty, and has been concerned about the \nverifiability of the proposal, and its impact on the credibility of the \nU.S. nuclear deterrent. These are indeed important questions, and I \nstand with the large majority of the American people, of our military \nleadership, and of our allies in concluding that, on balance, the CTBT \nis a net plus for our security.\n  But when weighing the risks involved in the Senate's action on this \ntreaty, we must also examine the risks involved in rejecting the \ntreaty. The leaders of three of our major allies who have already \nratified the CTBT, Great Britain, France and Germany--who also \nrepresent two of the world's seven recognized countries which have \nsuccessfully tested nuclear weapons--recently sent an unprecedented \njoint communication to the United States Senate which concluded:\n\n       Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the \n     pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to \n     ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to \n     proliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental \n     divergence within NATO. The United States and its allies have \n     worked side by side for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty since \n     the days of President Eisenhower. This goal is now within our \n     grasp. Our security is involved, as well as America's. For \n     the security of the world we will leave to our children, we \n     urge the United States Senate to ratify the treaty.\n\n  The consensus assessment of what will happen if the Senate rejects \nthe treaty is that none of the other nuclear powers--Russia, China, \nIndia and Pakistan--will ratify the agreement while all are likely to \ndo so if we ratify.\n  In May of 1998, in an irresponsible show of strength, both India and \nPakistan detonated nuclear devices to demonstrate to the world, but, \nmore importantly each other, their formal initiation in the ranks of \nnuclear powers. Yesterday's disturbing news that the democratically \nelected government of Pakistan had fallen victim to a military coup \nstresses just how important the CTBT is to both the subcontinent and to \nglobal security. These events coupled with the recent elections in \nIndia which returned Prime Minister Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party \n(BJP)--the party which chose to ignite the nuclear arms race on the \nsubcontinent--further underscore the need for sensibility when it comes \nto testing nuclear weapons. Both India and Pakistan have indicated \ntheir unwillingness to consider ending their nuclear arms race and sign \nthe CTBT only if the United States has ratified the treaty. The \nnational security of the United States and, in fact, the security of \neveryone on the planet, will be enhanced when countries such as India \nand Pakistan decide to stop testing nuclear weapons.\n  The United States stands today as the unchallenged military \nsuperpower, with by far the largest, most reliable and most versatile \nnuclear arsenal, as well as the strongest conventional arsenal. Indeed, \nthe trends of the last decade, where the demise of the Soviet Union has \nled to an ongoing and inexorable decline in the capacity of what had \nbeen the only comparable strategic nuclear force and a continuing \n``technology and investment gap'' has led to a circumstance where our \nconventional forces are vastly more capable than those of even our \nclosest allies as evidenced by the recent war against Serbia, have \nplaced us in the strongest relative military posture we have perhaps \never experienced as a Nation. As such, we are certainly more secure \nthan when John F. Kennedy sought ratification of the Limited Test Ban \nTreaty in 1963, more secure than when Ronald Reagan sought approval of \nthe Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1988, and more secure than \nwhen President Bush submitted the START I Treaty for Senate \nratification in 1992.\n  While no course of human action is ever risk free, of all nations in \nthe world, we have the most to gain from slowing the development of \nmore capable weapons by others and the spread of nuclear weapons to \nadditional countries, even if we cannot expect to prevent such \ndevelopments altogether. In addition, the Treaty cannot enter into \nforce unless and until all 44 nuclear-capable states, including China, \nIndia, Iran, North Korea and Pakistan, have ratified it. Should any one \nof these nations refuse to accept the treaty and its conditions all \nbets are off. Finally, even if all of the required countries ratify, we \nwill still have the right to unilaterally withdraw from the treaty if \nwe determine that our supreme national interests have been jeopardized.\n  After debating concerns about verification and the impact on our \nnuclear arsenal on September 22, 1963, the United States Senate, on a \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S12630]]\n\nbasis ratified the Limited Test Ban Treaty by a vote of 80 to 19. On \nOctober 7th of that year, President Kennedy signed the instruments of \nratification in the Treaty Room at the White House. He said:\n\n       In its first two decades, the Age of Nuclear Energy has \n     been full of fear, yet never empty of hope. Today the fear is \n     a little less and the hope a little greater. For the first \n     time we have been able to reach an agreement which can limit \n     the dangers of this age. The agreement itself is limited, but \n     its message of hope has been heard and understood not only by \n     the peoples of the three original nations but by the peoples \n     and governments of the hundred other countries that have \n     signed * * * What the future will bring, no one of us can \n     know. This first fruit of hope may not be followed by larger \n     harvests. Even this limited treaty, great as it is with \n     promise, can survive only if it has from others the \n     determined support in letter and in spirit which I hereby \n     pledge on behalf of the United States. If this treaty fails, \n     and it need not fail, we shall not regret that we have made \n     this clear and national commitment to the cause of man's \n     survival. For under this treaty we can and must still keep \n     our vigil in defense of freedom.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I oppose the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty, (CTBT). I do so because this accord is, in my view, fatally \nflawed. While I share the almost universal goal of nuclear \nnonproliferation, it seems clear to me that this Treaty, as written, \nwill weaken America's national security. I have been strongly \ninfluenced in my examination of this issue by the fact that this treaty \nis opposed by 6 past Secretaries of Defense, 2 past Chairmen of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, 5 past Directors of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former National \nSecurity Advisor Brent Scowcroft, former Ambassador to the United \nNations Jeanne Kirkpatrick and a host of other experts in the field.\n  I took seriously the objection raised by these experts and public \nservants. And I have come to the conclusion that the CTBT would be \ndangerous to America, and to the American people. CTBT is not \nverifiable. It would erode our confidence in the safety and reliability \nof our own nuclear deterrent. And, perhaps most damning, it would \nutterly fail to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  Let me explain my reasoning.\n  First, this treaty is not verifiable. The United States simply does \nnot have the technical means to detect violations of the Treaty at this \ntime. Nor are such technical means currently in development. Thus, it \nwould be entirely feasible for an adversary to conduct significant \nmilitary testing with little or no risk of detection.\n  With our current capability, we could not detect, with any \nsignificant degree of confidence, any nuclear testing producing yields \nof less than 1 kiloton. Yet testing that is of real, military \nsignificance does not require a 1 kiloton yield. If we are to have \neffective verification, we must have high and rationally based \nconfidence that we can detect militarily significant cheating.\n  To make matter worse, potential adversaries can employ evasion \ntechniques of varying complexity that would make nuclear tests with \nyields as large as 10 kilotons extremely difficult to detect and \nidentify with any confidence. In addition, we should not forget that a \ncountry determined to develop a nuclear arsenal could do so without any \ntesting whatsoever. The resulting nuclear capability might be \nunreliable. But it would be no less dangerous for that fact.\n  Throughout the last several decades of test ban negotiations it has \nconsistently been United States policy that our nation would not sign \nany treaty unless it were effectively verifiable. This position has \nbeen based on solid reasoning: any adversary that covertly tests--while \nthe United States foregoes testing--could gain significant military \nadvantage over us. Based on this fault alone, I would recommend against \nratification of CTBT.\n  But there are other serious flaws in this treaty that, in my view, \ndictate its rejection. Among these is the simple fact that reliability \nrequires testing. Our nation's national security strategy is based on \nthe policy of deterrence. CTBT will jeopardize our policy of nuclear \ndeterrence by undermining the reliability of our nuclear weapons and by \nforeclosing the addition of advanced safety measures to our warheads.\n  Mr. President, for deterrence to be effective, the nuclear stockpile \nmust be safe and reliable. By banning testing, the CTBT would \npermanently deny the US the only proven means we have for ensuring the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent.\n  The Administration is pursuing various new experimental techniques as \npart of its Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) to replace actual \nnuclear testing with sophisticated computer modeling and simulations. \nHowever, these new techniques are not yet proven and there is no way to \nconfirm that even the best models will be able to predict, with \nadequate precision, the condition of weapons systems.\n  In fact, Dr. James Schlesinger, the former Secretary of both Defense \nand Energy, has testified before the Senate that ``it will be many, \nmany years before we can assess adequately the degree of success of the \nStewardship Program and the degree to which it may mitigate the decline \nof confidence in the reliability of the stockpile.'' It would be \nirresponsible for us to bet something as critical to national security \nas the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons on unproven \ntechnology. We have no right to take such a leap of faith where the \nsafety and very survival of the American people are involved. We must \nkeep open the option of future testing.\n  Finally, the CTBT will neither stop nor slow nuclear proliferation. \nAs I have mentioned, nuclear testing is not a prerequisite to acquiring \na workable arsenal. Simple nuclear weapons can be designed with high \nconfidence without nuclear testing. For example, South Africa designed \nand developed nuclear weapons without testing. The CTBT will not create \na significant or meaningful obstacle to nuclear proliferation. A nation \nthat attempts to build complex nuclear weapons will encounter problems \nwith reliability. But it is entirely feasible for a nation to design, \nbuild, and stockpile effective nuclear weapons without nuclear testing.\n  CTBT, as its name implies, is simply a ban on nuclear explosions of \nany yield exceeding zero. It is not a treaty by which states which \ncurrently have nuclear weapons agree to give them up, reduce their \nnumbers, even stop their development or agree not to give them to \nothers. It simply would not provide any added safety in our dangerous \nworld. Indeed, by reducing the reliability of our own nuclear deterrent \nand encouraging the secret development of nuclear weapons, it would \nsignificantly reduce the level of safety currently enjoyed by citizens \nof the United States, and of the world.\n  I am convinced that it would be a tragic disservice to the American \npeople for this body to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for safety by voting against this treaty.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I came across a quote from a Senate \ntreaty debate, and I thought it was important to restate it for my \ncolleagues. The quote reads:\n\n       I am as anxious as any human being can be to have the \n     United States render every possible service to the \n     civilization and the peace of mankind. But I am certain that \n     we can do it best by not putting ourselves in leading \n     strings, or subjecting our policies and our sovereignty to \n     other nations.\n\n  It struck me how familiar the passage sounded. It is similar in tone \nand substance to the remarks made during the debate on the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty these last few days. However, the quote \nis almost exactly 80 years old, because it was nearly 80 years ago \ntoday, that this body took its first steps towards rejecting the Treaty \nof Versailles, and preventing our entry into the League of Nations.\n  The statement is from the distinguished Republican Majority Leader, \nHenry Cabot Lodge. Senator Lodge had a very real distaste for the \nPresident at the time. He, and a small minority of Senators used this \ntreaty to send a political message to then President Wilson. The \nPresident had worked very hard to establish the League of Nations, he \nwas very popular with the American people, and so was this treaty. \nHowever, through red herring arguments, and political arm twisting, \nSenator Lodge was able to block ratification. He thought he had \nembarrassed the President; he thought he had outmaneuvered the \nDemocratic party; he thought he was laying the groundwork for the \nPresidential election of 1920. But Senator Lodge did not beat President \nWilson that day, he beat America. Senator Lodge did not believe America\n\n[[Page S12631]]\n\nneeded to lead. In his view, America could withdraw across the \nAtlantic, and the world events would take care of themselves.\n  Detractors of this world view called its adherents ``little \nAmericans.'' In other words, the proponents of isolation and \nwithdrawal, saw the United States as a country with no particular place \nin history, and with no important place in world events. Twenty years \nlater, millions around the world would pay the price for Senator \nLodge's short-sightedness. The United States never did join the League, \nand that fact undermined its credibility from the word go. First, \nneighboring states in the western hemisphere withdrew from the League: \nBrazil, Honduras, Costa Rica and a host of others. The trend continued \nuntil finally Germany and Japan left the organization. Having abandoned \nour place at the table, the power vacuum was filled by other forces, in \nthis case the ultra-nationalist and fascist regimes of Germany, Italy \nand Japan.\n  To put that mistake into a little greater perspective, about 7 \nmillion soldiers lost their lives in World War I. That was a shocking \nfigure at the time, it was greater than the combined total of all the \nwars in Europe for the previous 100 years. However, the horrors of \nWorld War I, were completely overshadowed by what came next. The U.S. \nwithdrew into isolation, the League of Nations failed, and World War II \nwas the direct result. World War I was the worst disaster humanity had \nknown in 1919, the loses in World War II were three times worse. This \nis a very high price to pay for a little presidential politics, and the \nfalse security of isolationism.\n  Mr. President, we have an often repeated axiom in the Senate, that \npolitics stops at the waters edge. The axiom is there to remind us of \nexactly the kind of mistake this body made 80 years ago. To play \npolitics with international agreements is to invite disaster. The \nheadlines were the same all over last night, the Senate handed the \nPresident a major defeat last night by rejecting the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty. There is no defeating the President, he will be out of \noffice in 18 months, his legacy will not rise or fall with the passage \nof this treaty. However, the members of this body can undermine \nAmerica's standing in the world, and last night they did just that.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I sat through several \nhearings, listened to testimony on the CTBT, and weighed the merits of \nthe agreement. I understood the perspective of my Chairman, Senator \nWarner and others with respect to this agreement. There were legitimate \nconcerns expressed by the directors of our national laboratories, there \nwere serious questions about our ability to monitor this agreement, and \nI understand how reasonable minds can disagree about the merits of the \ntreaty. However, what occurred last night was willful disregard for the \nleadership role that this nation plays in the world. That vote need not \nhave occurred. We could have waited for a stronger consensus on the \nscience of the stockpile stewardship program. Had we delayed \nconsideration, we would have benefitted from the revised national \nintelligence estimate. We might also have negotiated with the Russians \nand Chinese to address some of the more difficult treaty monitoring \nquestions. However, all such potential benefits of time are lost to us. \nAll of this despite the fact that a clear majority of Senators would \nhave preferred to delay consideration of the treaty. Sadly, I must \nconclude that the drive to bring this treaty to a vote was not a \nquestion of merit, it was a political exercise.\n  We have numerous treaties sitting before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee that might be brought up, and dealt with the same way. I'll \ngive just one example--the Convention on the Elimination of all forms \nof Discrimination Against Women or CEDAW. There are many in this body \nwho oppose particular provisions of this treaty, and I am not certain \nthat if we brought it to the floor, there would be sufficient votes to \nratify it. The reason we do not bring it to the floor, is because the \nUnited States is not going to send a message to the world that the \nUnited States tacitly endorses discrimination, by actively rejecting \nthis treaty. However, on something as important as nuclear \nproliferation, the majority felt compelled to do exactly that.\n  Mr. President, I believe that a small group of the members of this \nbody took aim at our President with last night's vote. Unfortunately, \nlike Senator Lodge before them, they missed the President and hit the \nAmerican people. President Wilson was fond of saying that American \npower, was moral power. He was right. The United States does not, and \ncannot rely on its nuclear weapons to convince the nations of the world \nto follow our example. The only real weapon that we have to combat \nnuclear proliferation is our world leadership and the power of American \nmoral authority. With last night's vote, I am afraid that we \nunilaterally disarmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/14/senate-section/article/S12631-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12631-S12632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about a \ncrisis going on in our nursing home industry. Today, a very large \nnursing home with headquarters in my home State of New Mexico filed for \nChapter 11, that is bankruptcy protection but it is bankruptcy \nnonetheless. This is the second nursing home chain to file for \nbankruptcy in the last 2 months. These two nursing home chains own \nhundreds of facilities over the country, across it from north to south \nand east to west. So every Senator should be concerned about what is \nhappening in this industry.\n  Frankly, we could have avoided this crisis if the administration had \nbeen more willing to acknowledge and address the problem. We wrote a \nbipartisan letter to Secretary Shalala in May, signed by 64 Senators, \nurging her to work with us to address the problem administratively. We \nhave yet to get a response. Now I am here to tell you unless something \nvery dramatic is done, this crisis is not over. We are going to see \nmore bankruptcies and ultimately disruptions in the care for our senior \ncitizens unless we fix this problem.\n  Clearly, one of the major reasons for these failures is the new \npayment system through the Medicare program for skilled nursing \nfacilities and some of the services they give to their patients. \nEveryone, including the Health Care Financing Administration, \nacknowledges that this payment system does not adequately reimburse \nnursing homes for so-called nontherapy ancillary services; that is, \ndrugs, oxygen, and other costs incurred, which are a very large part of \nthe expenses of taking care of our seniors in nursing homes.\n  To address this problem, I joined with Senator Hatch and others in \nintroducing S. 1500. That would fix the new payment system and it is \nfiscally responsible.\n  Unfortunately, the package of Medicare provisions released by the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee yesterday is \nwoefully inadequate.\n  Hatch-Domenici increased the payment rates in the 15 categories of \nreimbursement that clearly underpay for those patients with high non-\ntherapy ancillary costs.\n  The Finance Committee package, however, only includes two of these 15 \ncategories.\n  I am told that this is the position that HCFA supports, perhaps based \non a contractor's analysis of the problem.\n  But I am also told that the same contractor indicates right up front \nin the report that patients with high non-therapy ancillary costs are \nlikely to appear in the patient categories covered by the Hatch-\nDomenici bill.\n  But, it seems to me that there is no higher priority in Medicare than \nfixing this problem, which is on the verge of disrupting care for \nmillions of seniors in every state.\n  The Finance Committee is working on a bill to help in this area and \nsome others. I have seen the bill as of yesterday. It is totally \ninadequate to take care of this problem, this crisis across this land. \nIn my State, if this company goes bankrupt, totally bankrupt, it will \nnot only hurt seniors across this land but we will have 700 to 800 \npeople who will lose their jobs. They have been working in this \nindustry for years.\n  I ask the Finance Committee to reconsider what they contemplated \nyesterday. I will begin working with some of them, with specifics. But \nI guarantee those who are contemplating a bill to\n\n[[Page S12632]]\n\ndo some justice and fairness in this area, we are not going to get by \nwith the provisions that were in the bill as of yesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/14/senate-section/article/S12632-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmodernize Medicare supplemental policies so that outpatient \nprescription drugs are affordable and accessible for medicare \nbeneficiaries; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the druggap insurance for seniors act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce \nthe DrugGap Insurance for Seniors Act of 1999, which will provide much-\nneeded insurance coverage for medicines for low-income seniors, and \nwill allow all other seniors, for the first time, to purchase an \naffordable, drug-only insurance policy to protect them against the \nrunaway cost of drugs.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware that prescription drug costs continue \nto grow at an alarming rate. Seniors are being forced to spend greater \nand greater portions of their fixed incomes on prescription drugs that \nthey need to live. Research and development of prescription drugs have \ncome a long way since Medicare was originally enacted in 1965. Today, \ndrugs are just as important, and in many cases more important, than \nhospital visits. It does not make sense for Medicare to reimburse \nhospitals for surgery, but not provide coverage for the drugs that \nmight prevent surgery. That is why I am committed to modernizing the \nMedicare program so that it does not go bankrupt in the next 10 to 15 \nyears. In addition, we must ensure that any Medicare reform proposal we \nconsider includes a prescription drug benefit that helps all seniors.\n  This is a basic coverage problem that we must address as we modernize \nthe Medicare program, and it is one of my top priorities. Ideally, it \nshould be part of broad Medicare reform. Even if we are not able to \nachieve broad reform in the Medicare program this year, we must at \nleast do something to address this basic need for seniors.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill that will target the most needy \nseniors. Currently, Medicare beneficiaries can purchase private \ninsurance plans, called Medigap plans, to pay certain health care \nexpenses that are not covered by Medicare. The law allows Medigap \ninsurers to offer ten standardized plans to beneficiaries. However, \nonly the three most expensive Medigap plans cover prescription drugs.\n  My plan calls for three new Medigap insurance plans to be developed \nthat will cover only prescription drugs. The federal government will \nuse a small portion of the budget surplus to purchase these new \n``DrugGap'' policies for low-income Medicare beneficiaries who do not \nalready have prescription drug coverage under Medicaid or through an \nemployer sponsored plan. This bill provides all seniors the option of \npurchasing affordable, comprehensive coverage for prescription drugs \neven if they do not qualify for the federal government purchase plan. \nThe bill also includes reforms to the Medigap system to give seniors \nmore choice, and to keep Medigap premiums affordable.\n  Mr. President, this bill offers several significant advantages to \nMedicare beneficiaries who need coverage for prescription drugs. First, \nnothing will change for those Medicare beneficiaries who like their \ncurrent Medigap plans. This bill will offer more choices for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, but will not make seniors change coverage that they \nlike.\n  Second, this plan does not mandate prescription drug benefits on the \ncurrent standardized plans, which some critics have argued will raise \npremiums. Indeed, one of the goals of this legislation is to make \nMedigap more affordable, and to seek solutions to the problem of the \nspiraling cost of Medigap premiums. This bill offers a way to \naccomplish this goal.\n  This bill also gives DrugGap policy holders access to the deep \ndiscounts on drugs that HMOs get, even if the beneficiary has not met \nthe policy's deductible, and makes it clear that insurance companies \ncan issue drug discount cares to Medigap policy holders even if the \npolicy doesn't cover prescription drugs.\n  Finally, this bill will provide federal grants to the states for \ncounseling for seniors regarding this new benefit.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not a substitute for the much-needed \nMedicare reform and Medicare drug benefit, but it is a positive step \nthat we can take right now to protect Medicare beneficiaries until \nMedicare reform can be achieved, and a broad drug benefit is \nimplemented. I hope my colleagues will support this moderate approach \nto helping Medicare beneficiaries deal with the runaway costs of \nprescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na brief summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S12635]]\n\n       (1) Coverage of outpatient prescription drugs is the most \n     important aspect of medical care not currently provided under \n     the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act.\n       (2) The medicare program needs to be reformed, and should \n     include provisions that provide access to outpatient \n     prescription drugs for all medicare beneficiaries.\n       (3) Comprehensive medicare reform will require extensive \n     time and effort, but Congress must act now to provide \n     outpatient prescription drug coverage to the most vulnerable \n     medicare beneficiaries until such time as the medicare \n     program is reformed.\n       (4) Low-income medicare beneficiaries are the most \n     vulnerable to the high cost of outpatient prescription drugs, \n     since they are often not eligible to receive benefits under \n     medicaid, yet have incomes too low to afford medicare \n     supplemental policies that include coverage for outpatient \n     prescription drugs.\n       (5) Medicare beneficiaries deserve meaningful choices among \n     medicare supplemental policies, including the option of \n     purchasing affordable outpatient prescription drug-only \n     medicare supplemental policies.\n       (6) Premiums for medicare supplemental policies have risen \n     dramatically in recent years, and steps must be taken to keep \n     premiums from rising out of the reach of medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       (7) Increased use of medicare supplemental policies does \n     not represent sufficient structural medicare reform.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide medicare supplemental policies covering \n     outpatient prescription drugs to low-income medicare \n     beneficiaries at no cost.\n       (2) To provide expanded choice to all medicare \n     beneficiaries by creating affordable drug-only medicare \n     supplemental policies.\n       (3) To ensure that medicare supplemental policies are \n     modernized in a manner that promotes competition and \n     preserves affordability for all medicare beneficiaries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

This process requires \n     the participation of consumer groups, Medicare beneficiaries, \n     and other representatives selected in a manner to assure \n     balanced representation among the interested groups.\n       New Drug-Only ``DrugGap'' Plans: In addition to modernizing \n     the existing ten standardized plans, NAIC would be required \n     to develop three new standardized DrugGap plans, within the \n     following structure:\n       (1) ``Standard DrugGap'' plan will have low deductible \n     (maximum $250) and cost-sharing levels (maximum 20% copay), \n     and a $5000 maximum benefit;\n       (2) ``Low-Cost Standard DrugGap'' will have somewhat higher \n     deductible (maximum $750) and cost-sharing levels (maximum \n     30% copay), and $5000 maximum benefit;\n       (3) ``Stop-Loss DrugGap'' plan will cover any out-of-pocket \n     prescription medicine costs after total prescription medicine \n     costs reach $5000.\n       Affordability: Issuers of the new DrugGap plans will be \n     given flexibility to employ a variety utilization management \n     techniques to ensure affordability in these plans, including \n     incentives to encourage appropriate generic substitution. The \n     NAIC standards will include standards by which formularies \n     could be developed, including requirements that all \n     therapeutic classes of drugs will be covered, and \n     beneficiaries will be guaranteed access to off-formulary \n     drugs when they are necessary and appropriate. The standards \n     will also include a mechanism to ensure appropriate \n     utilization and to minimize incidents of adverse drug \n     interactions, as well as mechanisms to ensure reasonable \n     accessibility. Competition between plans will push actual \n     deductible and coinsurance levels lower than the maximum \n     allowable deductible and cost-sharing amounts.\n       Eligibility for Assistance: Any Medicare beneficiary who: \n     (1) has income of less than 150% of the federal poverty level \n     (in states where Medicaid eligibility is currently above 100% \n     of poverty, the eligibility level will be 50 percentage \n     points above the states' current Medicaid eligibility, up to \n     200% of the federal poverty level); (2) does not currently \n     have employer-sponsored coverage for prescription drugs; and \n     (3) who is not eligible to receive prescription drugs through \n     Medicaid, is eligible to receive federal assistance. Each \n     eligible beneficiary will receive federal assistance in \n     purchasing a Standard DrugGap and Stop-Loss DrugGap plan.\n       Beneficiary Access: Any DrugGap plan may be purchased by \n     any Medicare beneficiary regardless of whether the \n     beneficiary is eligible for federal government assistance \n     under this proposal.\n       Access to Discounts: Before the deductible has been \n     satisfied, and after the maximum coverage amount of the \n     DrugGap plan has been reached, plans are required to make \n     drugs available to covered beneficiaries at the same price \n     that is referenced by the plan in determining the plan \n     coverage--i.e., beneficiaries purchase medications at the \n     plan's discounted price. When providing drugs in these \n     situations, plans may assess nominal administration/\n     dispensing fees. This allows seniors to access the heavily \n     discounted plan prices, which may be 20% to 25% lower than \n     the market price for important prescription medicines.\n       Grants to States: This proposal will include grants to the \n     states ($50 million) for counseling of seniors regarding this \n     new benefit, and to help them access the new DrugGap \n     policies.\n       Affordable Premiums: As a part of this Act, Congress would \n     also instruct the NAIC to make recommendations regarding \n     other regulatory and statutory changes which, if enacted, \n     would reduce the cost of Medigap premiums, and would \n     encourage more issuers to offer Medigap policies. These \n     changes would address issues such as balance-billing and \n     outpatient expenses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1726. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nfor unemployment compensation purposes Indian tribal governments the \nsame as State or local units of government or as nonprofit \norganizations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n the indian tribal government unemployment compensation act tax relief \n                           amendments of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nCampbell and Senator Inouye to introduce the Indian Tribal Government \nUnemployment Compensation Act Tax Relief Amendments of 1999.\n  This bill would correct a serious oversight in the way the Internal \nRevenue Code treats Indian tribal governments for unemployment tax \npurposes under the unique, State-Federal program authorized by the \nFederal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). It would clarify existing tax \nstatutes so that tribal governments are treated just as State and local \nunits of governments are treated for unemployment tax purposes.\n  It is well-settled that tribal governments are not taxable entities \nunder the Federal Tax Code because of their governmental status. But in \nrecent years, both the Internal Revenue service and the U.S. Department \nof Labor have begun to advance an interpretation of FUTA that is \nparticularly burdensome to Indian tribal governments.\n  The IRS has begun to insist on collecting the Federal portion of the \nFUTA tax from tribal governmental employers. The IRS rationale is that \nbecause the FUTA statute expressly exempts charitable organizations and \nall State and local units of government from paying the Federal portion \nof the FUTA tax, but does not expressly mention tribal governments, it \nmust collect the Federal portion of the tax from tribal employers.\n  The Labor Department, for its part, several years ago issued an \nopinion declaring that State unemployment funds may not treat tribal \ngovernment employers like other governmental units and accord them \n``reimburser'' status. The Department's rationale was that FUTA statute \ndoes not expressly authorize tribal governments to participate on a \nreimbursable basis, and so State Unemployment Funds were prohibited \nfrom allowing them to do so.\n  The Congressional Research Service conducted a study at my request in \nthe early 1990s which revealed that FUTA was being applied to tribal \ngovernment employers differently throughout our Nation. Some were \nallowed to participate, even as reimbursers. Others were denied \nparticipation but charged the full tax without getting any benefit \nwhatsoever. The recent actions by the IRS and the Labor Department have \nonly served to make the application of FUTA to tribal government \nemployers even more confusing, contradictory, and unfair.\n  FUTA involves a joint Federal-State taxation system that levies two \ntaxes on most employers: an 0.8 percent unemployment tax and a State \nunemployment tax ranging up to more than 9 percent of a portion of an \nemployer's payroll. Since its enactment in the 1930s, FUTA has treated \nforeign, Federal, State, and local government employers differently \nfrom private commercial business employers. It exempts all foreign, \nFederal, State, and local government employers from the 0.8 percent \nFederal FUTA tax. It exempts foreign and Federal government employers \nfrom State unemployment programs and allows State and local government \nemployers to pay lower State unemployment taxes as reimbursers. FUTA \nalso treats income tax-exempt charitable organizations the same as \nState and local governments. All other private sector employers pay \nboth the Federal and State FUTA tax rates. The FUTA statute does not \nexpressly include tribal government employers within the definition of \ngovernmental employers.\n\n  This legislation will expressly authorize tribal governments, like \nState and local units of government and charitable organizations, to \ncontribute to a State fund on a reimbursable basis for unemployment \nbenefits actually\n\n[[Page S12639]]\n\npaid out. Private sector employers typically must pay an unemployment \ntax in advance. The rationale for reimburser status is that \ngovernmental employers, like tribes and States, have a far more stable \nemployment environment than that of the private sector, and that \ngovernmental revenue should not be committed to such purposes in \nadvance of when the obligation to pay arises.\n  Let me be clear, this bill would ensure that tribes participate in \nthe unemployment compensation system. Some now do not do so. Their \nparticipation would be on the same terms as other governments. Tribal \ngovernment employers would pay for every dime that is paid out in \nbenefits to workers they lay off. But the bill would clarify the law to \nensure that tribal government employers do not pay more than what is \npaid, a ``reimburser'' status long accorded all other governmental \nemployers and tax-exempt organization employers.\n  The bill I am introducing today would permanently resolve this matter \nacross the Nation for every Indian tribal government. Unless this \nproblem is resolved, many former tribal government employees will \ncontinue to be denied benefits by State unemployment funds and many \ntribal government employers will be charged at much higher rates than \nare all other governmental and tax-exempt employers. I believe tribal \ngovernments should be treated no differently than all other governments \nunder our tax code, and that Indian and non-Indian workers who are \nseparated from tribal governmental employment should be included within \nour Nation's comprehensive unemployment benefit system. This bill will \ngo a long way toward ensuring mandatory participation by tribal \ngovernments on a fair and equitable basis in the Federal-State \nunemployment fund system. I can think of nothing more fair than the \napproach clarified in this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the Joint Committee on Taxation, through the \nCongressional Budget Office, estimates the cost of this bill to be \nminimal, about ten million dollars over a ten-year period. The cost to \nimplement these provisions in the first few years will eventually be \noffset over the ten-year period, resulting in a negligible effect on \nthe Federal treasury.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation, as well as \na September 27, 1999 letter from the Joint Committee on Taxation \nproviding the revenue estimate on this bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

An election under this \n     subsection may not be made except by an Indian tribe within \n     the meaning of section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination \n     and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)).''.\n       (d) Definitions.--Section 3306 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to definitions) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(u) Indian Tribe.--For purposes of this chapter, the term \n     `Indian tribe' has the meaning given to such term by section \n     4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)), and includes any \n     subdivision, subsidiary, or business enterprise chartered and \n     wholly owned by such an Indian tribe.''.\n       (e) Transition Rule.--For purposes of the Federal \n     Unemployment Tax Act, service performed in the employ of an \n     Indian tribe (as defined in section 3306(u) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by this Act)) shall not be \n     treated as employment (within the meaning of section 3306 of \n     such Code) if--\n       (1) it is service which is performed before the date of \n     enactment of this Act and with respect to which the tax \n     imposed under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act has not been \n     paid; and\n       (2) such Indian tribe reimburses a State unemployment fund \n     for unemployment benefits paid for service attributable to \n     such tribe for such period.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: This letter is in response to your \n     request for an estimate of the revenue effects of the \n     ``Indian Tribal Government Unemployment Compensation Act Tax \n     Relief Amendments of 1999.''\n       The proposal would treat tribal governments like State \n     governments for the purpose of defining their obligations \n     under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (``FUTA''). \n     Specifically, tribal government employers would be exempt \n     from the Federal unemployment tax and would be authorized to \n     contribute to State unemployment funds on a reimbursement \n     basis. The proposal is assumed to be effective for services \n     performed on or after January 1, 2000.\n       Because the provision affects contributions to the FUTA \n     trust fund, the Congressional Budget Office (``CBO'') \n     estimates its revenue effects. CBO estimates that the \n     provision would have the following effects for Federal fiscal \n     year budget receipts:\n\nFiscal years:                                                    Million\n  2000........................................................      -$20\n  2001........................................................       -11\n  2002........................................................       -10\n  2003........................................................        -9\n  2004........................................................        36\n  2000-2004...................................................       -14\n  2000-2009...................................................       -10\n \n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. Please let me \n     know if we can be of further assistance in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lindy L. Paull.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joining Senator \nMcCain in co-sponsoring the Indian Tribal Government Unemployment \nCompensation Act Tax Relief Amendments of 1999. If enacted, this \nlegislation will modify the Federal Unemployment Tax Act of 1935 \n(``FUTA'') to allow Indian tribal governments to receive the same \nunemployment compensation treatment as state and local governments.\n  FUTA imposes a tax on the wages paid by employers to their employees. \nFrom these tax proceeds, unemployment insurance and benefits for out-\nof-work citizens is provided. Under the bill introduced today, Indian \ntribal governments would be treated as state and local governments, and \nwould be authorized to contribute to state unemployment funds on a \nreimbursable basis.\n  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that this bill would \nhave a minimal impact, $10 million over 10 years, on the Federal \nbudget.\n  However, the impact that this amendment would have on Indian economic \ndevelopment is immeasurable. The development of strong tribal economies \nis fundamental for tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination.\n  Private enterprise is often reluctant to do business and hire Indian \nworkers if legal, tax, and regulatory regimes they face are confusing \nor unfriendly. This legislation would eliminate any confusion over the \napplicability of the FUTA tax and would create a level playing field \nfor tribal governments and enhance their ability to attract and retain \nthe best skilled employees.\n\n[[Page S12640]]\n\n  By providing equitable FUTA treatment to tribal government employers, \nthis legislation will assist in the long-term growth and stability of \ntribal economies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator McCain and I in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1727. A bill to authorize for the expansion annex of the historic \nPalace of the Governors, a public history museum located, and relating \nto the history of Hispanic and Native American culture, in the \nSouthwest and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n               THE PALACE OF THE GOVERNORS EXPANSION ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in conjunction with Hispanic Heritage \nMonth I am introducing the Palace of the Governors Expansion Act. The \nPalace is a symbol of Hispanic influence in the United States and truly \nshows the coming together of many cultures in the New World--the \nvarious Native American, Hispanic and Anglo peoples who have lived in \nthe region for over four centuries.\n  It is appropriate that during Hispanic Heritage Month that a bill \nshould be introduced to preserve a priceless collection of Spanish \nColonial, Iberian Colonial paintings, artifacts, maps, books, guns, \ncostumes, photographs. The collection includes such historically unique \nitems as the helmets and armor worn by the Don Juan Onate expedition \nconquistadors who established the first capital in the United States, \nSan Juan de los Caballeros, in July of 1598. It includes the Vara \nStick, a type of yardstick used to measure land grants and other real \nproperty boundaries in Dona Ana County, New Mexico.\n  We have all heard of Geronimo. The Collection includes a rifle \ndropped by one of his men during a raid in the Black Range area of \nWestern New Mexico.\n  We have all heard of Pancho Villa. His activities in the Southwest \ncome alive when viewing some of the artifacts included in the Palace of \nthe Governors Collection. The Columbus, New Mexico Railway Station \nclock was shot in the pendulum, freezing for all history the moment \nthat Pancho Villa's raid and invasion began. It is part of the \ncollection, but you wouldn't know it because there is no room to \ndisplay it.\n  Brigadier General Stephen Watts Kearny was posted to New Mexico \nduring the Mexican War. He commanded the Army of the West as they \ntraveled from the Santa Fe trail to occupy the territories of New \nMexico and California. As Kearny travelled, he carried a field desk \nwhich he used to write letters, diaries, orders and other historical \ndocuments. It is part of the collection, but you can't see it because \nthere is no display space for it in the Palace of the Governors.\n  Many of us have read books by D. H. Lawrence, but none of us have \nseen the note from his mother that is part of the collection.\n  There are more than 800,000 other historic photographs, guns, \ncostumes, maps, books and handicrafts.\n  Today, where are these treasures that Teddy Roosevelt wanted to make \npart of the Smithsonian housed now?\n  Where is this collection that has been designated as National \nTreasures by the National Trust for Historic preservation kept?\n  In the basement of a 400 year old building.\n  It is a national travesty.\n  This legislation would right this wrong by authorizing funds for a \nPalace of the Governors Expansion Annex. The entire project will cost \n$32 million. The legislation authorizes a $15 million federal grant if \nthe Museum can match the grant on a 50-50 basis.\n  The Palace of the Governors has acquired a half block right behind \nthe current Palace. Obtaining this valuable real estate is evidence of \nthe ingenuity and commitment of those involved in preserving the \ncollection. Real estate near Santa Fe's plaza is seldom for sale at any \nprice, much less an affordable price.\n  Palace of the Governors has been the center of administrative and \ncultural activity over a vast region in the Southwest since its \nconstruction as New Mexico's second capitol in Santa Fe by Governor \nPedro de Peralta in 1610. The building is the oldest continuously \noccupied public building in the United States. Since its creation, the \nMuseum of New Mexico has worked to protect and promote Hispanic, \nSouthwest and Native American arts and crafts.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation saving this important collection. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1727\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This act may be cited as Palace of the \n     Governors Expansion Act.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nremove the limit on amount of medicaid disproportionate share hospital \npayment for hospitals in Ohio; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            medicaid hospital payment for hospitals in ohio\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, to introduce legislation that \nwill remove the limit on the amount of federal Medicaid \ndisproportionate share (DSH) payments for hospitals in Ohio. In 1993, \nCongress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) in an \neffort to curb the rate of growth of federal Medicaid DSH spending to \nhospitals. Section 1923(g) of that bill placed maximum payment caps on \nhospitals. Subsequently, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) \nin 1997, in which Section 1923(f) placed funding caps on states. With \nthe implementation of the aggregate state DSH spending limits, \nhospital-specific caps are no longer needed to assure the financial \nintegrity of the program.\n  I have often spoken on the floor of the Senate in support of \nfederalism. When the federal government makes overly prescriptive laws \nand regulations, it can erode the ability of state governments to \nprotect consumers, promote economic development, and generate the \nrevenue streams that fund education, public safety, infrastructure and \nother vital services. This is especially true in the case of Medicaid. \nHospitals that provide care to indigent patients provide an invaluable \nservice to their communities, often at great expense. DSH payments are \nintended to help reimburse those expenses. Congress should allow \nindividual states to administer their DSH program in a way that \nprovides the most funding for the most hospitals as possible. Without \nsuch leeway, we are imposing what is effectively an unfunded mandate on \nthe private sector--telling these hospitals to treat Medicaid and \nuninsured patients without helping them pay for it. This is not good \npolicy.\n  This legislation is federalism at its best. Section 1923(g) fails to \nrecognize that each state implements its DSH program differently, and \nthus fails to recognize that the hospital-specific caps adversely \naffect Ohio hospitals. This legislation is budget neutral, yet it gives \nmy state the flexibility to implement the Medicaid DSH program in the \nfairest and most equitable manner.\n  Under Ohio's DSH program, the Hospital Care Assurance Program (HCAP), \nall necessary hospital services are provided free of charge to persons \nbelow the federal poverty line. Generally, under HCAP, hospitals are \ntaxed and those funds are used as the state's share to draw matching \nfederal Medicaid DSH funds. The total pool is then distributed back to \nhospitals based on the level of each hospital's indigent care. Ideally, \nthe DSH dollars should follow the indigent patients. However, partly \nbecause of the hospital-specific caps that were enacted in 1993, there \nare many HCAP hospitals that are reimbursed far less than the amount \nthat would actually cover their indigent care expenses. The bill will \ngive Ohio the ability to implement a new formula to correct this \ninequity within Ohio's overall spending limit.\n  Mr. President, Ohio deserves the authority to make health care \ndecisions that are in the best interest of her citizens and their local \nhospitals. Ohio is not seeking additional federal dollars, merely the \nflexibility to allocate reimbursement funds under the DSH program where \nthe funds are needed most. I urge passage of this legislation that will \ngive relief to our hospitals and allow them to continue to provide \nquality care to each and every citizen in my state.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1728\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF LIMIT ON AMOUNT OF MEDICAID \n                   DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITAL PAYMENT FOR \n                   HOSPITALS IN OHIO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1923(g)(1) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-4(g)(1)) is amended--\n  (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``A'' and inserting ``Except as \nprovided in subparagraph (D), a''; and\n  (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n  ``(D) Exception.--The limitations in subparagraphs (A) and (C) shall \nnot apply to payments made to hospitals (other than institutions for \nmental diseases or other mental health facilities) located in Ohio.''.\n  (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall \napply to payments and payment adjustments made to hospitals on or after \nJuly 1, 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1729. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to clarify \nFederal authority relating to land acquisition from willing sellers for \nthe majority of the trails, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             The National Trails-Willing Seller legislation\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend the National Trails System Act to clarify federal authority \nrelating to land acquisition from willing sellers. This bill is the \ncompanion to Congressman Scott McInnis' legislation. Congressman \nMcInnis has been an advocate for this legislation for many years.\n  There are 20 trails in the national scenic and historic trail system. \nThese trails are among some of the most beautiful areas in the United \nStates and are deserving of preservation. This bill will enable the \nfederal government to help conserve the special resources of all of \nthese congressionally designated trails, enabling everyone to enjoy the \nbenefit of these trails today and for future generations of Americans \ntomorrow.\n  This legislation does not appropriate any money, it only provides the \nfederal government the authority to acquire lands from willing sellers. \nOnce willing sellers are identified, Congress then appropriates the \nmoney so that the land can be purchased. It also will help to address \nthe increasing development pressures that threaten the long-range \ncontinuity of the National Trails System.\n  Currently, the federal government only has authority to buy land \nalong 11 of the 20 national scenic and historic trails. This bill gives \nauthority to buy\n\n[[Page S12642]]\n\nland from willing sellers along the other nine trails to ensure that \nthe entire trail can be preserved.\n  There are many unique and special historic sites along the nine \naffected scenic and historic trails. These sites have been voluntarily \nprotected for several generations by responsible individual families. \nThese families should have the right to sell these irreplaceable places \nof our nation's heritage to the federal government to continue their \nprotection when and if they choose to do so.\n  This legislation is a vehicle to help preserve part of our natural \nheritage. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.

A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to provide for a \nnational standard of interoperability and portability applicable to \nelectronic food stamp benefit transactions; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\nTHE ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER INTEROPERABILITY AND PORTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today with my Colleagues to \nintroduce the Electronic Benefit Transfer Interoperability and \nPortability Act of 1999. This legislation addresses the problem of food \nstamp beneficiaries being unable to redeem their benefits in authorized \nstores that may be located outside their state of residence.\n  As you may know, Congress passed legislation in 1996 that required \nthe federal government to deliver food stamp benefits electronically, \nrather than using the paper coupons. Most states have started the \nprocess of issuing plastic cards, very similar to ATM cards to access \nthese benefits. The federal government termed this new process, \nelectronic benefits transfer (EBT).\n  You may have noticed a separate button on the payment terminal in \nyour local supermarket with the designation ``EBT'' or a separate \nstand-alone payment terminal to handle these new transactions.\n  More than half of the country has already switched from the paper \ncoupons to this new EBT card. However, one significant issue is causing \nproblems in the program for retailers, states and recipients. That \nissue is the inability for recipients to use their state-issued cards \nacross state lines. This is especially true in communities that are \nnear a state border.\n  Under the old paper system, recipients could use the coupons in any \nstate in the country. Under the new electronic system, that is \ncurrently not the case. Customers go into a food store expecting to use \ntheir federal benefits to purchase food and when they cannot use their \nEBT cards, they become frustrated and dissatisfied with the food stamp \nprogram.\n  For example, under the old system, a food stamp recipient living in \nPalmyra, MO could use their food stamp coupons in their favorite \ngrocery store in Quincy, IL just over the Illinois border. Similarly, a \nrecipient living in Illinois could visit family in Tennessee and still \npurchase food for their children. Food stamp beneficiaries are not \nunlike the average shopper. Cross border shopping occurs for a variety \nof reasons. One reason is convenience; another equally important one is \nthe cost of groceries. The supermarket industry is very competitive. \nCustomers paying with every type of tender except EBT have the ability \nto shop around for the best prices. Shouldn't recipients of our \nnation's federal food assistance benefits be able to stretch their \ndollars without regard to state borders?\n  Another reason is convenience. While one of my constituents may live \nin the metro east area, they might work in St. Louis. Under the current \nsituation, if the only grocery store between their work and their home \nis in Missouri, the recipient cannot purchase food without traveling \nout of their way.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would once again, provide for \nthe portability of food assistance benefits and allow food stamp \nrecipients the flexibility of shopping at locations that they choose.\n\n[[Page S12644]]\n\n  Interoperability works well today with ATM/Debit cards, the type of \ncards that EBT was modeled after. Consumers and merchants are confident \nthat when a MAC card issued by a bank in Pittsburgh is presented, \nauthorization and settlement of that transaction will work the same as \nwhen a Star card, issued by Bank of America in California is presented. \nThis occurs regardless of where the merchant is located.\n  Unfortunately, this is currently not the case with EBT cards. If \nevery state operated their EBT program under a standard set of \noperating rules as this legislation requires, companies operating in \nmultiple states could be more efficient, resolve any discrepancies in \ncustomer accounts more quickly and ultimately hold down the price of \ngroceries for all consumers.\n  This legislation I am introducing is very straightforward. \nSpecifically, the legislation:\n  Requires interoperability by October 1, 2002, with a few exceptions \nneeding a waiver;\n  Requires USDA to ``adopt'' the national standard used by the majority \nof the States;\n  Requires USDA to pay for all interoperability costs (currently \nestimated by Benton International to be no more than a maximum of \n$500,000 annually when all states are on EBT systems or $160,000 for \nthe current year), significantly less than the $20 million USDA pays \nannually to the Federal Reserve to redeem coupons;\n  Requires contracts entered into after the date when the national \nstandard is adopted to use the standard, and for USDA to pay the \ninteroperability costs;\n  Includes transitional funding for states currently using a national \nstandard. Upon enactment, FNS will pay 100 percent of the costs of \ninteroperability fees for current states using a national standard \n(While the interoperability pilot sponsored by NACHA is due to expire \nin September, this would allow those states and beneficiaries in states \nparticipating in the pilot to continue to have interoperable \ntransactions beyond the pilot period without interruption.);\n  Requires current contracts that are not using the national standard \nto convert at the point of a new contract;\n  Includes a waiver process for current states with significant \ntechnological challenges to provide time to convert to the national \nstandard (This is intended to cover current smart card states).\n  This legislation is more about good government than it is about food \nstamps. Since 1996, the transition from paper coupons to electronic \nbenefit transfer has saved the federal government a significant amount \nof money. For example, while the food stamp caseload decreased 24 \npercent from fiscal year 1995 to 1998, food stamp production and \nredemption costs dropped by an impressive 39 percent. While it is \nestimated that the bill's implementation will cost the federal \ngovernment no more than $500,000 annually, it will save at least $20 \nmillion per year when paper coupons are a thing of the past.\n  This legislation is sound public policy that enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. I thank my Colleagues, Senators Leahy, Lugar, Harkin and \nCraig, for joining me as co-sponsors of this bill. I would stress to my \nfellow Senators that this legislation is vitally important to every \nfood stamp recipient, every state food stamp program administrator and \nevery grocery store nationwide. I ask each of you to join me as co-\nsponsors of this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Fitzgerald in \ncosponsoring the Electronic Benefit Interoperability and Portability \nAct of 1999.\n  The Food Stamp Program has been critical to diminishing hunger and \nimproving nutrition and health throughout our country. As the country's \nlargest source of food aid, approximately 18 million people--half of \nwhich are children--receive food stamp benefits every month. In my home \nState of Vermont, more than 20,000 households depend on food stamps to \nhelp feed their families.\n  In an effort to strengthen and streamline the Food Stamp Program, \nthree years ago Congress mandated that every State switch to an \nElectronic Benefits Transfer system for distributing food stamp \nbenefits. Operating like ATM or credit card machines at cash registers, \nEBT streamlines food stamps by eliminating the cumbersome paper system.\n  The implementation of the EBT system was left up to the States, and \nnearly 40 States currently have switched to this new system. EBT has \nalready demonstrated itself to be a more efficient system for \ndistributing food stamp benefits, and it promises to help reduce food \nstamp fraud.\n  However, three years into the implementation of EBT, a problem has \narisen--some State EBT systems do not match up with neighboring State \nEBT systems, leaving residents of border communities unable to utilize \ntheir food stamp benefits across State lines. This Federal benefit \nprogram has always been recognized and redeemable in every State, \nirrespective of where the actual food stamps were issued.\n  For some of our more rural States, the inability to access food stamp \nbenefits across State lines could mean the difference between traveling \na few miles to a grocery store in the next State to traveling an hour \nor more to the closest grocery store in one's home State. Clearly, this \ncreates quite a burden.\n  The bill which we are introducing today would correct this oversight \nby requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to adopt a national EBT \nstandard, and requiring that all States be EBT interoperable by 2002.\n  Vermont Commissioner of Social Welfare Jane Kitchel has voiced her \nsupport for this bill, as has the New England Convenience Store \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Fitzgerald for all of \nhis work on this issue. I believe that this bill will help make the \nFood Stamp Program more streamlined and efficient, and I am proud to \ncosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Fitzgerald):\n  S. 1734. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \ncontribute funds for the establishment of an interpretive center on the \nlife and contributions of President Abraham Lincoln; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  abraham lincoln presidential library\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nmy Illinois colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, in introducing legislation \nthat would authorize an important Department of the Interior project--\nthe Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois.\n  I should begin by confessing a Lincoln bias. Obviously, I'm an \nIllinoisan, but I hail from the same city, Springfield, that Abraham \nLincoln once called home. I practiced law in an office not far from the \nhistoric Lincoln-Herndon Law Office. I also represented a district in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives that included portions of the \ndistrict Congressman Abraham Lincoln represented in the 30th Congress--\n1847 to 1849. My home state, the ``Land of Lincoln,'' holds the former \nPresident in very high regard.\n  Abraham Lincoln is considered to be one of our nation's greatest \nPresidents. Yet, his works and the story of his life and public service \nare spread over numerous historic sites, monuments, museums, and \nprivate collections of Lincoln memorabilia. The State of Illinois has a \nmore than 42,000-item Lincoln Collection which contains national \ntreasures such as the Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation \nProclamation, and Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address. The Collection is \npart of the State's 12-million-item historical library, which is the \nnation's only public institution engaged in ongoing research on the \nlife and legacy of Abraham Lincoln.\n  Currently, 13 former Presidents, including Confederate leader \nJefferson Davis, have presidential libraries. Our 16th President \ncertainly deserves such a facility so children and people from around \nthe world can learn from the excellent examples Lincoln set during his \nlife and his Presidency and historians can continue to discover more \nabout the man who preserved the Union.\n  The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library would serve as a state-of-\nthe-art, interactive library, museum, and interpretative center where \nvisitors could learn about Abraham Lincoln and the events and places \nthat shaped his life and the history of our country. It would also \nserve as an academic archive and research facility for scholars to \nstudy Illinois' collection of Lincoln documents and personal effects.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would require that for every \ndollar of federal funds directed toward this project, two dollars must \ncome for other non-federal sources. The State of Illinois and the City \nof Springfield have already pledged significant financial support for \nthe Library. Also, it is important to note that the U.S. Department of \nthe Interior is not being asked to operate or maintain the facility. \nThe State of Illinois, through the Illinois Historic Preservation \nAgency, would run the day-to-day operations and handle upkeep of the \nLibrary.\n  Mr. President, the Illinois Congressional Delegation, Illinois \nGovernor George Ryan, and the City of Springfield strongly support this \nimportant project and this authorizing legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me and Senator Fitzgerald in constructing a lasting \nlegacy for Abraham Lincoln.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 59\n\n       Whereas the Panama Canal remains a vital economic and \n     strategic asset to the United States, its allies, and the \n     world;\n       Whereas the United States has maintained a military \n     presence in Panama since Panama gained its independence in \n     1903, ensuring the protection of the Canal and its unfettered \n     operations;\n       Whereas the United States Armed Forces have depended upon \n     the Panama Canal for rapid transit in times of global \n     conflict, including during World War II, the Korean War, the \n     Vietnam War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Persion Gulf \n     War;\n       Whereas the 1977 Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality \n     and Operation of the Panama Canal provides that Panama and \n     the United States have the joint responsibility to ensure \n     that the Panama Canal will remain open and secure, and \n     provides that each signatory, in accordance with their \n     constitutional processes, shall defend the Canal against any \n     threat to its neutrality and shall have the right to act \n     against threats against the peaceful transit of vessels \n     through the Canal;\n       Whereas the Government of Panama, in the bilateral Protocol \n     of Exchange of instruments of ratification, agreed to \n     consider negotiating future arrangements or agreements to \n     maintain military forces necessary to fulfill the \n     responsibility of both signatories to maintain the neutrality \n     of the Canal;\n       Whereas the common interests of Panama and the United \n     States have produced close relations between the two nations \n     and a shared interest in protecting the Canal and its \n     operations;\n       Whereas public opinion surveys in Panama consistently \n     demonstrate that an estimated 70 percent of the people of \n     Panama support a continued United States military presence in \n     Panama;\n       Whereas Panama and the United States are both confronting \n     growing problems with illegal drug trafficking, money \n     laundering, and narcoterrorism in the Western Hemisphere, and \n     those problems threaten peace and security in the region;\n       Whereas facilities now utilized by the United States Armed \n     Forces in Panama are essential to the coordination of any \n     counter-narcotic efforts in the region;\n       Whereas the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), \n     a narco-trafficking terrorist organization, is operating from \n     Panamanian territory and poses a risk to the security of \n     Panama and to the stability of Latin America;\n       Whereas the former United States Ambassador to Panama and \n     others have protested the lack of transparency and the \n     unorthodox bidding process in the granting of leases for the \n     port facilities at Balboa and Cristobal in 1997 during the \n     Administration of former Panamanian President Balladares; and\n       Whereas the passage of Panama Law Number 5 and the lease \n     agreements for the port facilities at Balboa and Cristobal, \n     because of\n\n[[Page S12647]]\n\n     reputed affiliations between the leaseholder and the People's \n     Republic of China and the People's Liberation Army, have \n     created concern about the future security of the Canal and \n     its continued unfettered operations and the future \n     disposition of United States facilities in Panama: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should negotiate a new base rights \n     agreement with the newly inaugurated Government of Panama--\n       (A) to permit stationing of United States Armed Forces in \n     Panama beyond December 31, 1999; and\n       (B) to ensure that the Panama Canal remains open, secure, \n     and neutral, consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty, the \n     Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of \n     the Panama Canal, and the resolutions of ratification \n     thereto;\n       (2) the President should ensure that United States military \n     facilities which could be utilized for stationing of United \n     States Armed Forces shall be fully maintained and secured if \n     the Government of Panama is willing to enter into good faith \n     negotiations for a continued United States military presence; \n     and\n       (3) the President should consult with Congress throughout \n     the negotiations described in paragraph (1).\n       Sec. 2.

Mr. President, I thank all of those who have been \ninvolved in trying to clear this piece of legislation. This is a very \nimportant piece of legislation for the preservation of the Paoli and \nBrandywine Battlefields. There is money in the Interior Appropriations \nbill to help with the State and local funds to combine to purchase a \npiece of the battlefield that would otherwise be sold for development. \nIt would be a real tragedy to lose a Revolutionary War battlefield \nbecause of inaction in the Senate.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan support we had to clear this particular \nbill because the deadline is tomorrow. The development contract would \nhave been exercised, and we would not have been able to purchase this \nland by clearing this bill today in time to get that done. It is very \nimportant to the people in that community.\n  I thank the minority leader, Senator Daschle, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Johnson, and many others who were involved in helping to clear \nthis issue on the Democratic side, and I certainly thank Senator \nMurkowski for his effort in putting that together on the Republican \nside. Obviously, the sponsors of the bill, Senator Specter and myself, \nare appreciative of the work that was done to take this bill out of \nwhat is a very big stack of bills that I know many Members want to have \nmoved in the Senate and to treat this specially because of the time \nsensitivity. At a time when comity is short because of how difficult \nthese last few weeks have been, people have put those kinds of \ndifferences aside and recognized what is in the best interest of all \ninvolved.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 3036, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3036) to provide for the interim continuation \n     of motor carrier functions by the Federal Highway \n     Administration.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3036. This \nlegislation is being considered to remedy language included in section \n338 of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2000. Contained in the FY 2000 DOT Conference \nReport was a provision that prohibits the enforcement of civil \npenalties against truck and commercial vehicles for safety violations \nuntil separate legislation is passed to move motor carrier safety \nfunctions out of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The \nprovision would also have the impact of eliminating authority to shut \ndown unfit carriers who pose a serious threat to highway safety.\n  While it is the intent of the committee to mark up a bill this month, \nit does not make sense to hamstring the agency charged with regulating \nand enforcing safety until the legislative process has taken its \ncourse. H.R. 3036 passed the House last night under suspension of the \nrules and quick consideration by the Senate today will ensure that the \nenforcement authority for motor carriers will be restored to the DOT. \nAs we consider authorizing legislation that will reorganize and \nreprioritize the functions of the Office of Motor Carriers, this \nlegislation will enable the federal government to continue to enforce \nimportant federal truck safety rules.\n  This bill is fair in that it provides authority to DOT to continue to \nlevy penalties until we finalize legislation on this matter. There are \npending bills in both bodies, it would be premature to change the \nfunctions of this critical safety agency prior to the completion of \nproperly considered legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we must take swift action to remedy a \nserious safety consequence which resulted upon enactment of H.R. 2084, \nthe Fiscal Year 2000 Transportation Appropriations Bill, P.L. 106-69 .\n  Signed into law last Saturday, section 338 of this law prevents the \nFederal Highway Administration (FHWA) from expending any funds for \nmotor carrier safety activities. Although the new law allows the \nSecretary to transfer the safety functions elsewhere, which has already \noccurred, there are some safety activities solely vested in FHWA and \nthe Secretary is precluded\n\n[[Page S12654]]\n\nby law from permitting any other entity to carry out those duties. In \nparticular, the Department's safety enforcement program has nearly come \nto a halt as a result of the Appropriators' language.\n  We must restore the Department's ability to fully enforce our federal \nmotor carrier safety regulations. Specifically, we need to restore the \ndepartment's authority to assess civil penalties when safety violations \nhave been identified. Currently, the Department can continue to carry \nout inspections, but in most cases has no authority to require a \ncarrier to take corrective action. This is like a police officer \npulling a driver over for speeding, but not being able to write a \nticket.\n  Last Mother's Day, 22 people lost their lives when a charter bus ran \noff the road and crashed. After the accident, the Federal Highway \nAdministration imposed the maximum fine against the company that it is \nstatutorily authorized to assess. If we do not act, the fine will be \nheld in abeyance. How can this be justified? I hope the Appropriators \nare finally the full consequences of this provision which was opposed \nby the authorizing Committees of jurisdiction.\n  The DOT Inspector General has repeatedly stated that strong \nenforcement with meaningful sanctions is needed at the Office of Motor \nCarriers. As long as this provision is allowed to stand, there will be \nno fines assessed against violators and efforts to strengthen Federal \nenforcement of motor carrier safety laws will be rendered meaningless.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Commerce Committee has been working to \nimprove truck safety. Many serious safety gaps have been identified and \nI believe we need to transfer authority for safety to a separate Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration. But, we need to act responsibly. We need \nto allow the authorization process to proceed. We need to put drivers \nand passengers ahead of unreviewed, unexamined quick-fix gimmicks that \nhave resulted in very disturbing and likely unintended consequences.\n  Last year, a similar attempt was made by the House Appropriations \nCommittee to strip FHWA from its authority over motor carrier safety \nmatters. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, which has jurisdiction over most federal transportation \nsafety policies, including motor carrier and passenger vehicle safety, \nI opposed this proposal, in part because it had never been considered \nby the authorizing committees of jurisdiction. The provision was \nultimately not enacted and I pledged that I would work to address motor \ncarrier safety concerns in this Congress. I have lived up to this \ncommitment.\n  At my request, the Inspector General of the Department of \nTransportation conducted a comprehensive analysis of federal motor \ncarrier safety activities. Serious safety gaps have been identified, \nand as such, the authorizing Committees of jurisdiction have been \nworking to move legislation to improve motor carrier safety. The \nCommerce Committee held a hearing on my specific safety proposal and we \nexpect to mark up that measure during the next Executive session. \nIndeed, we are working to move legislation through the regular \nlegislative process.\n  Public safety could be seriously jeopardized if Congress does not \ntake quick action to restore federal motor carrier safety enforcement \nactivities. I am aware safety improvements are necessary. I am working \nto pass those needed improvements. But halting motor carrier \nenforcement activities is clearly not in the interest of truck and bus \nsafety.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow the destruction of the Federal \ngovernment's motor carrier safety enforcement program. I fully support \npassage of H.R. 3036 to restore the Department's truck safety \nenforcement programs. I urge my colleague to support this much needed \nbill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statement relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3036) was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/14/senate-section/article/S12654-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1999\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.
