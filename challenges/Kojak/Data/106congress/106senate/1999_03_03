Mr. President, I am honored this morning to recognize \nCommander Mickey Vernon Ross, a great American from Arkansas who later \ntoday will be promoted to the rank of Captain in the United States \nNavy. With his promotion to Captain, Commander Ross not only earns the \nrespect and admiration of his country, he also earns a place in \nArkansas history, becoming the first African-American from our state to \nattain that high rank.\n  Commander Ross is a native of North Little Rock and comes from a \nproud family with a long record of military service, following his \nfather and three older brothers into the Armed Services. His father is \nno longer with us, but his mother, Minnie P. Ross, has traveled from \nArkansas to be at the ceremony formally recognizing her son's promotion \ntoday. As you might imagine, she is overjoyed knowing how hard her son \nhas worked to accomplish this feat. His wife, Mary Ann Ross, of Elaine, \nArkansas, which is my home area, and their two children, Timothy, age \n14, and Benjamin, age 6, will also be on hand to celebrate this \nmomentous occasion.\n  From an early age, Commander Ross has exhibited excellence in all \naspects of his life--academically, professionally and personally. More \nthan that, in a world short on heroes and role models to guide our \nchildren, Commander Ross is a shining example of the brilliant promise \nevery life holds. Hard work and an eager spirit still equal success in \nAmerica--no matter how difficult the challenges may be. It is my \nprivilege--indeed, my duty as a voice for my state--to hold him up as \nan example for others to see.\n  After graduating from North Little Rock High School in 1973, \nCommander Ross attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, \nMaryland, where he was commissioned an Ensign and graduated in 1977 \nwith a degree in Physical Science. In 1983, Commander Ross received a \nMaster of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate \nSchool in Monterey, California. Currently, Commander Ross is pursuing a \ndoctoral degree in Engineering Management at George Washington \nUniversity.\n  As an officer in the Navy, Commander Ross has served his country with \ndistinction. His first tour of duty was onboard the U.S.S. Ranger CV 61 \nwhere he helped the command receive top honors, the No. 1 Recruiting \nDistrict in the Nation. Later, on the U.S.S. Acadia as the Repair \nOfficer, his department received the highest award for fleet \nmaintenance support and the ship received the Navy ``E'' award from \nCommander Naval Surface Forces, Pacific. And I couldn't help but notice\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nthat in between his many assignments, Commander Ross found time to \nreturn to Arkansas to recruit Naval Officers at colleges and \nuniversities in our state. Today, Commander Ross is Director for Combat \nSystems for the Program Executive Officer for Aircraft Carriers at the \nNaval Sea Systems Command in Arlington, Virginia.\n  But Commander Ross' record as a student and a Naval Officer aren't \nthe only things for which I want to commend him this morning. Commander \nRoss is also a devoted husband and a wonderful father. His wife, Mary \nAnne, and their children must be very proud of him today.\n  My father fought in Korea and my grandfather fought in World War I \nand they taught me at an early age to have the highest respect for the \nmen and women in uniform who defend our nation. On behalf of the state \nof Arkansas and the United States Senate, I thank you, Commander Ross, \nfor your service to our country. I hope the honor you bestow on your \nfamily, our state and our nation today inspires others to follow your \nexample. I, for one, will be following your career with great interest \nand I suspect this will not be my last opportunity to recognize an \noutstanding achievement in your life.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2160-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 350\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ben \nHighton and Elizabeth Kuoppala be allowed to be on the floor during the \nduration of the debate on Ed-Flex.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, explain to my \ncolleagues and for those in the country who are going to now be \nfocusing on this bill, the Ed-Flex bill, why I started out yesterday \nspeaking in opposition to this motion to proceed and why I will be \ntaking several hours today to express my opposition to this piece of \nlegislation. There are a number of different things I am going to \ncover, but at the very beginning I would like to spell out what I think \nis the fundamental flaw to this legislation, the Ed-Flex bill. Frankly, \nI think my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, would have had an \nopportunity to carefully examine this legislation if we had a hearing, \nI mean a thorough hearing, or if we had waited to really examine in \nsome detail and some depth what has happened in the different Ed-Flex \nStates.\n  The General Accounting Office gives us a report in which they say it \nlooks like some good work has been done, but we don't really have a \nfull and complete understanding of what has happened in these Ed-Flex \nStates. I think what this piece of legislation, called Ed-Flex--and I \ngrant it is a great title, and I grant it is a winning political \nargument to say let's give the flexibility to the States and let's get \nthe Federal Government out of this--but what this piece of legislation \nis essentially saying is that we, as a national community, we as a \nNational Government, we as a Federal Government representing the people \nin our country, no longer are going to maintain our commitment to poor \nchildren in America. That is what this is all about.\n  What this piece of legislation essentially says to States and to \nschool districts is: Look, when it comes to the core requirements of \ntitle I, core requirements that have to do with qualified teachers, \nthat have to do with high standards for students, that have to do with \nstudents meeting those standards and there being a measurement and some \nresult and some evaluation, these standards no longer necessarily will \napply. What this legislation says is, when it comes to what the title I \nmission has been all about, for poor children in America--that is to \nsay that we want to make sure that the money, first and foremost, goes \nto the neediest schools--that standard no longer will necessarily \napply.\n  As a matter of fact, in 1994, one of the things that we did in the \nElementary/Secondary Education Act reauthorization was we sought to \nconcentrate title I funds by requiring districts to spend title I on \nschools with over 75 percent poverty-stricken students first. That \nrestriction has had the desired effect. Only 79 percent of schools with \nover 75 percent poverty received title I funds in 1994. Today, over 95 \npercent of those schools receive it.\n  So, Mr. President--and I want to make it clear that I will have an \namendment--one of the amendments that I will have to this piece of \nlegislation, if we proceed with this legislation, is an amendment that \nsays that the funding has to first go to schools that have a 75 percent \nor more low-income student population.\n  I cannot believe my colleagues are going to vote against that. If \nthey want to, let them. But if they do, they will have proved my \npoint--that we are now about to pass a piece of legislation or a good \nmany Republicans and, I am sorry to say, Democrats may pass a piece of \nlegislation that will no longer provide the kind of guarantee that in \nthe allocation of title I funds for poor children that the neediest \nschools will get served first. I cannot believe that we are about to do \nthat. I cannot believe this rush to recklessness. I cannot believe the \nway people have just jammed this bill on to the floor of the Senate. I \ncannot believe that there isn't more opposition from Democrats.\n  Mr. President, the second amendment that I am going to have, which I \nthink will really speak to whether or not people are serious about \nflexibility with accountability, is an amendment which essentially \nsays, look, here are the core requirements of title I.\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\n  The reason we passed title I as a part of the Elementary/Secondary \nEducation Act back in 1965--that was almost 35 years ago--the reason we \npassed title I was we understood, as a nation, whether or not my \ncolleagues want to admit to this or not, that in too many States poor \nchildren and their families who were not the big givers, who were not \nthe heavy hitters, who do not make the big contributions were falling \nbetween the cracks.\n  So we said that, as a nation, we would make a commitment to making \nsure that there were certain core requirements that all States had to \nlive up to to make sure that these children received some help. Thus, \nthe core requirements of title I: Make sure they are qualified \nteachers; make sure low-income students are held to high standards; \nmake sure there is a clear measurement of results.\n  Let me just read actually some of the provisions that would be tossed \naside by Ed-Flex in its present form: the requirement that title I \nstudents be taught by a highly qualified professional staff; the \nrequirement that States set high standards for all children; the \nrequirement that States provide funding to lowest-income schools first; \nthe requirement that States hold schools accountable for making \nsubstantial annual progress toward getting all students, particularly \nlow-income and limited-English-proficient students, to meet high \nstandards; the requirement that funded vocational programs provide \nbroad education and work experience rather than narrow job training.\n  These are the core requirements. I will have an amendment that will \nsay that every State and every school district receiving title I \nfunding will be required to meet those requirements, will be called \nupon to meet those requirements.\n\n  Mr. President, right now this legislation throws all of those core \nrequirements overboard. This legislation represents not a step forward \nfor poor children in America; it represents a great leap backwards. \nThis piece of legislation turns the clock back 35 years. It comes to \nthe floor of the Senate without a full hearing in committee; it comes \nto the floor of the Senate without any opportunity to see any report \nwith a thorough evaluation of what those Ed-Flex States have done; it \ncomes to the floor of the Senate with the claim being made that Ed-Flex \nrepresents a huge step forward for education and for the education of \npoor children in America. It is absolutely ridiculous.\n  I will talk over the next couple of hours about what we could be \ndoing and should be doing for children if we are real. This piece of \nlegislation does not lead to any additional opportunities for low-\nincome children. This piece of legislation does not dramatically \nincrease the chances that they will do well in school. This piece of \nlegislation does absolutely nothing by way of making sure that we have \njustice for poor children in America.\n  To the contrary, this piece of legislation does not call for--and I \nam pretty sure that it will not happen, although I will have \nlegislation that will try to make it happen--for an additional \nexpenditure of funds for title I programs. This piece of legislation \ndoes nothing for the schools in St. Paul and Minneapolis that have over \n50 percent low-income students and still don't receive any money \nwhatsoever because there isn't enough money and there aren't enough \nresources that are going to our school districts.\n  This piece of legislation does nothing to make sure children, when \nthey come to kindergarten, are ready to learn, that they know how to \nspell their names, that they know the alphabet, that they know colors \nand shapes and sizes, that they have been read to widely, that they \nhave been intellectually challenged. This piece of legislation does \nnothing to assure that will happen. This piece of legislation does not \ndo anything to dramatically improve the quality of children's lives \nbefore they go to school and when they go home from school. And I want \nto talk about that as well.\n  I will tell you what this piece of legislation does. This piece of \nlegislation says, we, as the U.S. Senate, are no longer going to worry \nabout whether States and school districts live by the core requirements \nof title I. We are just going to give you the money and say, Do what \nyou want to do. What this piece of legislation says is we are no longer \ngoing to worry about whether or not States and school districts provide \nfunding first to those schools with a 75 percent or more low-income \nstudent population, the neediest schools. We are just going to say, Do \nwhat you want. And this is being passed off as something positive for \npoor children in America?\n  Again, I will have two amendments--I will have a number of \namendments, quite a few amendments--but two amendments that I think are \ngoing to be critical by way of sort of testing out whether or not we \nare talking about accountability or not: One, an amendment that says, \nagain, the allocation of funding by States and school districts means \nthat those schools that have 75 percent or more low-income students get \nfirst priority, and, second of all, an amendment that says, here are \nthe core requirements of title I. This is what has made title I \na successful program. And this is fenced off, and in no way, shape or \nform will any State or any school district be exempt from these core \nrequirements.\n\n  Why would any State or school district in the United States of \nAmerica not want to live up to the requirements that we have highly \nqualified teachers, that we hold the students to high standards, that \nwe measure the results, and we report the results?\n  Mr. President, before talking more about title I, let me talk a \nlittle bit about context. And it is interesting. I am going to do this \nwith some indignation. And I want to challenge my colleagues. I want to \nchallenge my colleagues not in a hateful way, but I certainly want to \nchallenge my colleagues.\n  We are a rich country. Our economy is humming along. We are at peak \neconomic performance. But fully 35 million Americans are hungry or at \nrisk of hunger. Every year, 26 million Americans, many of them \nchildren, go to food banks for sustenance.\n  Last year, the requests for emergency food assistance rose 16 \npercent. Many of those requests were unanswered. I would like for \neveryone to listen to this story. A Minnesota teacher asked his class, \n``How many of you ate breakfast this morning?'' As he expected, only a \nfew children raised their hands. So he continued, ``How many of you \nskipped breakfast this morning because you don't like breakfast?''\n  Lots of hands went up. And how many of you skipped breakfast because \nyou didn't have time for it? Many other hands went up. He was pretty \nsure by then why the remaining children hadn't eaten, but he didn't \nwant to ask them about being poor, so he asked, How many of you skipped \nbreakfast because your family doesn't usually eat breakfast? A few more \nhands were raised. Finally, he noticed a small boy in the middle of the \nclassroom whose hand had not gone up. Thinking the boy hadn't \nunderstood, he asked, And why didn't you eat breakfast this morning? \nThe boy replied, his face serious, ``It wasn't my turn.''\n  Do you want to do something for children and education of poor \nchildren? Don't eliminate standards and accountability with title I. \nMake sure those children don't go hungry. The U.S. Senate, 2 years ago, \nput into effect a 20-percent cut in the Food Stamp Program, which is \nthe single most important safety net nutritional program for children \nin America, and my colleagues have the nerve to come out here with \nsomething called Ed-Flex and make the claim that this is going to do \nall these great things for poor children in America.\n  Let me repeat it: We have entirely too many children that are not \nonly poor but hungry in America. We put into effect 2 years ago a 20-\npercent cut which will take effect 2002 in food stamp assistance, which \nby all accounts is the single most important safety net program to make \nsure that children don't go hungry. I will have an amendment to restore \nthat funding before this session is out.\n  Children don't do real well in school when they are hungry. They \ndon't do real well in school when they haven't eaten breakfast. If we \nwant to help those children, this is the kind of thing we ought to do \nto make sure that these low-income families have the resources so that \nthey can at least put food on the table. I can't believe that in the \nUnited States of America today, as\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\nrich a country as we are, we can't at least do that.\n\n  Instead, we have something called Ed-Flex. For all of the families \nwith all of the hungry children, for all of the children that are poor \nin America--a quarter of all children under the age of 3 are growing up \npoor in America; 50 percent of all children of color under the age of 3 \nare growing up poor in America--Ed-Flex doesn't mean anything. Ed-Flex \nmeans absolutely nothing.\n  The New York Times told the story of Anna Nunez and of hundreds of \nthousands of families like her. Up a narrow stairway, between a pawn \nshop and a Dominican restaurant, Anna Nunez and her three children live \nin a single, illegal room that suffocates their dreams of a future. It \nis a $350-a-month rectangle with no sink and no toilet, that throbs at \nnight with the restaurant's music. Ms. Nunez' teenagers, Kenny and \nWanda, split a bunk bed, while she squeezes into a single bed with \nlittle Katrina, a pudgy 4-year-old with tight braids. Out of the door \nand down the linoleum-lined hallway is the tiny bathroom they share \nwith five strangers.\n  Last winter, tuberculosis traveled from Kenny to his mother and \nyounger sisters in a chain of infection as inevitable as their \nbickering. Inevitable, too, is the fear of fire: Life in 120 square \nfeet means the gas stove must stand perilously close to their beds. \nKenny, at age 18, is a restless young man in a female household. Ask \nhim what bothers him most, and he flatly states that he has the only \nway to get some privacy--``I close my eyes.''\n  At night, Anna said, when the mice crawl over us in bed, it feels \neven more crowded.\n  What should we be doing on the floor of the U.S. Senate if we are \nreally committed to children in America, and if we are committed to \npoor children in America? We would be making a dramatic investment in \naffordable housing, which is receiving crisis proportion. But these \nchildren and these families are not the ones who march on Washington \nevery day.\n  We want to talk about what will help children in school. If we want \nto talk about family values, we ought to talk about making sure that \nthese children don't live in rat-infested slum housing, but have some \ndecent shelter. But we don't. Instead, we have Ed-Flex. Ed-Flex will do \nabsolutely nothing for these children.\n  I have a close friend that many staffers know well and I think many \nSenators know well because of his brilliance and also because he is \nsort of a perfect example of someone who really lives such an honest \nlife. He treats all of us, regardless of our political viewpoint, with \nsuch generosity--Bill Dauster. My friend, Bill Dauster, wrote something \nwhich I think applies to this debate:\n\n       We need to restore the family values that put our children \n     first, for if we do not advance the interests of those who \n     will inherit the future of our society, then we have no \n     vision. And if we do not protect the most helpless of our \n     society, then we have no heart. And if we do not support the \n     most innocent of our society, then we have no soul.\n\n  I think he is absolutely right.\n  Mr. President, I will talk more about the concerns and circumstances \nin children's lives in a while, but I did want to give some context \nbefore returning to title I, and then I am going to develop my \narguments about what we should be doing specifically in education.\n\n  I will say one more time that I find it very interesting that we have \na piece of legislation on the floor that purports to be some major step \nforward for poor children. As a matter of fact, most of the Ed-Flex \nwaiver requests have dealt with title I, which deals with poor \nchildren. That is why I am talking about poor children. At the same \ntime, this is the U.S. Congress that not only has no positive agenda to \nmake sure that poor children aren't hungry and therefore able to learn, \ndoesn't have any positive agenda to make sure that poor children live \nin decent housing and therefore can come to school ready to learn, but \nactually has cut nutrition programs for children, and now brings a \npiece of legislation out which, all in the name of flexibility, is \nsupposed to do all of these great things for poor children.\n  Now, let me return to title I. Let me explain my indignation. My \nindignation about this particular bill goes further than what I have \nsaid. Not only does it represent a retreat on the part of the U.S. \nSenate from a commitment to poor children in America, not only does it \nrepresent a retreat from any basic accountability so that the core \nrequirements of title I--I will repeat it one more time--that have to \ndo with highly qualified teachers and high standards and those \nstandards being met--no longer apply if a State or local school \ndistrict doesn't choose to comply, not only does this piece of \nlegislation abandon what we did in 1994 with positive effect, that is \nto say some assurance that the money would first go to the neediest \nschools. In addition to adding insult to injury--I don't even know why \nthis bill is on the floor--to add insult to injury, this piece of \nlegislation does absolutely nothing by way of, not even one word, \ncalling for more funding.\n  I will tell you what people in Minnesota are telling me. I am \nassuming--but I am not so sure it has happened--I would like to believe \nthat my colleagues who are in such a rush to pass this piece of \nlegislation have spent a lot of time with principals and teachers and \nteacher assistants who are working with the title I program. I have to \nbelieve that. Well, if you have, I want to find out--when we get into \ndebate, I would like for my colleagues to identify for me a specific \nstatute in title I right now that is an impediment to reform. Tell me \nwhat exactly we are talking about.\n  I will tell you what I hear from people in Minnesota. They are not \nworried about flexibility. What they are worried about is, they don't \nhave enough money. What we hear from those men and women who are \nworking with poor children in the title I program is, ``We don't have \nenough resources.'' That is what they are telling us. In that sense, \nthis particular piece of legislation is a bit disingenuous. We talk \nabout flexibility, that is the sort of slogan here, but we don't \nprovide any additional resources.\n  Examples: St. Paul. I talked about some of this yesterday, but I \nthink it is well worth presenting this data. There are 20 schools \naltogether--there are 60 K-through-12 public schools in St. Paul, MN. \nThere are 20 schools in St. Paul with at least a 50 percent free and \nreduced lunch--that is the way we define low-income--that receive no \ntitle I funds at all--one-third of the schools.\n  Let's talk about urban schools. I would like to ask my colleagues, \nhave you been in the urban schools? Did the principals and the teachers \nand the families in these urban schools--was the thing they were saying \nto you over and over again, ``We need to have Ed-Flexibility''? Or were \nthey saying, ``We need more resources to work with these children''? \nWhat were they saying to you? I will tell you what they were saying to \nme: ``We don't have the resources.'' One-third of St. Paul's schools \nhave significant poverty, a low-income student body, and receive no \ntitle I funds to eliminate the learning gap. At Humboldt Senior High \nSchool, on the west side of St. Paul, 68 percent of the students are \nlow-income; no title I funding. I visited the school. I try to be in a \nschool about every 2 weeks.\n\n  For those listening to the debate--and I am taking this time because \nI want to slow this up. I want people in the country, and journalists, \npeople who cover this or who write and cover it--so people in the \ncountry will know what is going on. I can be put in parentheses and \nkeep me out of it, but I want the people to know what is going on. I \ndon't think legislation like this that has the potential of doing such \nharm to low-income children should zoom through the U.S. Senate.\n  As I say, at Humboldt Senior High 68 percent of the students are on \nfree and reduced lunch; no title I. So the question is, How can that \nbe? The answer is that in Minnesota, altogether, this year, we had $96 \nmillion for title 1 programs. We can use double that amount of funding, \ntriple that amount of funding. What happens is that after we allocate \nthe money in St. Paul to the schools that have an even higher \npercentage of low-income students, there is no funding left. And we \nhave Ed-Flex that is such a ``great response'' to the challenges facing \nthese families and these children, which isn't even talking about \nproviding more funding.\n  My prediction is that, come appropriations, don't count on it. Don't \ncount on it. It won't happen, though some of us will fight like heck to \ntry to make it happen.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n  Several middle schools receive no title I funding. Battle Creek \nMiddle School has 77 percent low-income students and no title I funds.\n  By the way, I argue that I have often believed--since I have some \ntime here today, I can go a little slower--I have often believed that \nthe elementary school teachers just do God's work. I think it starts \nthere. I was a college teacher, but I know that elementary school \nteaching is more important; I am sure of it. If I had to do it over \nagain, I think I would have been an elementary school teacher, if I \ncould be creative enough. I was a wrestling coach, but I would have \nliked to teach elementary school. I did coach the junior high school \nwrestling team in Northfield. Those are difficult years. I think any \nkind of support we can give kids who are middle school or junior high \nschool age, we ought to do so.\n  What is the kind of support we can do with title I? It is a good \nprogram. That is why I am on the floor. This is a good thing we did in \n1965. This was a good thing we did in reauthorization in 1994. It means \nthere are more teacher assistants, more one-on-one instruction, more \ncommunity outreach, and more parental involvement. It is not easy \nbecause a lot of not such beautiful things are happening in the lives \nof many children in America today. I know that. I am in the \ncommunities. But this makes a difference. I will tell you, we could do \na lot at Battle Creek Middle School if we had the funding. Frost Lake \nElementary School has 66 percent low-income children and no title I \nfunding.\n  So can I ask this question: What exactly are these schools going to \nbe flexible with? Are they going to be flexible with zero dollars? What \nare they going to get to be flexible about? Do they get to choose \nbetween zero and zero? Is that the flexibility? Let's get real. Let's \nget real. The U.S. Congress, a couple years ago--because it is so easy \nto bash the poor--cut the Food Stamp Program by 20 percent. We have \ndone next to nothing by way of pre-K. That is where the Federal \nGovernment is a real player in education. I will talk about that in a \nmoment. We have done next to nothing by way of getting resources to \nfamilies so there could be decent child care. And we are not talking \nabout increasing the funding for title I, but we are talking about \nflexibility.\n\n  Some other schools: Eastern Heights Elementary, 64 percent low-\nincome, no title 1. Mississippi Magnet School, 67 percent low-income \nstudents and no title I. They get to be flexible between zero and zero. \nThey get to choose how to spend no money. They get to imagine and \ndream. But do you want to know something? They need to do more than \nthat. I am not going to let this piece of legislation go through this \nfloor like this. I am sure some of my colleagues will be angry, but I \nam not going to let this zoom through the Senate without a lot of \ndiscussion. I want people to know exactly what it is.\n  Now, it could be--I have to be careful because it could be that \npeople say: Well, you know what, all right, case made; we know what it \ndoesn't do; but, nevertheless, in terms of what it tries to do, let's \nhave more flexibility. These are two different things. I don't, first \nof all, want this to go through as the ``big education initiative.'' It \nis not. It is not. I don't want this piece of legislation to go through \nas the sort of legislation that represents the ``bold response'' on the \npart of the United States of America to the concerns and circumstances \nof poor children. It is not. And I certainly don't want this piece of \nlegislation to go through with the slogan of ``flexibility,'' unless we \nhave real accountability.\n  When we get to our amendments, I will have an amendment on \naccountability. I know Senator Kennedy will have an amendment on \naccountability. I know that Senator Reid will have an amendment on \naccountability. We will see if people are ``real'' about that.\n  By the way, what I hear from the St. Paul School District is that if \nthey had another $8 million in title I funding, they would use it to \nreduce class size. They would use it to increase parental involvement. \nThey would use it to hire additional staff to work with students with \ngreatest needs. There are a lot of ways they could use it. But we are \nnot providing for the funding that they need. This is one of the things \nthat I just hate about this vicious zero sum game, especially in \ngreater Minnesota, which is rural. Here is what happens.\n  Don't anyone believe I am giving only urban examples somehow about \nthe problem of children that need additional support. The whole goal of \ngetting it right for all the kids in our country is not just an urban \nissue. It is suburban, and it is rural. But see, here is what happens \nwhen we don't provide enough funding. I don't know why we don't call \nthis an unfunded mandate. It may not technically be, but in many ways \nit is.\n  We talk a lot about IDEA. We should. I say to the Chair, who is a \nformer Governor, that the Governors make a good point. And I am in \ncomplete agreement that we ought to, when it comes to children with \nspecial needs, be providing for funding. I don't know why we don't talk \nabout this, because you know what happens, I say to my colleague from \nVermont. There is strong rural community as well in Vermont. What \nhappens is that in those schools in the rural areas where maybe there \nis a 35 percent, low-income, or 30 or 20 percent, they say, ``Listen. \nWe need some funding.'' But we get into this zero sum game with not \nenough funding. It gets divided up in such a way that it makes sense \nthat the funding goes first to the neediest schools. And there isn't \nany. And there isn't any.\n  Minneapolis--this is just looking at estimates for next year. K \nthrough 12 schools in Minneapolis: 31 schools will receive no title I \nfunds; 14 schools with at least 50 percent free and reduced lunch \nrecipients will receive no title I; 14 schools that have 50 percent \nlow-income student population will receive no title I funding. \nBurroughs Elementary School, 43 percent low-income, no title I funding. \nThe school would be eligible, if we had funding.\n  For almost $100,000 in title I next year, they would use the money to \nbuy computers for special reading software, additional assistance in \nreading and math, work for students in small groups, and to close the \nachievement gap. But they can't do it. We are going to give them Ed-\nFlex. We are going to give them Ed-Flex. Anthony Elementary School, 43 \npercent free and reduced lunch, again, the operational definition of \nlow-income, receive no title I. The school would be eligible if we got \nfunding we needed--$154,000 next year--and they would use the money for \nafterschool tutoring, that is what we should be doing, if we are \n``real.'' We will have an amendment on that before this debate is all \nover.\n  They would use the money for afterschool tutoring to improve math and \nscience, to improve technology, to increase staffing, and to improve \nparental involvement.\n  Marcy Open Elementary School, 44 percent low-income, they are going \nto lose their educational assistance if they don't get the funding they \nneed. Kenny Elementary School, 39 percent low-income, no title 1. If \nthey were going to get the funding that they deserve, they would have \nabout another $9,000 that they would be eligible for, and they would \nuse that to hire tutors who are trained to tutor small group \ninstruction, to buy certain computer-assistance instruction, to make \nthe Read Naturally Program available to more students, and to focus on \nstudents who are English language learners. I think this whole issue of \nstudents who are English language learners is the key issue here.\n  One of the things that is so unconscionable to me about all of this \nand the way we give title 1 the short end of the stick is that we have \na lot of students right now who are from families--Minneapolis, MN--I \nthink I am right. Don't hold me to these figures. But, roughly \nspeaking, in Minneapolis students come from families where there are 90 \nlanguages and dialects spoken. That is Minneapolis, MN. That is not New \nYork City. In St. Paul, it is about 70 languages and dialects spoken. \nIt is not uncommon. I remember being in a Jackson Elementary School \nmeeting with fourth grade students, and there were five different \nlanguages spoken in that class of 25 or 30. For a lot of those \nstudents, they need additional help. We know why. That is a big \nchallenge.\n  Title I really helps if the funding is there. But we are not talking \nabout--I haven't heard any Republican colleagues talking about \ndramatically increasing the funding for title I. I haven't heard the \nPresident talk about it. He has talked about $110 billion\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\nmore for the Pentagon over the next 6 years, and $12.5 billion next \nyear. And the President of the United States, a Democrat, says \neducation is his highest priority, and he doesn't even call for an \nadditional $2 billion for education for the whole Nation. You would \nthink that he would call for as big of an increase, I say to my \ncolleague from Vermont, for the Education Department and education as \nhe would for the Pentagon, if education was his No. 1 priority. I think \nthat is part of the problem. I think the White House has absolutely \ncaved on this issue. I cannot believe their silence. I cannot believe \nit.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit about some success \nof title I. I think I read a couple of these letters last night. But I \nthink it is worth talking about again.\n  Let me start with Annastacia Belladonna Maldonado from the \nMinneapolis Chicano-Latino Council who says:\n\n       I am very concerned about the hurried fashion in which \n     Congress is handling S. 280. Given that ESEA is up for \n     reapproval, it seems reasonable, more appropriate, and \n     certainly a more dramatic way of addressing issues and \n     concerns that Ed-Flex has written. At the very least I would \n     expect a series of responsible considerations of all aspects \n     of S. 280 be addressed by the committee before proceeding to \n     an open debate.\n\n  Well, it is too late. We are on the floor. Secretary Riley, who I \npersonally think is probably the gentlest and kindest person in \ngovernment--I can't fault him for his commitment to education. I can't \nfault him for his courage as Governor of South Carolina who called for \nan increase in taxes to fund public education. He came to our \ncommittee, I say to my colleague from Vermont, a couple of weeks ago, \nand he said we believe that since title I represents really a big part \nof what the Federal Government does here, we would prefer that when you \ngo through your reauthorization of the Elementary Secondary Education \nAct, that you put off this Ed-Flex legislation, which has such huge \nconsequences, until then. But we didn't. While I appreciated the words \nof Secretary Riley, I don't see a lot of fight on the part of the \nadministration on this question.\n  A constituent of mine, Vicki Turner, says:\n\n       The title I program of the Minneapolis public schools \n     provided not only help for my two children, but the parental \n     involvement program was crucial in helping me develop as an \n     individual parent and now a teacher for the program.\n\n  Gretchen Carlson Collins, title I director of Hopkins School \nDistrict, a suburb of Minneapolis, says:\n\n       There is no better program in education than title I, of \n     the ESEA. We know it works.\n\n  She didn't say, ``Oh. We are just strangled with regulations. It \ndoesn't work.'' In fact, I haven't heard that. I haven't had people in \nMinnesota say this is the statute that has been changed. As a matter of \nfact, I would say to my colleagues, if there is something right now in \nthe title I statute that is an impediment to the kind of steps we need \nto take to improve educational opportunities for low-income children, \nplease identify it, and then we will change it. But what you want to do \nis throw out all of the accountability.\n  You want to basically have the Federal Government, which represents \nthe Nation, a national community, you want us to remove ourselves from \nany kind of protection for these low-income children. You want to say \nthat the very core requirements that have made title I so important and \nso positive in the lives of children, albeit we have enough funding, we \nno longer will require that States and the school districts live up to \nthese requirements. That is what you want to do. That is not \nacceptable. I don't care if you call it ``Ed-Flexability.'' I don't \ncare if you have all of the political arguments, 10-second sound bites \ndown pat. Give the power back to the States, get the Federal Government \nout, get rid of all of the Washington rules and regulations.\n  You can say that over and over and over again, and I will tell you, \neven though some of you won't like it, that I am all for flexibility. I \nwas a community organizer. I am all for people at the local level \nmaking a lot of the decisions in terms of how they design programs and \nwhat they do. But I will tell you something else. There is a whole \nhistory of all too many States not making poor children and their \nfamilies top priorities when it comes to commitment.\n  I am not about to let this piece of legislation just fly through here \nwithout pointing out what we are doing, which is we are abandoning a \n35-year-old commitment on the part of the Federal Government that we \nwill at least have some minimal standard that will guarantee some \nprotection that poor children will get the assistance they need in the \nUnited States of America.\n  That is what this legislation does. And this legislation could be \ndifferent legislation if strong accountability measures were passed--\nstrong, not wishy-washy language. And we will see. We will see, because \nI am, again, all for the flexibility part, but I am not for abandoning \nthis commitment to low-income children in the country.\n  John and Helen Matson say:\n\n       How could anyone question the need for a strong ESEA? Ed-\n     Flex waivers are an invitation to undermine the quality of \n     public schools.\n\n  That is an e-mail I received.\n  High school senior Tammie Jeanelle Joby was in Title I in third \ngrade. She says:\n\n       Title I has helped make me the hard-working student that I \n     am. My future plan after high school is to attend St. \n     Scholastica--\n\n  Which is a really wonderful college in Duluth, MN--\n\n       I may specialize in special education or kindergarten.\n\n  And I think that is great.\n  Then here is something from Claudi Fuentes from the Minnesota Urban \nCoalition. He opposes Ed-Flex. And you know what he says instead: \n``Focus on all day, every day kindergarten.''\n  People in the communities, they have the wisdom. I will come back to \nsome of their wisdom a little while later, but it is pretty \ninteresting. The whole idea of Ed-Flex is let's get it back to the \nlocal communities. You know what. Why don't we listen to people in the \nlocal communities?\n  Did we spend any time, I would love to find out--I can't wait for the \ndebate. Here is the question I am going to ask of the authors of the \nlegislation: How much time did you spend with low-income parents? How \nmany meetings did you have with the parents? How many meetings did you \nhave with the children? How many meetings did you have in communities \nwith those students and those families who are going to be most \naffected by this legislation? I will be very interested in hearing the \nanswer. I will be very interested in what they say because, frankly, I \ndon't even hear anybody talking about it. When I go into cafes in \nMinnesota, nobody comes up to me and says, Are you for or against Ed-\nFlex? They don't even know what it is. They will tell me that I am a \nsingle parent or we are two parents and we have an income of $30,000 a \nyear and we can't afford child care. Child care costs us as much as \ncollege tuition now. Can anything be done about that?\n  They will say what about a tax credit? How about we pass today a \nrefundable $2,000-a-year tax credit for child care, for families with \nincomes up to $50,000 a year? Why don't we do something real?\n  That is what people talk about. Or they talk about--and I will talk \nabout early childhood development in a moment--or they talk about \nworking and their kids are home after school and they are very worried \nand what about afterschool care? Can something be done by way of \nproviding some adults to look after our kids when school is over \nbecause we are both working?\n  Or they will talk about how their daughter has a really--she has an \nabscessed tooth, and I don't have any dental care; we can't afford it, \nand she goes to school in pain. She can't learn when she is in pain.\n  The language is very concrete. I don't hear community people--as long \nas we are saying the case for Ed-Flex is to decentralize, I don't hear \ncommunity people saying it. Sometimes I think Washington, DC, is the \nonly city I have ever lived in where when the Governors come to town \neverybody says, The grassroots is here; let's hear from the grassroots. \nI have never lived anywhere else where that happens. ``The Governors \nrepresent the grassroots of America.''\n  Well, I would suggest to you, since most of what Ed-Flex is really \nabout is waivers and title I, that grassroots goes down to a little bit \nlower level. It goes to the community level and starts with the \nchildren and the parents who\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nwill be affected by what we do or by what we don't do.\n  Mr. President, let me talk about what would make a difference as \nopposed to this piece of legislation, which represents at best a great \nleap sideways and at worst a great leap backwards. And let me talk \nabout equity in education, which is just another way of talking about \nthe kind of inequality that exists right now. Let me talk about \nlearning gaps.\n  And by the way, I don't have any evidence of this. A friend of mine, \nColin Greer, who is head of the New World Foundation, told me--I think \nSenator Jeffords would be interested in this. I haven't seen the data. \nIt would be interesting. I think this is what Colin said. He said that \nactually the United States of America measures up well against any \nother country in terms of our educational attainment, educational tests \nif you take title I students and put them in parenthesis for a moment. \nIn other words, the learning gap is essentially, these are issues of \nrace and gender and poverty in children. That is really what the \nlearning gap is about. These are the kids who come to school behind and \nfall further behind.\n  So let me talk about the learning gaps. They are prevalent at all \neducation levels. In general, the poor and minorities do worse on just \nabout any measurement of achievement, be it the Federal Government's \nnational assessment of educational progress or real-world outcomes like \nhigh school and college graduation rates\n  Boy, I hope I didn't read this the right way, but I think I read the \nother day that in California there are five times as many African \nAmerican men ages 18 to 26 or 30 in prison than in college. I think I \nread that the other day, that in California there are five times as \nmany African American men ages 18 to 30 in prison than in college.\n  And, by the way, there is a higher correlation between high school \ndropout and winding up in prison than between cigarette smoking and \nlung cancer. So we should be doing everything we can to make sure that \nkids do well in school and don't drop out. And Senator Bingaman will \nhave an amendment that speaks to that.\n  The disparities that we see--if you think that where I am going is \nblaming the children, no, I am not. Now, let me be clear about this \nbecause we have a lot of this going on, too, and I would like to talk a \nlittle bit about the White House again.\n  When I say that in any measure of achievement the poor and \n``minorities'' fall way behind, I am not now about to engage in blaming \nthose children and blaming those families because a large part of these \ndisparities are caused by unequal educational opportunities. These \nstudents have unequal access to key resources that strongly affect \ntheir achievement levels. Preparation to begin schools, teacher \nquality, class size, curriculum content, school infrastructural \nquality--and I will talk about all of that. Let me just jump ahead now.\n  I am sorry to be speaking with some anger here today. I don't know, \nmaybe the President got it from a poll--you know, be against social \npromotion. I am a Democrat. Say you are tough on social promotion \nbecause everybody says, boy, I tell you what, you are right; those \nstudents, they just shouldn't be promoted if they haven't reached an \neducational attainment. That is just terrible. Well, you know what it \nis. But here is what is so outrageous about this latest given.\n  You have a White House that sends a budget over here--and I will be \ntalking about it--that does precious little by way of making sure the \nchildren come to school ready to learn. We know that is the most \ncritical time. It does absolutely nothing by way of really investing \nresources in afterschool care. We have this huge disparity that I am \nabout to go into, where all too many kids go to schools where the \ntoilets don't work, where the heating doesn't work, where there is no \nair conditioning, where the buildings are crumbling, when they are \nhungry, where there are not enough textbooks, where there aren't \ncomputers, where there aren't adequate lab facilities. They don't have \nthe same opportunity to do well. So, now, all in the name of \neducational rigor--I was a teacher--now what we are going to do is \nflunk them again. It is outrageous.\n  We don't do anything to make sure that they have the same chance to \ndo well on these tests, but we will give them the tests and flunk them. \nThat's great. These kids come to school way behind, we don't make the \ninvestment in the schools, they don't have the same opportunities to \nlearn, and then we give them the tests, and then we say you don't go \non. And then, come senior year, we give them another test, and if they \ndon't pass it, then they don't graduate.\n  We failed the students who have been failing. If you don't do \nanything to make sure that these children have the same chance to do \nwell, then this is just blaming these children. This is cowardly. Why \ndon't you blame the school systems? Why don't you blame the adults? Why \ndon't you blame Senators? Why don't you blame mayors and \nrepresentatives and school boards? No, you blame the children.\n  By the way, a lot of our educational experts, if anybody wants to \nlisten to them, say: Listen, you know what, we want to do additional \none-on-one tutoring, we want to do summer school, we want to do \neverything we can to help these kids to do well. But if the only thing \nyou are going to do is flunk them, what happens is they will drop out \nof school. Pretty soon you will have 17-year-olds who will be in, I \ndon't know, 10th grade, 9th grade, they will be flunked 2 or 3 years, \nand they drop out or they cause trouble for other kids. Not many \neducational experts are very high on this idea, especially given the \ntin cup education budget that the President gives to us, with my \nRepublican colleagues probably not even wanting to support that. But we \nblame the children.\n  Let's talk about what we should be putting the focus on.\n\n       It is not unusual for economically disadvantaged students \n     in these poor districts to enter school without any preschool \n     experience, to be retained in the early grades without any \n     special help in reading, to attend classes with 30 or more \n     students, to lack counseling and needed social services, to \n     be taught by teachers who are inexperienced and uncertified, \n     and to be exposed to a curriculum in which important courses \n     are not taught and materials are inadequate and outdated.\n\n  That is Bill Taylor, ``A Report On Shortchanged Children, the Impact \nof Fiscal Inequity on the Education of Students at Risk,'' U.S. \nGovernment Printing Office, 1991.\n  May I repeat this quote? And then I would like to, later on in \ndebate, ask my colleagues how you intend to rectify this through Ed-\nFlex.\n  There is probably not a more serious and important scholar on this \nquestion than Bill Taylor.\n\n       It is not unusual for economically disadvantaged students \n     in these poor districts to enter school without any preschool \n     experience, to be retained in the early grades without any \n     special help in reading, to attend classes with 30 or more \n     students, to lack counseling and needed social services, to \n     be taught by teachers who are inexperienced and uncertified, \n     and to be exposed to a curriculum in which important courses \n     are not taught and materials are inadequate and outdated.\n\n  What does Ed-Flex do? What does Ed-Flex do to address any of these \ndisparities? Do you know what the answer is? Nothing. Zero. What is the \nU.S. Senate doing to address these disparities? Nothing.\n  Mr. President, let me start off--and this is hard to do--by reading \nexcerpts from a book by a man who has probably contributed more to \nraising the consciousness of people about children in this country than \nanyone else, Jonathan Kozol. The last thing he wrote was a book called \n``Amazing Grace, Poor Children and the Conscience of America.'' It is \nset in the Mott Haven community in the Bronx. I recommend this book. \nFor all who are listening, I recommend this book, it is so powerful. It \nis called ``Amazing Grace, Poor Children and the Conscience of \nAmerica.'' Here is what Jonathan Kozol said. Basically, what he is \nsaying is: No country which truly loved children would ever let \nchildren grow up under these conditions. But we do.\n  By the way, I had a chance to meet with these children. The heroine \nof this book is a woman named Mother Margaret, who is an Episcopalian \npriest. She has done incredible work with these kids. She came down to \nD.C., and Jonathan said, ``Would you host the children?'' I said, \n``Great. I read the book and I read about the kids.'' They came down \nhere, and I think Jonathan\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\nKozol thought they would be impressed, meeting in the office, but the \nonly thing they really talked about was the swimming pool in the hotel, \nand the other thing they talked about was beds. It was a very big deal \nto them to be able to sleep in a bed.\n\n  Mr. President, this book is called ``Savage Inequalities.'' Let's \njust talk about what Ed-Flex does and what it does not do.\n  A 14-year-old girl, with short black curly hair says this:\n\n       Every year in February we are told to read the same old \n     speech of Martin Luther King. We read it every year. ``I have \n     a dream.'' It does begin to seem, what is the word--she \n     hesitates and then she finds the word--perfunctory.\n       Perfunctory? I asked her what do you mean?\n       We have a school in East St. Louis named for Dr. King, she \n     says. The school is full of sewer water and the doors are \n     locked with chains. Every student in that school is black. \n     It's like a terrible joke on history.\n\n  It startled Jonathan Kozol to hear her words, but I am startled more \nto think how seldom any press reporter has noted the irony of naming \nsegregated schools for Martin Luther King. Children reach the heart of \nthese hypocrisies much quicker than the grownups and the experts do.\n  A history teacher at Martin Luther King School has 110 students in 4 \nclasses but only 26 books. What is Ed-Flex going to do for this teacher \nof these students?\n\n       Each year, [Kozol observes of East St. Louis High School] \n     there is one more toilet that doesn't flush, one more \n     drinking fountain that doesn't work, one more classroom \n     without texts. Certain classrooms are so cold in the winter \n     that the students have to wear their coats to class while \n     children in other classrooms swelter in a suffocating heat \n     that cannot be turned down.\n\n  You know, we have all these harsh critics of our public schools. Some \nof them are my colleagues in the U.S. Senate. They couldn't last 1 hour \nin the classrooms they condemn. They couldn't last 1 hour in these \nschools.\n  I am going on to quote the teachers:\n\n       These kinds of critics willfully ignore the health \n     conditions and the psychological disarray of children growing \n     up in burnt out housing, playing on contaminated land, and \n     walking past acres of smoldering garbage on their way to \n     school.\n\n  Mr. President, let me go on to read from this book:\n\n       In order to find Public School 261 in District 10, a \n     visitor is told to look for a mortician's office. The funeral \n     home which faces Jerome Avenue in the North Bronx is easy to \n     identify by its green awning. The school is next door in a \n     former roller skating rink. No sign identifies the building \n     as a school. A metal awning frame without an awning supports \n     a flagpole, but there is no flag. In the street in front of \n     the school, there's an elevated public transit line. Heavy \n     traffic fills the street. The existence of the school is \n     virtually concealed within this crowded city block. Beyond \n     the inner doors, a guard is seated. The lobby is long--\n\n  And there is a sign, by the way, on the outside of the school: ``All \nstudents are capable of learning.''\n\n       Beyond the inner doors, a guard is seated. The lobby is \n     long and narrow. The ceiling is low. There are no windows. \n     All the teachers that I see at first are middle-aged white \n     women. The principal, also a white woman, tells me that the \n     school's capacity is 900, but there are 1,300 children here. \n     The size of classes for fifth and sixth grade children in New \n     York, she says, is capped at 32, but she says the class size \n     in the school goes up to 24. I see classes as large as 37. \n     Classes for younger children, she goes on, are capped at 25, \n     but a school can go above this limit if it puts an extra \n     adult in the room. Lack of space, she says, prevents the \n     school from operating a prekindergarten program. ``Lunchtime \n     is a challenge for us,'' she explains. ``Limited space \n     obliges us to do it in three shifts, 450 children at a \n     time.'' Textbooks are scarce.\n\n  And it goes on:\n\n       The library is tiny, windowless. There are only 700 books. \n     There are no reference books.\n\n  And it goes on and on and on. These are the conditions of the \nschools.\n  Let me just read the conclusion. I could go on for an hour from this \nbook. Here is the conclusion where he concludes his book:\n\n       All our children ought to be allowed a stake in the \n     enormous richness of America. Whether they were born to poor \n     white Appalachians or to wealthy Texans, to poor black people \n     in the Bronx or to rich people in Manhattan or Winnetka, they \n     are all quite wonderful and innocent when they are small. We \n     soil them needlessly.\n\n  Mr. President, I have tried to develop my case. We are not talking \nabout providing more funding for title I. We talk about abandoning \nbasic core requirements of title I--we are talking about abandoning the \nFederal Government, holding States and school districts accountable and \nmaking sure that the money gets to the neediest schools. We are talking \nabout abandoning the very essence of accountability, that these \nstandards are lived up to to make sure that there are good teachers, to \nmake sure that the kids are held to high standards, to make sure there \nis testing.\n  And we know the results. We have not done a darn thing to make sure \nwe make a commitment to pre-K so kids come to kindergarten ready to \nlearn. We do not do much by way of afterschool care. We do not have the \nmoney, we say. We are a rich country. The economy is booming, but we do \nnot have the money to do any of that?\n  In addition, the reality is that some schoolkids go to schools, \nbecause of the property tax, wealth of the school districts, that can \ngive them the best of the best of the best--the best of computers, the \nbest of technology, the best of labs, the best school buildings, the \nbest teachers, the best band and music and theater and athletics, the \nbest of everything. Other kids in America, who come from different \nschool districts, or come from communities where there is not the \ncommitment to them or they do not have the resources to make the \ncommitment, go to schools that are burnt out--I mean, how would any of \nmy colleagues do, as U.S. Senators, if you walked into this Chamber --\nthis is a beautiful Chamber, thank God--how would you do if you walked \ninto this Chamber and it was the summer in DC and there was no air-\nconditioning or it was winter and there was no heat or we did not have \nstaff to help us, we did not have pages to help us, we weren't able to \nhave the materials we needed, we were hungry, and maybe 20 percent of \nus had a gun, which is not unusual in a lot of schools in our cities? \nWould you learn? Would you do well?\n  What kind of message do you think we communicate to children in \nAmerica when they go to school buildings that are decrepit, where the \nroofs are leaking, where the toilets do not work, where the buildings \nare just grim? What kind of atmosphere is that for children? What kind \nof encouragement do you think we give these children to learn?\n  You think these children are fools? You think these children think \nthat the Ed-Flex program is going to do anything for them? They are a \nlot smarter than you think they are. They know it is not going to do \nanything for them, because we are not doing anything for them. As a \nmatter of fact, we are going to pass a piece of legislation, unless \nthere is some strict accountability measures in this bill, amendments \nthat are passed, that is going to do harm to them. That is what we are \ndoing. And I cannot believe that this bill just came to the floor of \nthe Senate and there has been so little opposition.\n  Mr. President, let me talk about some of the inequalities that exist. \nFirst of all, the inequality in participation in early childhood \nprograms, like nursery school and prekindergarten: Three-year-olds from \nbetter-off families are more than twice as likely than those from less-\nwell-off families to be in these programs, like the nursery school \nprograms and prekindergarten programs.\n  Among 4-year-olds, there remains substantial disparities. Barely half \nof the children with families of incomes of $35,000 or less have \nparticipated in early childhood learning programs compared to three-\nfourths of the children from families with incomes over $50,000. So if \nwe wanted to do something about this, Mr. President, what we would do \nis we would make sure that we would invest the resources in early \nchildhood development.\n  I am going to talk about some really shocking statistics in a moment. \nBut let me just say it again--whether it be Arkansas or whether it be \nMinnesota or whether it be Vermont, the Federal Government--what the \neducation community tells me in Minnesota is you all are real players \nwhen it comes to making sure that children can come to kindergarten \nready to learn. You could make a real commitment of resources.\n  We have in the President's budget--you know, we have a White House \nconference on the development of the brain. The evidence is \nirrefutable, it is irreducible. I am going to talk about it at some \nlength a little later on in my\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\npresentation. But we know that if you do not get it right for these \nkids by age 3, they may never do well in school and may never do well \nin life.\n\n  What is really interesting about the literature that has come out is \nthat--we have always known--we have always known that if a 7-year-old \ncomes to school and she has not received dental care, she is not going \nto do well. We have always known that if children do not have an \nadequate diet, they are not going to do well. We have always known if \nwomen expecting children do not have a good diet, that at birth that \nchild may have severe disabilities and may not be able to do well. But \nwhat we did not know--although I think all of us who are parents and \ngrandparents; I am a grandparent as well--what we did not know is that \nactually literally the way the brain is wired, and whether or not a \nchild will do well in school, whether or not a child will behave well \nis highly correlated to whether or not--is my mike working or not? Is \nthe mike working?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HUTCHINSON). Senator, I do not know \nwhether your mike is working. You can be heard very well.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my good friend from Arkansas, what is \nreally astounding about this literature is that literally the key part \nof it is whether or not there is real intellectual stimulation for \nthese children. It isn't a question of whether they have had a proper \ndiet or have been immunized; that has a huge impact on whether they can \ncome to school and do well.\n  Anyone who is a parent or grandparent knows this. I like to tell the \nstory, because it is absolutely true. Our children are older and I had \nforgotten what it was like. But now we have three grandchildren: 3-\nyear-old Josh; 4-year-old Keith; Kari is 7, she is older. They visit us \nand every 15 seconds these children are interested in something new. \nWhen they are 2 and 1, it is the same way. It is a miracle. It makes me \nvery religious. It is as if these small children are experiencing all \nthe unnamed magic of the world that is before them.\n  We know that if we would make an investment in these children, we \nmake sure that there is good child care, and we make sure when they \ncome to kindergarten they are ready to learn. I will say it again: Our \nnational goal ought to be that every child in the United States of \nAmerica, when he or she comes to kindergarten, they know how to read, \nthey know how to spell their name, they know the alphabet; if they do \nnot know how to read, they have been read to widely. Can't we make that \na national goal? These are all God's children. But the fact of the \nmatter is, we don't. There is a huge disparity. The fact of the matter \nis that many children, by the time they come to kindergarten, are way \nbehind, and then they fall further behind. And then they wind up in \nprison.\n  This Ed-Flex bill does absolutely nothing to make a difference for \nthese children.\n  Point 2: Reading levels are not where they need to be. In early \nFebruary of this year, the National Center for Education Statistics \nreleased the 1998 reading report card for the Nation. These results are \nbased on the national assessment of education progress data collected \nin 1998. These results tell us how our children are doing, what their \nreading levels are, and whether they need improvement.\n  There are two sets of findings I want to emphasize. First, as a \ncountry, too few of our children have the reading skills necessary to \nsucceed. At all grade levels, 40 percent or fewer of the Nation's \nstudents read at a level that is proficient for their grade. This \nfigure is unacceptably low. What can we do?\n  Second, and even more disturbing, are the tremendous disparity levels \nin reading levels by family income, race, and ethnicity. For example, \nchildren who are eligible for the free and reduced lunch program, title \nI or title I-eligible children, are more than twice as likely to be \nbelow the basic reading level than those who are not eligible for the \nprogram. In addition, fourth- and eighth-grader white students are \nthree times as likely as black students or Hispanic children to be \nproficient readers.\n  Part of what these figures are telling us--in fact, they are \nscreaming at us--is that we have a long way to go. This is a crisis.\n  Now, may I ask the question: Does Ed-Flex do anything to help these \nstudents? Are there additional resources that we are calling on? Are we \ndoing anything to make sure that kids come to school ready to learn? \nAre we doing anything to improve their nutritional status? We cut \nnutrition programs for these children. Are we doing anything to make \nsure each and every one of those children is healthy? Are we doing \nanything about the housing conditions? Are we doing what we should do \nto reduce some of the violence in the communities, some of the violence \nin the homes? Are we doing anything to provide some additional support \nservices for these kids?\n\n  A woman is beaten up every 15 seconds in her home. Every 15 seconds \nin the United States of America, a woman is battered in her home. A \nhome should be a safe place. Those children, even if they are not \nbattered themselves--although many are--see it. They essentially suffer \nfrom posttraumatic stress syndrome.\n  My colleague from Arkansas works with veterans. I have done a lot of \nwork with Vietnam vets. I see it all the time, PTSS. We have children \nwho suffer from that. Do we have anything in Ed-Flex that talks about \nadditional services to these children? No. The only thing we do in the \nEd-Flex bill is essentially wipe out any kind of accountability \nstandard that would make sure the money goes to the neediest schools \nfirst, and we wipe out the accountability standards that make sure \ntitle I children have good teachers, are held to high standards, that \nwe have testing and results, and we know how we are doing. And this \nlegislation purports to be a step forward for poor children in America?\n  There have been a number of lawsuits filed. It is too bad, but that \nis the way we have to go to affect these conditions. Since Ed-Flex \ndoesn't have anything to do with the reality I am describing, I think \nthe lawsuits are necessary. Let me cite a lawsuit that came out of \nHartford, CT, in the early 1990s. The Hartford School District had a \nsubstantially higher percentage of minority students than the \nsurrounding suburbs. The Hartford school enrollment was more than 92 \npercent minority, whereas contiguous suburbs such as Avon, East Granby, \nand Wethersfield were less than 5 percent minority. Although \nConnecticut had the highest per capita in the United States, Hartford \nwas the fourth-poorest of the United States cities, with the second \nhighest rate of poverty among children.\n  At the same time, not surprisingly, the Hartford school system had \nsubstantially inferior educational resources than other school systems. \nHartford students were shortchanged in a broad range of educational \ninputs. For example, school systems across the State spent an average \nof $147.68 per student per year on textbooks and instructional \nsupplies; in Hartford, it was $77 dollars, only 52 percent of the \nstatewide average.\n  Or consider East St. Louis, IL, in 1997. Here are some of the \nproblems that the students in the East St. Louis school system faced: \nBacked up sewers, flooding school kitchens; faulty boilers and \nelectrical systems, regularly resulting in student evacuations and \ncancelled classes; dangerous structural flaws, including exposed \nasbestos; malfunction of fire alarms; and emergency exits that were \nchained shut; instructor shortages that usually meant students did not \nknow in advance whether or not they even had a teacher; and school \nlibraries that were typically locked or destroyed by fire.\n  How can we expect our children to achieve or be able to learn to \ndevelop and realize any, let alone all, of their potential as human \nbeings when faced with such an outrageous environment as this? What \ndoes Ed-Flex do to change this environment? Nothing, zero. This is what \nwe ought to be talking about on the floor of the U.S. Senate. That is \nwhy I am trying to slow this bill up.\n  Here is a final description from Louisiana, although you can pick any \nState. In preparing for a lawsuit in Louisiana, the ACLU staff \ndiscovered a pitiful lack of the most basic resources. Besides having \nto deal with leaky roofs and broken desks, students often had to share \ntextbooks among the entire class, negating any possibility of doing \nhomework or building out-\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\nof-class research skills. What few books existed in school libraries \nwere typically torn, damaged, or outdated, a particularly riling \nproblem for subjects like technology, science, and history. At one \nschool, students posing for a class photo in the auditorium had to keep \ntheir coats on because of the lack of heat in the building. I repeat \nthat: At one school, students posing for a class photo in the \nauditorium had to keep their coats on because of the lack of heat in \nthe building.\n  Here is the reaction of one of the staff attorneys. ``It was \nimpossible to imagine that any serious education could go on in these \ndecrepit schools. In some schools children had to go to the principal's \noffice to get toilet papers. The overwhelming impression left on us \n[the lawyers] was sadness.''\n  Mr. President, let me talk about Federal standing on elementary and \nsecondary education. Now, I am going to try--some of this is off of the \ntop of my head. These statistics will be close, but they might be off \njust a little bit. We have had reports, like Nation at Risk in the \nearly 1980s, and we have had politicians of all stripes give speeches \nabout children and education. We all want to have photo opportunities \nnext to children. We have talked about it as a national security issue.\n  Do you want to know something? The percentage of the Federal budget \nthat goes to education is pathetic. It is pathetic. It amounts to about \n2.5 percent of total Federal budget outlays--2.5 percent.\n  By the way, on title I, since this Ed-Flex is supposed to represent \nsome great step forward, according to the Rand Corporation study, we \nwould have to double our spending on title I to really even begin to \nmake a difference for these children. I said this earlier and I will \nsay it again. Here is what I am not quite sure of. Then I will tell you \nwhat I am absolutely sure of. What I am not quite sure of is, I think \nthat during the sixties--this was where title I became part of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act--we were at maybe 10 percent \nthat we were devoting as a percentage of the Federal budget to \neducation. That is what we say is a priority.\n  When Richard Nixon was President, it was higher than it is with the \nDemocratic President. And then it was Ford and Carter, and I think it \nstayed about the same level. With Reagan, it went way down. And then, \nwith President Bush, it went up some. It never got back to the \npercentage it was during Nixon's Presidency. With President Clinton, it \nis about the same as it was with President Bush, maybe even a little \nless; I am not sure.\n  Here we have a Democratic President who says that education is the \nNo. 1 priority, and we are spending less as a percentage of our Federal \nbudget on education than under President Nixon, a Republican. I am \ngoing to talk about Head Start in a while. Here we have a Democratic \nPresident and we don't fully fund the Head Start Program. I can forgive \nmy Republican colleagues; I didn't expect a Republican President to \nfully fund Head Start. I just expected a Democratic President to fully \nfund Head Start. How naive of me.\n  Mr. President, it is just unbelievable. I point out these \ndisparities, and a lot of K through 12 is at the State level. But you \nwould think that we would make a difference where we could make a \ndifference. Yet, we don't, and we have all this discussion about \neducation being the No. 1 priority.\n  Frankly, the President has presented us with a ``tin cup budget.'' \nThe President wants to increase the Pentagon budget next year by $12.5 \nbillion and by $110 billion over the next 6 years, and he calls for \nbarely a $2 billion increase in the Department of Education budget. \nPretty unbelievable. You would think that if education was a big \npriority, we would see the same increase in funding for education as we \nwould see for the Pentagon. Not so.\n  Mr. President, I now want to turn my attention to what we ought to be \ndoing as opposed to what we are doing. Before I do that, however--and I \nwill finish up on this--I want to point out one more time--and I will \nhave an amendment that deals with this part of the bill that makes it \ncrystal clear that this title I program is severely underfunded. And I \nwill have a vote on it. I spend a lot of time in these schools with \nthese principals, teachers, and these families. They all tell me--\nbefore my colleague came here, I was saying that I went to the schools \nin St. Paul-Minneapolis with 65 to 70 percent poverty that don't \nreceive any title I funding because by the time we allocate the money, \nthere is no more money left. And we do very good things with this money \nfor these children that need additional help. But we are not calling \nfor any additional investment of money for our schools to work with. In \naddition, what we are not doing is, as a national community, we are no \nlonger saying to the States and school districts there are certain \ncore, if you will, values, that we want to see maintained.\n  There is a mission to title I. We know why we passed title I in 1965, \nbecause we took a look around the Nation and it wasn't a pretty \npicture. In quite a few States, whether anybody wants to admit it or \nnot, these poor children fell between the cracks. So we, as a Nation, \nwill at least have a minimal standard that will say, with title I, \nthere will be certain core requirements; there will be qualified \nteachers; there will be high standards; there will be some testing and \nsome results and some evaluation, and this will apply to title I \nprograms everywhere in our land, to make sure that some of these \nchildren have a real opportunity. And now, with this legislation, we \nare going to toss that overboard. I will have an amendment that says we \ncan't.\n  The second thing we said in 1994--and I don't know what my colleagues \nthink, and I will have an amendment and we will have a debate and vote \non it--was that in the allocation of the money, those schools with a \nhigher percentage, 75 percent low-income students or more, should have \nfirst priority for funding. That makes sense to me. For some reason, my \ncolleagues want to toss that overboard.\n\n  By the way, I made a third point, which is that I understand--I know \nmy colleague from Arkansas comes from a smaller town, a rural \ncommunity, and that is a big part of Minnesota. I understand the zero \nsum game we are in, because the crazy part of it is that we don't get \nenough funding and, therefore, say--I could pick any community in \nMinnesota, but in any number of our greater Minnesota communities, \npeople are saying, ``Paul, we have 20 percent or 30 percent low-income \nor 35 percent low-income''--in some rural areas it is much higher--\n``and we don't get any funding.'' So it becomes a zero sum game. What \ndo you do with a limited amount of money? I would like to see something \nreal out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate when we talk about \ngetting more resources to our States and school districts.\n  Now, here is what we should be talking about on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate: early childhood development. This is the most pressing issue of \nall. If you talk to your teachers, they will tell you this. The best \nthing we can do as Senators is to get--by the way, it would be $20 \nbillion over the next 4 years minimally. If we really wanted to make a \ndifference, it would be about $20 billion over the next 4 years. Well, \nlisten, we are going to do $110 billion to the Pentagon over 6 years--\nmore subs, more nuclear warheads, more missiles.\n  If we were serious about this, we would make the commitment to early \nchildhood development. That is what all of our teachers are telling us, \nand that is what our experts are telling us. It is the best thing you \ncan do. By the way, those of you for flexibility, I agree, don't run it \nfrom Washington, DC. Get the resources back to the local communities \nand, like NGOs and nonprofits and all sorts of folks who meet the \nstandards, set up really good development child care centers and also \nfamily-based child care and give the tax credits, but make sure they \nare refundable and that the low-income aren't left out, or families. Do \nit. Get real. Do the best thing we can do. But that is not on the floor \ntoday. We have Ed-Flex. Ed-Flex means nothing to these families.\n  Mr. President, I have already talked some about the kind of science \nliterature--my colleague, I am trying to remember the name of the \nbook--Dick and Ann Barnett. Dick is at the Institute of Policy Studies, \nand Ann is a pediatric neurologist. They have written a wonderful book. \nI can't remember the title. But there are many books that have come \nout.\n  Let me talk about the disparity. Listen to this 1990 study. Looking \nat the\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\nhours of one-on-one picture book reading kids have experienced by the \ntime they started first grade, low-income children average 25 hours. By \nthe time they come to first grade they have altogether, with picture \nbook reading, been read to 25 hours. Middle-class children average \nbetween 1,000 and 1,700 hours. It is unbelievable.\n  By the way, as a grandpa, I know that reading makes a difference. Now \nthis gets tricky, because I can read my colleague's face here about the \nresponsibility. Let's talk about this a little. I just said this. I now \nhave to figure this out a little bit.\n  First of all, let me make the case that we could do so much better. I \nam for combining the commitment to child care. That is what we should \nbe talking about today, and investing some resources in this, and \ngetting community level volunteerism. I am for doing whatever can be \ndone in the families, and I want parents to take the responsibility. I \nwish more would. I think sometimes it is brutal. People work different \nshifts, and two or three jobs working their heads off. And they hardly \nhave the time to have a common occasion with their children; even to \nsit down and eat dinner together. All too many of our families are \nunder siege.\n\n  It is not that people aren't working. It is that people are working \nentirely too many hours. But both have to work. But I wish that parents \nwould read more to their children before they are in kindergarten. But \nI also think this is all about whether there is good child care. This \nis also true with volunteers. I would be, for all of us who no longer \nhave children that are young, getting the books out of our homes, and \nolder computers out of our homes, and do it through veterans halls, do \nit through union halls, do it through the religious community, and \ninvite volunteers, get tutors and mentors. We could do a lot. But I \nwill tell you something. It makes a real big difference in terms of \nwhether these children are ready to learn. And they are needy.\n  The needy--50 percent of the mothers of children under the age of 3 \nnow work in our country outside of the home; 50 percent. There are 12 \nmillion children under the age of 3, and one in four lives in poverty. \nOne out of two of color live in poverty--half of the children of color \ntoday in our country--and under the age of 3 are needy, the richest \ncountry in the world.\n  Compared with most other industrialized countries, the United States \nhas a higher infant mortality rate portion of low-birth weight babies \nand a smaller portion of babies immunized against childhood diseases.\n  This critically affects education. This critically affects the \neducational payment of children. Full day care for one child ranges \nfrom $4,000 to $10,000. That is comparable, as I said earlier, to \ncollege tuition, room and board at our public universities.\n  Half of the young families in our country with young children earn \nless than $35,000 a year. A family with both parents working full time \nat minimum wage earns only $21,400 a year.\n  I want to tell you something. More than just about any other issue \nwhen I am in cafes in Minnesota, people talk to me--working families. \nThey say, ``We can't afford this. We both work. We both have to work. I \nam 30. My wife is 28. We have two small children. Isn't there any way \nwe can get some help for child care?''\n  That is what is really critical, if we are going to be talking about \neducation. Ed-Flex means nothing to these families.\n  Drawing on some reports, I am sorry to report these statistics. Six \nout of seven child care centers provide only poor to mediocre care. One \nout of eight centers provides care that could jeopardize a child's \nsafety in development. One out of three home-based care situations \ncould be harmful to a child's development--the Children Defense Fund \nstudy.\n  Although approximately 1,500 hours of training from an accredited \nschool is required to qualify as a licensed hair cutter, masseur, or \nmanicurist, 41 States do not require child care providers to have any \ntraining prior to serving children. The annual turnover rate among \nchild care providers is about 40 percent. Do you want to know why? I \nlove to take my grandchildren to the zoo. If you work at the zoo, you \nmake twice the wage that women and men make with small children in this \ncountry.\n  One of the worst things we have done in the United States of America \nis to have abandoned too many poor children. This legislation takes us \nin that direction. And we have devalued the work of adults that work \nwith these children. Most child care workers earn about $12,000 a year, \nslightly above the minimum wage. And they receive no benefits. That is \nunbelievable--unbelievable.\n  When I was teaching, I would have students come up to me, and they \nwould say, ``Look. You know, do not be offended, but we want to go into \neducation. But we don't want to teach at the college level. We think we \ncould really make a difference if we work with 3 and 4-year-olds.'' \nThen the next thing they say is, ``But we don't know how we can afford \nit. We have a loan to pay off. How do you make a living?'' Why in the \nworld do we pay such low wages? So the families can't afford the child \ncare. The families can't afford the child care. And those adults that \nwant to take care of children can't afford to provide the care.\n  What we have on the floor of the U.S. Senate instead is Ed-Flex. We \ncould make a huge difference, but we don't, and we will not.\n  There was a woman, Fannie Lou Hammer--I have quoted her before--a \ncivil rights activist. She was, Senator Hutchinson, I think, one of 14 \nchildren, the daughter of a sharecropper. Her immortal words, where she \nwas once speaking, were, ``I am so sick and tired of being sick and \ntired.''\n  I am sick and tired of the way in which we are playing symbolic \npolitics with children's lives. If we were serious about doing \nsomething on the floor of the U.S. Senate that would make a difference \nfor children, we wouldn't have this Ed-Flex bill on the floor. We would \nbe talking about the ways in which we are going to provide money, \ndollars, resources for local communities to provide the very best of \nelemental child care so that every child, by the time he or she is of \nkindergarten age, is ready to learn. That is the most important thing \nwe could do. And we don't even make it a priority.\n\n  Now, Senator DeWine and I passed an amendment that we are proud of; \nit is the law of the land, but we don't have the funding yet, which \nsays that we will at least have loan forgiveness for those men and \nwomen who get their degree and go into early childhood development \nwork. But that still doesn't do the job. We ought to pay decent wages. \nI don't understand this.\n  Senator Hutchinson is, I guess, what Governor Bush would call a \ncompassionate conservative. He is certainly passionate; he is certainly \nconservative. I don't understand this. We have two groups of citizens \nthat are the most vulnerable that deserve the most support and the \nadults that work with them make the least amount of pay with the worst \nworking conditions.\n  Nursing homes, my mother and father both had Parkinson's disease, and \nwe fought like heck to keep them at home, and we did. We kept them at \nhome for a number of years. We kept them at home, between Sheila and I \nand our children spending the night, as long as we could until we could \nnot any longer. And then toward the end of each of their lives, toward \nthe end of their lives they were in a nursing home.\n  Well, I don't think I could do that work. It is pretty important. You \nhave people who built this country on their backs. They have worked \nhard. They are elderly. They are infirm. They need the help, and we pay \nthe lowest wages. We have a lot of people in these nursing homes who \ndon't even have health care coverage.\n  Congratulations, Service Employees International Union, for your \nvictory in California in LA organizing home health care workers. The \nother thing we ought to do is to try to enable people to stay at home \nas long as possible to live in dignity and provide help. But why do we \npay people, why do we pay adults so little to do such important work?\n  And then the other group of citizens that is the most vulnerable, the \nmost in need of help that we should provide the most support to is \nsmall children. We devalue the work of adults. I don't get it. If you \nare some advertising executive--I don't want to pick on them, but if \nyou are some advertising executive who figures out some clever way\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\nto sell some absolutely useless product or you have got all sorts of \nads that the Senator from Arkansas and I both would not like, just \nthink it is trash, it should not be on TV, exploitive in all kinds of \nways--and I think the Senator from Arkansas knows what I mean--such a \nperson probably gets paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, and then \nyou have child workers who are working with children, and they get next \nto peanuts. Boy, I think our priorities are distorted.\n  Let me tell you, Ed-Flex doesn't do anything to deal with this \nproblem of priorities.\n  Mr. President, I am going to just mention two other areas. I have \nreally covered Head Start already. I was going to read from some \nMinnesota stories, but I am going to move on, some huge success stories \njust to simply mention the well-known Perry study on the benefits of \nHead Start. It is pretty interesting. They did a sort of a control of \ntwo different groups.\n  Head Start participants, they did a followup through age 27. This \nprogram was started in 1965. Criminal arrests: 7 percent Head Start, 25 \npercent control group--those kids that weren't in Head Start, \ncontrolling for income and family background and all the rest. Higher \nearnings, 29 percent of Head Start kids, 2,000 plus per month, only 7 \npercent control group; 71 percent Head Start kids graduated or received \na GED, only 54 percent control group. And 59 percent received \nassistance, they did receive some assistance, still poor, but 80 \npercent of the control group. And fewer out-of-wedlock births across \nthe board.\n\n  For kids who have really grown up under some really difficult \nconditions, the Head Start Program has helped them with a head start. \nAnd we have a budget that the President presents that will get us to 2 \nmillion children, I think, covered, but that is about half.\n  About 2 million children will be eligible. The President's budget \ngets us a million. Half. So our goal--talk about a downsized agenda, \ntalk about politics of low expectations--is to provide funding for only \nhalf these children.\n  Now, this isn't even early Head Start because really what we have to \ndo well is before the age of 3. I noticed when Governor Whitman was \ntestifying before, she was talking about her program in New Jersey, \nwhich sounds to me as if it is a very important program that deals, I \nthink, with 4 and 5-year-olds or 3 and 4-year-olds, and I said to her, \nwhat about preage 3? I know she nodded her head in agreement.\n  Why aren't we providing the resources? In all due respect, if we want \nto do something really positive, the most important thing we can do is \ninvest in the health care and intellectual skills of our children. Ed-\nFlex doesn't do that, and we are not going to do it.\n  So I am not going to let my colleagues put this bill forward as if it \nis a great big, bold step forward for poor children in America. It is \nnot. As a matter of fact, it will do damage to children unless we have \nthe strengthened accountability language. And we will see whether or \nnot we can get a vote for that.\n  Might I ask a question, Mr. President? I wonder how much time do I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 hour 31 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have a few things I would like to lay \nout, but I want to ask my colleague from Vermont--he has had to sit \nhere and listen to some of which I don't think he agrees and some of \nwhich he might agree. I wonder whether or not--I could take another 15 \nminutes and then reserve the remainder of my time if my colleague wants \nto speak, or does he want to wait, or how would he like to proceed?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have no intention at this time to \nspeak. I will obviously at a later time. I will do it when it is \nappropriate. But I desire to expedite our situation so that we can get \nto the bill as soon as possible.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Vermont, on my time, if he \nchooses to assent or disagree or remind me where I am wrong, please \nfeel free to do so. I extend the invitation. I was a teacher. I can \neasily fill up the next hour without any trouble.\n  Mr. President, before I go to afterschool care, I would like to just \none more time focus on why I think this Ed-Flex bill shouldn't even be \nin the Chamber. I have talked about what I think the flaws are with the \nlegislation, but I also want to talk about what I think we should be \ntalking about. I would like to just draw, if I could, on two \nexperiences that I have had traveling the country that I think apply to \nthis debate.\n  One of them which I have talked about once or twice before--it is \nvery positive. It is not a putdown of anybody--took place in the delta \nin Mississippi, in Tunica, MS. I had traveled there because I wanted to \nspend some time in low-income communities around the country--South, \nNorth, East, West, rural, urban. And when I visited Tunica several \nyears ago now, there was a teacher, Mr. Robert Hall, who I will never \nforget. It was at a town meeting, and he stood up and said it is hard \nto give students hope, and he talked about how--I don't know--I think \nmaybe about 50 percent of the students graduated.\n  By the way, this young African American woman that I quoted I think \nin East St. Louis, who was talking about her school being segregated, \nactually in Tunica the case is that the public school is all black or \nAfrican American, the private school is all white.\n  Anyway, at the end of this he asked me whether I would come back to \nspeak, would I come next year for the graduation? I said yes, and I \nsaid yes not realizing that I had made a prior commitment. What are you \ngoing to do, you know, when you make a commitment like that? So I \ncalled and I said could I come the day before graduation, to at least \nget a chance to meet with the seniors, because I wanted to live up to \nmy commitment. And he said yes. So I flew from Minneapolis down to \nMemphis and then was met, I think by Mr. Erikson, who was driving me to \nTunica. This is one of my favorite stories.\n  I said, ``Are we going to the high school?''\n  He said, ``No. You are going to be addressing the third and fourth \ngraders.''\n  And I said, ``I am going to be giving a policy address to the third \nand fourth graders?''\n  And he said, ``Well, yes.''\n  And I said, ``Is this the last day of school?''\n  He said, ``Well, yes.''\n  I said, ``So I am going to be giving a policy address to third and \nfourth graders on the last day of school?''\n  He said, ``Well, yes.''\n  I said, ``I'm in trouble.''\n  So we go to the elementary school. There are, I don't know, a hundred \nkids, third and fourth graders, thereabouts, sitting in the chairs, \nwaiting for me to give a policy address. And there is the PA system on \nthe stage, which is high above where the students are, and the \nprincipal gives me a really nice introduction, and I am supposed to go \nup there and look down at these students and give them a policy \naddress.\n  So I was trying to figure out what to do. I asked the principal, \n``Can I get down in the auditorium where the kids are?''\n  He said, ``Sure.''\n  So I got down there, and this little girl, thank God, made my class \nfor me. I said, ``Is this the last day of school?''\n  Everybody said, ``Yes.''\n  I said, ``Well, what have you liked about school?''\n  And this one little girl raised her hand and she said, ``Well, what I \nlike about school is, if I do good in school, I can do really good \nthings in my life.'' Something like that.\n  And I said, ``Well, what do you want to be?'' And I said to all the \nstudents, ``What do you want to be?''\n  There were, Senator Hutchinson, 40 hands up. It was great. They had \nall sorts of dreams. I mean, quite a few of them wanted to be Michael \nJordan--not a surprise. I heard everything: Teacher, writer, \npsychiatrist, Michael Jordan, on and on and on. But the thing of it is, \nthere was that spark. It was beautiful. I know, as a former teacher, \nthat you can take that spark of learning in a child, regardless of \nbackground, and if you ignite that spark of learning, that child can go \non to a lifetime of creativity and accomplishment. Or you can pour cold \nwater on that spark of learning. We are not doing anything here in \nWashington, DC, to help ignite that spark of learning. We are not.\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\n  Now, I feel a little uncomfortable saying that. Maybe I should say \n``precious little.'' We are doing precious little. I feel uncomfortable \nsaying that, because Senator Jeffords is a Senator who is committed to \neducation. I know that. I have a tremendous amount of respect for him. \nBut I am talking, I say to my colleague, Senator Jeffords, in a more \ngeneral way. I don't understand our priorities. I just don't understand \nour priorities. I am just sick and tired--to sort of again talk about \nFanny Lou Hammer--of bills that are brought out here, people get the \nimpression there is some big step forward, and when it comes to the \ninvestment of resources--some of which you fight for, this investment \nof resources--we do not do it. I just tell you, it is tragic.\n  For these kids and these schools all across the country, they are not \nsaying: Give us Ed-Flex, give us Ed-Flex, give us Ed-Flex. They are \nsaying: We want to have good teachers and smaller classes. We want to \nhave good health care. We want to have an adequate diet. We want to go \nto schools that are inviting places. We want to have hope. We want to \nbe able to afford college. That is what they are saying. They are not \ntalking about Ed-Flex.\n  The second point, and last one of my stories--true. I am going to \nshout this from the mountaintop. I get this time on the floor of the \nSenate because I insist this is what we should be talking about, and I \nwill do everything I can, with amendments and bills, to bring this out \nhere and force debates and votes and all the rest.\n  I hear this in the law enforcement community. We should hold kids \naccountable when they commit brutal crimes. We should hold people \naccountable when they commit brutal crimes. But we will build a million \nnew prisons on present course. That is the fastest growing industry in \nthe country. And we will fill them all up and we will never stop this \ncycle of violence unless we invest in the health and skills and \nintellect and character of our children. And we are not doing that in \nthe U.S. Senate or in the U.S. House of Representatives. Certainly not \nwith Ed-Flex.\n\n  Where do these kids wind up? They come to school way behind, they \nfall further behind, they don't have anywhere near the same \nopportunities to learn, and then they wind up in prison. I talked about \nthis before. I think this will be the last time I will talk about it, \nexcept when we debate a bill which I introduced, the mental health \njuvenile justice bill. I visited a ``correction facility'' called \nTallula Correction Facility in Tallula, MI. But I say to my colleagues \nfrom Arkansas, Louisiana, south--this could be anywhere in the country, \nanywhere in the country. And the Justice Department has had a pretty \nhard report about conditions in Georgia and Kentucky and some other \nStates.\n  I see there are some young people here today in the gallery. What did \nI find in Tallula? The Tallula facility is a corrections facility for \nkids ages 11 to 18. I went to Tallula because I had read in the Justice \nDepartment report that there were kids who were in solitary confinement \nup to 7 weeks at a time, 23 hours a day, and I wanted to know what they \nhad done for this to happen to them.\n  One young man, Travis, he is now 16, he went to Tallula when he was \n13 for stealing a bike. He wound up there for 18 months, and he was \nbeaten up over and over again. Tallula has had some lawsuits filed \nagainst it.\n  I went to the Tallula facility, and the first thing I noticed about \nthe 550 kids was about 80 to 85 percent of them were African American. \nAnd then, when I met with some of the officials, I wanted to go to the \nsolitary confinement cells and they wanted to take me to where the \nstudents were eating lunch--students--kids--young people. So we first \nstarted out to where they were eating lunch and then we were going to \ngo to these cells.\n  When I walked in, even with all these officials there, I asked some \nof these kids, ``How are you doing?''\n  I will never forget, this one young man says to me, ``Not well.''\n  I say, ``What do you mean?''\n  By this time, there were 30 officials looking at this kid. He said, \n``This food, we never eat this food. It's because you are here.'' He \nsaid, ``These clothes? We never had clothes like this. They just gave \nus these shorts and T-shirts. We have been wearing the same smelly, \ndirty clothes day after day.''\n  He said, ``The tables are painted--smell the paint. It has just been \npainted.''\n  Then I went outside and this one young man made a break from the \nguards, jumped onto a roof, and ran across the roof. It was about 100 \ndegrees heat. And I said, ``Why are you doing this? You are going to \nget in a lot of trouble.'' I looked up at him, walked up to the roof.\n  He said, ``I want to make a statement.''\n  I said, ``What's your statement?''\n  He said, ``This is a show, and when you leave here they are going to \nbeat us up.''\n  Well, the State of Louisiana has taken some action. This was \nprivatized. There are lawsuits. There have been editorials about \nanarchy at Tallula. I will just tell you this. I will tell you this: 95 \npercent of these kids at Tallula had not committed a violent crime. I \nmet one kid who had stolen a bike. I met one kid who was in there for \nbreaking and entering. I did meet one kid who cut a kid in a fight with \na knife. I forget the fourth kid. Mr. President, 95 percent of \nnonviolent crimes--that is about the case in all of these juvenile \ndetention facilities.\n  I will tell you, Senator, I would be pleased to meet almost any of \nthose kids at 10 o'clock at night before they got to Tallula. I would \nnot want to meet any of them when they get out.\n  So let's not kid ourselves. These State budgets and Federal budgets \nthat go to prisons and jails are just going to continue to skyrocket, \nand that is where a lot of young people are going to end up unless, \nfrom the very beginning of their lives, we figure out--at a community \nlevel, not a Federal Government level--how we are going to make sure \nthat we make the investment in these kids. And that is something we \nshould be doing in the Senate. But this bill does not do that.\n  Before I return to the final case I want to make on this specific \nbill, let me just read some figures. Mr. President, I would like to \nread a little bit about some facts on what is going on with kids after \nschool. Twenty-two million school-aged children have working parents; \nthat is, 62 percent of these children have parents who are working. \nChildren spend only 20 percent of their waking hours in school. The gap \nbetween the parents' work schedule and the students' school schedules \ncan amount to 20 to 25 hours per week. That is from the Ann E. Casey \nFoundation.\n  Experts estimate that nearly 5 million school-aged children spend \ntime without adult supervision during a typical week. An estimated 35 \npercent of 12-year-olds care for themselves regularly during \nafterschool hours when their parents are working.\n  What happens during out-of-school hours? Violent juvenile crime \ntriples during the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. And 280 children are \narrested for violent crimes every day. Children are most likely to be \nthe victims of violent crime by a nonfamily member between 2 p.m. and 6 \np.m.\n  Children without adult supervision are at a significantly greater \nrisk of truancy from school, stress, receiving poor grades, risk-taking \nbehavior, and substance abuse. Children who spend more hours on their \nown and begin self-care at younger ages are at increased risks. And I \ncould footnote each and every one of these findings.\n  Children spend more of their discretionary time watching television \nthan any other activity. Television viewing accounted for 25 percent of \nchildren's discretionary time in 1997, or 14 hours per week on average.\n  Facts about out-of-school programs: Almost 30 percent of public \nschools and 50 percent of private schools offered before- or \nafterschool care in 1993-1994. It is going up. But the General \nAccounting Office estimates that, for the year 2002, the current number \nof out-of-schooltime programs for school-aged children will meet as \nlittle as 25 percent of the demand in urban areas.\n  Mr. President, I could actually go on and on, but here is the point I \nwant to make. The point I want to make is that if we want to pass \nlegislation that makes a positive difference in the lives of children \nand helps parents raise their children decently--you know, what \nfamilies are saying to us is: ``Do what you can do to help us do our \nbest\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nby our kids.'' They are not talking about Ed-Flex.\n  What I am hearing from families in Minnesota--and I think it is the \nsame for around the country--is: Look, we both have to work, or, I am a \nsingle parent, and I am working, and I am worried sick about where my \nchild is after school. Can't you provide some funding?\n  Why doesn't the Ed-Flex bill talk about flexibility for schools and \ncommunities to have more resources for afterschool care? There is \nsomething positive we can do. I assume that maybe Senator Boxer or one \nof my colleagues will have an amendment and we will have a vote on \nthis. Now, there is an educational initiative that will make a huge \ndifference.\n  There is nothing more disheartening to a parent or parents than to \nknow that both of you have to work but to also know that your second \ngrader or your third grader or your 12-year-old or your 13-year-old is \ngoing home alone. Why don't we do something about that? We have all the \nevidence we need. We have all the evidence we need.\n  We know that this is the time when kids get into the most trouble. We \nknow that in more and more of our working families both parents are \nworking. We know this is one of the biggest concerns parents have, \nright alongside affordable child care. What we all ought to be doing by \nway of ed-flexibility is providing the resources for communities and \nfor schools to make a difference.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I was mentioning television. For my \ncolleagues who are worried about the violence that kids see on TV--and \nit is awful--you should just think about what they see in their homes. \nEvery 15 seconds, a woman is battered. One of the things we ought to be \ndoing, if we really want to do something that will make a difference \nfor kids--and I have a piece of legislation I am introducing on this \nthat I hope to get a lot of support on--is to provide some funding for \npartnerships between the schools and the other key actors in the \ncommunity that will provide some help and assistance to kids who have \nseen this in their homes over and over and over again. That would make \na big difference. That would make a big difference.\n\n  I said this last night. I think I need to say it again. I do not \nthink I am being melodramatic when I say that we have two problems. We \nhave a huge learning gap. That is what it is all about. And it is \nhighly correlated with income and race and poverty and gender. But we \nalso have--and I do not know what the right label is for this, but we \nhave a lot of kids who, by the time they come to kindergarten or first \ngrade, have seen so much in their lives, that children should not have \nto see and experience, that they are not going to be able to learn at \nall, even with small class sizes, even with really good teachers, even \nwith really good facilities--none of which Ed-Flex deals with--unless \nthere is some help for them. They need additional help. And you know \nwhat? They deserve it. They deserve it.\n  Mr. President, I am going to, I think, finish up where I started. \nBefore I do that, I want to just read one other quote that is kind of \ninteresting. This is from a woman Jonathan Kozol is talking to in his \nlatest book he has written called ``Amazing Grace.'' And I say to my \ncolleague, I am not sure I should quote this because of the current \ncircumstances, but I think it should be read. This woman lives in the \ncommunity, South Bronx, the Mott Haven community. And here is what she \nhas to say. She is saying this to Jonathan Kozol, the author:\n\n       Do you ever turn on C-SPAN? You can see these rather \n     shallow but smart people--\n\n  This is just her perspective--\n\n     most of them young and obviously privileged, going on and on \n     with perky overconfidence about the values and failings of \n     poor women, and you want to grab them in your hands and shake \n     them.\n  It is like this young man I met at Center School, which is an \nalternative school in Minneapolis, in the Phillips neighborhood, about \na month ago. This is kind of his last chance; he is a young African \nAmerican man. I was having a discussion with 30 or 40 kids. There are a \nlot of Native American students there, as well. Actually, there are \nmore Native American students. I was trying to be very honest with \nthem. I said, I would like for you to answer one question for me. I am \nhere because I really do care about you and I respect your judgment. A \nlot of these kids don't believe anybody values their opinions. They \nhave very little self-confidence. I said to this one young African \nAmerican man, a senior, ``A lot of people say that you don't really \ncare. The problem isn't the poverty of your family, the problem isn't \nthe violence in the neighborhoods, the problem isn't that you haven't \nhad the funding or the opportunities. The problem is you don't care. \nAnd that if you really cared, you would be able to do this. How do you \nrespond to that?'' He looked at me and he said, ``Tell them to walk in \nmy shoes.''\n  I think that is what this woman was saying about her observations \nabout what she sees on C-SPAN.\n  I conclude this way: I came to the floor of the U.S. Senate last \nnight and I spent half an hour speaking. I have come to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate today and I have spent several hours speaking about the \nEd-Flex bill. I have been strong and maybe harsh in my comments. I do \nnot mean them to be personal at all. I have gone out of my way to say, \nbecause I think it is true--I wouldn't say it if I didn't think it was \ntrue.\n  It happens that the Senator from Vermont is out here managing the \nbill, and I consider him to be a Senator who cares a great deal about \neducation and children. I know what he has done right here in \nWashington, DC.\n  What deeply troubles me about what is going on here in the U.S. \nSenate, which is why I have tried to the best of my ability--and I will \nhave amendments, as well--to say, wait a minute, we have a piece of \nlegislation, and I can see the spinning and I can see the hype. It has \na great name: Ed-Flex. It has a great slogan: ``Get the bureaucrats \nout, let the States decide.'' But I can see this piece of legislation \nrepresented as a piece of legislation that is a major educational \ninitiative for children in our country. I have tried to make it crystal \nclear that is quite to the contrary.\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas that I will be finished in a \nminute or two. If he chooses to debate, I will be glad to do that. Is \nhe standing to speak?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. You earlier said you might yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could finish this thought, I am pleased to yield \nfor a question. In fact, that might be a welcome relief from hearing \nmyself speak. I am pleased to take a question or whatever criticism \nthat the Senator might want to throw my way.\n  This piece of legislation isn't going to do anything that is going to \nmake a significant difference in assuring educational opportunities for \nall of our children in our country. It won't. This particular piece of \nlegislation is not going to meet the standard, which is the most \nimportant standard that I believe in more than anything else. I say to \nmy colleague from Arkansas: I think every infant, every child, ought to \nhave the same chance to reach his or her full potential.\n  This legislation doesn't make any real difference. This legislation \ndoesn't point us in the direction of making a commitment to early \nchildhood development, to making a commitment to communities so that \nkids can come to school, ready to learn. This piece of legislation \ndoesn't fully fund Head Start. This piece of legislation doesn't \nprovide the funding for nutrition programs for children, many of whom \nare hungry. Quite to the contrary. We put into effect a 20-percent cut \nin the Food Stamp Program by the year 2002. This piece of legislation \ndoesn't do anything that will change the concerns and circumstances of \nthese children's lives before they go to school and when they go home. \nThis piece of legislation doesn't do anything to effect smaller class \nsize, to repair or rebuild our crumbling schools, to help us recruit \nover the next 10 years 2 million teachers, who we will need, as the \nbest and the most creative teachers. This piece of legislation does \nabsolutely nothing that will in a positive way affect the conditions \nthat have the most to do with whether or not each and every child in \nour country will truly have the same opportunity to be all he or she \ncan be.\n  Moreover, to summarize, this piece of legislation turns the clock \nbackwards. This piece of legislation takes the good\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\nwork of the 1994 reauthorization bill, which will assure that the \nallocation of funds first goes to those schools with a 75 percent low-\nincome population or more, and tosses it overboard. This piece of \nlegislation in its present form--and to me this may be the biggest \nissue of all about this piece of legislation. I think other bills \nshould be on the floor that make a difference, but if we are going to \npass this piece of legislation, at least let's make sure we have \nflexibility with accountability. That means that the basic core \nrequirements of title I on well-qualified teachers, high standards \ntesting, measuring results and knowing how we are doing are fenced in. \nIn no way, shape or form, with all the flexibility in the world, will \nany State or school district be exempt from meeting those requirements.\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas, I am pleased to yield for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I did have a question for the Senator from Minnesota, \nbut if the Senator is about to conclude, I know there will be plenty of \ndebate and time to debate, so I don't want to further hold up \nproceeding on the bill. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield the floor in just a moment. I appreciate \nmy colleague's courtesy. The C-SPAN quote, just so it is in the Record, \nwas from a Mrs. Elizabeth Washington of the Mott Haven community in the \nSouth Bronx.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator from Oregon is desirous of speaking for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How about if I reserve the remainder of my time? I \nwill reserve the remainder of my time, and if the Senator from Oregon \nwants to speak, that would be fine with me. How much time do I have \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 57 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Would the Senator mind yielding his time to the \nSenator?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Fifteen minutes of my time? I would be pleased to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that many Americans who are watching this \ndebate hear the words ``Ed-Flex'' and wonder what in the world is the \nU.S. Senate talking about? My guess is that we probably have some folks \nthinking that Ed-Flex is the new guy who has been hired to run the \naerobics class at the local health club. But since my home State of \nOregon was the first to receive an Ed-Flex waiver, I would like to take \na few minutes to tell the U.S. Senate why Ed-Flex makes a real \ndifference and especially why it has been a valuable tool to improve \nthe lives of poor children.\n  To begin with, Ed-Flex represents a new approach in Federal-State \nrelations. Right now, there are two schools of thought on the \nrelationship of Washington, DC, to the States. One side says everything \nought to be run at the Federal level, because folks locally can't be \ntrusted to meet the needs of low-income people. The other side says the \nlocal folks ought to be able to do it all, because everything the \nFederal Government touches turns to toxic waste.\n  Ed-Flex represents a third-wave approach, and we have pioneered it in \na variety of areas, including health, welfare and the environment, and \nnow in education, in addition.\n  We told the Federal Government in each of these areas that we will \nmeet the core requirements of Federal law. The Federal Government ought \nto hold us accountable, but, at the same time, the Federal Government \nought to give us the flexibility to make sure that we can really meet \nthe needs of our citizens--in this case, the poor children--rather than \nbuilding up bureaucracy.\n  Ed-Flex has been good for students, but especially good for poor \nstudents. There are no examples of abuse, Mr. President--not one. We \nhave asked the opponents of this legislation to give us even a \nscintilla of evidence of an abuse, and they cannot cite one example for \na program that has been used in 12 States. But I will tell you there \nare plenty of examples where this program has worked for poor children.\n  In Maryland, one low-income school used Ed-Flex to reduce class size. \nClass size dropped under this Ed-Flex program from 25 students to 12. \nAnd the last time I looked, a fair number of Members of the U.S. Senate \nwanted to see class size drop.\n  In our home State, Ed-Flex helps low-income high school students take \nadvanced computer courses at the community college. Before the waiver, \nFederal rules would only allow high school students to take computer \ncourses offered at the high school. If a student wanted to take an \nadvanced computer course, but the school didn't have the equipment or \nthe people to teach advanced computing, those poor kids were out of \nluck. But we found a community college that was just a short distance \naway with an Ed-Flex waiver where we could take the dollars that would \nhave been wasted because there were no facilities at the high school, \nand the poor kids learned at the community college. No muss, no fuss. \nBut we did what the Federal Government ought to be trying to do, which \nis to help poor children.\n\n  In Massachusetts, a school with many low-income kids who are doing \npoorly in math and reading received title I funds in 1997; but they \nwere denied title I funds the next year because of a technicality. This \nmeant that low-income children who were getting special help with title \nI funds in 1997 could not get those funds in 1998 for one reason, and \nthat was bureaucratic red tape. But when they got an Ed-Flex waiver, \nthey could use the dollars to serve low-income children and make sure \nthat they could use that help until they had addressed the mission of \nthe program.\n  Ed-Flex doesn't serve fewer poor kids; it serves more of them, and it \nserves them better.\n  In the State of Texas, the State has used Ed-Flex, and the \nachievement scores confirm that Ed-Flex has improved academic \nperformance. After only 2 years under the waiver, statewide results on \nthe Texas assessment of academic skills shows that schools using Ed-\nFlex are outperforming the districts that aren't. These are poor school \ndistricts with low-income children, and reading and math scores are \nrising using Ed-Flex. At one high-poverty elementary school, student \nperformance improved almost 23 percent over the 1996 math test scores; \n82 percent of them passed. The statewide average was only 64 percent. \nPoor kids did better. Poor kids did better under Ed-Flex.\n  Now, this legislation protects the poor in other important ways. The \ncivil rights laws, the labor laws, safety laws, all of the core Federal \nprotections for the vulnerable, are not touched in any way. The \nSecretary of Education has complete authority to revoke a waiver if \ntitle I requirements are not met. Under current law, a State must have \na plan to comply with title I. This legislation requires a plan as \nwell.\n  Let me outline a number of specific protections that pertain to the \npoor in this legislation. First, under current law, title I funds can \nonly be used in school districts that are for the low-income. Our \nlegislation keeps this requirement. You cannot get an Ed-Flex waiver \nand move it out of a low-income school district to somewhere else. You \nhave to use those dollars in a low-income school district. They can't \nbe moved elsewhere.\n  Second, not only does the legislation keep the core requirements of \ntitle I, it strengthens them. For example, under current law, States \nare not required to evaluate whether they are meeting title I goals \nuntil 2001. Ed-Flex says to the States: Why should you wait for 2 years \nto show that you are serving the poor and disadvantaged? Develop high \nstandards for serving the poor now, demonstrate that you meet the \naccountability requirements, and put more education dollars in the \nclassroom to serve poor kids and their families now, rather than \nwaiting until 2001.\n  Now, opponents of Ed-Flex have not been able to offer any examples--\nnot even one--of how the flexibility waivers have been abused, and that \nis because the Secretary of Education has watch-dogged these Ed-Flex \nwaivers; and we can cite examples of how it works, and they can't cite \nany examples of how it has been abused. That is why the Education and \nLabor Committee in the last Congress approved this legislation by a 17-\n1 bipartisan vote.\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\n  Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of the committee, said,\n\n       Under Ed-Flex, the Secretary of Education allows \n     Massachusetts and other States to waive Federal regulations \n     and statutory requirements that impede State and local \n     efforts to improve learning and teaching. With that \n     flexibility comes stronger accountability to improve student \n     achievement.\n\n  Since that time, since those eloquent words of Senator Kennedy, in a \n17-1 vote in the Labor Committee, after lengthy debate, the sponsors \nfelt that it was important to work with those who have had reservations \nabout this legislation, and we have made six additional changes in the \nlegislation to strengthen a bill that had virtual unanimous bipartisan \nsupport. We have strengthened the requirements for public participation \nso that there is public notice. We put in place a requirement that \nStates include specific, measurable goals, which include student \nperformance, a requirement that the Secretary report to the Congress \nafter 2 years on how Ed-Flex States are doing. The Secretary must \ninclude how the waiver is affecting student performance, what Federal \nand State laws are being waived, and how the waiver is affecting the \noverall State and local reform efforts.\n\n  There is a requirement that the Secretary review State content and \nperformance standards twice, once when deciding if the State is \neligible to participate and again when deciding whether or not to grant \napproval for a waiver. This is to make sure that there is no \ncompromising title I. The Secretary of Education reviews twice whether \nor not to go forward with an Ed-Flex waiver.\n  We have always altered the legislation to ensure that local review \ncannot be waived under Ed-Flex; that is, any school or school district \nreceiving title I funds is still subject to punishment and still has to \nanswer to a local review board. Those provisions that protect the poor \ncannot be waived.\n  Mr. President, it is no accident that every Governor, every \nDemocratic Governor, believes this will be a valuable tool to them to \nmake existing programs work better.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota has made an important point in \ntalking about how additional dollars are needed for some of these key \nprograms to serve the poor. But the best way to generate support for \nthat approach is to show that you are using the dollars that you get \ntoday wisely. That is what Ed-Flex allows. It is a fresh, creative \napproach to Federal-State relations, one that has enormous potential \nfor improving the delivery of services to the poor and all Americans.\n  So I say to the Senate that we have a chance to take a new, creative \npath with respect to Federal and State relations where one side says \nall the answers reside in Washington, DC, and the other side says, no, \nthey all reside at the local level. The third path that is being taken \nby Ed-Flex, that is being taken by my State in health, in welfare, in \nthe environment, says to the Federal Government: At the local level, we \nwill meet the requirements of Federal law, Federal education law. We \nwill be held accountable. But in return for holding us accountable, \ngive us the flexibility so that we can ensure that we come up with \nsolutions that work for Coos Bay, OR, and The Dalles, OR, and you don't \ntake a ``one-size-fits-all'' cookie-cutter approach and say that what \nis done in the Bronx is what is going to work in rural Oregon.\n  Before I wrap up, I would like to pay a special tribute to our former \ncolleague, Senator Hatfield. I served in the House when Senator \nHatfield took the lead in 1994, working with Senator Kennedy and \nothers, to promote this approach. In my view, his record alone, \nstanding for years and years for civil rights laws, for health laws and \nsafety laws, would suggest that there is a commitment by the sponsors \nof this legislation to ensure that this helps the poor, not hurts the \npoor.\n  If there was one example, Mr. President, even one, of how an Ed-Flex \nwaiver has harmed the poor, I know I would immediately move to address \nthat and to ensure that our legislation didn't allow it. But we have no \nexamples of how in any of those States the poor have been exploited or \ntaken advantage of. We have plenty of examples of how Ed-Flex has \nworked in Texas where the scores have gone up, in Maryland where it has \nreduced class size, in Oregon where poor kids who couldn't get advanced \ncomputing under the status quo were able to use Ed-Flex dollars to get \nthose skills that are so critical to a high-skill, high-wage job.\n  So I urge the Senate today to vote for the motion to proceed, vote \nfor the bill, empower the communities across this country to earn the \nright to use Federal education dollars to serve the vulnerable in our \nsociety most effectively. This is not the sole answer to what is needed \nto improve education, public education, in our country, but it is an \nimportant step, because it shows the people of the country that we can \nuse existing Federal funds more effectively, that we can be more \ninnovative in serving poor kids. It seems to me that step does a \ntremendous amount to lay the foundation to garner public support for \nareas where we need additional funds.\n  We are going to need additional funds for a number of these key areas \nthat the Senator from Minnesota is right to touch on. But let's show \nthe taxpayer that we are using existing dollars effectively, as we have \ndone in Oregon, as we have done in Texas, as we have done in \nMassachusetts, in line with objectives that, as far as I can tell, are \nwidely supported on both sides of the aisle.\n  I see the Senator from Tennessee has joined as well, and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota was kind enough to give me time from his allocation. I \nwould just wrap up by thanking the Senator from Minnesota and also say \nthat I very much appreciated working with the Senator from Tennessee on \nthis legislation. I think it is clear that the country wants to see the \nU.S. Senate work in a bipartisan way on this legislation.\n  This bill had exhaustive hearings in the Senate Budget Task Force on \nEducation. It was debated at length in the Education and Labor \nCommittee, where it won on a 17-to-1 vote in the last session of the \nSenate. Since that time, as I have outlined in my presentation, \nadditional changes have been made to promote accountability.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take about 5 or 10 minutes, and \nthen I will yield back the rest of my time. I have had several hours. I \nsay to my colleague from Tennessee that I will yield back my time \nbecause I have to give a talk with law enforcement people in Minnesota \nvia video.\n  There are some students from Minnesota who are here. Welcome. We are \nglad you are here, and teachers and parents.\n  Let me just make three points.\n  First of all, although we will have tougher debate later on, I say to \nmy colleague from Oregon, we certainly didn't have any lengthy debate \non Ed-Flex this Congress. We never had a hearing--not one hearing at \nall. When my colleague says they can't talk about any abuses, the fact \nof the matter is that both the Congressional Research Service and GAO--\nI am not prejudging one way or other, but it is difficult to talk about \nwhat is going on--both have said we don't have the data in yet. We \ndon't have the data in. What is the rush? I might have a different \njudgment about this on the basis--I don't know whether I will \ngeneralize 12 States to 50 States, but I certainly might be less \nskeptical if in fact we had the data and if we had the reports in. We \ndon't. But we are rushing ahead.\n  The second point I want to make is that my colleague talks about the \n``core'' requirements. Certainly it is true that, with IDEA, the core \nrequirements are kept intact. But as a matter of fact, we will see that \nthe truth will be very clear with this amendment. I will have an \namendment on the floor, and it will simply say that the core \nrequirements are that title I students be taught by highly qualified \nprofessional staff, that States set high standards for all children, \nthat States provide funding to the lowest income schools first, that \nStates hold schools accountable for making substantial annual progress \ntoward getting all students, particularly low-income and limited-\nEnglish-proficient students, to meet high standards, and that the \nvocational programs provide broad education and work experiences rather \nthan their own job training. I will have an amendment\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\nthat says those core requirements will be fenced off and no State or \nschool district will be exempt.\n  Can my colleagues tell me that that is the case right now? If so, \nthen that amendment will pass with overwhelming support. Right now, \nthat is not in the bill. Do you have language in the bill that \nguarantees that all those requirements will be met?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes. I think your amendment is OK.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Do both my colleagues agree? Lord, we don't even have \nto have a debate on it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, clearly, we would like to get to the bill, \nand we can actually talk about what is in the bill. The bill has not \nbeen, as you know, introduced in the managers' package. And I hope \nthat, although the morning hour has been reduced, we can get to the \nbill and discuss what is in it or not.\n  For a State to become a title I State, in both existing law as well \nas what we will have in our bill, you have to have the full complement \nof title I requirements, which will be spelled out.\n  You can't be an Ed-Flex State both today and in the future law. So is \nit in the bill? Because you can't be eligible unless they are actually \nin. For the very specific things, if we could introduce it, there is a \nwhole list of accountability clauses I would like to get to after we \nintroduce the bill formally, if we could do that, talk about the core \nprinciples and the protections and the accountability.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, this amendment will say that \nStates cannot waive the following core requirements. These have been \nthe core requirements of title 1.\n  Would my colleague agree that States will not be able to waive these \ncore requirements?\n  Mr. FRIST. I have not seen the core requirements. I didn't hear what \nthe core requirements are specifically. But if you would allow us to \nproceed to the bill at some point, at the appropriate time--right now, \nas you know, we have given the Senator the last 3 hours so he can make \nthese points. We are ready to go to the bill, introduce to America a \ngreat Ed-Flex bill, as soon as the Senator is finished.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just to be clear, I get a different message from my \ntwo colleagues here. This is where the rubber meets the road. I spent a \nlot of time on what Ed-Flex doesn't do and what we should be doing. My \npoint right now is that every single person I know who has worked on \ntitle I and knows what it is all about is absolutely committed and \ninsistent that the core requirements be fenced in, remain intact, and \nno State can get a waiver, no school district can get a waiver. I am \nasking the Senator whether he agrees. If the Senator agrees, this \ncertainly makes it a far better bill than it is right now.\n  And my second question is, What about the 75 percent rule? That is a \ncore requirement right now. We worked that in in 1994. Would both of my \ncolleagues agree that schools with 75 percent low-income students or \nmore should be first priority in funding and that we keep that in as a \nrequirement, so that we don't lessen the financial aid to the neediest \nschools? Would you agree? Could I get support for that right now?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would respond to my distinguished colleague from \nMinnesota, that if we could introduce the bill and discuss the bill \nbefore specific amendments--right now we have not had the opportunity \nbecause of these delaying tactics, which is what they are, so the \nSenator would have the opportunity to have 3 hours to lay everything \nout--if the Senator would just allow us to at least bring this bill to \nthe floor at some time so we can discuss and formally debate and read \nthe amendments--he is talking about an amendment which I have not seen. \nI haven't had the opportunity to see it. The Senator hasn't presented \nit. It is a little bit strange to be debating specific amendments and \nprinciples to amendments before the bill is introduced.\n  So let me just make a plea to the Senator to allow this bill to be \nformally introduced, debated, amendment by amendment, if the Senator \nwould like, and I think that is appropriate, but we can't do it unless \nthe Senator allows consideration of this bill. Right now it is \nimportant for the American people to understand that we, because of \nwhat is going on right now and what we are hearing, cannot proceed \nuntil the Senator from Minnesota allows us to proceed with the \nunderlying bill.\n  So I will just ask, Is the Senator going to allow us to proceed to \naddress the Ed-Flex bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague, first of all, well knows \nthat we are going to be allowed to proceed, because I asked for several \nhours and I have about used up my time. So we are going to proceed.\n  My colleague already knows that, so there is no reason to press, to \nmake the case. With all due respect, we could have a discussion about \nthese issues right now. We can have the discussion about them later on. \nI have spent a considerable amount of time pointing out right now that \nin the bill, as it reads, States can receive a waiver from these basic \ncore requirements of title I. I want to make sure we have the strictest \naccountability measures to make sure that will not happen. I have \npointed out that right now, as the bill currently stands, States can \nreceive a waiver from the 75-percent requirement.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to make sure that doesn't happen.\n  I will be pleased to yield. In fact, I literally have to leave in a \nminute\n  Mr. WYDEN. This will be only 30 seconds.\n  On page 12, line 12 of the bill, it states, and I quote:\n\n       The Secretary may not waive any statutory or regulatory \n     requirement of the program.\n\n  Point blank. You cannot waive any of the core requirements. I thank \nthe Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague from \nOregon, that if we have the same interpretation--and we will see; I get \na somewhat different reaction from my colleague from Tennessee--I will \nhave an amendment with clear language that lists those core \nrequirements and makes it crystal clear that they are fenced in and \nthat no State or school district can receive any waiver on those \nrequirements, in which case that will be some good accountability, in \nwhich case I would expect full support for it. My interpretation is a \ndifferent one. If you are right that we already have the ironclad \nguarantees, then this amendment should pass with 100 votes.\n\n  Mr. President, let me simply thank my colleagues. We don't agree, but \nI think it was important to have the opportunity to speak about this \nbill and give it, I think, a wide context and to speak to what I think \nare the flaws. We are going to have a spirited debate with any number \nof amendments, and I hope ultimately this ends up being a very positive \npiece of legislation that will make a positive difference in the lives \nof children. In its present shape and form, it does not do that. And we \nwill have a major debate.\n  I will yield back the remainder of my time, and I say to my \ncolleagues, I will not be asking for the yeas and nays. We can just \nhave a voice vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to very briefly respond to a \ncouple of points that have been made over the course of this morning.\n  The distinguished Senator from Minnesota has made a number of points \nin outlining his view of what needs to be done with education in this \ncountry as we go forward. His time was delegated to him so that he \nwould have that opportunity, although a lot of us are anxiously waiting \nto get to the bill itself, the Ed-Flex bill, which is the subject of \nour debate over the course of today, tonight and tomorrow, and probably \nthe next several days.\n  First of all, he has outlined many of the challenges that we do have \nin education today. The great thing about this whole debate is that \nwhether it is his intentions or my intentions or the intentions of the \nSenator from Oregon,\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\nit really is to address the fundamental issues of education, of really \nmaking sure that our children today, and in future generations, are \nbest prepared. And they are not today. We all have come to that \nconclusion. Parents recognize that and principals understand that, and \nteachers and school boards and Governors, and all the various groups \nthat we will hear about.\n  That is the great thing, that as the No. 1 agenda item coming out of \nthis Congress and the Senate, we are addressing education. Let me say \nthat the approach is going to be different. There won't be a lot of \nheated debate. What needs to be protected, which programs to address, \nhow to address them, how much control does the Federal Government have, \nhow much control do the local communities have or do parents have or do \nGovernors have, that will be the subject of much of the debate that we \nwill hear.\n  A second big issue is flexibility. People on both sides of the aisle \nare so well intentioned, and we all have our favorite education program \nand we think that that program might be the silver bullet, but we all \nknow that there is no single silver bullet as we address this whole \nissue of educating our young people, preparing them for that next \ncentury.\n  Let me say that right coming out of the box, before we even introduce \nthis bill formally, which I think will be done early this afternoon: \nThis bill is no silver bullet either. It does address the basic \nprinciples. It is not a series of programs that are well intended that \nmay cost money, that may be very good in and of themselves, but it sets \nthat principle that does allow more flexibility, more creativity, more \ninnovation in accomplishing the goals that most of us agree to. This \nbill does not change the resources going in, nor does it change the \ngoals, but it does reorder our thinking of how to get from those \nresources to those goals. And what it does, it drops the barriers with \nstrong accountability.\n  When we talk about flexibility and we talk about accountability, that \nis what this bill does. Not the resources, not yet; we are going to \nhave that argument over the course of the year with what is called--we \nwill all become very familiar with it--the ESEA, the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. There is an ongoing discussion right now in \nSenator Jeffords' committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. That is ongoing and hearings will be held and that is where \nwe will be looking at all these multiple well-intended programs. We \nwill be looking at all the resources going into education. Is it too \nlittle? Is it too much? Should we divert certain of those resources to \ncertain programs?\n  That is not what we are doing today or tomorrow in the Ed-Flex, the \nFrist-Wyden Ed-Flex. That is not what we are doing. We are looking at \nhow to streamline the system, make more efficient use of those \nresources, trust our local schools and local teachers and local \nprincipals who can identify specific needs in order to improve \neducation, and make sure those resources are used in the appropriate \nway to meet the goals that we all lay out. That is an important \nconcept, because a lot of these amendments that are being proposed, \nprincipally on the other side of the aisle and maybe solely on the \nother side of the aisle, will be to make some good, strong points that \nthis program is great. You will hear me and others say let's consider \nall of those issues, but we need to consider them in the context of \nwhat we are doing with education totally and that is not what this bill \nis all about. This is about the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, \nthe Ed-Flex Act.\n  I want to begin with that because it does set the overall environment \nin which this debate can most intelligently be carried out. Without \nthat, we are going to drop into these whirls of rhetoric: Although this \nprogram will really turn things around--and we all should recognize \nright up front we cannot look just at rhetoric.\n  I heard three points over the last 3 hours that my colleague from \nMinnesota mentioned. No. 1, we are rushing through this thing and we \nare trying to jam it through the U.S. Senate and thrust it upon the \nAmerican people. You hear these words ``rushing it through, rushing it \nthrough.'' The second point he seemed to make this morning was that in \nsome way Ed-Flex hurts poor children. And then he said there is no \ndata, there is no evidence, there is no information; let's wait until \nwe generate some information before we go forward. In some way it hurts \npoor children, that was almost the theme. So I think we need to respond \nto that and move on and look at the great things this bill does.\n  The third point he made is that our bill does not address a lot of \nspecific programs that he would like to address, and it is nutrition \nneeds and it is Head Start and a lot of afterschool programs and a lot \nof programs which are very important to education and need to be \ndiscussed. We need to go back and evaluate. But that is not what Ed-\nFlex is intended to do. That is not what the Ed-Flex bill is all about.\n  What we have is a bill that was generated by myself and Senator \nWyden, who just spoke on the floor, that is a bipartisan bill that \nrepresents strong support with all 50 Governors--every State Governor \nis supporting this piece of legislation. It is bipartisan, \nsymbolically, because it is Ron Wyden and Bill Frist out there who have \nbeen working on this bill for the past year.\n  We will talk, after the bill is introduced, about the broad support \nthat it has. But we all know the President said last week: Let's pass \nEd-Flex this week. The Department of Education has been very supportive \nof this bill throughout. Unfortunately, I think what we heard this \nmorning may be a prelude to what we can expect, and that is going to be \na series of programs which have billion-dollar price tags, million-\ndollar price tags, that will be billed as the best program out there. \nAnd some of those programs are really going to appeal to our colleagues \nand to people listening to this debate. They will say: Yes, things like \nmore teachers and construction and all would be good, and they are very \nconcrete and real. Again, we are going to look at those later.\n\n  Real quickly, as we go through, are we rushing this through? Let's \nmake very clear that we are not rushing this through. We addressed this \nin the committee, the appropriate committee of Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pension, which is the former Labor Committee. Senator \nJeffords will be managing this bill with me. He has been very \nthoughtful, and over the period of time through a number of different \ndiscussions, we have debated the bill, we marked this bill up--again, \nthat is terminology inside this room--but that means we have discussed \nthis bill, we have debated these amendments, many of them, both last \nyear when it sailed through the committee we debated each of these \nissues and then again this year.\n  It is important for the American people to understand that, yes, this \nparticular bill passed last year 17 to 1; that one person, that \ncolleague we have heard from this morning and I am sure we will hear \nfrom again and again. But recognize it passed 17 to 1. We ran out of \ntime at the end of the last Congress. It came back through the \ncommittee and was marked up just several weeks ago and, again, was \npassed out and sent to the floor.\n  The General Accounting Office study which has been cited, which will \nbe referred to--again, I will have to turn to my colleague, Senator \nWyden, and say thank you. He is the one who initially requested that, \nthe initial request to GAO which came back with the report, and out of \nthe report we have been able to see great benefits and also some of the \nareas in which we need to strengthen our legislation, which we have \ndone so we can go ahead and move ahead with that flexibility and \naccountability.\n  Then ``rushing this through,'' when you think about most of the \neducation we address here, we have not had an experience of 5 years. \nRemember, this is a demonstration project today. There are 12 States \nthat have Ed-Flex--passed in 1994 with six States; another six States \nadded on to that. So we have a 5-year experience in 12 different States \nwith this program already. So, yes, we know that it works. So, are we \nrushing it through? You can just move that argument right to the side.\n  No. 2, it hurts poor children? This is remarkable because it was \nreally the theme of this morning: In some way, Ed-Flex hurts poor \nchildren. Let me just look to some outside groups who have looked at \nthis.\n  If you refer back to the chart behind me, it is the report of the \nCitizens'\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\nCommission on Civil Rights, a wonderful report that may be referred to \nseveral times in the course of the next several days, issued in the \nfall of this past year, and they hit right at the heart. Really, I \nthink we can just move on, almost:\n\n       In the Citizens' Commission's judgment, these waivers did \n     not seriously undermine the statute's intent to target aid to \n     poor children.\n\n  Then, if we look for hard data, again we have heard all this rhetoric \nabout, ``Oh, we have a potential for hurting poor children; we have the \npotential for this.'' Clearly, you can create hypotheticals in any \npiece of legislation, in any statute, any regulation, and politicians \nare pretty good at it. We can create hypotheticals and say if this were \nto happen it would destroy education and so forth. My approach is a \nlittle bit more the scientist.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I spent time looking at data and that \nscientific, analytical mind may interfere with some things, but it does \ncause me to ask the question: What data do we have? What is the hard \ndata and what is the evidence? And let me just look at some of the \nareas that were mentioned.\n  Texas, which has a very successful Ed-Flex program, has accumulated \nsome representative data which looks at three different areas. It is \ngoing to be hard to read, but at the top it looks at African American \nstudents; beneath that it looks at Hispanic students; and beneath that \nit looks at economically disadvantaged students.\n  The far left column shows 1996, the next column over shows 1997. The \ncolumn I want to concentrate on is, ``Actual change.'' Remember, this \nis hard data, looking at a State that compared Ed-Flex to non-Ed-Flex.\n  If you look at that middle column--let me just drop right down to the \nbottom where it says ``Economically Disadvantaged Students.''\n  In 1996--this is for mathematics. This is a statewide comparison of \nselected campuses in title I, part A. Title I is the disadvantaged \nstudents element which we heard so much about this morning. We see in \nthose States, like Westlawn Elementary, La Marque ISD, with the title I \nschoolwide waiver, in that column we see an improvement of 16.8 \npercent. These are just with the disadvantaged students. The statewide \naverage was an improvement of 8 percent.\n  Thus, for those disadvantaged students, if you compare the Ed-Flex \nprogram, we see that students improved twice as much in the very \npopulation that we hear this rhetorical concern about. Again, this is \nhard data, representative data.\n  We look at African American students compared to the statewide \naverage. In the Ed-Flex, African American students at Westlawn \nElementary, we see they improved by 22 percent; statewide average, 9 \npercent--again, more than a doubling of improvement in the Ed-Flex \nschoolwide waiver program.\n  Halfway down you see Hispanic students. Again, if you take the entity \nof Westlawn, you see an improvement of 16 percent versus 7.9 percent--\nagain, that Ed-Flex school doing twice as well under a schoolwide \nwaiver as they would otherwise do. And this is representative data. \nAgain, once we get to the bill, you will see.\n  So we see that the Commission on Civil Rights--we see hard data. \nThere are other examples from Massachusetts we will hear about.\n  And then I guess really the fundamental thing I will come back to \nlater is, our bill can't hurt poor children, because the dollars have \nto be used. Going back to my earlier comments, we do not change the \ndollars and we did not change the ultimate goals in the targeted \npopulation. Our bill does not do that. So by law, if you are targeted \nfor this population, the money and the programs have to go there. How \nyou get there is where the flexibility comes in.\n  One last point I referred to, which was his last point, was that we \nare not addressing nutrition and other well-meaning programs, again, \nthat we will hear paraded out. Let me just say that is not the intent \nof this bill. We can discuss them. We can introduce them. Those sorts \nof issues will be discussed in the chairman's committee appropriately, \nwhere they can be debated, where we can consider all of the resources, \nall of the programs, recognizing there is not one single silver bullet \nto cure education, the challenges of education. The Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act is the appropriate forum that this body has to \nconsider these issues.\n  With that, I thank you for this opportunity to speak and thank the \nchairman for yielding time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Oregon \ndesires some time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I could wrap up very \nbriefly, even in, say, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman.\n  Senator Frist has said it very well. Mr. President, and colleagues, \nall we want to do under Ed-Flex is to make sure that these dollars get \ninto the classroom to help poor kids and not get chewed up by \nbureaucratic redtape.\n  Ed-Flex is not a block grant program. It is not a voucher kind of \nscheme. The people who are advocating Ed-Flex in my home State of \nOregon do not want a Federal education program to go away. Quite the \ncontrary, they want those programs. They know that we need those \ndollars to serve low-income students. What we want is, we want some \nfreedom from some of the Federal water torture and bureaucratic redtape \nthat so often keeps us from using those dollars to better serve the \npoor.\n  I would just hope, Mr. President, and colleagues, that during the \ncourse of the afternoon colleagues look at the requirements that \nprotect the poor families and the poor children that cannot be waived \nunder the Ed-Flex statute. Specifically, it is not possible to get a \nwaiver if you are trying to waive the underlying programs of each of \nthe critical services that is made possible under title I. You cannot \ndo it. And as I stated earlier, you can only use those dollars in a \nlow-income school district; you cannot move those dollars out of a low-\nincome school district and take them somewhere else.\n  So there is a reason for the Governors and all of the Democratic \nGovernors supporting this legislation. I happen to have some sympathy \nfor the Senator from Minnesota about the need for additional dollars \nfor a variety of human services. But the best way to win support for \nthat additional funding is to show that you are using existing dollars \nwell and effectively. That is what Ed-Flex does.\n  I am very pleased to have had a chance to team up with Senator Frist \nof Tennessee who has worked very hard to bring both parties together. \nAnd I thank the Senator from Vermont for the time.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield back all our remaining committee time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2177-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2177-S2201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EDUCATIONAL FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Today, Mr. President, we are taking up what I would \ncall ``unfinished business'' from last Congress. Our bipartisan efforts \nin the last Congress resulted in nearly 30 public laws, about a third \nof them in the area of education. However, there was one bill that was \nreported from the Health and Education Committee with broad bipartisan \nsupport, the Ed-Flex bill, that was not enacted into law.\n  A year ago, the President told the Nation's Governors that passage of \nthis legislation--and I quote him--``would dramatically reduce the \nregulatory burden of the federal government on the states in the area \nof education.''\n  Six months ago, Secretary Riley wrote me to reiterate the \nadministration's support for the Ed-Flex bill and urged its passage. \nThe Senate Health and Education Committee heeded his advice and passed \nit with only one dissenting vote.\n  The National Governors' Association, under the chairmanship of \nGovernor Carper from Delaware, has strongly urged the Congress to pass \nEd-Flex this year.\n  Last November, the General Accounting Office looked at this program \nin detail, both at the dozen States that now participate in the Ed-Flex \nprogram and the 38 that potentially could participate under this \nlegislation. It found that views among the current States varied, but \nit was seen as modestly helpful.\n  It would be a gross overstatement to suggest that this bill will \nrevolutionize education. It will be a sensible step in making our \nlimited resources go further toward the goal of improving our education \ndelivery system.\n  The Department of Education, under the leadership of Secretary Riley, \nhas stated that Ed-Flex authority will help States in ``removing \npotential regulatory barriers to the successful implementation of \ncomprehensive school reform'' initiatives.\n  I would like to take a moment to briefly review the history of Ed-\nFlex. The original Ed-Flex legislation was first conceived by former \nSenator Mark Hatfield, as many of us know, an individual deeply \ncommitted to improving education. His proposal had its roots in his \nhome State of Oregon which has long been a role model in education.\n  Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education gives a State some \nauthority to grant waivers within a State, giving each State the \nability to make decisions about whether some school districts may be \ngranted waivers pertaining to certain Federal requirements.\n  It is very important to note that States cannot waive any Federal \nregulatory or statutory requirements relating to health and safety, \ncivil rights, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, \nequitable participation of students and professional staff in private \nschools, parental participation and involvement, and distribution of \nfunds to State or local education agencies. They have no authority to \nwaive any of those.\n  The 1994 legislation authorized six Ed Flex states, three \ndesignations were to be awarded to states with populations of 3.5 \nmillion or greater and 3 were to be granted to states with populations \nless than 3.5 million.\n  These states were not chosen randomly nor quickly--the selection \nprocess was 2 and one-half years in duration. The Department of \nEducation sent out a notice and a state interested in participating in \nEd Flex submitted an application.\n  In the application, each interested state was required to describe \nhow it would use its waiver authority, including how it would evaluate \nwaiver applications from local school districts and how it would ensure \naccountability.\n  The original six are: Kansas, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and \nmy home state of Vermont. Another six states came on board between May \n1996 and July 1997. Those additional states are: Colorado, Illinois, \nIowa, Maryland, Michigan, and New Mexico.\n  Vermont has used its Ed Flex authority to improve Title One services, \nparticularly improving services for those students in smaller rural \nareas. In addition, my home state has also used Ed Flex authority to \nprovide greater access to professional development, which is a very \ncritical area and perhaps has the greatest impact on enhancing student \nperformance.\n  The Department of Education has stated that the 12 current Ed Flex \nstates have ``used their waiver authority carefully and judiciously.''\n  In last November's GAO report on Ed Flex, several state officials \nfrom the established Ed Flex states, said that ``Ed Flex promotes a \nclimate that encourages state and local educators to explore new \napproaches . . .''\n  The bill before us today, S. 280, under the sponsorship of Senator \nBill Frist and Senator Ron Wyden, has significantly improved the \naccountability aspects of the 1994 Ed Flex law.\n  S. 280 is very specific regarding a state's eligibility under Ed Flex \nauthority. The bill makes it clear that a state must have state content \nstandards, challenging student performance standards, and aligned \nassessments as described in Title 1 or the state must have made \nsubstantial progress, as determined by the Secretary, in implementing \nits Title 1 state standards.\n  This legislation also emphasizes the importance of school and student \nperformance. Each local education agency applying for a waiver must \ndescribe its ``specific, measurable, educational goals'' regarding \nprogress toward increased school and student performance.\n  As I indicated earlier, this legislation is not meant to serve as the \nsole solution to improving school and student performance.\n  However, it does serve as a mechanism that will give states the \nability to enhance services to students through flexibility with real \naccountability.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 280 and to withhold extraneous \namendments that will delay and complicate its enactment.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Bill Frist and Ron Wyden and \ntheir staff for their hard work on this legislation.\n  They have done an outstanding job and I commend them for their \nefforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am happy to rise in support of the Ed-Flex \nlegislation. I want to commend Chairman Jeffords and Senator Frist for \ntheir outstanding work, as well as Senator Wyden for his bipartisan \nefforts on behalf of this legislation which I think takes a tremendous \nstep--a bold step--toward improving education in our Nation's schools.\n  I listened closely to some of those who spoke earlier today and \nyesterday in opposition to this legislation. Time and time again, I \nheard the advocacy of greater spending, as if spending were the sole \ngauge for our commitment to better education in this country.\n  I heard time and time again that Ed-Flex was nothing or that it did \nnothing. The fact is that providing greater flexibility for our State \ndepartments of education, providing greater flexibility for local \nschool districts, is the single best thing that we can do to untie \ntheir hands, to take the straitjackets off local educators and ensure \nthat they, in fact, have the ability to make the decisions that are \ngoing to be in the best interests of the students in this country.\n  I remember well when I came to the House of Representatives, the U.S. \nCongress, in 1993, and the great debate was on what we should do about \nwelfare reform. We had established across this country a process by \nwhich States could apply for waivers from the burdensome welfare \nregulations mandated on the Federal level. While not all of the analogy \nbetween welfare reform and education reform today fit--there are many \ndifferences--there are also a number of similarities.\n  The first step toward what became comprehensive welfare reform was \nthe ability for States to apply for waivers and escape the heavy-handed \nmandates coming out of Washington, DC. That first step on waivers led \nus to the much broader step of block grants and comprehensive welfare \nreform, which has worked, and which has taken thousands and thousands \nof people who were living lives of dependency on welfare to now lives \nof independence, lives of hope and greater prosperity.\n  It has worked in spite of the dire predictions about giving the \nStates the\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\nflexibility to enact what they believed would work in their States in \nwelfare reform; it has, in fact, accomplished the stated goals.\n  I believe that while this, as has often been said, is not an end-all, \nit is not a cure-all for educational woes in this country, providing \nthe States an ability to escape Washington mandates so long as they are \naccomplishing intended purposes with proper accountability is an \nimportant first step to take. I hope we will go further. I hope we go \nto dollars to the classroom that will consolidate a number of Federal \neducation programs. But this is bold and this is important. I commend \nthe bipartisan efforts to bring us to this point.\n  I think what we are addressing in this legislation is the tragedy of \nbureaucratic waste. We have heard repeatedly the statistics that have \nbeen cited, and I think accurately cited, that we have 760 Federal \neducation programs; that those 760 Federal education programs spend \napproximately 6 or 7 cents on the dollar in funding for our local \nschools, while mandating 50 percent of the paperwork required for our \neducational programs.\n  When Pete Hoekstra in the House of Representatives began his \nCrossroads Project, looking at education in America, one of the first \nthings he did was to try to catalog the number of Federal education \nprograms. I have the transcript of Secretary Riley before Congressman \nHoekstra's committee.\n\n       Chairman Hoekstra: How many education programs do you \n     estimate that we have throughout the Federal Government? [A \n     rather straightforward question to ask of the Secretary of \n     Education.]\n       Secretary Riley: We have--what is the page? It's around \n     200. I've got it here. One thing that I do think is \n     misleading is to talk about 760--\n       Chairman Hoekstra: Well, how many do you think there are?\n       Secretary Riley: We have--I've got a page here with it.\n       Chairman Hoekstra: Just the Department of Education alone \n     or is this including all other agencies?\n       Secretary Riley: It is just a couple less than 200.\n       Chairman Hoekstra: Is this just the Department of \n     Education?\n       Secretary Riley: Just the Department of Education.\n       Chairman Hoekstra: Well, how about including other agencies \n     and those kinds of things.\n       Secretary Riley: Well, that is where I was going to get \n     into the 760.\n\n  It goes on. Congressman Hoekstra explains the process they had to go \nthrough to actually come up with the figure 760 Federal education \nprograms, and, in fact, it is quite well verified. So 760 programs that \nhad never even been cataloged, when you asked the Department, they \ndidn't even know how many there actually were. What we are suggesting \nis that those 760 education programs place an enormous paperwork burden \non classroom teachers, local educators, and on a State's department of \neducation. It is in that area that we can address the enormous \nbureaucratic waste.\n\n  Now, it was said repeatedly that this bill is nothing. I want to \nquote a man I admire greatly, and he is quoted in the Fordham \nFoundation report entitled ``New Directions.'' That individual is the \nRev. Floyd Flake. Many of you will recognize that name because Floyd \nFlake was a Congressman from New York State for many, many years, \nrepresenting his constituents very well, but who was willing to step \noutside of the box and, in fact, he was so committed to education \nreform and improving the lives of the children of his constituents in \nNew York, he left the U.S. Congress--a safe seat for sure--and went \nback to his home district to run a school and pastor a church. This is \nwhat Rev. Floyd Flake said, an African American pastor who served in \nthe U.S. House as a Democrat:\n\n       While over $100 billion in title I funds have been expended \n     on behalf of these children--\n\n  that is, children at risk--\n\n     these funds have not made much difference. Study after study \n     has shown that this important Federal program has failed to \n     narrow the achievement gap. The result for America's neediest \n     girls and boys is nothing short of tragedy. Real education \n     reform will transform the future prospects of America's \n     minority and low-income children, but this cannot come \n     primarily from Washington. What the Federal Government can do \n     is get out of the way of States and communities that are \n     serious about pursuing real education reform of their own \n     devising.\n\n  I believe Reverend Flake, Congressman Flake, has hit the nail on the \nhead. We have heard much very strong, emotional and passionate talk \nabout the needs of disadvantaged children. I don't believe anybody can \nquestion Pastor Flake's commitment to disadvantaged children. He said \nthe best thing we can do is get Washington out of the way. So I believe \nwe can address the tragedy of bureaucratic waste by passing Ed-Flex.\n  Secondly, we address the logic that one size fits all; that wisdom \nflows only from Washington, DC; that the U.S. Congress has the wisdom \nand ability to micromanage our schools. So we hear much about \naccountability and that somehow by providing States broad, new \nflexibility we are going to water down or minimize accountability.\n  Well, I believe it is a very high form of arrogance to say that we \ndon't trust local elected officials, we don't trust local school \nsuperintendents who are hired by that local school board, that we don't \ntrust the Governors of our States, that, in fact, only we can make \nthose decisions about what accountability should be. ``One size fits \nall'' rarely works in a country as diverse as the United States of \nAmerica. To believe that we can micromanage local schools from \nWashington, whether they are in inner-city New York City or Desha \nCounty, AR, or whether it be in Detroit or in Miami, the differences in \nour cultures, our social backgrounds, and our needs across this country \nare so great, we are so diverse, that to believe that we can properly \ndiagnose and then treat educational problems from Washington, I think, \nis foolish, indeed.\n  In fact, as you look over the history of the last 30 years of \neducation in this country, we have seen, by every objective \nmeasurement, a deterioration in academic success. I suggest to those \nwho oppose this bill that they are attempting to defend a status quo \nthat is demonstrably flawed. We can address the tragedy of ``Washington \nknows best'' and that we don't trust those local officials. What brings \nus to the floor today--what brings this legislation to the floor today \nis the crisis that exists in American education.\n\n  I listened to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. He used many \nof the same statistics that I quote. He quoted many of the same reports \nthat I have before me, which emphasize and underscore the crisis we \nface in American education. But it seems to me that the opponents are \nsaying it is a terrible crisis and therefore we need to keep the status \nquo, we need to fund current programs at higher levels, when what we \nhave been doing has clearly failed.\n  So what this bipartisan bill does is to say, let's try a new \napproach, and that innovation, creativity, and new ideas are coming \nfrom the States and local schools. Let's give them the flexibility to \nenact those reforms, and I believe we will see education truly improve.\n  The federally funded National Assessment of Educational Progress, the \nNAEP report, reports that 38 percent of 4th grade students do not even \nattain ``basic'' achievement levels in reading. In math, 38 percent of \n8th graders score below basic level, as do 43 percent of 12th graders \nin science.\n  I point out that there is an obvious trend there. In the lower \ngrades, we do better; in the higher grades, we do worse. That reality \nwas further emphasized in the TIMSS test report, which is the best \nmeasurement of an international comparison of student achievement. The \nTIMSS report shows that while we do quite well in math and science in \ngrade 4, compared to students in other countries, by the time those \nstudents reach the 12th grade, they are almost at the bottom, \ninternationally. So something has clearly gone awry between grade 4 and \ngrade 12.\n  I believe that is a strong incentive for us to change the direction \nof education in this country. The Fordham Foundation report is well \nnamed: New Directions. It is high time that we find new directions in \neducation, and that is what Ed-Flex does. It is a first step, but it is \nan important step, freeing us from bureaucratic waste and inefficiency. \nAs President Ronald Reagan used to say, ``The only thing that saves us \nfrom bureaucracy is its inefficiency.'' The tragedy is when you look at \nthe inefficiency in the education bureaucracy, those whom it is hurting \nare those who are most vulnerable--our children, our students.\n  Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona State Superintendent of Public \nInstruction, recognizes this. She has stated that it\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\nis ``the lure of Federal dollars tied to programs with hazily defined \ngoals,'' and compliance with those Federal programs is a big cause of \nthe problems we face in education today. Keegan specifically indicates \nthat 165 employees in the Arizona Department of Education are \nresponsible for one thing, and one thing only, and that is managing \nFederal programs--165 employees just to manage the Federal programs, \nwhich account for 6 percent of Arizona's total spending on education.\n  Now, those 165 employees work out to be 45 percent of her total \nstaff. She has 45 percent of her educational staff in the educational \ndepartment in Arizona doing nothing more than complying with Federal \nprograms that account for only 6 percent of the funding for Arizona \nschools.\n  Something is badly out of kilter when that happens. And it happens \nnot only in Arizona, but you can echo those same sentiments by \ndirectors of education across this country.\n  This is an opportunity for us to move in a new direction.\n  President Clinton has made it very clear that he decided the problem \nwith education is class size; that smaller class size is a good thing, \nand that even if the Federal Government has to step in and do it, that \nis what we should do. No research indicates what the impact of class \nsize is going to have on a child's ability to learn. Despite this there \nis a $1.2 billion proposal to spend tax dollars to reduce class size. \nThat will be a debate for another time. But I think once again it \nreflects the traditional thinking that we can only solve education \nproblems with Washington solutions.\n  In 1996, then-Governor Voinovich of the State of Ohio who is now our \ncolleague in the U.S. Senate noted that local schools in his State had \nto submit as many as 170 Federal reports totaling more than 700 pages \nduring a single year. This report also noted that more than 50 percent \nof the paperwork required by a local school in Ohio is a result of \nFederal programs; this despite the fact that the Federal Government \naccounts for only 6 percent of Ohio's educational spending. One-hundred \nand seventy Federal reports, Governor Voinovich said, 700 pages in \nlength, and 50 percent of the paperwork, and once again only 6 percent \nof the educational spending in Ohio.\n  Then I think the experience in Boston illustrates this need for Ed-\nFlex as well. I quote again from this very important report. It states:\n\n       Unfortunately, even this estimate is likely to \n     underestimate the true paperwork burden to local schools and \n     universities across the country.\n\n  According to the President of Boston University, John Wesley, Boston \nUniversity spent 14 weeks and 2,700 employee hours completing the \npaperwork required to qualify for Federal title IV funding. They were \nslowed by repeated corrections and clarifications requested by the \nDepartment of Education. And, in the end, the university spent the \nequivalent of 1\\1/2\\ personnel years compiling what turned out to be a \n9-pound application.\n  I wish that were unusual. It may be unusual. But they actually \ncompute it where it can be quantified. But I am afraid that reflects \nthe experience of the education establishment all across this country.\n  I know that there are many others who want to speak on this bill. I, \nonce again, applaud so much of the efforts of Senator Frist, Senator \nWyden and Chairman Jeffords.\n  My sister is a public schoolteacher in Rogers, AR. She, right now, I \nsuppose is teaching her third-grade class in Reagan Elementary School \nin Rogers, AR.\n  I was thinking last evening about my experience in elementary school \nin a little town with a population of less than 1,000. And I can to \nthis day name every elementary teacher I had. The first grade, Ms. \nJones; the second grade, Ms. Harris; the third grade, Ms. Miller; the \nfourth grade, Ms. Shinpaugh; the fifth grade, Mrs. Allen; the sixth \ngrade, Mrs. Comstock. I can't do that with junior high school or \ncollege.\n  But the impact that an elementary teacher makes upon those students \nis beyond exaggeration, I think. Most of us, I suspect, can look back \nat those elementary teachers who had an incredible impact upon our \nlives. There is a kind of magic that takes place in a classroom. \nChairman Jeffords sees it every time he goes over and reads to those \ndisadvantaged children. All of us who have taught, whether it was in \njunior high teaching civics, as I did, or whether it is teaching third \ngrade in the public schools just like my sister does, have experienced \nthat magic where the light comes on, where those students connect with \ntheir teacher, the thrill of learning and where the experience of \neducation catches on in a classroom.\n  I suggest to those who want to talk about the need for greater \ncontrol in Washington and who want to oppose providing flexibility to \nlocal schools that they remember that the magic happens in the \nclassroom.\n  I want my sister, Geri, spending her day teaching those students, \ncreating the magic, inspiring those kids to learn and to appreciate the \nvalue of education rather than spending her day filling out forms for \nthe 6 percent of funding that comes from Washington, DC. I don't want \nher having to spend her prep hour filling out more forms for \nbureaucrats in Little Rock and Washington.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a bold step. I hope it is not the \nlast one that we take. But it is an important step. I applaud, once \nagain, and am glad to be a part of supporting this effort today.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSantorum be added as a cosponsor of both S. 271 and S. 280, the Ed-\nFlexibility Partnership Act of 1999.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to speak on \nEd-Flex and give just a little bit of background of what the bill is, \nthe importance of the bill, and where we are going.\n  Earlier this morning I had the opportunity to comment on the nature \nof the bill--that it is not a bill that is intended to solve all of the \nproblems in education today, but it is a focused bill, a bill which \nwill be of significant benefit to hundreds of thousands of \nschoolchildren. And, if we act on this bill sometime in the next \nseveral days, and if the House does likewise with its corresponding \nbill, it could be sent to the President very shortly, and hundreds of \nthousands of schoolchildren can benefit in the next several months. \nThat is why we are moving ahead with this particular bill.\n  It has strong bipartisan support. It is supported by the Nation's \nGovernors, and by Democrats and by Republicans.\n  I thank my colleague from Arkansas who I think did a wonderful job \nsetting the big picture and the fundamentals of why a bill that \nstresses flexibility and accountability really unties the hands and \nunshackles the schools which right now have huge amounts of paperwork \nand regulations coming down from well-intentioned laws and statutes \npassed here in Washington, DC, but really makes it very difficult, in \nfact impedes their ability to efficiently do what they want to do, and \nthat is teach students and educate our children.\n  I thank Senator Hutchinson for that wonderful background and \npresentation. He mentioned the Third International Math and Science \nStudy (TIMSS), and although we are not going to be talking a lot about \nthat today, it is interesting because this study, which is an \nobjective, very good study, recognized nationally and internationally, \nis a good measurement of where we are today. It reflects the common \ninterests that we have as American people on both sides of the aisle to \npresent a better future to our children by preparing them.\n  Behind me are the results of the Third International Math and Science \nStudy. It is a little bit confusing when you see the chart. But after \ndigesting lots of different studies, the more time one looks at this \nchart the more comfortable it is. And this chart has a lot of \ninformation which hits right at the heart of why we have the problems \nwe have today.\n  This particular chart highlights science. I have other charts that I \nwon't show today that also highlight similar statistics for \nmathematics. But the statistics are very similar, whether it is \nreading, science or math that is being evaluated.\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\n  Let's look at science.\n  In the first column, it is grade 4. As the Senator from Arkansas \nsaid, the TIMSS study looks at grade 4, looks at grade 8, and looks at \ngrade 12--all of those green lines going down in the print. There are \ndifferent countries that are involved. So you will have a relative \nstanding of how well the United States does in grade 4, 8 and 12 versus \nother countries.\n  Again, the studies are very good, very carefully controlled from a \nscientific standpoint, and right on target. For example, grade 4, at \nthe top of the list is South Korea. In the fourth grade in terms of \naverage score, in terms of science, the second one down is Japan; third \none, is Austria; the fourth is the United States. The red line, both in \ngrades 4, 8, and 12, is the United States.\n  So right off you see in the fourth grade we do pretty well relative \nto other countries. In the eighth grade, just as the Senator from \nArkansas said, we didn't do nearly as well. And in the 12th grade, we \nfall way down.\n  You will also see on the chart a black line. The black line indicates \nthe average for all countries.\n  So not only do we know where we stand relatively in terms of other \ncountries, but we also know where we stand with the average of other \ncountries.\n  Again, the observation is in the fourth grade, we are fourth when we \ncompare ourselves to other countries, which is above average. In the \neighth grade for science, we fall way down, yet we are still above the \naverage. But look what happens by the time we get to the 12th grade. By \nthe time we get to the 12th grade, Sweden is ahead of us, Netherlands \nis ahead of us, Iceland is ahead of us, Norway, Canada, New Zealand, \nAustralia, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, are ahead of us. Denmark \nis ahead of us, and so are Germany, the Czech Republic, and France. The \nRussian Federation is also ahead of us in the 12th grade in terms of \nscience.\n  As we look to the future and we look at fields like reading and \nscience and mathematics and we see this trend over time, that is really \nthe call for us, as a nation, to focus on education, to do it in a \nbipartisan way, a way that really does focus on our children today, and \nrecognize how are we going to be able to compete in the next millennium \nwith this sort of trend over time. As the charts have indicated the \nUnited States is below the average of all these other countries, and \nthe trend is getting worse the longer one stays in school in the United \nStates of America.\n  Let me refer once again to what a pleasure it has been for me to \nparticipate in the education issue on this particular bill with Senator \nWyden of Oregon. He and I have been working on Ed-Flex expansion \nthrough a number of committees and task forces--the Senate Budget Task \nForce on Education, working with the chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, which is the new name for that \nparticular committee. We began to address this issue over a year ago \nwhen first explored it through the Senate Budget Task Force on \nEducation.\n  The more we looked into it, the more we felt this bill could make a \nhuge difference, and it is something that Government can and should do. \nThe Federal Government needs to take the leadership role to untie the \nhands of our States, our schools, and our school districts so that they \ncan carry out the sort of objectives that we all generally agree to, \nthe sort of goals that we set in this body.\n  Again, what we are doing today, is to expand a demonstration project \nthat began in 1994. As the Senator from Vermont outlined in his brief \nhistory of the program--it began in 1994 as a demonstration project \nwith 6 States. It was extended later to another 6 States, so now 12 \nStates have the opportunity to be Ed-Flex States. And what we are going \nto do in this legislation, which will pass, I am very hopeful, not too \nlong from now, is extend that demonstration project from 12 States to \nall 50 States.\n  Behind me on the map, again, for the edification of my colleagues who \nmay not be familiar with this program, you can see that Massachusetts \nis an Ed-Flex State, and we have, I think, good demonstrated results \nthere. Texas has also had positive results with using its Ed-Flex \nwaiver authority. Earlier this morning I had an opportunity to present \nsome of the outcome data from that particular State. The color yellow \non the chart indicates the States where Ed-Flex is currently available. \nBut Tennessee, the State I represent, says, Why don't we have that same \nopportunity of increased flexibility for greater accountability? Let us \nhave that same flexibility to get rid of the excessive regulations. Let \nus get rid of the unnecessary paperwork. Let us get rid of the \nWashington redtape.\n  Now, what they are saying is, Allow us to look at our local \nsituation, which in Nashville is different than Jackson, which is \ndifferent than Johnson City, which is different than Humboldt, which is \ndifferent than Soddy-Daisy. Give us that opportunity.\n  And, again, you can see how it happens. All of us in this body have \ngood intentions when we pass these statutes and we pass these laws and \nthen they go through this regulatory machine. Everybody has good \nintentions. But the regulations get more and more complicated, which \nseems to be a common theme whenever one look at a variety of fields \nhere in Government.\n  Now, one of the issues that we are going to be talking about is \nwaivers. So what is the Ed-Flex program? There are currently 12 States \nparticipating. The Ed-Flex program, very simply, is a State waiver \nprogram which allows schools and school districts the opportunity to \nobtain temporary waivers to accomplish specific education goals but \nfree of that Washington redtape, free of those unnecessary Federal \nregulations. And that in one sentence is a description of Ed-Flex.\n  Because the Ed-Flex program is currently a demonstration program, we \nhave a lot of data available about it. Again, over the course of the \ndebate, we will come back to some of the outcomes of Ed-Flex and give \nsome examples of how it is being used. The key thing is that Ed-Flex \ngives flexibility to find some of the solutions to specific problems \nthat vary from school to school, school district to school district, \nand community to community. It allows that element of responsiveness to \nspecific needs. In addition, it allows a degree of creativity, and \ninnovation. These things are critical especially when we see the trends \nthat I just showed on TIMSS which clearly indicate that we can't just \ndo more of the same; we can't just throw more money at existing \nprograms; we can't accept the status quo; we can't do a lot of the \nthings that at first blush we might think work, because we have tried \nit in the past and it hasn't worked.\n\n  Over the past 30 years, we have been flat in terms of our student \nperformance in this country. Now, some people will stand up and say, \nyes that is true, but look at some results released last week or look \nat some from 5 years ago where there is a little bit of improvement. I \nwill tell you--and I can bring those charts--if you plot it out year by \nyear performance for students has been stagnant in the 4th, 8th and \n10th grades. The problem is that the other countries that have allowed \ncreativity and innovation are all improving and we are being left \nbehind.\n  So I don't want to underestimate the power of that innovation, the \npower of that creativity. We like to think it all begins in this room \nhere with the Congress; in truth, it begins in those classrooms with \nhard-working teachers, with hard-working school attendants, with those \nGovernors who recognize that they really have made progress and need \nsome flexibility.\n  We will hear a number of examples of how flexibility and \naccountability have worked. In Maryland, we have seen that the Ed-Flex \nprogram has allowed a school to reduce the teacher pupil ratios from 25 \npupils to 1 down to 12 to 1. They felt that was important and they \nreceived a waiver that allowed them to accomplish this based on their \nparticular needs.\n  In Kansas, waivers have been used to provide all-day kindergarten, \nbecause this was a priority for them. It was a dimension where they had \na specific need.\n  They were also able to have a preschool program for 4-year-old \nchildren. They also saw they weren't doing very well in reading, so \nthey were able to implement, through the waiver program, new reading \nstrategies for all students.\n  Now, the waiver issue will come up, and whenever you hear ``waiver,'' \npeople have to think, and they should\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\nthink, ``accountability,'' We are saying, accomplish certain goals, but \ndo it in a way that meets your specific needs with programs that you \nbelieve will work at the local community level. It is critical that we \nbuild in strong, accountability measures.\n  If we look at the history, again referring to Senator Wyden's initial \nrequest to have the General Accounting Office look at some of the Ed-\nFlex programs, we can see in GAO's report in November of 1998, that the \n``Department of Education officials told us they believe that the 12 \ncurrent Ed-Flex States have used their waiver authority carefully and \njudiciously.'' This is an important statement because we are going to \nhear some rhetoric, and we heard a little bit this morning, that if you \ngive this freedom, people are going to abuse it. People say there is no \nevidence. Based on what the Department of Education has concluded and \nreported to us through the General Accounting Office, the waiver system \nhas worked well.\n  Ed-Flex is a bipartisan plan. It is a common sense plan that will \ngive States and localities and school districts the flexibility, which \nI have already been stressing. Now I want to stress the accountability \nprovisions. Accountability is critical to the overall success of the \nprogram. It has to be built in. The two words I want my colleagues to \nremember are ``flexibility'' and strong ``accountability.'' Those are \ntwo important principles behind this bipartisan bill.\n  Now, the accountability measures in the current Ed-Flex programs--we \nhave 12 programs with this 5-year history--are very good. I want my \ncolleagues to understand that accountability has been strengthened. We \nhave given even more teeth to ensure accountability in the bill and in \nthe managers' package that has been put forward. Under current law \nthere is less accountability than what we are proposing. Under current \nlaw, a State need only have what is called a comprehensive reform plan \nto participate in Ed-Flex. Even though the current 12 state program has \nless accountability than what we are offering, have been told by the \nGAO, that the Department of Education says there has been a judicious \nand careful use of this waiver authority.\n\n  Behind me is a chart which, again, is going to be difficult to read \nfrom far away. It is a pyramid and it is tiered, because we have \naccountability measures built in at the Federal level, which is at the \ntop; we have accountability measures built in at the State level, which \nis the middle; and at the bottom of that, we have strong accountability \nmeasures built in at the base, at the local level.\n  At the local level, there is a requirement to demonstrate why the \nwaiver is needed. You have to spell that out very specifically. The \napplicant has to say how that specific waiver will be used to meet the \npurpose of the underlying program. Again, we are not changing the \npurpose of the program. You have to specifically say how that waiver \nwill be used, and then you have to have specific measurable goals \nwritten out in that waiver application. You will be held accountable \nfor all of that. There are additional accountability measures in the \nbill, but I have summarized accountability at the local level.\n  At the State level, again we include strong accountability measures \nbecause we address things that are called ``content standards'' and \n``performance standards'' and ``assessments.'' In addition to those \ncontent standards and performance standards, States are required to \nmonitor the performance of local education agencies in schools which \nhave received a specific waiver. That includes the performance of \nstudents who are directly affected by those waivers. Then, for those \nlow-performing schools or school districts that are identified, the \nState must engage--and these are the key words--in ``technical \nassistance and corrective action.'' And then the last, in terms of the \nState level, the State can terminate a waiver at any time; the ultimate \npower. If the State says things are not going right, it may terminate \nthe waiver.\n  At the Federal level, indicated on the chart at the top of the \npyramid, we have an additional backup, an important element, I think, \nto demonstrate the pyramid effect of this. That is, the Secretary is \nrequired to monitor both the performance of the States and also to have \nthe ability to, as you can at the State level, terminate that waiver at \nany time.\n  I think this three-tiered level of accountability is something that \nis very, very important when we give that flexibility to achieve the \nspecific goals which are outlined. That, I believe, is a real recipe \nfor success as we work towards educating our children and improving \nthose scores that have been referred to already this morning.\n  I will just spend a couple of more minutes, I think, so we can move \non with other people's comments. But as I pointed out, we have \nexperience with this. This is not a program that we pulled out of the \nsky and said, let's try it out, some experimental program, rushing this \nthrough the legislative process. I think we need to recognize right up \nfront that we have a 5-year history with it. It has been a \ndemonstration project, it has been endorsed by the Department of \nEducation, it has been endorsed by the President of the United States, \nit has been endorsed by Democrats and Republicans, and something which \nI think is critically important is the fact that all 50 Governors have \nsaid this program is right; it is what is needed to best educate that \nchild who is in the school system in his or her State.\n  The Governors are in a position, I believe, both to judge but also to \nlead, as we go forward. I have behind me a resolution that passed just \nlast week from the National Governors' Association. The headline or \ntitle is, ``Expansion of Ed-Flex Demonstration Program To All Qualified \nStates and Territories.'' It was a resolution. NGA doesn't do a whole \nlot of resolutions, but this is a major priority for our Governors who \nunderstand, like we do, addressing as a nation, that we must put \neducation at the very top of our priorities. Let me just read the first \nsentence:\n\n       The governors strongly affirm that states are responsible \n     for creating an education system that enables all students to \n     achieve high standards and believe that the federal \n     government should support state efforts by providing \n     regulatory relief and greater flexibility.\n\n  Skip on down just a little bit to the second paragraph so we can look \nback to the past from the Governors' perspective. Again, this is \nDemocrats and Republicans, bipartisan, which is the nature and the real \npower of this bill. They say:\n\n       Ed-Flex has helped states focus on improving student \n     performance, by more closely aligning state and federal \n     education improvement programs and by supporting state \n     efforts to design and implement standards-based reform.\n\n  And then just their last sentence:\n\n       Ed-Flex will provide states and territories with increased \n     incentives to strengthen state efforts to adopt meaningful \n     standards and assessments with greater accountability.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, we ran out of time to pass Ed-Flex last year. \nIt is coming back to the floor now. It has been passed in the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee and the now Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, where we had the opportunity to discuss many of \nthese amendments. We have an opportunity to pass this legislation very, \nvery early in this Congress so it will be to the benefit of hundreds of \nthousands of children in the very near future. That is why we really \nshould not put this off. Some people have said, Why don't you consider \nthis in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act? That is \nunnecessarily pushing a bill off that we know will benefit children \ntoday, putting it off for a year or a year and a half unnecessarily, \ngiven the tremendous consensus that has been reached around this \nparticular bill.\n  In closing, let me just say I think the time really has come that we \nlend our efforts to give States and give localities and give schools \nand give school districts the flexibility they need, and the tools that \nthey need, to accomplish the jobs that we, as a society, have entrusted \nthem to do.\n  Ed-Flex is not the cure-all. It is not going to be the answer to all \nof our education challenges. But what it is, is a modest first step at \nmoving toward that common goal that we all share.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think all of us in the Senate are \nlooking forward to these next few days during which we will have an \nopportunity to address the fundamental issue which\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\nis on the minds of most families in this country--certainly the working \nfamilies in this Nation--and that is whether we, as a Federal \nGovernment, are going to be partners with state and local governments \nas we try to address the critical issues facing our public schools--\nwhether our children are going to be able to make academic progress and \nhave the opportunity to achieve their full potential.\n  Public education is basically a partnership, and one in which the \nFederal Government has had a very limited role, historically. The \nprincipal responsibility has been local governments, and the States \nhave had some interest. The Federal Government has really had a limited \ninterest. As has been pointed out, approximately 7 cents out of every \ndollar that is spent locally that can be traced back to the Federal \nGovernment. Two cents of that is actually in nutrition and the support \nof breakfast and lunch programs. It comes down to about 4 cents out of \nevery dollar that is actually appropriated by the Federal Government.\n  So all of us are interested in how we can use scarce resources. What \nwe are talking about here today is not expanding that in any way. We \nare talking about whether, of that 4 cents, maybe 2 cents will be able \nto have greater flexibility at the local level.\n  The question is what are the priorities for us at the Federal level? \nIt has been generally agreed that the priority for us at the Federal \nlevel is going to be targeting the neediest and the most disadvantaged \nchildren in the country. We, as a society, feel that we have some \nresponsibility, some extra responsibility--that it is not just a local \nresponsibility to try to deal with those needy children, but that we \nhave a national responsibility. That was the basis for the title I \nprograms.\n  Over a long period of time, we have debated about how that money can \nmost effectively be used to enhance academic achievement and \naccomplishment. As has been pointed out today, and as was pointed out \nin the President's excellent statement earlier today over in the \nLibrary of Congress, we know what needs to be done. It is a question \nnow of whether we, as a country and a society and a people, are willing \nto do it.\n  During the next few days, we will have an opportunity to look at a \nnumber of different features of the education priority. We are dealing \nnow with the Frist-Wyden legislation, and I want to speak to that for a \nfew moments and make some observations and also address, later in the \nafternoon, what I think could be useful changes in the legislation.\n  I commend Senator Frist and Senator Wyden for their initiative, and I \nhave voted for this legislation to come out of our committee both last \nyear and this year--and, as a matter of fact, I was the author, with \nSenator Hatfield, in 1994 that initially set up the Ed-Flex--and I have \nfollowed it very closely. I am glad to have a chance to reflect on some \nof the observations that I have made over the years in watching that. \nBut we will also have an opportunity to debate whether we, as a Senate, \nare going to go on record as supporting smaller classrooms from the \nearly grades.\n  We will have a chance to hear an excellent amendment from the Senator \nfrom Washington, Senator Murray, on that particular issue. We made a \ncommitment to the school districts across the country last year that we \nwere going to start this process. It was going to go in effect for some \n6 years. We made the commitment for the first year, but the school \ndistricts across the country are wondering whether this is going to be \na continuum. Certainly it is extraordinarily timely that we provide \nthat kind of authorization for smaller classrooms, so that the school \ndistricts all across the country will have some certainty as to what \nthe education policy at the congressional level will be on that issue.\n  The President has included the resources to fund that initiative, in \nexcess of $11 billion, in his budgets over the next 5 years. That is \nvery important, and we will have an opportunity to address that issue.\n  Senator Boxer wants to address afterschool programs. I think we have \nseen, with a modest program in the last year, the beginning of the \nrecognition of the afterschool problem. Every day, there are some 5 to \n9 million children between the ages of 9 and 14, who too often find \nthemselves not attending to their homework, but rather find themselves \ninvolved in behavior which is inappropriate.\n  What we have seen is that where these programs have been developed--\nwhere children are able to work in the afterschool situation, being \ntutored perhaps in their subject matter or encouraged to participate in \nliteracy programs--those children are doing much better academically \nand socially as well. And when they have the opportunity to spend time \nwith their parents in the evening time, it is quality time, rather than \nparents telling children as soon as they get home, ``Run upstairs and \ndo your homework.'' This has been very, very important, and Senator \nBoxer has an important proposal to authorize and to enhance the \ncommitment in those areas.\n  There will be modest amendments in other areas. I know Senator Harkin \nhas a proposal with regard to school construction. I know Senator \nBingaman has an amendment about school dropouts. Some of these are \nprograms that we have debated in the past and have been actually \naccepted by the Senate. There are other programs as well, issues \ninvolving technology and other matters that will eventually be \naddressed and brought up. We are not interested in undue delay, but we \nalso believe that there is no issue which is of greater importance to \nAmerican families, and we ought to be willing to address these issues.\n  We just passed an increase in military pay. There were 26 amendments \non that particular proposal. I do not expect that we will have as many \non this, but nonetheless it is important that we do have a chance \nthrough today and through the remainder of the week and through the \nearly part of next week to address some of these issues. We welcome \nthis chance to focus on the issues of education and also on what our \npolicies are going to be.\n\n  Just to review very briefly, Mr. President, this chart demonstrates \nquite clearly a rather fundamental commitment. That is, for every \ndollar that is spent by the States, they spend 62 cents in addition to \nthat for the needy children in their State. The corresponding Federal \ndollar amount is $4.73. This is a really clear indication of what we \nare talking about, primarily with Title I, which is the principal issue \nhere--the resources that are being provided are going to the neediest \nchildren in this country.\n  And, interestingly, in the reauthorization bill of 1994, we changed \nthe direction of Title I to very high poverty areas--very high poverty \nareas--not just poverty areas but very high poverty areas. And when we \nhave a chance, as I will in just a few moments, to go through and see \nwhat the distinction has been in targeting more precisely the \nresources, there has been a very important indication of progress among \nthe children in getting a much more targeted direction in terms of \nresources. This is part of the reason why some of us believe that, in \naddition to being able to get some kinds of waivers from the Federal \nprograms in the area of Title I, we ought to insist that we are going \nto require that there be academic achievement and student improvement \nif we are going to move ahead. We are finding now, under the most \nrecent report of Title I, that for the first time we are making \nnoticeable and important gains on Title I. That has escaped us over the \nalmost 30 years, but now we are making some real progress in the area \nof Title I. I will have a chance to review that, but this is basically \nan indication to show the targeting of Title I.\n  Secondly, Mr. President, while we are looking at the issue of \nflexibility at the present time, I just want to point out what we have \ndone in terms of Ed-Flex. In 1994, we passed what was called the \nHatfield-Kennedy amendment on the elementary and secondary education \nbill. That amendment provided that six States at that time would have \nEd-Flex. The Governors then, once they were given that kind of \napproval, would be able to waive particular requirements if any \ncommunity within the State wanted to do so. When we came to the Goals \n2000, we added another six States and we permitted the Secretary of \nEducation to provide Ed-Flex to any school district in the country.\n  So what we have seen is, with all of the various applications that \nhave been\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\nmade in the period since then, some 54 percent have been approved; 31 \npercent, when they brought those measures up to the Department of \nEducation, were shown to be unnecessary and therefore withdrawn; and \nonly 8 percent were disapproved. This is a pretty good indication that \nany school district that wanted to seek a waiver of any of these rules \nand regulations has been permitted to do so. In the State of \nCalifornia, there have been more than 1,000 applications that have been \napproved. That is the current situation in which we find ourselves.\n  On the issue of accountability, the real question is, ``In the waiver \nof these regulations, are we going to be able to give the assurance \nthat we are going to have student achievement?'' What we are basically \nsaying is, if we are going to give you 5 years of waiving the \nregulations, which take scarce resources, and target it on needy \nchildren, are we going to insist that the children are going to have \nstudent achievement? That is what we are asking.\n  And I mentioned, at least to my colleague and friend, Senator Wyden, \nthat we could add those words in three different places in the \nlegislation along with the language that is in here and resolve at \nleast one of the concerns that I have, and that I think a number of \nothers have as well.\n  We have seen since it has passed out of our Committee, as I am sure \nhas been explained by the authors of the legislation, that they provide \nchanges to try to reflect greater accountability. And we very much \nappreciate that. That is in the managers' package, and it is a good \nstart. I believe the authors have gone through that in some detail. If \nnot, I will take some time to do that briefly later in my discussion. \nBut this is where we are, Mr. President.\n  What we are interested in is student achievement. What we are going \nto insist on is to make sure that if we are going to give over to the \nStates the resources targeted for these particular areas, that they are \ngoing to be able to come back over the period of the following 2, 3, 4, \n5 years and demonstrate the student achievement. That is what we are \ninterested in and what we want to address here later this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, education is a top priority in this Congress, and few \nother issues are more important to the Nation than ensuring that every \nchild has the opportunity to attend a good, safe, and modern public \nschool. The Ed-Flex Partnership Act can be a useful step toward \nimproving public schools, but to be effective, it must go hand in hand \nwith strong accountability.\n  Current law already contains substantial flexibility. As I mentioned, \nthe 1994 amendments to the Elementary/Secondary Act reduced paperwork \nand increased flexibility. Since then, two-thirds of the Act's \nregulations--two-thirds--have been eliminated. States now have an \noption to submit a single consolidated State application instead of \nseparate applications, and all but one State has adopted this approach. \nSchools and school districts already have great flexibility today and \npaperwork is not their top issue.\n  According to the General Accounting Office report that was quoted \nearlier today, ``information, funding, and management,'' not paperwork, \nare the primary concerns of school districts. Provisions for increased \nflexibility, such as waivers, ``do not increase federal assistance to \nschool districts, nor do they relieve districts of any of their major \nfinancial obligations.'' That is the finding of the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  It is interesting to me, Mr. President. I would have thought there \nwould be much more authority and much greater credibility if those who \nwere talking about this would be able to demonstrate that the States \nthemselves were willing to waive their statutes and regulations. That \nhas not been the case. In some instances States have, but in many they \nhave not. As the General Accounting Office report shows, even if you \ngranted it, it would not make a great deal of difference, because there \nare so many State regulations and statutes that are in existence, that \nare related to this program, that it would not really have the kind of \nbeneficial result many of us would like.\n  I am always glad to hear our good friends the Governors talk about \nreducing the regulations, when we have seen a reduction in the \nregulations by two-thirds since the authorization of 1994, and yet we \nhave not really heard from them, nor have we heard here on the floor of \nthe Senate, how the States themselves have changed their statutes and \nrules and regulations in order to be more flexible during this period \nof time.\n  In fact, in many cases it is the State's redtape, not the Federal \nbureaucracy, that will keep schools from taking full advantage of the \nflexibility that the law provides. Ten States cannot waive their own \nregulations and statutes because State law does not permit it in order \nto match this.\n  It is good, as we start off on this, to have some idea about the \nscope of this whole debate. I think it is going to be useful if we get \nthrough this part of it in the next day or so. The real guts of the \nwhole debate is going to be next week when we come to the questions of \nclassrooms and afterschool programs.\n\n  But I do want to make some additional points. In fact, in many cases, \nas I mentioned, it is the State's redtape, not the Federal bureaucracy, \nthat will keep schools from taking full advantage of the flexibility \nthat the law provides. That is why, if tied to strong accountability, \nexpanding Ed-Flex makes sense, so all States can ease the burden on \nlocal school districts as they obtain increased Federal flexibility.\n  One requirement to be eligible for Ed-Flex is that a State must be \nable to waive that State's statutory or regulatory requirements which \nimpede State or local efforts to improve learning and teaching. That \nstep will ensure that the real paperwork burdens on local school \ndistricts are diminished. As I mentioned, we have 10 States that do not \nhave that capacity or willingness to do so.\n  Families across the Nation want Uncle Sam to be a partner, a helping \nhand in these efforts. Parents want results. They want their \ncommunities, States, and the Federal Government to work together to \nimprove public schools. In doing our Federal part, we should ensure \nthat when we provide more flexibility, it is matched with strong \naccountability for results, so that every parent knows their children \nare getting the education they deserve.\n  I support the Frist bill because it provides flexibility and takes \nsome steps towards holding States accountable. But it isn't enough. \nCongress has the responsibility to ensure that Federal tax dollars are \nused effectively to help all children learn. Just giving States more \nflexibility will not do the job. A blank check approach to school \nreform is the wrong approach. Our primary concern in this legislation \nis to guarantee that accountability goes hand in hand with flexibility. \nStrong accountability measures are essential to ensure that parents and \ncommunities across the country have confidence in the waiver process.\n  Another fundamental requirement is that States and districts must \nprovide parents, educators, and other interested members of the \ncommunity with the opportunity to comment on proposed waivers and make \nthose comments available for public review. These public comments \nshould be submitted with State or local waiver applications. What we \nare talking about is parental involvement. And we will have an \nopportunity to address that.\n  I am sure we will hear the response back, ``Why are we going to do \nthat?'' That is going to require more action at the State level. We are \ngoing to have hearings in order to hear parents' views about it. But \nthe fact of the matter is, unless you get the parents involved, you are \nnot going to do the job. The parental involvement is essential. We will \nhave a chance to go through that in the most recent title I report.\n  And you can't show me where in the Frist-Wyden proposal they are \ngoing to guarantee that the parents are going to have a voice in the \nfinal decision that is going to be made here. It just is not there. You \nshow me a community where you have intense parental involvement, and \nyou are going to see a school system that is moving in the right \ndirection. You show me a community where parental involvement is \ndistant or remote, and you are going to see a school that is in \ndecline. Those are not my conclusions--those are the conclusions of the \neducational community. We want to make sure that parents are going to \nbe involved when waivers are being proposed to get their kind of input. \nAnd there will be the transmission of their views to the Secretary.\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is essential that States and districts provide \nparents, educators, and other members of the community with the \nopportunity to comment on proposed waivers and make their comments \navailable for public review. These public comments should be submitted \nwith State or local waiver applications.\n  That is what we are talking about. Just make that change. Public \ncomments should be submitted with State or local waiver applications. \nThat would move us in a very, very important, very positive way--we get \nthe student accountability and we get the parental involvement. Those \nare the measures we are looking at, Mr. President.\n  We must also ensure that all students, particularly the neediest \nstudents, have the opportunity to meet the high State standards of \nachievement. Fundamental standards should not be waived. Parents need \nto know how their children are doing in every school, and in the \npoorest performing schools, parents also need help in achieving change.\n  Under Title I, disadvantaged students have the opportunity to achieve \nthe same high standards as all children. School districts must provide \nrealistic assistance to improve low-performing schools. Flexibility \nmakes sense, but not if it means losing these essential tools for \nparents and communities to achieve reform and improve their schools.\n  There were four very important changes in the 1994 authorization: \nfirst was a significant reduction in paperwork; second, the targeting \nof the highest incidence of poverty; third, the heavy involvement of \nparents in terms of the participation; and fourth, and perhaps most \nimportantly, high standards.\n  We move away from dumbing down. We establish high standards for poor \nchildren as well as children that were coming from other communities. \nThose factors have had an important positive impact. We are finally \ngetting there.\n  We must ensure that increased flexibility leads to improved student \nachievement. Accountability in this context means that States must \nevaluate how waivers actually improve student achievement--open-ended \nwaivers make no sense. Results are what counts. Student achievement is \nwhat counts.\n  The Secretary of Education should be able to terminate a State's \nwaiver authority if the student achievement is not improving after 5 \nyears. States must be able to terminate any waivers granted to a school \ndistrict or participating schools if student achievement is not \nimproving. If waivers do not lead to satisfactory progress, it makes no \nsense to continue.\n  What I have been mentioning here is being practiced in one of the Ed-\nFlex States, and is showing remarkable improvement in terms of \neducation. That state is Texas, where they have real student \nachievement, real accountability, parental involvement, and specific \nstudent achievement goals. That is true accountability.\n  If you review the different State annual reports, there is a dramatic \ncontrast between what has been implemented by the State of Texas in \nusing the greater flexibility to enhance student achievement and what \nhas happened in many of the other States. True accountability is what \nwe want to achieve if we are going to have the Federal funds.\n  Each of these requirements is sensible. No one wants a heavy-handed \nFederal regulation of State and local education. That is not the issue. \nThe real issue is accountability. These important requirements are well \ndesigned to achieve it. We should do nothing to undermine these \nprinciples, especially when we have new evidence that they work, \nparticularly for the neediest students.\n  ``The National Assessment of Title I,'' released earlier this week, \nshows that student achievement is increasing and that the Federal \nGovernment is an effective partner in that success. The glass on the \ntable is half full, not half empty as critics of public schools would \nhave you believe. This is good news for schools, good news for parents, \ngood news for students, and it should be convincing evidence to \nCongress that many of the reforms we put in place in recent years are \nworking.\n  Since the reauthorization of Title I in 1994, a nonpartisan \nIndependent Review Panel, made up of 22 experts from across the \ncountry, has overseen the program. Title I is the largest Federal \ninvestment in improving elementary and secondary schools. Title I helps \nto improve education for 11 million children in 45,000 schools with \nhigh concentrations of poverty. It helps schools provide professional \ndevelopment for teachers, improve curriculums, and extend learning time \nso students meet high State standards of achievement.\n  Under the 1994 amendments to Title I, States were no longer allowed \nto set lower standards for children in the poorest communities than \nthey set for students in more affluent communities. The results are \nclear: even the hardest-to-reach students will do well when \nexpectations are set high and they are given the support they need.\n\n  Student achievement in reading and math has increased, particularly \nin the achievement of the poorest students. Since 1992, reading \nachievement for 9-year-olds in the highest poverty schools has \nincreased nationwide by a whole grade level. Between 1990 and 1996, \nmath scores of the poorest students rose by a grade level.\n  Students are meeting high State standards, too. Students in the \nhighest poverty elementary schools improved in five of six States \nreporting 3-year data in reading, and in four out of five States in \nmath. Students in Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and Texas made \nprogress in both subjects.\n  Many urban school districts report that achievement also improved in \ntheir highest poverty schools. In 10 out of the 13 large urban \ndistricts that report 3-year trend data, there were increases in the \nnumber of elementary students in the highest poverty schools who met \nthe district or State standards of proficiency in writing or math. Six \ndistricts, including Houston, Dade County, New York, Philadelphia, San \nAntonio, and San Francisco made progress in both subjects.\n  Federal funds are increasingly targeted to the poorest schools. The \n1994 amendments to Title I shifted funds, as I mentioned, away from \nlow-poverty schools into high-poverty schools. Today, 95 percent of the \nhigh-poverty schools receive Title I funding, up from 80 percent in \n1993.\n  The percent of schools with parent compacts--agreements between \nteachers and parents about how they will work together to help the \nchildren do better--rose from 20 percent in 1994 to 75 percent in 1998. \nA substantial majority of the schools find their compacts are important \nin promoting parents' involvement, especially in higher poverty \nschools. Parent involvement is a key element in terms of academic \nachievement, and that is why we believe their voice regarding waiving \nthe requirements should be heard and at least considered.\n  Title I funds help improve teaching and learning in the classroom. \nNinety-nine percent of Title I funds go to the local level; 93 percent \nof those Federal dollars are spent directly on instruction, compared to \nonly 62 percent of all State and local education dollars that are spent \non instruction.\n  We are going to hear a lot as we debate education about where the \nFederal money that is appropriated goes, in terms of Federal \nbureaucracy and administration, State bureaucracy and how much of the \nmoney goes to the local level. This is the most recent report that has \nbeen done by independents. It shows that local school districts get \n95.5; State administration is 4 percent, Federal administration is one-\nhalf of 1 percent. State administration of their own programs are \nconsiderably higher, as the chart indicates.\n  All of these steps are working together to improve student \nachievement. The best illustrations of these successes are in local \nschools. In Baltimore County, MD, all but one of the 19 Title I schools \nincreased student performance between 1993 and 1998. The success has \ncome from Title I support for extended year programs, implementation of \neffective programs in reading, and intensive professional development \nfor teachers.\n  At Roosevelt High School in Dallas, 80 percent of the students are \npoor. Title I funds were used to increase parent involvement, train \nteachers to work with parents, and make other changes to bring high \nstandards to every classroom. Reading scores have nearly doubled, from \nthe 40th percentile in 1992 to the 77th percentile in 1996.\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\nDuring the same period, math scores soared from the 16th percentile to \nthe 73rd percentile, and writing scores rose from the 58th to the 84th \npercentile. That is remarkable.\n  What happened in this area? We got the parents involved and we \nenhanced the training of teachers to work more effectively with the \nparents to bring the high standards into every classroom.\n  The Baldwin Elementary School in Boston, where 80 percent of the \nstudents are poor, performance on the Stanford 9 test rose \nsubstantially from 1996 to 1998 because of the increases in teacher \nprofessional development and implementation of a reform to raise \nstandards and achievement for all children.\n  In 1996, 66 percent of third grade students scored in the lowest \nlevels in math. By 1998, 100 percent scored in the highest level. In \n1997, 75 percent of fourth graders scored in the lowest levels in \nreading. By 1998, no fourth graders were at the lowest level, and 56 \npercent were at the highest level.\n  We have seen that the National Assessment of Title I shows that high \nstandards and parental involvement get better results for children, \nparticularly the neediest children. That is what we would like to see \ncome through this legislation--where you get the flexibility, but you \nare also going to be able to demonstrate enhanced student achievement \nand parental involvement. Those are the two key requirements.\n  The improvements so far are gratifying, but there is no cause for \ncomplacency. Clearly, more needs to be done. We must build on these \nsuccesses to ensure that all children have the best possible education. \nIncreasing flexibility without accountability will stop progress in its \ntracks. But just increasing flexibility with accountability won't do \nthe job either.\n  We must provide more support for programs like Title I to make these \nopportunities available to all children. We must do a better job of \nsupporting the States and local communities in their efforts to hire \nand train teachers. The National Assessment of Title I found that too \nmany students in too many Title I schools--particularly those with high \nconcentrations of low-income children--are being taught by unqualified \nteachers.\n  The teacher shortage forced many school districts to hire uncertified \nteachers, and asked certified teachers to teach outside their areas of \nexpertise. Each year, more than 50,000 underprepared teachers enter the \nclassroom. One in four new teachers does not fully meet State \ncertification requirements. Twelve percent of new teachers have had no \nteacher training at all. Students in inner city schools have only a 50 \npercent chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. \nIn Massachusetts, 30 percent of teachers in high-poverty schools do not \neven have a minor degree in their field.\n  In addition, many schools are seriously understaffed. During the next \ndecade, rising student enrollments and massive teacher retirement mean \nthat the Nation will need to hire 2 million new teachers. Between 1995 \nand 1997, student enrollment in Massachusetts rose by 28,000 students, \ncausing a shortage of 1,600 teachers--without including teacher \nretirements.\n  We must fulfill last year's commitment to help communities hire \n100,000 new teachers, as part of our national pledge to reduce class \nsize. Research has documented what parents and teachers have already \nknown--that smaller classes enhance student achievement.\n  It is equally important to help communities recruit promising teacher \ncandidates, provide new teachers with trained mentors who will then \nhelp them succeed in the classroom, and give current teachers the \nongoing training they need to help keep up with modern technology and \nnew research.\n  Another major need is in the area of afterschool activities. \nAccording to the National Assessment on Title I, opportunities for \nchildren to participate afterschool and summer school programs have \ngrown from 10 percent of Title I schools to 41 percent in 1998. That \nhas made an important contribution to the enhancement of these \nchildren's achievement. But more needs to be done. We must increase \nsupport for afterschool programs.\n  In addition, children who have fallen behind in their school work \nneed opportunities to catch up, to meet legitimate requirements for \ngraduation, to master basic skills, and to meet high standards of \nachievement. A high school diploma should mean something--it must be \nmore than a certificate of attendance. It should be a certificate of \nachievement. High-quality afterschool and summer school academic \nimprovement activities should be available to every child in every \ncommunity in America.\n  Finally, we must do more to see that every child in every community \nis learning in safe and modern facilities. Across the country, 14 \nmillion children in one-third of the Nation's schools are learning in \nsubstandard buildings. Half of the schools have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental condition. It will take an estimated $100 \nbillion to repair the existing facilities.\n\n  Too many children are struggling to learn in overcrowded schools. \nThis year, K through 12 enrollment reached an all-time high and will \ncontinue to grow over the next 7 years. Communities will need to build \nnew public schools.\n  The agenda is broad, but the need is great. We are on the right \ntrack. There is no need to make a u-turn on education. We are making \nprogress. We need to build on these successes and do what we can to \nmeet the pressing needs of schools across the Nation, so that we can \nmeet the high standards of achievement. When it comes to education, the \nNation's children deserve the best that we can give them.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to commend the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts who, for years, along with our colleague from Vermont, \nhas been such a leader in these issues. I particularly thank him for \nraising the issue of the after-school program. Several of us have been \ntalking about this. As my colleague from Massachusetts knows, I offered \nan amendment last year when we considered the Ed-Flex bill in committee \nto increase federal support for after-school programs. My colleague \nfrom California is interested in the subject, as well. We would like to \nbring this issue up. It is a very important one which we will talk \nabout later. I thank him for including that in his remarks as he gave \nan overview of where we are on education issues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. We are all mindful \nthat our good friend and colleague is a leader in this body in many \nareas, but when it comes to children's interests, he is truly our \nleader. And on the issue of afterschool programs, Senator Boxer has \nbeen in the forefront of that effort. We look forward to having a good \ndebate on that issue as we move ahead as well. I thank the Senator very \nmuch for his involvement. Hopefully we will have an opportunity to \nconsider that in the next day or so. That is certainly our hope because \nit is a matter of enormous importance.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First, Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. We have been working with him on the questions of \naccountability. I am hopeful that we will reach agreement on an \namendment, which he may propose, so that we will not have issues in \nthat regard. I point out that the substitute amendment which I offered \ntoday includes many improvements with respect to accountability over \nthe bill that we passed last year out of committee 17-1.\n  I will run through, very briefly, the areas where we have already \nimproved the accountability and are still attempting to reach agreement \nwith the minority.\n  First, the substitute amendment I offered strengthens the \naccountability features already included in S. 280. It adds State \napplication requirements relating to the coordination of the Education \nFlexibility plan with the State comprehensive reform plan, or with the \nchallenging standards and assessment provisions of title I of the ESEA.\n  This Managers Package adds emphasis that student performance is an \nobjective of Ed-Flex. It adds provisions regarding annual performance \nreviews, by the State, of local educational agencies and schools which \nhave received\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\nwaivers, and reemphasizes the authority of the State to determine \nwaivers if LEAs or schools are not meeting their goals. It also adds \nprovisions of public notice and comment, and provisions requiring \nadditional reporting by the secretary regarding his rationale for \napproving waiver authority and the use of that authority. We will \ncontinue to work and, hopefully, we can reach agreement so that we will \nnot lengthen the time necessary for passing this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts has given, in my view, a very important address to the \nU.S. Senate. I want to take a few minutes and try to respond to a \nnumber of points. The Senator has made a number of points that I \ncertainly agree with as a Democratic sponsor of this legislation, along \nwith the Republican sponsor, Senator Frist. But there are a number of \nareas where I think the record indicates that we ought to take another \nlook.\n  For example, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has said \nthat, in some way, the States are being free riders here, that they are \nasking the Federal Government to waive various regulations, but the \nStates are somehow not willing to do that. As our colleagues will see \non page 6, line 7, it is specifically required that the States are \nwilling to do some heavy lifting and also be part of this effort to \nshow that they are going to try to ratchet out of their systems some of \nthe foolish bureaucracy. This ought to be a two-way street and I think \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right in \ninsisting on that. What is thus required today, the legislation spells \nout on page 6, line 7, that the States are not going to be able to be \nfree riders. They are going to have to waive some of these mindless \nregulations as well. I think that is an important point for the U.S. \nSenate to consider as we go forward.\n  Now, another area that has been raised is this question of smaller \nclass size. I think the Senator from Massachusetts again is absolutely \nright in saying that we do need additional funds to reduce class size \nin America. I have, on several occasions, voted for just those kinds of \nmeasures to provide additional funds to reduce class size. But I think \nit is important to note that Ed-Flex, now in 12 States, is helping us \nto reduce class size using existing law. The Senator from Massachusetts \nis correct; we do need additional funds to reduce class size, but let \nus not pass up the opportunity to use existing law, existing Ed-Flex \nopportunities to reduce class size. For our colleagues who would like \nto have a good example of how Ed-Flex helps to reduce class size, we \ncan turn to the Phelps Luck elementary school in Howard County, MD. \nThere they put a special priority on reducing class size with their Ed-\nFlex waiver. They were able to lower the student-teacher ratio from 25-\nto-1 to 12-to-1.\n  As we go forward with efforts to try to get additional funding that \nwe need to reduce class size in America, which we know is so critical \nin improving student performance, let us not pass up the opportunities \nto use the Ed-Flex program to make it possible with existing dollars to \nreduce class size in America.\n  Third, Mr. President and colleagues, there have been questions raised \nabout whether the dollars are going to get to the neediest children, \nand particularly with respect to title I, which is one of the seven \nprograms that are eligible for Ed-Flex but certainly is an especially \nimportant program to all of us.\n  What we have done--and we have outlined it here--is we have kept in \nplace every single one of the core requirements with respect to title I \nprotecting our neediest kids. It is off the table, folks, in terms of \nwaiving any of those core requirements. You can't do it; it is off the \ntable. And although it is hard for Members of the U.S. Senate to see \nthese charts, we specifically outline the requirements that cannot be \nwaived.\n  In addition, with respect to title I--I think there is some confusion \nperhaps at this point with respect to how the Ed-Flex funds can be \nused--under current law, you can only put those dollars into low-income \nschool districts. That is the only place they can go. We keep that \nrequirement. So today, and under this Ed-Flex legislation that is \nbefore the U.S. Senate, it is not possible to flex any dollars away \nfrom a program to help low-income youngsters and send them packing to \nanother district that will not need them as much.\n  I would like to spend a little bit more time on this question of \naccountability, because this is an area where the sponsors of the \nlegislation have been very open to trying to address the concerns of \nthose who have begun to look at this program and may not have been \nfamiliar with it in the past.\n  But I want to say that we have made six changes in the legislation \nsince it came out of the Senate Labor Committee last year by a 17 to 1 \nmargin. In addition to the public notice and opportunities for citizen \ncomments that the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nJeffords, touched on, there are requirements for specific measurable \ngoals, which include student performance, which Senator Kennedy is \nright to focus on. There are reports that would be required for the \nCongress every 2 years on how the Ed-Flex States are doing.\n  And then I am especially pleased that we have required now that a \nState review a State content and performance standard twice: First when \nit is decided that the State is eligible to participate, and again when \ndeciding whether or not to grant approval for the waiver. This makes it \nclear that a State must be in compliance with title I. If it is not in \ncompliance with title I, it isn't going to get a waiver. If at any \npoint it has been given a waiver and it is not in compliance with title \nI, the Secretary has the authority to come forward and revoke it.\n  So the accountability provisions have been especially important to \nthe sponsors of this legislation. And this idea that somehow Ed-Flex \nhas relaxed the standard is simply not true on the basis of the clear \nlanguage of the bill. These requirements are kept in place. We have \nadded six requirements for accountability since the legislation came \nout of committee.\n  I would like to wrap up by giving the U.S. Senate an example of how I \ngot into this issue, because I think it is important to get beyond some \nof the rhetorical arguments about this legislation and talk about real \npeople, real people who benefit, especially the low-income kids of our \ncountry.\n  We have a high school about an hour from my hometown in Portland. \nThey wanted poor kids to get help with advanced computing. The problem \nwas that the school didn't have the instructors who could teach \nadvanced computing and they didn't have the equipment. So under current \nlaw, those youngsters, low-income youngsters, wouldn't have had the \nopportunity to pick up those skills to put them on the path to high-\nskill, high-wage jobs.\n\n  But in this rural district an hour from my home town is a community \ncollege just a short distance away that would make it possible, with \ninstructors and equipment, for those poor kids to get help with \nadvanced computing. So instead of students who couldn't get what they \nneeded without additional funds, without additional redtape and \nbureaucracy, what this town did in rural Oregon was simply say we are \ngoing to use the dollars that we aren't equipped for at the local high \nschool to make sure that the kids get advanced computing at a community \ncollege just a short distance away.\n  That is what Ed-Flex is all about--taking this regulatory \nstraitjacket off some of the thousands and thousands of school \ndistricts across the country. They can't use the money for pork barrel \nprojects. They can't use it to waive standards. They have to comply \nwith accountability. But they can teach advanced computing to poor \nkids. That is why it is going to make a difference when we extend this \nto 50 States.\n  I am looking forward to working with our friend and distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, who knows so much about this issue, on his \namendment with respect to the achievement standards. My understanding \nis we are getting fairly close on that. I want to make sure, in \nparticular, that we can incorporate what the schools call the student \nperformance standards, so it includes some of the things like dropout \nrates and issues like that in addition to the tougher test scores. But \nI think Senator Jeffords spoke for all of us a minute or so\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\nago where I think we are getting close, and I want Senator Kennedy to \nknow that we are going to go forward in good faith and try to work that \namendment out.\n  Finally, the last point I want to make deals with the parental \ninvolvement issue. We keep in place all requirements for parental \ninvolvement--all of it. But it seems to me, Mr. President, and \ncolleagues, that if we are talking about the best way to get folks \ninvolved in a convenient, accessible kind of way, it is to have these \nEd-Flex programs that empower local communities to set up opportunities \nfor folks to participate.\n  I know that people in rural areas who are 3,000 miles away from \nWashington, DC, find it a lot harder to come to one of the useful \nhearings and forums that are held by the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts. I can get to them. I find them very, very useful. But I \ncan tell you that folks in rural Oregon would much rather be empowered \nto participate at the local level than to try to say we are going to in \nsome way skew more of the parental involvement back to Washington, DC.\n  At the end of the day, what Ed-Flex is all about is a third path with \nrespect to Federal-State relations. We now have two camps on this \nissue. There is one camp that says only the Federal Government has the \nanswer, that those folks at the local level can't chew gum and walk at \nthe same time, do not trust them, and run these programs at the Federal \nlevel. Then there are a group of people 180 degrees the other way. They \nsay that everything the Federal Government touches turns into toxic \nwaste, just give us all the money at the local level, and we can't \npossibly do any worse with those dollars than the Federal Government \ndoes.\n  What Ed-Flex is all about--and in Oregon, particularly with Senator \nHatfield's leadership, we have done it in health, in welfare, with the \nenvironment--what we have said is that Ed-Flex is a third path. And we \nhave told the Federal Government, in areas where we have received \nwaivers, that we will meet all the requirements of the Federal laws, \nall of them, and the Federal Government can hold us accountable; but in \nreturn for that commitment to comply with all of the Federal laws, give \nus in Oregon the chance to tailor the approaches that we are using to \nmeet the individual needs of our community.\n  I feel very strongly that poor kids need the funds that are available \nunder title I. I will fight as hard as any Member of the Senate to make \nsure that there is no compromise there. But I do think that in coming \nup with approaches to best meet the needs of kids at the local level \nwith respect to title I, what works in rural Oregon is going to be \ndifferent than what works in the Bronx, and the opportunity to get away \nfrom that one-size-fits-all approach while holding communities \naccountable is what Ed-Flex is all about.\n  So I think this is an important debate. I said earlier most Americans \nhave no idea what Ed-Flex is all about. I bet a lot of people at this \npoint think Ed-Flex is a guy who is teaching aerobics at the local \nhealth club. We are going to have to spend some time talking about this \nissue to show why it is actually beneficial in the real world in terms \nof serving poor kids and meeting the needs of the communities. I think \nwe can do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. It is, indeed, invigorating and \nencouraging to be in the Chamber today to talk about education, talking \nabout an innovative proposal to try to reform education and also being \nable to have a principled debate about increasing the accountability \nthat should be inherent in this proposal because the issue of \nflexibility alone without accountability could lead simply to sending \nfunds to States without proper controls. And so I believe we will have \nto emphasize in this debate and ultimately in this legislation \naccountability as well as flexibility.\n  I have been working on these issues since my time in the other body \non the Education and Labor Committee and here on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, and I have always tried to stress the notion of \naccountability because, sadly, there are too many children in this \ncountry today who are not receiving quality education, particularly in \nrural areas and in central cities. And if we simply transfer funds \nwithout some meaningful accountability, I think we will continue to \npromulgate that disadvantage and continue to do disservice to those \nchildren.\n  I would prefer, frankly, to look at all these issues in the context \nof the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nbecause however innovative this approach is today with Ed-Flex, it is \nin my view a nod toward reform, a genuflection toward reform, but it is \nnot the comprehensive reform, frankly, that we should be encouraging \nbecause that comprehensive reform requires improvement in teacher \nquality, the repair and modernization of schools, reduction in class \nsize, strengthening parental involvement, equipping our libraries with \nthe modern technology and the modern media, which is so necessary. And \nthose are the hallmarks of real reform, and those we will encounter in \na comprehensive and systematic way in the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Act. But if we are to deal with and move \nforward on the issue of flexibility, we have to do it right, and we \nhave to do it with respect to accountability.\n  I want to emphasize one other point in terms of this comprehensive \napproach to education reform. I hope that in this year's \nreauthorization we would take special strides to try to develop ways to \ninvolve parents in the process. This might be one of the most difficult \nissues we face, one of the most challenging issues we face, but, \nultimately, if we get it right, could be the lever that moves \nsignificant reform and in a way which we all can afford, because I \ndon't think there is any person in this body who would say that we can \ndo less than improve the involvement of parents in the education of \ntheir children.\n  The Ed-Flex bill provides flexibility to States. But, as I have \nstressed before, flexibility must be a carrot for and matched up with \naccountability.\n  One aspect of this--and the debate is ongoing now in discussions--and \nI again commend the sponsors for their willingness to talk and to \ndiscuss and negotiate these amendments, these proposed amendments--I \nthink we have to be very clear what we are trying to use the \nflexibility to achieve.\n\n  In my view, we are trying to improve student performance. Our focal \npoint should be improved student performance, and this legislation \nshould reflect that overriding focal point. It is one thing to provide \nrelief from forms of regulation to make the life of a principal a \nlittle easier, the life of school committee people a little easier, and \nmaybe free up a few extra dollars along the way, but if that does not \nresult in improved student achievement, then we have missed the boat, \nwe have missed the point. That should be our overarching goal, and I \nbelieve the amendment Senator Kennedy and I are proposing is a key to \nthat, and I hope we are making progress to come to a principled \nreconciliation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to say how much I agree with the Senator from \nRhode Island. Student achievement is measured by the individual State's \nprogram. I think it is important that we underline that student \nachievement is measured by what is happening in the States, not by some \nFederal standard. That is all we are asking. The State establishes its \ncriteria, and all we are saying is if you are going to get the \nadditional flexibility and you are going to get the resources, that at \nsome place someone ought to know whether the students are achieving and \nmaking progress.\n  Mr. REED. I think that is precisely correct. We are not talking about \na national standard, a national level of achievement. We are talking \nabout letting the States propose their levels of achievement and then \nmeasuring how well this flexibility leads to the accomplishment of \ntheir goals.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is really all we are saying. We are taking Federal \nresources--resources that will go into the States and to the local \ncommunities--and communities are going to use these resources in ways \nthat are going to be consistent with the overall purpose, which is \ntargeting the needy children, and, over 5 years at least, there will be\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\nsome progress in student achievement according to what the State has \nestablished.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that an example which incorporates \nwhat we are intending to do is in the State of Texas, which has set \nnumerical criteria that are closely tied to both schools and districts, \nand the specific students affected by the waiver? Texas expects all \ndistricts that receive waivers under Title I to make annual gains on \ntest scores so that in 5 years 90 percent of all the students will pass \nState assessment tests in reading and mathematics. Texas districts must \nmake annual gains so at the end of the same 5 years, 90 percent of \nAfrican American students, 90 percent of Hispanic students, 90 percent \nof white students, 90 percent of economically disadvantaged students \nwill pass these tests. Now, there is something specific. The State \nestablishes the criteria. They say we want the flexibility to be able \nto do it, and we say fine. What we have found out is that they have \nmade great academic achievement and progress for those students.\n  We have another State of the 12 that says on their waiver, ``We want \na commitment to the identification and implementation of programs that \nwill create an environment in which all students achieve academic \npotential.'' They got the waiver, they got the resources, and it will \nbe a bold Secretary of Education that is going to terminate or take \nthat away.\n  What we are trying to say is, as Texas has done right from the very \nbeginning, it has got to be very specific. The State establishes their \ncriteria and they have proposed measurable ways of evaluating whether \nthose students are going to achieve. And they have met all their goals \nso far. Why do we have to spend so much time in this Chamber saying \nthat makes a good deal of sense? We know it is something that is \nworking. Why don't we try to accept it? That is all we are looking \nfor--for the words ``student achievement'' to be included in the \ncriteria.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for his excellent comments.\n  I believe Texas is a great example of what we can do if we give \nflexibility and demand accountability. As the Senator from \nMassachusetts emphasized, this accountability is with respect to their \nown standards, but it is measurable, it is objective, and it has \nresulted in great success in the State of Texas. In fact, I suggest \nmost of the proponents of this legislation point to Texas as the \nexample of what Ed-Flex can be and should be. As the Senator from \nMassachusetts pointed out, part and parcel of that is not just the \nflexibility, it is rigorous accountability. I hope we can incorporate \nthat notion in this legislation.\n  I think it is also important to recognize, too, that as we debate \nthis Ed-Flex bill, we have yet to have the definitive results from many \nof the demonstration States confirming that what they have done with \nEd-Flex has led to improvement in student performance or just overall \nimprovement in the educational process. The GAO has looked at this \nissue. Their report certainly raises as many questions as it answers \nwith respect to this issue as to whether Ed-Flex is working in those 12 \nStates that already have the flexibility to do what we are proposing to \ndo legislatively here.\n  The other thing I suggest, too, is it is a concern--and it is a \nconcern that was expressed by my colleague from Oregon--about whether \nthis may endanger funding for the neediest students. I don't think \nthere is anyone in this body, again, who would encourage such a \ndevelopment. We recognize, particularly through title I, that these \nscarce Federal dollars are going into communities that need them \ndesperately and, in many cases over the decades of this program, have \nprovided a significant makeup for local funds that are not adequate to \nthe purpose.\n  But what we are concerned about--and it is a concern that, again, I \nhope is worked out through the process of this debate and amendments--\nis that unwittingly we might undo some of that emphasis and effort. \nAgain, I would not argue it is the purpose of anyone who has proposed \nthis legislation, but we must be careful because, again, we are looking \nat the most vulnerable population in this country in terms of \neducation. We are looking at a population that desperately needs the \nsupport and assistance of every level of government.\n  There is another aspect I would like to conclude with, and that is \nthe participation of parents in this process. I mentioned initially, I \nbelieve one of the great challenges we have this year in our \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is \nfinding ways to encourage more substantive, meaningful parental \ninvolvement. In the context of this legislation, along with my \ncolleagues, I will propose an amendment that would allow for greater \nparental involvement, allow for parental input that would be available \nfor public review and would be included in state or local waiver \napplications.\n  We are not trying to hamstring local authorities. Last year I had an \namendment similar to this that had a 30-day public notice and comment \nrequirement. That is not in this amendment. We are just suggesting, \nthough, if we mean that we want to have parents involved, this is not \nonly a symbolic but a very real and meaningful way to get that \ninvolvement--to encourage them to submit comments, to have those \ncomments publicly available, and then have those comments submitted \nwith the application.\n  Again, I am extremely encouraged that we are talking about \neducational reform. We are working together to come up with innovative \nways to do what we all want to do, which is to give every child in this \ncountry access to an excellent education. Indeed, we hope to guarantee \nevery child in this country access to an excellent education.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. This legislation will \nhelp States and local schools to pursue innovative efforts to improve \nK-12 education. I commend my colleagues, Senator Frist and Senator \nWyden, for bringing forth this legislation. Senator Wyden has very \neffectively demolished the myths about this legislation. The fact is, \nthe goal of this legislation is to improve--to improve the education \nthat we are providing to kids all over this country. It is that simple. \nThe legislation would accomplish that goal by extending educational \nflexibility to all 50 States.\n  The public schools in this country have made an immeasurable \ncontribution to the success of our society and our Nation. We need to \nassure that future generations of Americans receive the same excellent \npublic education that many of us were so fortunate to receive while we \nwere growing up. Unfortunately, as the Federal Government has imposed \nan alarming number of well-intended regulations on our public schools, \nwe have seen a decline in the overall achievements of our students in \nour public school systems.\n  I am very proud of the progress that Maine schools have made in \nimproving the performance of our students through a challenging \ncurriculum. For example, Maine students rank highly in the National \nAssessment of Education Progress tests. This achievement reflects the \nefforts of the Maine Department of Education, our teachers, our \nprincipals, our school boards, our State's elementary and secondary \nschools, and the University of Maine, to design and use challenging \nstatewide learning results.\n  The NAEP test results show that the efforts in Maine are in fact \nsucceeding. They show that our K-12 education system can produce high-\nachieving students when the standards, curriculum, and expectations are \nsupported and designed by those closest to our schools.\n\n  The process that the State of Maine used was a burdensome one. It \nrequired seeking individual waivers from the Federal Department of \nEducation. It was a lengthy process. It was one that involved a great \ndeal of bureaucratic delay. It is that kind of process that would be \nchanged by this legislation.\n  The fact is, Maine and the rest of our Nation still have a long way \nto go to improve the education of our students. America holds dear the \ntradition of State and local control of education. The basic \nresponsibility for improving student achievement lies with the States, \nnot the Federal Government. Indeed, perhaps a better name for this \nlegislation would be ``The Return to Local Control Education Act.''\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\n  I believe that all of us, in all of our States, are trying to meet \nthe challenge of greater student achievement. But our State \nadministrators need help from the Federal Government. They do not need \nmore dictates. They do not need more regulation. The Ed-Flex bill \nprovides some of that help by reducing Federal intrusion into the local \ncontrol of schools.\n  How will this legislation help? Let's look at the role of the Federal \nGovernment. Over the last 30 years, the Federal Government has layered \nnew programs on top of old ones that themselves are not meeting their \ngoals. This has been done with a blind commitment to the belief that \nyet another program devised in Washington will somehow reverse the \ndecline in educational achievement.\n  We spend over $10 billion a year to support elementary and secondary \neducation. This Federal money is spent through so many different \nprograms that we can't even get an accurate count of how many there \nare. The General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research \nService estimates range from 550 to 750 separate Federal education \nprograms. Each of these programs comes with its own objectives, \nstatutory requirements, and administrative regulations. Collectively, \nthey create a huge administrative burden on local schools. Indeed, \nwhile the Federal Government funds only 7 percent of our public \neducation system, it is responsible for 50 percent of the schools' \npaperwork.\n  By passing the Education Flexibility Act, we will allow States and \nlocal school districts the flexibility they need to pursue creative and \ninnovative approaches in using Federal funds. And the Federal dollars \nthat they do receive will become a genuine force for education \nimprovement. Even more important, the bill will afford States and \ncommunities the flexibility that they need to craft local solutions. \nInstead of struggling to make programs designed in Washington fit local \nneeds, States and localities will have the freedom to make the changes \nthat they know are needed in each individual school.\n  Because, as the Senator from Oregon put it very well, the schools in \nan urban environment may be very different in their needs from a school \nin a rural community.\n  The Ed-Flex Act addresses the need for change within our public \nschools. It will provide a way for State and local education agencies \nto be freed from the multitude of Federal statutes and regulations that \nprevent them from breaking out of the Federal education mold and \ncreating their own exciting programs. Expanding the opportunity for Ed-\nFlex to every State gives our school boards, teachers, parents, and \nState officials the opportunity to experiment and innovate, to chart a \nnew path for better schools, and to provide Congress with the \ninformation it needs to help promote rather than hinder educational \nimprovement.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \nlegislation. I would also like to clarify that I don't think Senator \nKennedy deliberately gave me his cold from the hearing yesterday so I \nwould be less effective in debating him today, despite the rumor to the \ncontrary.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, does the manager of the bill want to say \nsomething?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just wanted to give the assurance to--if you will \nyield 15 seconds--to the Senator from Maine, as far as I am concerned, \nshe is always effective, whether it is that clear voice that comes out \nfrom the northeast part of the country, we always listen and take great \ncare what she says.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask, with the concurrence of the \nSenator from Connecticut, that the Senator from Wyoming be recognized \nfor a period of not more than 5 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont for \nhis request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator from Wyoming be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas pertaining to the introduction of S. 516 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman once again for the \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Ed-Flex bill \nintroduced by Senators Frist and Wyden. I believe it is a responsible \nway to help our nation's educators meet the challenges that we face in \npreparing our nation's young people for the 21st century.\n  Ed-Flex gives states the authority to grant waivers of certain \nFederal requirements to local school districts if such a waiver will \nhelp that school district better meet the needs of its students. But in \nexchange for this flexibility, the local school district must show \nresults. If the district does not show results, the waiver is revoked. \nEd-Flex gives school districts flexibility, but it also demands \naccountability--and we should discuss how to make the accountability \nmeasures even stronger.\n  In addition, under Ed-Flex states are limited in the kinds of \nrequirements they are authorized to waive. They cannot waive health and \nsafety requirements or civil rights requirements. And they cannot deny \ndistricts the funds they would ordinarily receive under these Federal \nprograms. Furthermore, districts must prove that the waiver they \nreceive truly helps them accomplish the goal it is designed to meet: \nhelping more students learn better.\n  In Nebraska we have 604 public school districts. They range in size \nfrom the small rural districts such as Tryon--which has just over 100 \nstudents, kindergarten through 12th grade--and Omaha, which has \napproximately 45,000 students.\n  A couple of weeks ago I was visited by Bob Ridenour, principal of \nNorth Ward and West Ward Elementary Schools in McCook, Nebraska. In \nresponse to the question, What do you need to do a better job of \neducating your kids?'' his answer was simple: More money and the \nflexibility to help the kids at the lowest end of the economic scale in \nthe best way possible.\n  But Ed-Flex is not just about flexibility. It's also about better \ncoordination. It allows for better coordination between the variety of \nlocal, state, and Federal education programs available to schools.\n  All of the principals in Nebraska would agree that the Federal \neducation dollars they receive are vital to well-being and success of \nthe school children within that district. But different districts have \ndifferent needs. And in some instances, different districts may need to \ntake slightly different paths to reach the common goal that all \ndistricts share: Making sure that all students have the reading, math, \nand social skills to succeed once they leave the schoolhouse door.\n  Right now, 12 States have Ed-Flex. And the feedback we have shows \nthat they are using it responsibly and that it is showing good results. \nTexas has implemented Ed-Flex more extensively than any other state in \nthe nation. Achievement scores in Texas reveal that districts with \nwaivers outperformed districts without waivers in both reading and \nmath. And the gains for African American students were even greater.\n  And Ed-Flex has allowed States like Massachusetts to assure \ncontinuity of service to schools that were eligible for title I funding \none year, ineligible the next year, but expect to be eligible in the \nfollowing year. In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor waiver. \nBut to a child in that school, the assistance provided through title I \ndollars makes a major difference.\n  Now let me be clear. Ed-Flex is a sound way to give local districts \nthe flexibility they need to do a good job of educating students. But \nit's only one part of a complex puzzle.\n  Schools also need resources. They need to have the funds to hire and \ntrain qualified teachers. They need to have the ability to reduce class \nsizes in the lower grades. They need to be able to provide students \nwith real classrooms in well-equipped buildings.\n  And schools need to be able to provide challenging afterschool \nprograms\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\nso that students can work on their math, science, reading, and \ntechnology skills between the hours of 3:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon.\n  Last summer we helped US West form a partnership with Project \nBanneker, a program that is helping raise the math and science \nachievement levels in Omaha Public Schools. Not only did students and \nteachers benefit from the hands-on technology skills training, but US \nWest benefited because they played a role in training prospective \nemployees. We are looking forward to another productive summer with US \nWest as we work to expand the partnership.\n  The Federal government can't do it all--and the Federal government \nshould not do it all. But we should be a helpful partner in the effort \nto improve our nation's schools. The Federal contribution to K-12 \neducation is relatively small--less than 10 percent. That is why it's \nimportant that we make sure our investments in education are wise ones, \nthat they complement efforts at the state and local levels, and that \nthe investments yield results.\n  We need to make sure that the most disadvantaged students have the \nassistance and resources that they need to succeed in school. We need \nto continue to invest in title I, and also figure out how to make it \nstronger. Nebraska received $31 million year in title I funds last \nyear. School districts use those funds in a variety of ways. We need to \ngive districts the flexibility to educate those students using the best \nmethods available, but we also must demand accountability.\n  I believe that the most important way in which the Federal Government \ncan be a helpful partner is by making sure that when a young person \nfinishes twelfth grade he or she has the skills to get a decent job. It \nmay take a couple of years at a community college to fine-tune those \nskills, but the point is that only 60% of high school graduates \nnationwide go on to college, and by the time they are 25 years old, \nonly about 25% have a college degree.\n  Now we need to do more to make higher education more affordable, and \nwe just passed a Higher Education Act that makes significant steps \ntoward that goal. But we also have to make sure that those who do not \npursue a postsecondary degree have the skills to make a good living.\n  That's why I believe strongly in the value of vocational education. \nTwo weeks ago I visited the vocational education program at Grand \nIsland High School, in Grand Island, Nebraska. In the vocational \neducation program at Grand Island High, students are receiving hands-on \neducation that will translate into real jobs. Grand Island has formed a \npartnership with area manufacturers, and the manufacturers know that \nit's a good deal for them. They have said to Grand Island, You train \nthe students, and there will be a job waiting for them when they get \nout of school.''\n  In one particular class students work together all year long to build \nan actual house. Every part of the house, with the exception of the \nfoundation, is built by the students. Then, at the end of the year, \nthey actually sell the house, taking pride in the fact that they have \ncreated a product that has tangible value to their community.\n  Mr. President, I believe we need to increase opportunities for these \nstudents. I support the Ed-Flex bill because I believe that if it is \nused wisely it can help schools accomplish important goals in educating \nstudents. But I want to make clear that it's just the tip of the \niceberg. We also need to increase our investment in these students so \nthat all students have a shot at the American Dream.\n  Mr. President, just briefly, I thank both the Senator from Vermont \nand the Senator from Massachusetts for their leadership on this as \nwell. I want to try to briefly declare why I like this bill and what I \nthink needs to be done in addition to it.\n  I had a recent conversation with one of the 604 school \nsuperintendents in Nebraska. Those schools are as small as 100 \nstudents, ranging all the way up to 46,000 students, with a lot of \nvariation in between. I talked to a superintendent in one of the rural \nschool districts--in my State there is more poverty in the rural areas \nthan is in the urban areas among children--and asked what he wanted. He \nsaid, immediately, ``I need, in some cases, more flexibility to \nimplement programs. I do not want any waivers from civil rights \nrequirements, no waivers from health or safety. But sometimes with a \nFederal program, the State won't allow me to do what would reasonably \naccomplish the objective of what the Feds want.'' This bill allows it. \nHe said, ``In fact, I would like to be held to even higher standards of \naccountability. I want you all to hold me accountable to make certain \nthat we are getting the job done.'' This bill does that. It provides \nboth flexibility and measures for increased accountability, which is \nprecisely what we need.\n  I want to point out as well, Mr. President, that he went on to say \nthat the greatest challenge is not only flexibility, but increased \nresources for those children of lower income working families in both \nrural and urban environments. He said, ``If you are insistent upon \nmaking certain that we have trade policies that are open, and if you \nwant to keep the restrictions on business to a minimum so entrepreneurs \ncan grow, what we are going to have to do is aggressively increase the \nskills of people that leave high school and go right into the \nworkforce.'' The only way to get that done is to start very early. And \nI hope that in this bill, Mr. President, that we will have an \nopportunity to put some amendments on it that will give us some \nincreased funding for lowering class size, that will allow us to do \nsome afterschool programs.\n  I know the Senator from Connecticut has a bill dealing with child \ncare. To me, child care and education are almost interchangeable. It is \ndifficult to tell one from the other. A full third of my high school \nstudents in Nebraska go immediately from high school into the \nworkforce, and there is an increasing amount of concern at the rural \nlevel and at the community level for the skills of these young people. \nIf you do not start it early, it is impossible for us to close that \nskills gap. In my judgment, with the pace of our economy and the speed \nwith which things are changing, there is a real urgency to get out \nthere with flexibility, which this bill does. I hope we will have the \nopportunity to provide some additional resources so we can make sure \nthat, with confidence, we are saying we are doing all we can to make \nsure that our young people, when they graduate from high school, are \nprepared and have the skills that they are going to need in a very \ncompetitive world economy.\n  Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I won't take a great deal of time. Senator \nKennedy, Senator Jeffords, Senator Frist, Senator Wyden and others have \ntalked about many of the specifics of the bill before us--the Education \nFlexibility Partnership Act. I just want to take a few minutes to thank \nmy colleagues for all their work on this bill.\n  I am very pleased that one of the first legislative matters we are \ntaking up this year is education. This is about as significant an issue \nin the minds of most Americans as any. There are a lot of other \nquestions which are very important, but none that I think dominates the \nconcerns of Americans regardless of geography or economic circumstance \nas education, particularly elementary and secondary education.\n  Later this year, we will take up the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act reauthorization, which contains the major federal \nprograms to assist our schools. This bill requires reauthorization \nevery 5 years. And this year is the year that we must reauthorize that \nbasic fundamental piece of legislation that deals with the elementary \nand secondary education needs of America. So we will have a chance, I \nsuspect, even then to review some of the issues that concern people. I \nhad hoped that we could consider this initiative on Ed Flex as part of \nthat larger bill given its relationship to those programs; however, I \nam still hopeful that we can include the review of this program in our \nwork on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n  Today, as we gather here, in many parts of the country students are \nstill in school. Fifty-three million students, more or less, went off \nto elementary or secondary schools this morning, from Hawaii to Maine. \nOf the 53 million, 48 million are in public schools and about\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\n5 million are in private or parochial schools across the country. The \nvast majority, of course, attend our public schools. And most attending \nour schools today are doing well and their schools are good.\n  I think too often we focus our attention on the things that do not \nwork. Partly it is because that is our job. And there are a lot of \ngaping holes in the education reaching students across this country in \nthe ability to learn and the opportunity to learn. But in many, many \ncommunities across this great country we find schools that are filled \nwith learning and blessed with qualified, motivated teachers, and \nenriched with excellent resources from libraries to computers.\n  In recent years, more and more schools have joined these elite ranks. \nMore schools are enjoying the benefits of these wonderful technologies; \nmore schools have adopted strong and challenging standards-based reform \nstrategies; and more fine, well-educated people are entering the \nteaching ranks.\n  But our job, as I said a moment ago, Mr. President, is not just to \npoint out the things that are working well. If we are to improve our \nschools, we must also focus on the problems and how to encourage real \nsolutions to these problems. And that brings us to this bill. It will \nbring us to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as well.\n  Let me just share some statistics with my colleagues, briefly here, \non the state of education in America.\n  The GAO estimates that one-third of all of the schools in the United \nStates are in need of basic repairs and renovations. Two-thirds are in \ngood shape. That is the good news. But still fully a third of them are \nin poor shape and in need of repairs and renovations.\n  Just to give you one example, in my home State of Connecticut, Mr. \nPresident, there was a study done on school conditions in the city of \nWaterbury, CT. I live in a very affluent State, but there are pockets \nof real poverty in Connecticut. It is a dichotomy of affluence and \npoverty living in a relatively small piece of geography. Waterbury, CT, \nhas some very fine and affluent neighborhoods. But like many of our \ncities, there are parts of it that are not doing as well economically. \nLast year, in Waterbury, they found that 500 fire code violations \noccurred in our schools over the last five years--500 fire code \nviolations.\n  Another statistic, nationwide, 53 percent of 3- and 4-year-olds \nparticipated in preschool programs.\n  Eight percent of second graders were detained in kindergarten or the \nfirst grade. Second Graders--it is hard to imagine why someone would be \nheld back at that level. One could maybe see it later in the elementary \ngrades, but by the second grade almost 10 percent are being held back.\n  Nearly 15 percent of middle and high school teachers in the United \nStates do not minor or major in the area of their main teaching \nassignment. Again, we have 85 percent who do. But there is a growing \nnumber, about 15 percent, who are being asked to teach at the secondary \nschool level in a curriculum that they have not received a significant \nformal education.\n\n  We see, as well, that 86 percent of 18- through 24-year-olds have a \nhigh school diploma. That number, again, is getting better. But is \nstill too high. And is way too high when one looks at some of the sub-\npopulations of students; over a third of Hispanic Americans are \ndropping out. This is the fastest growing ethnic group in the United \nStates and one-third of them are dropping out of school.\n  At the end of the 20th century, Mr. President, we are going to have \nto do better in all these indicators if we are going to compete \neffectively.\n  So I am pleased we are turning our attention to education today. But \nlet's not delude ourselves. The bill that we are talking about here is \nnot the answer. I respect immensely the authors of this legislation. I \nhave a high regard for them and the motivations which caused them to \npropose this legislation, particularly my good friend from Oregon, who \nhad a long and distinguished career in the other body, and who cares \nabout young people and their educational needs, and our colleague from \nTennessee, and others who are a part of this legislation. But I want to \nraise some of the concerns that some of us have about this bill and am \nhopeful that we can work through some of these issues in the coming \ndays.\n  Six years ago, in 1993, we enacted the Ed-Flex Demonstration program \nin the hopes that it would spur school reform in our states. It was a \nvery tightly written program with just 6 states participating. We \nquickly expanded that to 12, recognizing 6 States probably was not a \ngood enough laboratory to get some decent results back to determine \nwhether or not this new waiver authority would prove to be worthwhile.\n  Ed-Flex was a major departure in education policy. We were allowing, \nfor the first time, officials to waive Federal regulatory and statutory \nrequirements. That is not a minor thing. I mean, we are responsible to \nsee to it that the dollars, the Federal dollars that go to education, \nare going to be spent well and wisely.\n  Now, I don't question that we can get heavyhanded, and too \nbureaucratic. We are all painfully aware that can happen. But to allow \nstate officials to waive statutory and regulatory requirements is a \nsignificant departure. It is one thing to modify, to amend, to drop \ncertain regulations, but to allow a complete waiver of statutory and \nregulatory requirements was a dramatic departure from our education \npolicy.\n  We included protections in the law at the time. The Secretary would \nhave to approve applications for this waiver authority. Only States \nwith strong standards-based reforms in place were eligible, and waivers \ncould not override the intents and purposes of the laws or civil rights \nand other certain basic protections. But the idea was for flexibility \nin return for results. So we passed overwhelmingly this demonstration \nprogram.\n  But it was for a demonstration program--a test. Well, the results are \nnot in. That is one of the difficulties here. It is not that anyone has \nstudied this and said they are bad, they are just not in. We do not \nreally know. It may be very good, or it may not--but raising the \nlegitimate concerns about it is not inappropriate.\n  Texas is the only State, the only one, by the way, out of all 12 \nStates, that has actually been giving us some details on how they are \nperforming. Most others cannot produce, unfortunately, any results \nabout student achievement results they have achieved through school \nreform and the Ed-Flex demonstration program.\n  The General Accounting Office, the GAO, has reviewed Ed-Flex and \nfound little in the way to suggest that Ed-Flex is making a difference. \nNow, it may. Again, I find myself in a situation of hoping it does. I \nsupported the demonstration program not because I anticipated it to \nfail, but I did it because I anticipated it to work. But I feel I have \na sense of responsibility to the people of my State--that it is their \ndollars, in a sense, that are going to this--that I can look them in \nthe eye and say why we are now going to pass legislation permanently \nestablishing this. But if you ask me the question, ``Do I have the \nempirical evidence which draws the final conclusion that in fact this \ncan work?'' I have to say, no, not yet.\n  Now, maybe it will come in, but it is not here yet. And so I hope my \ncolleagues understand that those of us who are raising these questions \nare doing so with a deep sense of optimism that this will work, but \nalso a deep sense of concern that we do not have the information yet to \nmake these final conclusions.\n  While we don t know much about results, we do know a little about how \nthis authority is being used. Seven of the participating 12 states have \ngranted 10 or fewer waivers. The vast majority of waivers requested are \nabout loosening title I requirements for targetting the neediest \nstudents. But generally, the finding suggests there is little being \ndone with Ed-Flex that is not being done directly with the Secretary \nwith his own waiver authority.\n  We hear anecdotes from Governors about how it is promoting creativity \nand spurring reform--but the evidence we have on how it has been used \nreally do not back this up in the most states. But I have never had a \nGovernor or mayor yet that wouldn't like to get all statutory and \nregulatory requirements of the Federal Government eliminated; that \ndoesn't come as a great shock. They would like us to write a check, \ngive it to them, and get out of the way. That is how Governors and \nmayors\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\nthink. I find it interesting that in States, when State legislatures or \nmayors ask Governors for similar waiver authority, I usually find the \nGovernors are far more resistant to waiver authority at the local level \nthan they are in asking us for it. It is where you are in the food \nchain in terms of your willingness to support waivers from regulation.\n  At any rate, we hear a lot of anecdotes from Governors and State \neducation leaders about Ed-Flex changing the mentality of their systems \nand motivating school improvement efforts. I am for this. I hope it \nworks. But I think we need to ensure that students are served by these \nchanges. That is why we have the accountability amendments.\n  Senators Kennedy, Reed, and I will offer two simple amendments that I \nbelieve get to the core of improving accountability. These build on the \nchanges that we were pleased to see the managers include the substitute \nbill they offered earlier today. Our staffs have been working together \nfor weeks to beef up the accountability in this bill. I believe we have \nmade good progress, but must do more.\n  The first amendment offered by Senators Kennedy, Reed and me will \nensure that accountability is resulting in student achievement. \nImproving the performance of students is what this is all about. I am \nrather surprised we have been forced to offer what we think is a very \ncommon sense amendment, rather than having it just agreed to and \naccepted. I understand we continue to work on this and am hopeful that \nwe will be able to resolve this without a vote.\n  The second amendment ensures involvement of one of the key players in \nschool reforms, parents and the larger public. The Reed amendment \nensures that parents and other local leaders can comment on \napplications for waivers and that these comments are given \nconsideration.\n  Again, I would hope that parental involvement is one of the things \nall of us can agree on. In Head Start, we require that parents be \ninvolved from volunteering in classrooms to parent planning boards, \nthen make key decisions about their community programs. We get about 80 \npercent parental involvement with Head Start programs. What has been \nterribly disappointing to me is that by the first grade parental \ninvolvement drops to about 20 percent. It immediately drops, which is \nterribly disturbing because there is no better way to increase a \nchild's performance in education than to have a parent involved--\nvisiting teachers, talking to them, going to the schools, learning what \nthe child is supposed to be learning, involved in school governance and \nreform.\n  The requirement we would add would ensure that interested parents \ncould be engaged in this process. I hope our colleagues would be \nsupportive of that since it fits in with the growing concern among all \nDemocrats and Republicans that parental involvement needs to be \nexpanded rather than contracted. The Reed amendment does not give \nparents or others veto power. That is not the point. It gives them the \npower to comment knowing their comments will be considered, which is \nnot too much to ask. It says their comments should be available and \nincluded in the application for waiver authority.\n\n  These are simple changes that broadly improve the accountability of \nthis bill.\n  We will also have the opportunity to consider several other important \neducation initiatives--not to belittle the importance some have placed \non this Ed-Flex bill, but I have never had one parent or teacher or \nstudent raise it with me.\n  I have heard from many concerned about class size, districts looking \nfor reassurance that the full promise of 100,000 teachers will reach \nthem. Class size is a critical issue to families all across the \ncountry, whether in a rural school in Idaho, or urban school in \nConnecticut. Parents know that class size matters--how many teachers \nteach how many students, how well educated they are, and are these \nbuildings that these kids are supposed to be learning in, in good \nshape. We also hear a great deal about the readiness of children to \nlearn when they enter school. We hear about aftershool.\n  My colleague from California, Senator Boxer, has an interest in this. \nMy colleagues from Vermont and Massachusetts will recall last July when \nthis specific bill was in committee, I offered an afterschool amendment \nto this proposal--which I hope to be offering in this debate. My \ncolleague from California has an interest in this subject matter, as \nwell.\n  Eighteen years ago our former colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nBradley, and I did the initial legislation on afterschool programs in \nthe dropout legislation. Over the years I have been deeply involved in \ntrying to reduce this afterschool problem, of the difficulties that \noccur with the lack of afterschool programs. This is an issue that many \npeople in this country would like to see us do more about.\n  I think most of my colleagues are aware of this, but this chart \npoints out when juveniles are most likely to commit violent crimes. The \nspike is around 2:30 or 3 o'clock. That is the peek time of violent \ncrimes among young people. The hours between 2:30 and 6:00 is when we \nsee the largest percentage of violent juvenile crime.\n  It is not uncommon for communities to have curfews. Invariably the \ncurfew suggests some time after 9 or 10 o'clock at night. In fact, 9 \no'clock or 10 o'clock at night is a relatively calm period of time. It \nis 2:30, 3 o'clock, 3:30, 4 o'clock--when kids are home from school, \nbut parents are not--which is the critical time period. We are told by \nchiefs of police and others that violent crime among young people is on \nthe increase. Afterschool programs, putting efforts into this, is \nsomething that we think would make a great deal of difference.\n  I hope to offer an amendment on my own or with Senator Boxer or \nothers to deal with this issue.\n  Mr. President, Ed-Flex may make a difference in some States. Frankly, \nin my view the jury is still out for the reasons; I hope the jury comes \nback with good results and good reports on this. We think the \naccountability amendments will help here.\n  But this legislation on its own is no substitute for what our schools \nneed and what parents and students across this country are demanding. I \nam hopeful that during these next several days we can have a real \ndiscussion on education and improve this bill with the addition of some \ncritical timely initiatives.\n  I am happy to work with the chairman of the committee and the ranking \nmember and move through these issues in an orderly way. I thank both \nSenators for their leadership. I commend my colleague from Tennessee \nand my colleague from Oregon for their fine work on this amendment.\n  I appreciate, again, the motivations that have given rise to this \nlegislation. I think we can make it a better bill and add to it some of \nthe elements that we think will strengthen the educational needs of all \nAmericans by some of the suggestions I have made here and that others \nhave made this afternoon. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I'll use a few moments to take a look at \nlast year. What we are talking about right now is where we ended last \nyear as far as passing bills on education.\n  Let us take a look at what we did accomplish during that period of \ntime. This chart lists all of the bills which we passed out of our \ncommittee, almost all of them by unanimous or close to unanimous votes. \nThey all became law. They were very important.\n  First of all, we had the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nfor which we had tremendous bipartisan agreement, and we took time to \ndo it. It came out and passed practically unanimously by both the House \nand Senate. That is what happens when we have good, bipartisan working \ntogether.\n\n  The next one was the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of \n1997. We had some important problems that came up with respect to \nstudent loans, but were able to take care of them. This Act passed with \na very substantial vote.\n  Next, was the National Science Foundation Authorization Act, which \nhad not been reauthorized for many years. An important component of the \nNational Science Foundation is education; we sometimes forget that. But \na tremendous amount of funding for the important areas of education, in\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\nthe areas of science, comes through this bill, and that was \naccomplished.\n  Then we had a real step forward with the Work Force Investment Act of \n1998, including the Rehabilitation Act Amendments. That bill has turned \nthis country around in its attitude and ability to prepare people for \nthe workforce. Not only that, but it recognized that workforce training \nis nonstop at high schools and colleges. Training goes on and on and \non. We now have the nontraditional students of the past who are \nactually outnumbering the so-called traditional students on the \nrecommendation that a person's job is going to change many times during \na lifetime. We had close to unanimous agreement on the Workforce \nInvestment Act of 1998.\n  And for the first time in 5 years, we did a thorough review of the \nHigher Education Act, taking into consideration the needs of the \nNation. Again, with very hard work and long, long hours, we were able \nto complete the Higher Education Amendments. Also included were the \nEducation of the Deaf Act Amendments of 1998. The Higher Education \nAmendments took a close look at not only higher education, but what \nhigher education was doing with respect to the teacher colleges. We \nfound we had serious problems with the teacher colleges and things had \nto be changed. We also recognized that we had a huge problem trying to \nget our teachers in schools the kind of retraining that is necessary in \norder to bring them up to speed on the needs not only in the next \ncentury but this century. This Act passed close to unanimously.\n  The work being done now in professional development--we eliminated \nall the bills on professional development in there. They were useless. \nWe have now created a very firm foundation for professional development \nin higher education institutions to assist us in our K-through-12 \neducation.\n  The Reading Excellence Act was unanimous here. In close cooperation \nwith the President, we came out with that act, and it is in law and \nalready having an impact upon the serious problems we have with a \nnumber of young people graduating from high school who are presently \nfunctionally illiterate and do not have the basic skills necessary to \nwarrant a diploma. We have had what is called social promotion, and the \nPresident emphasized that we have to do away with social promotion. The \nway that can be done is to try to make sure every kid can read, and the \nReading Excellence Act will be an important part of that.\n  In addition, we had the Charter School Expansion Act. As we go \nforward, it is necessary to experiment in the kinds of institutions we \ncan create to have the flexibility and dedication to be able to change \nthe relatively low results we have been getting out of our K-through-12 \neducational system. Some of the charter schools are working well. We \nhave learned a lot. Those will be models for what we can do in the \npublic school system. It is an important step forward.\n  In addition, we had the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998. \nThat is Head Start and other programs for the very young, as well as \nfor those in special low-income areas. It was the first reauthorization \nof Head Start in many years. We came out with an excellent bill, all \nworking together, Republicans and Democrats, and with the White House.\n  Finally--and this is an important act--is the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational-Technical Education Act Amendments. We had not been able to \nget that amended in many years. We did a thorough review of its \napplication. We upgraded it and brought it into the modern day \nsituation.\n\n  I am pleased to say that we almost reached our goal on all the bills \nthat we had. However, one bill didn't make it, and it was this Ed-Flex \nbill. The reason it didn't make it is not because the Members did not \nagree with what we had in the bill, but it was seen to be a vehicle on \nwhich perhaps many other ideas and thoughts about how to change \neducation could be amended to it.\n  I hope that doesn't occur this time. I hope we don't find ourselves \nin the position of not taking a bill which everybody agrees is \nimportant. The President has said that he favors it. He gave strong \nwords of support for it. The Governors have unanimously agreed that \nthey want it. I hope we will be able to get this out in the next few \ndays in order to be sure that we can give the flexibility to the States \nthat they need.\n  My State has had it. It has worked very well. It is not a huge \nsuccess in the sense that it is going to change that much that goes on, \nbut it makes it easier for States to coordinate things. You have \nsituations--at least in our State--where school districts are very \nclose to the 50 percent or the 125 percent thresholds for poverty. If \nyou don't quite make it, it fouls everything up. With the flexibility \nwe have had in Vermont as one of those six States that have been able \nto use the flexibility, we have found that it has reduced the time and \neffort which go into trying to work with title I. That is all we are \ntrying to do today.\n  I think we are hearing now an agreement on accountability. If we have \nlearned anything over the past year, it has been the tremendous lack of \naccountability in this country in our educational system. If there is \nany area that we need to improve upon--and I serve on the Goals 2000 \npanel--it is accountability. One of the most disturbing things I have \nfound is that we really don't know what is going on in this country. We \nstill can't measure performance, still can't determine--in fact, in the \nreport we have no evidence that there was any improvement from the date \nthat we got the ``Nation at Risk'' report in 1983. Fifteen years and \nthere is no measurable improvement in our schools. But then we found \nthat the data we were using to determine whether or not there was any \nimprovement was 1994 data, and here it was 1998.\n  So we have other improvements to make, and one of those is \naccountability and to be able to measure what is going on in our school \nsystem. The flexibility will help the States to be able to really \nascertain and work better with their school systems to determine \nexactly what is going on, how to measure success. That is one of the \nreasons. So I am hopeful that that one bill we were unable to get \npassed last year in the area of education, which we knew was \nappropriate and necessary--I hope we can get it done quickly this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will just take a few moments to expand \nupon a couple of issues that have been raised over the course of the \nmorning and early afternoon. One has to do with accountability and the \nother, parental involvement. Both of these are very important issues as \nwe proceed ahead in addressing both the underlying bill and the \npotential amendments that are coming forward.\n  The Ed-Flex bill itself, again, is a bill that expands a \ndemonstration project, which has been very successful, from 12 States \nto 50 States. What it does is simple. It allows schools and school \ndistricts the opportunity to obtain a waiver, and that waiver would \nallow them to accomplish very specific goals as set out in programs but \nfree of the redtape and excessive, burdensome regulations, and it also \nallows them to say we are going to meet those goals and objectives and \nbe held accountable for those in very strict ways that identify our \nparticular needs. Schools have different needs; a particular school \nmight need access to computers and another might need to have a pre-\nkindergarten program. Another school might need to have an afterschool \ntutoring program. I think the point is that we don't want to tie the \nhands of our local communities and our schools if they say this is what \nit takes for us to increase student performance, this is how we have \nidentified, based on our own needs to achieve, these very specific \nobjectives. Again, we are not talking about a block grant. We are not \ntalking about changing the goals that we set out. We are saying that \ngiven the resources that we are putting in a particular area, and given \nthe specific goals, we are going to give the local communities the \nopportunity to have more flexibility and at the same time demanding \naccountability to meet those goals.\n\n  That, very simply, is what the bill does. We have this experience \nwith it that historically we can look to; we can learn from it. We can \nexpand upon it. And that is where we are today.\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\n That is what I think real leadership in education is all about. I \nthink it is an appropriate Federal role to give that flexibility and \ndemand that accountability. ``Accountability'' is tied with \n``flexibility.''\n  That accountability needs to be carried out at the local level, for \nwhich I have the next chart, which was spelled out earlier. We need to \nhave the accountability built in at the local level. We need to have \nthe accountability built in at the State level and at the Federal \nlevel, all reinforcing each other in an appropriate hierarchical way \njust to make sure we are holding those schools or school districts \naccountable for the waiver that they have spelled out.\n  I have gone through the specifics earlier, but as I keep this chart \nup, just so people can understand how it builds one on the other, let \nme also make it clear that the type of waivers that we are allowing are \nreally two kinds. One is an administrative type of waiver. That is a \nwaiver where you unshackle the paperwork on local communities, local \nschools, and school districts which say that they are bombarded with \npaperwork and time requiring activities which keep them away from \naccomplishing that goal. Those sorts of administrative waivers are very \nimportant. And that is one element of the waiver system.\n  Another element of the waiver system about which we have talked a \ngreat deal about today is where the schoolwide waivers take place, \nagain accomplishing the specific goals consistent with the intent of \nthe Federal law.\n  We have to keep in mind that not all waivers are about student \nperformance per se, that some waivers are about--I will describe them \nfirst--lowering that paperwork burden on both schools and school \ndistricts and at the State level.\n  I say that because we have to be careful, if we start modifying this \nbill at all, so that we don't try to connect every single waiver with \nan increase in student performance and use that as the judge. There are \ncertain areas that we cannot basically come back and link that \nparticular waiver that produces paperwork to the performance of \nindividual students in a school.\n  On the issue of student performance, I think it is important to point \nout that Ed-Flex, as is spelled out in the underlying bill, has more \naccountability that we have injected into it than the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act which is in existence today. That particular \nact authorizes over $13 billion. We have injected in our bill, Ed-Flex, \nmore accountability than is in that Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  I mention that again so people will know how hard we have worked in \nthis peer approach to make sure that accountability is included.\n  Under current law, education programs that provide direct services to \nstudents are not specifically required to improve student performance. \nEd-Flex has more accountability built into it than the largest single \nFederal education law in the land.\n  That is point No. 1.\n  No. 2, it is important to understand that the accountability \nprovisions in our bill as written--I encourage my colleagues to read \nthat bill as written--inject more accountability than the existing 12-\nState demonstration-project. It is important, because I want people to \ngo back and read the bill and not just look at what is in the current \nEd-Flex program and the 12-State demonstration project.\n\n  First, before a State may issue waivers, they must first provide \npublic notice and comment. I am going to come back to that shortly \nbecause that will give me the opportunity to talk a little bit more \nabout parental involvement. But it is very clear that by having that \nrequirement that the community at large, including the parents, will be \nvery much involved as they can express their concerns if they have such \nconcerns about the waiver.\n  Second, before receiving any waiver in the State, local school and \nlocal school districts must establish specific measurable education \ngoals, which may include student performance. But they have to have \nvery specific goals spelled out.\n  That is important, again, so we can demand that accountability as to \nwhether or not they meet those goals. As I pointed out before, those \ngoals, as spelled out in the bill, may very well include student \nperformance.\n  Third, every year States must monitor--this is at the State level--\nand review the performance of schools and school districts that have \nreceived those waivers. So we go from local up to the State level that \nthe State must monitor. In addition, the States are required to make \nsure that the school and school districts that have received waivers \nare, indeed, making progress toward those goals; again, including \nschool performance. Whatever those goals are they establish, consistent \nwith the Federal intent, we need to show not only that the goals have \nbeen spelled out, but that progress on a regular basis is being met. If \na school district or a school fails to meet that progress toward \nmeeting the goals, the State at any time can revoke that waiver.\n  In addition, we have built in and spelled out here that the States \nhave to offer technical assistance, if progress is not being made, and \nalso take corrective action.\n  Fifth, every year the States must send a report on how Ed-Flex is \nworking to the Department of Education; again, an accountability \nmeasure.\n  Sixth, again looking at the top of the chart at the Federal level, \nthe Secretary of Education has the final say. He or she can terminate a \nwaiver at any time.\n  Seventh, the Secretary must issue a report to Congress every 2 years \non the performance of students affected by the waivers.\n  Eighth, State waiver authority to issue waivers is thoroughly \nreviewed every 5 years, and is contingent upon school performance.\n  Earlier today, the Senator from Oregon presented the accountability \nchecks in the bill. These accountability checks are critical.\n  The second issue that I wanted to refer to, again because it has been \ntalked about, is regarding the requirements that can or cannot be \nwaived. Again, I encourage my colleagues to go back and see what is in \nthe legislation, because it has been written very carefully with a huge \namount of input from a broad number of people. The requirements that \ncannot be waived in Ed-Flex--again, spelled out in the bill--include \nsuch things as: The civil rights requirements, the underlying purposes \nof each program or act for which a waiver is granted.\n  The third one that I want to stress right now--I will not go through \nthe rest of these--as requirements that cannot be waived under Ed-Flex, \nis parental participation and involvement. We have heard a lot about \nthe parents, how important it is to have the parents involved. I agree. \nThere is nobody that cares more about their children, about the future \nof their children, than those parents.\n  One important thing is the whole notion of public notice. We talked a \nlittle bit about public notice. This is one area that has been greatly \nimproved, I think compared to a year ago--public notice of those \nwaivers.\n  First of all, let's see what is currently being done in terms of \npublic notice of the waivers. Let's look at Texas. In Texas, at the \nlocal level requests for waivers must be reviewed by campus and/or \nsite-based decision making committees composed of parents, teachers, \nand other community representatives.\n  The same thing in Maryland. I won't go through the details. But, if \nyou look at these examples, you will see that through public notice, \ncomments and concerns by the parents are made known. The parents are \ninvolved.\n  To take another example of public notice in current Ed-Flex States, \nin Michigan, it has a waiver-referent group composed of representatives \nfrom a number of people: Michigan Department of Education, local and \nintermediate school districts, private schools--and importantly--parent \norganizations.\n  Furthermore, if you look at the public notice, among the criteria \nthat the Secretary uses to evaluate a State's Ed-Flex application is,\n\n       Did the State conduct effective public hearings or provide \n     other means for broad-based public involvement in the \n     development of the Ed-Flex plan? How has the State involved \n     districts, schools and [very specifically] parents, community \n     groups and advocacy and civil rights groups in the \n     development of the plan?\n\nThese are the criteria that are used, which will be used as well under \nextension under our bill.\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\n  I can just go on. The other criterion that they have to use is,\n\n       How would the State provide districts, parent \n     organizations, advocacy and civil rights groups and other \n     interested parties with notice and an opportunity to comment \n     on proposed waivers of Federal requirements?\n\n  Again, as you can see, parents are an integral part of this waiver \nprocess. And there is a good reason. As has been pointed out by both \nsides, we want parents involved. Nobody cares more about the education \nof the children of this country than those parents.\n  The National Education Association, (NEA), on February 25, 1999 made \nan important statement. I d like to look at how a group that is \ninvolved in education, that is objective, that is not on one side of \nthe aisle here, that is not just a policymaker but is a group of people \nwho are in the field, who have a vested interest in education and \neducation policy--how do they view the direction we are going, in terms \nof that overall balance? I think we can go through this first statement \non the chart. It says:\n\n       . . . the NEA believes the Ed-Flex legislation introduced \n     by Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Bill Frist of Tennessee \n     is a step in the right direction.\n\n  Remember, we are not trying to cure all of the problems in education \ntoday. That is not our purpose in this particular bill. That is a \nprocess underway in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee right now as we are reauthorizing the ESEA, the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. That is the appropriate forum for that. \nThis is a very targeted bill that can be passed to the benefit of \nhundreds of thousands of children if we do it right over the next \nseveral days.\n  But going back to the NEA, because again I want to stay on this issue \nof parents, how do they view what we are doing from the outside with \ntheir vested interest in education, the education establishment, and, \nmost important, the education of our children? I will turn to the \nsecond quotation from their letter. They say:\n\n       The bill has been much improved through the addition of \n     increased accountability and coordination measures and a \n     public comment period that permits parents and members of the \n     community to participate actively in education reforms.\n\n  I think this again is critically important, because it demonstrates \nobjectively that we, as a body, on a bipartisan bill, have made \nabsolutely sure to address the accountability issue and to address the \nissue of including parents.\n  I have to say, ``The bill has been improved. . . .'' Those are the \nwords of the NEA, which shows we have taken a bill that really went \nthrough committee and passed, and have been willing to work again with \nall interested parties to make sure that accountability, through the \neight steps I outlined, through the tiered approach of the pyramid, \nguarantees--guarantees--that accountability.\n  Just so people will know, because it is always hard for people to go \nback and read the bill, on the public notice and comment issue, which I \nthink is very important--just so people will know specifically what is \nin the bill on public notice and comment, let me just read directly \nfrom the bill, page 13. The bill has been distributed.\n\n       Public notice and comment.--Each State educational agency \n     granted waiver authority under this section and each local \n     educational agency receiving a waiver under this section \n     shall provide the public adequate and efficient notice of the \n     proposed waiver authority or waiver, consisting of a \n     description of the agency's application for the proposed \n     waiver authority or waiver in a widely read or distributed \n     medium, and shall provide the opportunity for all interested \n     members of the community to comment regarding the proposed \n     waiver authority or waiver.\n\n  I repeat, ``shall provide the opportunity for all interested members \nof the community to comment regarding the proposed waiver authority or \nwaiver.''\n  There are a number of other issues. I wanted, again, to come back to \nthe accountability issue and parental involvement, both issues that \nhave been addressed. People who read the bill will find the \naccountability and parental involvement issues very, very strongly \nenumerated, supported, and substantiated in the bill, again with the \ninput of the Department of Education, from whom we solicited direct \ninput on how to assure that accountability, and many, many other \ninterested parties.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know the afternoon is moving along, but \nwe are making some progress. Even as we are trying to find some areas \nof common ground, let me just respond specifically to the Senator from \nTennessee on his provisions in this and on his statement that the \ncriteria in this results in greater performance standards than in Title \nI. It is difficult to see that, because, under the provisions under \nTitle I, the State has developed and implemented the challenging State \ncontent standard, challenging student performance standards and aligned \nassessments described in the Elementary/Secondary Act, and therefore it \nhas content standards and performance standards included, while, in \nthis legislation, Ed-Flex, it says, ``made substantial progress as \ndetermined towards development.'' So, I think we are headed in the \nright direction, but I don't want anyone to think we have tougher \nstandards in this particular proposal than we do in the underlying \nTitle I.\n  Specifically in the managers' package, on page 3, you have findings:\n\n       To achieve the State goals for the education of children in \n     the State, the focus must be on results in raising the \n     achievement of all students, not process.\n\n  I agree. Amen. That is exactly what we want to try to use as a \nmeasurable fact. But it is only a finding, it is not part of the \noperative language. This is a good idea, and that is exactly what we \nare trying to do, to make sure that we are going to have the students' \nachievement and performance, as we have outlined in the earlier debate. \nManagers' amendment, page 6, says an ``Eligible State'' is a State \nthat:\n\n       . . . waives State statutory or regulatory requirements \n     relating to education while holding local educational \n     agencies or schools within the State that are affected by \n     such waivers accountable for the performance of the students \n     who are affected by such waivers.\n\n  We want to see the whole State, not just the local communities. We \nare able to take what the Senator has put as a finding--and we agree \nand put that into language--and to make sure that the State is going to \nhave compliance, that particular provision says that a State will hold \nlocal districts accountable for results. It does nothing to say that \nthe State will evaluate whether they have done so. It does nothing more \nto ensure that the State's overall waiver plans to achieve student \nachievement. If we have that, we have solved at least the major \nproblem.\n  Look at page 9 in the managers' package, ``Local Application'' shall:\n\n       . . . describe for each school year, specific, measurable, \n     educational goals, which may include progress toward \n     increased school and student performance, for each local \n     educational agency or school affected by the proposed waiver. \n     . . .\n\n  We could solve at least one part of this by instead of saying ``may \ninclude'' saying ``shall include.'' ``Shall include.'' All we are \ntrying to do is to make sure that--while giving the States and local \ncommunities flexibility--the fundamental purpose of Title I is going to \nbe achieved for the reasons that have been illustrated in the very \nimpressive report that has come out in the last 2 days about the \nsuccesses of Title I. We want to make sure when we are providing this, \nthat the principal criterion is going to be student achievement, and \nthat is what we are going to do. The words are used but we do not find \nit applicable, in terms of the statewide program.\n  As I say here on page 9:\n\n       Local application shall describe for each school year \n     specific measurable educational goals which may include \n     progress toward increased school and student performance. . . \n     .\n\n  Isn't this all about the performance of the children? Isn't that what \nwe are attempting to achieve? That is why we are spending the \nresources, to enhance the students' performance. That is what we are \ndoing. As we are prepared to see greater flexibility, we are simply \nsaying: Okay, you get the flexibility, all we are asking for is student \nperformance and achievement. That is what the basic debate on this is.\n  In the managers' package, on page 11 on State waiver approval, it \nsays:\n\n       A State educational agency shall not approve an application \n     for a waiver under this paragraph unless . . . the waiver of \n     Federal statutory or regulatory requirements as described in \n     paragraph (1)(A) will assist the local educational agency or \n     school in reaching its educational goals, particularly goals\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\n     with respect to school and student performance.\n\n  This, again, applies to the LEA rather than the States.\n  Just to sum up, Mr. President, for those who support our particular \namendment, all we are saying is, yes, we will have the flexibility, but \nin giving the flexibility, there is some assurance that there will be \nan improvement in student performance and student achievement, as \nmeasured by the State plan, not by the Federal plan, but by what \nAlabama wants to do or what Massachusetts wants to do or what Vermont \nwants to do. They are setting their plans. All we are saying is, \naccording to your own State plan, that we are going to have measurable \nresults in terms of the performance. That is what this amendment is \nreally about.\n  We have the example which we have gone over in terms of Texas where \nthey have spelled out exactly what they are going to do. It has been \nenormously impressive, and the students have made very significant and \nimportant gains. And that example is being replicated by other \ncommunities. The parents understand it. The parents know what is \nhappening in their particular schools, and they are able to make some \njudgments about it. Mr. President, this is what we are all working \ntowards.\n  I wanted to get back into reviewing, very briefly, the absolutely \nsplendid independent evaluation that has just been released this past \nweek on title I and their conclusions. Those will be valuable for our \nEducation Committee as we are looking over ESEA. They have made some \nvery, very important recommendations, and we ought to be responsive to \nthose.\n  One of their very key elements is to do the evaluation in terms of \nstudent performance. We have that. I will go back into it at another \ntime, Mr. President, but I see my good friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Minnesota, on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 32 To Amendment No. 31\n\n  (Purpose: To preserve accountability for funds under title I of the \n            Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 32 to amendment \n     No. 31.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I object. I prefer to have it read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will read the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 4, after ``determines'' insert ``that the \n     State educational agency is carrying out satisfactorily all \n     of the State educational agency's statutory obligations under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     to secure comprehensive school reform and''.\n       On page 12, line 22, after ``hearing,'' insert ``that such \n     agency is not carrying out satisfactorily all of the agency's \n     statutory obligations under title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 to secure comprehensive \n     school reform or''\n       On page 15, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (F) standards, assessments, components of schoolwide or \n     targeted assistance programs, accountability, or corrective \n     action, under title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, as the requirement relates to local \n     educational agencies and schools;\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nPennsylvania have 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry for a moment. \nCertainly that is fine with me. The pending business is the amendment \nthat I have on the floor; is that correct?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That remains the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Is there objection to the request? If not, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 528 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Louisiana be allowed to speak in debate only for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 280, the Education \nFlexibility Partnership Act, which we have spent most of the afternoon \nspeaking about today, for several reasons.\n  First, this Ed-Flex bill, as we have come to call it, represents a \nvery solid bipartisan effort to provide greater flexibility in our \npublic schools and, hopefully, improvement. Passage now at this early \nstage in this Congress sends a very positive message, I think, to the \nAmerican people that we want to put first things first; we want \neducation to be a priority. We are willing now, with the ordeal of the \ntrial behind us, to work together across party lines for the things \nthat are important to people back home.\n\n  Second, expanding the Ed-Flex program gives every State and school a \nchance to temporarily waive sometimes very restrictive specific Federal \nregulations to help them better meet their new standards and to help \nthem to better utilize the tax dollars that we send to them and that \nthey generate on their own.\n  Thirdly, for its timeliness, I am happy to join this debate because, \nnext Monday, it will be my honor to host Secretary Riley in Louisiana \nfor the first yearly conference on educational excellence in our State, \nas we reach out to develop stronger Federal-State partnership for \nreforms in education. As you know, Mr. President, it takes more than \njust the Federal Government's actions, but it takes our actions, with \nthe States and local governments, to make real these kinds of reforms \nfor the children in our schools. The conference this week in Louisiana \nand this bill will move us closer to that goal.\n  I also support Ed-Flex because it has proven to be effective over the \nlast 4 years. As my colleague from Oregon has so eloquently pointed \nout, these pilot programs have worked, and that is why the bill is \nbefore us today. We know it works. States and local school districts \nunder Ed-Flex have received waivers for several Federal education \nprograms. These waivers will free States and school districts from \nunnecessary regulations that stifle innovation in education, while \nstill ensuring the core principles that have been outlined so clearly; \nspecifically, the civil rights principles will be honored with this \nbill.\n  At the same time, Ed-Flex is voluntary. No State, no school, no \ndistrict has to apply for these waivers, but they will be available \nshould a school or a district choose to apply. And for accountability's \nsake, waivers can be revoked under the current draft of the bill, if \nthe Secretary of the Department of Education determines that these \nwaivers granted have not improved significantly the performance of the \nstudents in that school or that district.\n  We know that the data resulting from certain demonstration States is \nvery encouraging. For instance, in Texas, where this has seen its \ngreatest use, students with Ed-Flex waivers outperform those in \ndistricts without the waivers in the Texas Assessment of Academic \nSkills in reading and math. In Maryland, the Ed-Flex waiver provided \nthe opportunity for that State to provide for one-on-one tutoring in \nearly grades in reading and math, in grades 1 through 5, and in \nlowering the student-teacher ratio from 25 to 1, to 21 to 1. Mr. \nPresident, with a 6-year-old who is in first grade now, let me tell you \nthat those student-teacher ratios at that level are crucial as our \nyoung boys and girls, sons and daughters, learn the skills necessary in \nreading.\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\n That is something I will speak about in a moment. But that is a \nflexibility that this waiver will provide.\n  Oregon has used the waiver authority to simplify its planning and \napplication structure to allow districts to develop one consolidated \nplan that meets all State and Federal requirements.\n  Let me thank the distinguished authors of this bill for including \nlanguage also that is already presented in the bill as drafted that \nwill increase the accountability. Some people are worried that if you \ngrant more freedom, we know that then comes more responsibility, and as \nmore responsibility comes, obviously there is more accountability. We \nwant this bill to hold us all accountable, and through the language \nthat we were able to submit earlier, I think with an additional \namendment that may be acceptable to both sides, that accountability \npiece will be made clear.\n  Let me be quick to say, as I conclude my remarks, that while Ed-Flex \nis a move in the right direction, much more must be done to improve \neducation. We need to be very clear about this bill. It is a good step \nin the right direction. It tries to reduce bureaucracy, reduce \nregulation, give greater flexibility; but it is only one step. We need \nto do other things.\n  I urge this Congress, my colleagues on both sides, to support \ninitiatives to decrease class size, particularly in the early grades. \nLet me share with you an alarming statistic from Louisiana that my \nacting superintendent and staff shared with me earlier. In the recent \ntest of third graders in Orleans Parish in the basic reading test, 72 \npercent of the students failed their basic proficiency in reading at \nthat level. In a parish outside of Orleans, a more suburban parish that \nis still struggling and growing, it was 14 percent. I think 14 percent \nis too high; I think 72 percent is tragic. We need to do everything we \ncan to reduce class size in those early years--kindergarten, first, \nsecond and third grade--so we can prevent scores like this from being a \nreality.\n  So I urge that we pass additional amendments to decrease class size \nand modernize our school buildings so that our children believe what we \nsay when we say they are important. We want them in an atmosphere to \nlearn and not in buildings that are falling down around them, with \nroofs that are leaking and situations that are unsafe. I think the \nFederal Government has an obligation to help spend some of our dollars \nin that regard, in cost-effective ways.\n\n  We, as a Nation, face hundreds of issues that affect millions of \nlives every day, but no single issue is as important to our Nation's \nfuture as education and the challenges that our children face in the \nnext century.\n  I was, as you were, Mr. President, a proud author of our pay raise \nincrease for the military. We have a real problem, as the Senator \nknows, with our readiness in the military forces because the economy is \nso good. It is hard for us to maintain this voluntary, well-qualified \nactive force. Why? Because the private sector competes.\n  Let me say, in Louisiana a beginning teacher makes $14,000, and in \nsome of our parishes up to $24,000. That is bad enough, but even after \nteaching 15 or 20 years, with a good record, the salaries are not that \nmuch higher, unfortunately. Our State is doing what it can in that \nregard, but if we can come together and pass $10 billion additionally \nfor the military, in terms of getting our troops ready for the new \nthreats of the future, we most certainly can put our money where our \nmouth is and pass Ed-Flex and look forward to school construction and \nclass size reduction, so that we can prepare our children for the \nthreats that face them if they are not technologically literate, if \nthey don't read well and communicate well. Our whole Nation will be at \nrisk.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues in support of this important piece \nof legislation. I urge my colleagues to consider that this is a step in \nthe right direction, but we need to do so much more. I hope we can make \ngood progress in this Congress on these important issues. Thank you, \nMr. President.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask that I might speak about the \namendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. This is \nfor debate only.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Then the Senator would be recognized for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't know whether we are going to \nreach agreement on this amendment or not. If we do, that is great. If \nwe don't, then I will come back to these points again and debate it. I \nwould like colleagues to know what is at issue here because I think \nthis amendment goes to the very essence of accountability.\n  Mr. President, I have a couple of letters and talking points from the \nleadership conference on civil rights that I want to briefly mention to \ncolleagues. Let me just start out and read a little bit here.\n\n       The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has made the \n     continuation of the standards-based reform adopted in title I \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act a top priority \n     in the 106th Congress. In order to protect these reforms, we \n     urge you to support amendments offered by Senators Kennedy, \n     Reed, Dodd and Wellstone to the Ed-Flexibility Partnership \n     Act that are urgently needed to protect the opportunities of \n     economically disadvantaged children, children of color, \n     children with disabilities, and other children who need the \n     law's protection.\n\n  Next paragraph:\n\n       While the stated purposes of S. 280 are to advance the \n     efforts to achieve comprehensive school reform, the bill as \n     reported by committee does not assure that States will \n     qualify for waivers only if they can demonstrate that they \n     have complied with a strong record of reform in the 5 years \n     since Congress with strong bipartisan majorities adopted \n     standards-based reform as national policy in title I of the \n     ESEA, nor does S. 280 assure that States once having achieved \n     Ex-Flex status will not excuse local school authorities from \n     fundamental requirements of title I, such as maintaining high \n     quality teaching staffs and offering afterschool and summer \n     programs for children who need them.\n\n  That is it. That is what this amendment says. This amendment is \nreally simple, and my colleagues have stated in spirit that they \nsupport it. This amendment simply says that we take the core \nrequirements, and we make sure that the core requirements, the \nfundamental requirements of title I, such as maintaining high quality \nteaching staffs, or offering afterschool and summer programs for \nchildren who need them, that no local school authority can be excused \nfrom meeting these standards.\n  Let me again just mention what we are talking about. The requirement \nthat title I students be taught by highly qualified professional \nstaff--who can be opposed to that? The requirement that LEAs hold \nschools accountable for making substantial annual progress toward \ngetting all students, particularly low-income and limited-English-\nproficient students, to meet the high standards. Who can be opposed to \nthat? The requirement that schools provide timely and effective \nindividual assistance for students who are farthest behind; and, \nfinally--this is it--the requirement that funded vocational programs \nprovide broad educational and work experience rather than narrow job \ntraining. That also applies.\n  All this amendment says is that we will make it crystal clear by \nmaking sure that we will have flexibility with accountability, that no \nState will provide a waiver to a school district from the core \nrequirements of title I.\n  My colleague, Senator Wyden, has said to me that he agrees with that. \nI am hoping that my colleague, Senator Jeffords, will agree.\n  That is the reason for this letter by the Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights. The reason that I have been out here on the floor for \nhours is twofold. One, I think we ought to be focusing on what we can \nreally do for children that will make a real difference. This piece of \nlegislation won't. But the second is\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\nI don't want to turn the clock backwards. I don't want to go back to \npre-title I, 35 years of good history. I don't want us to essentially \nsay that we as a Federal Government, we as a national community are \ngoing to abandon poor children, that we are going to now say for the \nfirst time that we are going to allow a State to allow a school \ndistrict to exempt itself from the core requirements of good teachers, \nhigh standards, and measurement of results.\n\n  My colleagues want to argue that there is already language in the \nbill that says this. I don't think so. The people who I think have been \ninvolved with this, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights for \nyears, have put a lot of sweat and tears into making sure that there \nare educational opportunities for disadvantaged children, low-income \nchildren, children of color. They are very worried about the lack of \naccountability. This amendment is specific. It says let's make sure \nthat we keep this accountability.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that the amendment will be accepted. I \nguess that we will wait and see. I will have other supporting evidence, \nif we go into a debate. I guess we are now negotiating on this \namendment. But it is really, I mean, simple. There are a couple of \nthings. The States have to be in compliance with title I. Who could \nargue that we would be interested in giving States flexibility, \nexemptions and all the rest, if they are not in compliance with title \nI?\n  The second thing the amendment says is no State should be able to \nprovide a waiver to a local school authority from these basic core \nvalues, the core mission of title I. And what are these requirements? \nThat these students be taught by highly qualified professional staff, \nthat schools be held accountable to making annual progress toward \nhelping students, including students with limited English proficiency, \nthat the schools provide timely assistance to those kids who need it \nthe most. How can anybody oppose this?\n  If you do not want to have accountability, and you basically want to \ngut part of what title I has been all about for all of these years, a \nprogram that, as Senator Kennedy has said, worked very well, go ahead \nand do it. Otherwise, this amendment should be accepted.\n  I will wait, for we will continue to talk, and I hope that there will \nbe support for this.\n  Mr. President, I have had a chance to speak a long time today. So I \nyield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that there be 15 minutes in \norder prior to the motion to table the pending amendment, No. 32, with \n5 minutes under the control of Senator Jeffords, myself, and 10 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Wellstone, and that no amendments be in \norder prior to the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I further ask that following that vote, if the \namendment is tabled, the only remaining amendments in order this \nevening be an amendment by Senator Wellstone regarding 75 percent and \nan amendment by Senator Kennedy regarding accountability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous agreement, the Senator from Minnesota now has up \nto 10 minutes for debate, the Senator from Vermont has 5 minutes for \ndebate under his control.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I ask my colleague, I assume he \nwould want me to take my time and then finish up; is that correct? Is \nthat the way he would like to do it?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would just as soon speak now.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will take my 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an amendment by Senator \nWellstone. I will give you a little history. This bill was voted out of \ncommittee earlier this year. It was basically the same amendment which \nwas passed out of the committee unanimously last year--I am sorry, with \none objection last year. It is generally agreed to. However, there are \nsome areas that some Members wanted to address. I rise in opposition \nand I will move to table the pending Wellstone amendment.\n  This issue was addressed in the managers' amendment package by \nincluding the eligibility of the State as a condition for approval and \nconsideration. Also, under the eligibility requirement, States must \nhave the very standards and assessments as laid out in title I. SEAs \nare prohibited from waiving statewide requirements for local school \ndistricts. And, finally, the States are required to implement \ncorrective action pursuant to title I.\n  Therefore, we believe it is redundant and unnecessary. At the \nappropriate time I will move to table.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has yielded back all \nthe remainder of his time. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all let me say I very much \nhope that there will be strong support for this amendment I have \nintroduced along with Senator Kennedy. If I could just make this \nrequest of my colleagues--and I will return to the letter from the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights in a moment--I don't know why in \nthe world we don't just get away from the paper and the words, and why \nwe do not accept an amendment that basically says we will do what we \nsay we will do. What in the world can be the basis of the opposition to \nthis amendment?\n  This is an amendment that is strongly supported by the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights. This is an amendment that speaks to, \nreally, their central fear about this legislation in its present form. \nThis is an amendment that makes it crystal clear, once again, that the \nmission of title I, an important mission, which is the improvement of \neducational opportunities for poor children, will not be weakened.\n  This is an amendment which says that when it comes to the core \nrequirements of title I, when it comes to the essence of what this \nprogram is about, when it comes to the essence of accountability, no \nState will be allowed to exempt any school district from these core \nrequirements.\n  We want to make sure that, in every school district in this country, \ntitle I students will be taught by highly qualified professional staff. \nWe want to make sure that schools are accountable for making \nsubstantial annual progress. We want to make sure that students, low-\nincome students and students with limited English proficiency, meet \nthese standards. We want to make sure that schools provide timely and \neffective individual instruction for students who are farthest behind. \nWe want to make sure there is specific language. This is the request of \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. This is the request of \npeople who have given their lives to title I in this legislation, that \nwe have specific language that makes it clear that no State will allow \nany school district to be exempt from these core requirements, the core \ncomponents of title I.\n  You say you want to do this but you don't want to support an \namendment that makes it clear that we will do this. My question is, Why \nnot? In all due respect, I may be the only vote against this \nlegislation. I know I won't be the only vote for this amendment. I \nthink there will be a strong vote for this amendment. But in all due \nrespect, if you are not willing to support this amendment which goes to \nthe core of accountability, then you are doing some serious damage to \ntitle I, to the title I mission. This piece of legislation will go too \nlong a way towards abandoning a national commitment to poor children.\n  Now, for the first time ever, we are saying it will be possible for a \nState to\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\ngive a school district an exemption from the basic core requirements of \ntitle I--from the basic core requirements. And this amendment just asks \nyou to support what it is you say you are for.\n  If you want to go toward block grants, and if you want to go toward \nmoving us away from this mission, and you want to go toward weakening \naccountability, then go ahead and vote to table this amendment. But I \ncertainly hope a majority of Senators will not do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for a question or yield \ntime to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What we are effectively doing under the existing \nproposal in Ed-Flex is focusing attention on needy children, but there \nare some specific guarantees under title I; for example, well-qualified \nteachers to ensure that we are going to seek the academic enhancement \nand achievement of the children. That is one example. There are a \nseries of those. As I understand the Senator's amendment, without the \nSenator's amendment, they will be able to waive those as well.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This really has nothing to do with paperwork at all. We \nhave already decided that there are going to be other kinds of \nsafeguards to make sure that the funding is focused in terms of the \nneedy students, but there are some specific guarantees that have been \nwritten in there, the ones that I have said. The purpose of the \nWellstone amendment is to give assurance that those particular \nguarantees will not be waived for the neediest children, as I \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My colleague from Massachusetts is absolutely correct, \nand I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, I will list these other \ncore requirements. One of them has to do with title I students, that \nthey be taught by highly qualified professional staff.\n  Another one is that the LEAs hold schools accountable for making \nsubstantial annual progress toward getting all students, particularly \nlow-income students and limited-English-proficient students, to meet \nthe same high standards, and the requirement that schools provide \ntimely and effective individual assistance for students who are \nfarthest behind.\n  I say to my colleague, the reason that the Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights feels so strongly about this amendment and the reason my \ncolleague from Massachusetts does, is we know this goes to the very \nmission of title I. Why in the world would we not want to have this \naccountability built into this legislation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is entirely different than what we talked about in \nthe general Ed-Flex where we had requirements that, for example, you \ncould have a studentwide utilization of resources if it was 50 percent \npoor, and then if it went down to 45, we said, OK; 40, maybe yes. Those \nwere the general kinds of waivers. But the point that the Senator from \nMinnesota is trying to say is those specific criteria which have been \nfound by educators who have really spent their lifetime focusing on the \nneeds of the neediest children, such as qualified teachers and some \ncommonsense protections, effectively could be waived if the Senator's \namendment is not agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 2 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely correct, and this is why I speak with some indignation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for one more brief comment? I \ndon't want to interrupt the thought line, but I have just been informed \nby the Administration that they support the Wellstone amendment and \nbelieve it is consistent with the Statement of Administration Policy. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement by the \nAdministration in support of the Wellstone amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n         s. 280--education flexibility partnership Act of 1999\n\n       The Administration has long supported the concept of \n     expanding ed-flex demonstration authority to permit all \n     States to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements \n     of Federal education programs in a manner that will promote \n     high standards and accountability for results, coupled with \n     increased flexibility for States and local school districts \n     to achieve those results. The Administration supports \n     amendments designed to: 1) ensure that State waivers of \n     Federal requirements result in improved student achievement; \n     and 2) enhance parental involvement.\n       In order to ensure consistency between ed-flex authority \n     and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (ESEA), which will be undergoing reauthorization this year, \n     the Administration urges Congress to sunset this legislation \n     upon enactment of the ESEA.\n       The Administration strongly supports an amendment that is \n     expected to be offered to S. 280 that would implement the \n     President's proposal for a long-term extension of the one-\n     year authority to help school districts reduce class size in \n     the early grades, which the Congress approved last year on a \n     bipartisan basis. In order to hire qualified teachers, \n     arrange for additional classrooms, and take other steps that \n     are necessary to reduce class size, school districts need to \n     know, as soon as possible, that the Congress intends to \n     support this initiative for more than one year.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, this is not on the whole question of funds and, \nfrankly, I have been worried about the dilution of funds. I have an \namendment that will be accepted tonight that says schools with over 75 \npercent low-income children have first priority to funds. And I say \nthis to my colleague from Vermont, I really speak now with some sadness \nbecause he is going to move to table this because this goes to not \ntechnical issues, not formula, this goes to the very essence of what \ntitle I is about. This goes to the core requirements, the core mission, \nthe core accountability, and you now have a piece of legislation that \ntosses that overboard.\n  You are overturning 35 years of important history. You are \noverturning 35 years of history of a commitment on the part of our \nNational Government to poor children in America. You are overturning \nthe hard work of many women and men who have written a title I program \nwith accountability that has really worked well for children. That is \nwhy the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is so strongly in favor \nof this amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against this motion to table this \namendment. This is the central accountability amendment. If this \namendment does not pass, we do not have the accountability that has \nbeen so important to the success of title I.\n  I yield back the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back on both sides.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The pending business is the \nsubstitute of the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is my understanding that two amendments would be in \norder, if offered--the Kennedy amendment and a Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Those are the two \npending amendments that will be agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 15, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (F) serving eligible school attendance areas in rank order \n     under section 1113(a)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965;\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment simply requires that \nschools with over a 75-percent low-income student population must \nreceive funds first, as a matter of priority--first, in terms of the \nallocation of the title I money--and that those neediest schools with a \npopulation of low-income students over 75 percent would have first \npriority in receiving those funds.\n  It is accepted by both sides. I thank my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Wyden, and Senator Frist, as well.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. HAGEL. The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The amendment (No. 33) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 34 to Amendment No. 31\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that increased flexibility leads to improved \n                          student achievement)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 34 to amendment No. 31.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 21, strike ``and'' after the semicolon.\n       On page 7, line 24, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       On page 7, after line 24, insert the following:\n       (v) a description of how the State educational agency will \n     evaluate (consistent with the requirements of title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965), the \n     performance of students in the schools and local educational \n     agencies affected by the waivers.\n       On page 9, line 22, strike ``which may include progress \n     toward'' increased school and student performance.\n       On page 11, line 17, insert ``in accordance with the \n     evaluation requirement described in paragraph (3)(A)(v),'' \n     before ``and shall''.\n       On page 12, line 14, before the period insert ``, and has \n     improved student performance''.\n       On page 16, line 9, insert ``and goals'' after ``desired \n     results''.\n       On page 16, lines 10 and 11, strike ``subsection \n     (a)(4)(A)(ii)'' and insert ``clauses (ii) and (iii) of \n     subsection (a)(4)(A), respectively''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment of the Senate's \ntime. We had a good opportunity during the course of the afternoon to \ntalk about the student performance. We have worked out language which I \nthink responds certainly to my concerns and, hopefully, is consistent \nwith what Senator Frist and Senator Jeffords were doing. Now the States \nwill be able to receive Ed-Flex, but they will also--in the \napplication, there will be an indication about what their expectation \nin the State is in terms of the students' performance, consistent with \nwhat the overall State plan is to enhance academic achievement. It also \nwill take in student performance after 5 years, should there be the \nrequest for the continuation of this legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues and friends. I think we really have the best of \nall worlds here. I am grateful to Senator Jeffords and Senator Frist \nfor working this through.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think the amendment is a helpful \naddition to the bill. We appreciate the efforts of Senator Kennedy and \nare happy to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The amendment (No. 34) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, under the Wellstone and Kennedy amendments, \nwould Michigan be able to continue their current Ed-Flex authority?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, Michigan would be able to continue its current Ed-\nFlex plans.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In January, 1998, Michigan moved to lower the poverty \nthreshold statewide from the 50 percent poverty level in title I to 35 \npercent. Would either the Wellstone or Kennedy amendment prohibit \nMichigan from continuing to allow these waivers under Ed-Flex that is \nimproving reform in the affected schools?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No.\n  Mr. President, we have made some progress today. We are looking \nforward to having some debate on the Bingaman amendments tomorrow, \nfollowed by my friend and colleague, Senator Kerry. We will indicate to \nthe membership that we will tentatively get started sometime around 11, \nand we will let the floor managers know at least in what order we will \nwant to offer our amendments.\n  Obviously, they have their own rights. But we will try to keep them \nas fully informed as possible so that we can all be as prepared on \nthese amendments as possible.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and Senator from \nMassachusetts. I deeply appreciate the cooperation we have had today. \nWe moved along well. We are well on our way. I look forward to seeing \nthe wonderful cooperation that we will have as we proceed on this bill. \nI look forward to seeing you all again in the morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2201-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2201-S2202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Educational \nFlexibility Partnership Act, the Ed-Flex program that has been debated \nhere today. I congratulate Senator Frist and Senator Jeffords for their \nwork on this bill of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Ed-Flex does the important work of granting waivers of certain \nstatutory and regulatory requirements so that local schools can \nimplement creative programs that are custom-tailored to the needs of \ntheir kids and allows some State education agencies to waive State \nrequirements along with Federal mandates so that local schools can \ninnovate effectively.\n  I think this is an extremely important program. We have been saying \nfor some period of time that too much of education is directed out of \nWashington, that problems in education are not solved in Washington as \nmuch as they are at the local level. If we can allow people to have the \nflexibility in Kansas, Nebraska, Vermont, Tennessee, Texas or \nCalifornia to solve their education problems with these dollars, they \nwill get more education done, and they will have more effective \neducation done than if we direct it out of Washington. It is a basic \npremise. It works. It has worked on a number of programs. We allowed \nthis to take place in welfare reform. We had a number of different \nexperiments on welfare reform that led welfare rates to decline 50 \npercent. We solve it in Kansas differently than they solve it in other \nStates. It worked. Education--we have a problem. But it is not a \nuniform problem that you can say, OK, if we just do this and this and \nthis all across the Nation with programs, the problem is solved. It \ndoesn't work that way. We have different educational needs in different \nplaces.\n  Ed-Flex is tried and true as a concept. It is a needed concept in \neducation, because we need more flexibility to get these dollars into \nthe classroom than people back here deciding how to spend it.\n  I might note that Ed-Flex is already in place in 12 States, including \nmy home State of Kansas. Schools there have already submitted 43 waiver \nrequests in an effort to better serve the unique needs of Kansas \nstudents. At this point, no waiver has been rejected. Around two dozen \nrequests have already been granted, and others are pending. I would \nencourage the Department of Education to expedite those requests.\n\n  That speech and that point that I just gave sounds very reminiscent \nof a point that I made in 1995 about waivers that were being granted on \nwelfare reform and asking that those be sped up so that States could \nsolve the problem. We are at the same point in time with education. \nLet's let the States have the resources and have them solve the \nproblem.\n  Kansas schools have used Ed-Flex for many reasons. One school \ndistrict received a waiver in order to better distribute title I funds \nto the neediest students. Leavenworth schools requested a waiver to \nprovide an all-day kindergarten class and preschool programs to better \nserve the needs of children of parents that are at Fort Leavenworth at \nthe military facility. Emporia used an Ed-Flex waiver to implement new \nliteracy programs in an intensive summer school program. That fit the \nneeds and what we had for needs in Emporia. The list goes on.\n  These are all very different programs that address different needs. \nBut that is just the point. Schools need this flexibility. We need \neducation decisions made in Emporia, in Fort Leavenworth, in Topeka, \nand in Manhattan--not in Washington for Kansas. We need it made there. \nAnd the people there care for the students. They look in their eyes \nevery day. They can say, ``We need this program here.'' What can we \ntell them in Washington? No. You don't need that program. What you need \nis something else when we don't even look into the eyes of that same \nchild. People here in the Washington bureaucracy have great desires to \nhelp that child, but the person who is right there closest is the one \nwho can best determine what that child needs. This is the sort of \nprogram that allows that to take place. Schools need that sort of \nflexibility.\n  While Ed-Flex is an important first step, there are other steps that \nwe need to take as well. If we are going to make progress toward \nimproving our schools, we need to give the States and communities far \nmore flexibility and empower them to make decisions with what is best \nfor their schoolchildren. As important as it is to make waivers to \nFederal regulations available, frankly, I believe it would be better if \nwe would roll back those regulations altogether and provide the \nresources to Kansas and to the school districts, and say to them, ``You \nfigure out how best to educate these students.'' Believe me. They will \ncome up with the ideas to do it. They will implement them, and they \nwill get them done without the regulation here.\n  I don't think anybody in this Chamber, or in this town, should think \nthat somebody in Emporia, KS, doesn't care greatly about how that child \nis educated and won't do the absolute best they can to make sure that \nchild is educated well.\n  We need to empower them. We need to empower the parents, the \nteachers, the school boards, the communities over the government \nbureaucracy. That is why I will vote in favor of the Ed-Flexibility \nAct. I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I say let's not stop here. This is where we started with welfare \nreform--providing these waivers. Ultimately, when we gave the program \nto the States and the resources to the State, they cut the welfare \ndependency in half and had people who were on welfare being thankful \nthat they are now out on the job and they are encouraged about that. \nWhy don't we try that with education, letting the States and the locals \ndecide this? We will get more for every education dollar that we put \nout there. And, more importantly, our students will be better, and they \nwill achieve higher test scores in the key areas that they are not \ndoing today.\n  Mr. President, one other point: I think we have finally started down \nthe road of making some real reforms in education, and reforms that I \nthink people have been afraid that we are going to dictate out of \nWashington. This, to me, is a positive step forward--letting the local \nschool districts start to decide on how they can implement those \nreforms. We have a lot of bright students across this country who need \na system that is as bright as that are to challenge them and help them \nmove forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, I very recently traveled to Israel. It had \nbeen several years since my last visit, and I expected this year we \nwould bring some\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\nimportant measures to the Senate floor. The timeline on the Oslo \naccords expires in May, and Arafat has threatened to unilaterally \ndeclare an independent state. The supplemental appropriations for the \nWye River accords will soon be before us, and the timetable on the \nJerusalem Embassy Act requires that the President report to the \nCongress why the United States Embassy has not been set up in Israel's \ncapital city, Jerusalem. I learned a great deal during the week and I \nrise today to share a few simple thoughts regarding what I saw and what \nwent through my mind as the week in Israel unfolded.\n  Let me begin with the question that is on my mind today: How is it \npossible to engage in peace negotiations with people who maintain the \nright to obliterate you, who are filled with hatred toward you, and who \nharbor the dream of one day destroying your homeland? Peace is a matter \nof the heart. I believe in the depths of every person's heart is a \ndesire to live in peace. But what I saw, which was the outcome of the \nPalestinian Authority rule, convinced me that their hearts and minds \nare set on other goals. The Palestinian leadership does not want peace. \nThey want, first, their own state which they can control with total \npower. Then they want to use that state to eliminate the State of \nIsrael.\n  Let's be clear. The peace process, to be meaningful, must be about \nmore than rules and laws and lines on a map. We can reach a short-term \nagreement on these points, but if the Palestinian leadership fails to \nabandon incitement of hatred, persecution, and terrorism, then we are \nall dreaming, only dreaming, and our President's behavior must be \nlabeled foolish appeasement. There will not be peace until hearts and \nminds are changed, and we must focus our attention on these issues.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House \nare aware of the promotion of hatred contained in the Palestinian \nmedia, and more significantly in the Palestinian schoolbooks. Let me \nprovide some examples.\n  This is a picture that was taken off of Palestinian Authority-\ncontrolled television. It is a picture of a young girl, probably 6 or 7 \nyears old. This is a young girl singing into a microphone. She is on a \ntelevision show that would be what we would refer to as kind of a \nMickey Mouse Club type of show that would be shown to children by the \nPalestinian Authority. I want to read to you what this little girl is \nsinging. Again, this is a program that was produced by the people who \nare sitting across the table from you, supposedly negotiating peace. \nThis is what the little girl is singing:\n\n       When I wander into the entrance of Jerusalem,\n       I'll turn into a suicide warrior in battledress,\n       In battledress. In battledress.\n\n  There is no way I can convey to you the emotion of actually seeing \nthat scene on television. There is no way I can put the emotion into \nwhat she was expressing and the emotion that she was expressing as she \nsang those words. And after her song, she got an ovation from her \nclassmates and from her teacher.\n  This focuses us on the fundamental difference in approach between the \nPalestinians and the Israelis. I have a grandson about that age, about \nthe age of that little girl. How would I feel if he were being taught \nhatred in school? If he were being taught hatred on television, how \nwould I feel? How would you feel if your Government was teaching your \nchildren to hate? Could you conclude that they were serious about long-\nterm peace with their neighbors?\n  I also have some examples from Palestinian textbooks for a third-\ngrade grammar lesson. Here is the task: ``Complete the following blank \nspaces with the appropriate word.'' And the sentence is, ``The Zionist \nenemy blank civilians with its aircraft.'' The correct answer is, ``The \nZionist enemy attacked civilians with its aircraft.''\n  For seventh graders: ``Answer the following question: Why do the Jews \nhate Muslim unity and want to cause division among them? Give an \nexample of the evil attempts of the Jews, from events happening \ntoday.'' These are from Palestinian textbooks today.\n  One would expect, rather than focus on hatred, if they were serious \nabout peace, they would focus on how the two peoples are working to \nlive side by side. A history book for 12th graders published only last \nsummer teaches: ``The clearest examples of racist belief and racial \ndiscrimination in the world are Nazism and Zionism.''\n  To see this taking place today is chilling. If you can, think about \nit in the context of being in Israel and being briefed by a member of \nthe Government with respect to what is happening in what they refer to \nas the anti-incitement committee, which was set up by the Wye \nAgreement. To be sitting there and seeing this, I must say to you, was \nchilling. I found it to be extremely chilling.\n  While the Government of Israel makes good-faith efforts to come to a \npeace agreement, the Palestinian Authority teaches children hatred. \nThis causes me to ask, How can peace be obtained when the children are \nbeing taught hatred?\n  Let me share another story. I attended Shabbat dinner at the home of \nSaul and Wendy Singer in Jerusalem. Saul worked on my staff for 7 years \nbefore moving with his wife to Israel. They just had their second \nchild, a girl named Tamar. Wendy told the story of the day she was \nchecking out of the hospital in Jerusalem, 2 days after giving birth. \nIn a very ordinary and matter of fact way, the hospital gave her the \nnecessities for bringing home a newborn baby. In addition to providing \nfor diapers and other things we would expect, she was handed a gas mask \nfor her baby. It is actually a tent which you put your baby under in \ncase of a chemical weapons attack.\n  In Israel, this preparation is routine. Everyone in Israel knows to \nhave a gas mask ready. It just becomes a part of the craziness of \neveryday life. But when you bring home a newborn baby, when you bring \nhome your baby and you get the chemical weapons tent at the hospital, \nthen you realize how unordinary life is in Israel today. You realize \nthat you are really simply struggling for a normal life, hoping for \npeace and security, praying to God, while actually living in a war \nzone.\n  I had another profound meeting during this week. I met one evening \nprivately--secretly--with Arabs who were being persecuted for their \nChristian faith. I met with about 10 Palestinian Christians. I will \ntell you just one of their stories, but I will change some of the \ndetails to protect the person I am describing.\n  I remember an energetic man, in his early 40s, at the end of the \ntable. I remember him because he seemed so full of life and love. He \nhad a great smile on his face and displayed a wonderful sense of humor. \nI say this was memorable because, frankly, after hearing what he had \nbeen through, I do not know if I could express the sense of peace and \nlove he did. This is his story.\n  He had many children and very little money. He converted to \nChristianity in 1993. He clearly loved God, and he loved to tell people \nabout his conversion. He described to me how in 1997, the Palestinian \nAuthority asked him to come to the police station for questioning. When \nhe arrived, he was immediately arrested and detained on charges of \nselling land to Jews. He denied this charge, since he was very poor and \nowned no land. He was beaten. He was hung from the ceiling by his hands \nfor many hours. He showed me what I just said. He showed me how his \nhands were tied behind his back and then raised from the floor and hung \nthat way for many, many hours.\n  After 2 weeks, he was transferred to a larger prison where he was \nheld for 8 months without trial. He was released in February 1998, \nafter his family borrowed thousands of dollars to pay off the local \nauthorities. And even though he is free, they are keeping his father in \nprison. They believe it is for his son's beliefs. He feels his father \nis being held hostage to prevent him from talking with people about his \nfaith. Needless to say, these Christians met with me at considerable \nrisk. They conveyed to me a message of fear and desperation. But their \nmere presence in the room with me demonstrated their hope, and it also \ncaused me to ask, how can the people of Israel find peace with the \nPalestinian Authority while the Palestinian Authority engages in \ncoercion and torture based upon religious beliefs?\n  I also met with the parents of American children killed by \nPalestinian terrorists. In this meeting, I was struck by the courage \ndisplayed by these families after suffering the tremendous loss\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nof a child brutally murdered. These families told me of the hopes and \ndreams they had for their children. I couldn't help thinking about my \nown. My daughter, Debbie, traveled with me on this trip. She was in the \nroom as these stories of brutality and murder were related. There was \nscarcely a dry eye in the room.\n  I am sure Debbie was thinking about her three little boys, ages 14, \n11 and 5. We were moved by the comments made by the parents as they \ndescribed to us what had happened.\n  I understand that the Palestinian Authority knows a great deal about \nthese murderers, but they are not being punished. Some of them have \ngone to trial and were sentenced, but we don't know if they remain in \nprison. I was told that we know some have been released.\n  There are reports that the Palestinian Authority allows them to leave \nprison each day and return in the evening--like free room and board \nmore than like prison. I was also presented with stories of the \nlionization of these murderers in the press and again in the \nclassrooms. Try to imagine how you would feel, try to imagine what \nwould be going through your mind when you are dealing with the grief of \nthe loss of your child. You know who is responsible. You know they know \nwho is responsible. You saw them go on trial. You saw them then \nreleased. You have to ask yourself, what are we going through this \npeace process for?\n  I would like to mention one story of many that I heard. Mrs. Dosberg \nsat directly across the table from me. When she told us of the loss of \nher daughter and son-in-law, the lesson of these murders became so \nclear--we must fight terror and we cannot back off. Mrs. Dosberg's \nfamily, her daughter, American son-in-law, and their 9-month-old \ndaughter attended a wedding in central Israel on June 9, 1996. They \ndecided not to bring their 2-year-old daughter along. Thank God. On the \nway home from the wedding they were stopped by Palestinian terrorists \nand killed in a so-called drive-by shooting. Fifty bullets were found \nto have been used in this murder, and yet, by some miracle, the baby \nsurvived. Even with a crime this gross, the Palestinian Authority did \nnot arrest everyone involved or suspected in the shooting. One of those \nwho remained free, it is believed, later took part in the bombing of \nthe Apropos Cafe, killing many others.\n\n  Another suspected killer, according to the Israeli Justice Ministry, \nwas under arrest but given permission to come and go as he pleases from \nprison.\n  Mohammed Dief, another suspected Palestinian terrorist, took part in \nthe murder of two other Americans, at two different times, according to \nthe mothers with whom I spoke. Mrs. Sharon Weinstock lost her 19-year-\nold son in a drive-by shooting masterminded by Dief. And only a year \nlater, Mrs. Wachsman told me of the kidnap-murder of their son, also \nbelieved to have been planned by Dief.\n  I am told Mohammed Dief remains a free man today. The obvious \nlesson--terrorists kill and those who are not jailed remain free to \nkill and to kill again thanks to the Palestinian Authority.\n  How would I feel in their place? I couldn't keep the thought from my \nmind, as I listened. If I had lost a child and knew that the murderer \nor accomplices were on the loose, how would I feel? And if I knew the \nkiller remained free to kill other people's children, how would I feel? \nIt is so hard, hard to even consider, but I do know that I left there \ncommitted to doing whatever I could to help each of those families.\n  Once again, I began to better understand the way the Palestinian \nAuthority leadership was approaching peace. How can one find peace with \npeople who do not condemn terrorism? Mr. President, how is it possible \nto engage in peace negotiations with people who want to teach their \nchildren to die in a holy war against you? How is it possible to engage \nin peace negotiations with people who persecute those of other faiths? \nHow is it possible to engage in peace negotiations with people who keep \nterrorists on the loose to wreak havoc and evil against you and praise \nthem for heroism?\n  Today the Israeli people are exhausted by 50 years of violence \nagainst their homes and families, of sending their sons and daughters \ninto the army, and they dream of a promised peace now. This is our hope \nand our dream as well. But we must not get confused. History is replete \nwith examples of compromises which bring terror and destroy dreams.\n  In the United States, many people seem to think that if we do not \nconfront these obstacles to peace and if we look the other way, then we \nwill be able to come to an agreement. The reality, however, is just the \nopposite. If we do not acknowledge the attitudes and acts of those at \nthe peace table, then the peace process is already over, and we just \nwon't admit it.\n  In other words, the surest way to kill the peace process is to avoid \nconfrontation, to fear upsetting a belligerent force and to avoid \naddressing incitement, violence, persecution and terrorism. The only \nway to keep the peace process alive is to focus on truth, freedom, \nsecurity and justice.\n  Israeli efforts, to date, have sought to keep the peace process \nalive, improve security during the negotiating process, and obtain \nreciprocity as a vital element of implementation.\n  The process remains alive, but terrorism continues and is exalted by \nmany in the Palestinian Authority, and reciprocity does not exist. The \nUnited States role has been to seek the middle ground. Unfortunately, \nthis only rewards those willing to go to new extremes.\n  The middle ground between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman \nArafat is not halfway between the two. The United States must not \nengage in moral equivocation. We must not shy away from holding Arafat \nresponsible for acts of violence, incitement and persecution.\n  The United States must demonstrate principled leadership and end the \nappeasement that perpetuates the cycle of violence. The peace process \ncan only work when leaders uphold their agreements and answer to the \npeople, and the United States remains a vigilant defender of the \nprinciples which bind us to Israel: freedom, democracy, and the rule of \nlaw.\n  What should we do? I believe there are three things. First, we should \ninsist upon the strict adherence to Oslo and the reciprocity codified \nat Wye. The purpose of the Wye accord was at long last to force the \nPalestinians to comply with commitments before further territory would \nbe turned over.\n  So at Wye, Israel agreed only to turn over territory in phases, in \nwhich it could verify Palestinian compliance at each and every step. In \nthe first phase, Israel completed its redeployment after the \nPalestinian Authority completed its tasks. In phase 2, the Palestinians \ndid not meet all their obligations and, therefore, Israel has not yet \nturned over the additional land. Reciprocity makes no sense unless it \nis based upon this formulation. Once Israel has ceded territory, it is \nunlikely it ever could recover it. The Palestinians, on the other hand, \ncan turn on and off their promises. In fact, this is exactly what they \nhave done.\n  Second, we should stop paying Arafat. Any funds provided to the \nPalestinian people should continue to go through private voluntary \norganizations. We should also monitor much more closely the rampant \ncorruption and mismanagement of funds provided currently.\n  And third, we must aggressively seek the bringing to justice of \nPalestinian terrorists who killed American citizens. I am told that our \nJustice Department can do a better job here, that they have a great \ndeal of information on the murderers of the Americans who are free in \nthe Palestinian areas and, indeed, can make some requests for \nindictments. It is time to do this. Let's put the needs of the American \nfamilies and other victims' families over the needs of those engaging \nin or supporting terrorism.\n  Mr. President, these are very basic principles. I am not discussing \ntoday the intricacies of the peace process, U.S. funding, embassies, or \nany other number of issues we will be discussing this year in the \nSenate. We need to focus on a more fundamental level first. And I hope \nthat this message will be heard at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  What I mean when I say this is that I hope the President will hear \nthe message. I say this from a standpoint not of arrogance, not of \nconfrontation, and I do not mean it in a political way. I just hope \nthat the President will listen\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\nand take another look at what he and his foreign policy team are trying \nto force the Israeli Government to do.\n  There cannot be peace until there is a change of heart. I returned \nfrom this trip with a newfound concern for the future of Israel. I saw \nexamples of incitement. I heard examples of persecution and hatred \nbeing taught throughout Palestinian society by their leaders. When the \npeople engaged in peace talks return from the negotiating table only to \ndisparage compromise and incite violence, there can be no progress \ntowards peace.\n  Israel has come a long way since I first began following the fate of \nthis state and the people of Israel. In so many respects, life appears \nand feels normal. The economy is developing, the standard of living is \ngrowing and improving. But just below the surface of this normalcy, Mr. \nPresident, Israel still faces a threat to the state's very existence. \nIsrael's survival remains, unfortunately, a very real and central \nconcern 50 years after its independence.\n  Some people believe, however, that by ignoring this threat, that the \npeace process can succeed. Mr. President, it will fail. It is clear to \nme that many in the Palestinian leadership today see the peace process \ntoward the goal of eliminating the State of Israel.\n  I suggest today that we get back to the basics. Peace is not possible \nwhile teaching children to hate and kill. Peace is not possible while \npersecuting those of other faiths. Peace is not possible while \nlionizing terrorism. We must stand up for freedom, security, and human \ndignity. We must stand up to ensure the security of Israel. We must \nstand up in the Congress, and we must insist that our President stand \nwith us.\n  Today is the day to end American pressure on Israel to force a peace \nagreement. Today is the day to remember it is up to the people of \nIsrael to determine their own fate--their own security. We should \npressure those who fill children with slogans of hatred and holy war; \nwe should pressure them to change. We should pressure those who \ntorture; we should pressure them to change. We should pressure those \nwho encourage and support terror and murder, and those who rejoice in \nhatred. That is where the pressure should be.\n  Now is the time, Mr. President, for a return to our principled stand. \nThe only way to truly attain peace is to support freedom, democracy and \njustice, and oppose the cycle of hatred. We must face tyranny and \noppression where it exists, condemn it, and stand up for peace--real \npeace based upon security, freedom, and a change of heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2205-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on February 26, 1999, the Federal Maritime \nCommission (FMC) completed its rulemaking to implement the Ocean \nShipping Reform Act of 1998. The regulatory framework for the liner \nshipping industry is now in place and ready for the May 1, 1999, start \ndate.\n  The 1998 Act signals a paradigm shift in the conduct of the ocean \nliner business and its regulation by the FMC. Where ocean carrier \npricing and service options were diluted by the conference system and \n``me too'' requirements, an unprecedented degree of flexibility and \nchoice will result. Where agency oversight once focused on using rigid \nsystems of tariff and contract filing to scrutinize individual \ntransactions, the ``big picture'' of ensuring the existence of \ncompetitive liner service by a healthy ocean carrier industry to \nfacilitate fair and open maritime commerce among our trading partners \nwill become the oversight priority.\n  Mr. President, as FMC Commissioner Ming Hsu recently told a large \ngathering of shippers and industry representatives, ``This has been not \nonly a long journey, but a long needed journey * * * With the passage \nof the Ocean Shipping Reform Act and the FMC's new regulations, I \nbelieve the maritime industry will be far less shackled by burdensome \nand needless regulations * * * I believe we can now look forward to an \nenvironment which gives you the freedom and flexibility to develop \ninnovative solutions to your ever-changing ocean transportation \nneeds.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  The FMC regulatory process bore some resemblance to the legislative \nprocess that preceded it. A few early steps started to head off in the \nwrong direction, but through honest dialogue among the industry and the \ngovernment parties, the course was corrected and the intent of the 1998 \nAct was embodied in the regulations. Now the FMC faces the challenge of \nimplementing the new regulations in a manner consistent with \nCongressional intent.\n  Mr. President, through the 1998 Act, the Congress directed the FMC to \nspend less effort attempting to regulate the day-to-day business of \nocean carriers and spend more effort on countering truly market \ndistorting activities. This shift is made possible by giving exporters \nand importers greater opportunity and ability to use the marketplace to \nsatisfy their ocean shipping requirements through less government \nintervention.\n  Recent efforts by some countries to protect their domestic maritime \nindustries by imposing restrictive trade practices indicates that this \nshift in emphasis is well-timed. I am particularly concerned about \nChina's efforts to impose greater regulatory control over the ocean \nshipping industry as the rest of the world is heading in the opposite \ndirection. While the Maritime Administration seem to be nearing an \nagreement eliminating unfair practices by Brazil, continued vigilance \nis required. As we are seeing with Japan's port practices, the problem \ncan remain long after such an agreement is reached.\n  Mr. President, I should point out that paradigm shifts are often \npainful, but enlightening, for involved organizations. To its credit, \nthe FMC met the challenge of promulgating the new regulations by the \nMarch 1, 1999 deadline. Now, I recognize that Congress issues many \ndeadlines for the Executive Branch, sometimes with little success. But \nI want to personally congratulate the FMC for its tremendous effort and \nresponsiveness to complete these regulations on time. Not only did the \nFMC deliver its rules on time; the FMC's rules are clearly within the \nintent of Congress. I feel good about that.\n  I want to express my gratitude to the four FMC Commissioners, \nChairman Hal Creel, Ming Hsu, John Moran, and Delmond Won, for their \nleadership and wisdom during this process. This band of four challenged \nthe staff to think ``outside the box'' of the previous regulatory \nsystem and develop innovative methods to monitor the industry in a less \nintrusive manner. Also, I want to recognize the efforts of the FMC \nstaff members who worked long and hard to meet Congress' deadline: \nGeorge Bowers, Florence Carr, Jennifer Devine, Rachel Dickon-Matney, \nBruce Dombrowski, Rebecca Fenneman, Vern Hill, Christopher Hughey, Amy \nLarson, David Miles, Tom Panebianco, Austin Schmitt, Matthew Thomas, \nBryant VanBrakle, Ed Walsh, and Ted Zook. Their hard work and sweat \nwill truly benefit this Nation by enabling industry and its customers \nto prepare for this new era of ocean shipping.\n  Mr. President, just as it took several years for the legislative \nprocess to bear fruit, I urge patience before evaluating the results of \nthis rulemaking. I will continue to monitor the transition process for \nthis fundamental change. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act can't fix \ninternational economic imbalances and uncertainties, but it will give \nthe industry and its customers much-needed flexibility to work through \nmany difficult situations.\n  Mr. President, The health of our Nation's economy depends on a \nhealthy system for international trade, and therefore, a dependable \nocean shipping industry. The FMC rules will provide the necessary \ncertainty in a manner consistent with Congressional intent.

Mr. President, last week the Defense Department and the \nCongress lost the services of an outstanding public servant when Sandi \nStuart stepped down as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nLegislative Affairs.\n  For the last six years, beginning in 1993, Sandi Stuart has served as \nthe senior legislative advisor to three Secretaries of Defense--our \nformer colleague the late Les Aspin; Dr. Bill Perry; and the current \nSecretary of Defense Bill Cohen. During this time she has earned a \nwell-deserved reputation as a skilled legislative strategist and an \neffective spokesperson for the Secretary of Defense and for the \ninterests of the men and women in uniform and their families.\n  At the same time, because of her extensive experience over almost 15 \nyears in senior staff positions in the House of Representatives, Sandi \nhad tremendous credibility on Capitol Hill as someone who understood \nhow Congress worked. She knew that to be successful working with \nCongress--particularly in the area of national security policy--\nrequires an ability to work closely with members and staff on both \nsides of the aisle. She did that very well, and leaves the Defense \nDepartment with the respect and gratitude of Democratic and Republican \nmembers and staff alike.\n  Mr. President, I have worked closely with Sandi Stuart for the past \nsix years on a broad range of national security policy issues. She has \ndone an outstanding job of meeting the needs of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and I have come to rely heavily on her advice and counsel.\n  Mr. President, Sandi Stuart has also become a good friend, and we \nwill miss her. I want to take this opportunity to thank her for her \nservice to the country, and to wish her continued success in the \nprivate sector as she leaves the Department of Defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2206-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues \nan article on ``Improving Human Rights in China'' written by Jim Dorn, \nvice president for academic affairs at the Cato Institute. Dorn \nadvocates that Congress return to legislation ``designed to change \nChina's stand on human rights and to liberate the Chinese people from \nreligious and political persecution.'' This call is particularly timely \ngiven the most recent wave of repression against those inside China who \nseek to widen freedom and political discourse in that country. Higher \ntaxes in the form of higher tariffs is not the answer, as Dorn points \nout. However, that does not mean America and the U.S. Congress, and, \nindeed, the President, should not be strongly advocating the rule of \nlaw and respect for political dissent in China. I recommend Jim Dorn's \npiece to my colleagues and encourage continued vigilance in the defense \nof civil liberties and freedom for the Chinese people. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Journal of Commerce, Feb. 8, 1999]\n\n                    Improving Human Rights in China\n\n                           (By James A. Dorn)\n\n       The use or threat of trade sanctions to advance human \n     rights in China has done relatively little to change policy \n     in Beijing. Congress should consider alternative measures to \n     improve human rights in China.\n       Trade sanctions are a blunt instrument; they often fail to \n     achieve their objectives and end up harming the very people \n     they are intended to help.\n       In the case of China, placing prohibitively high tariffs on \n     Chinese products entering the United States in order to \n     protest Beijing's dismal human rights record would cost U.S. \n     consumers billions of dollars.\n       It would also slow the growth of China's nonstate sector, \n     which has allowed millions of Chinese to move to more \n     productive jobs outside the reach of the Communist Party. \n     Isolating China would reverse the progress that has been made \n     since economic reform began in 1978 and would create \n     political and social instability.\n       A better approach is to continue to open China to the \n     outside world and, at the same time, use non-trade sanctions \n     and diplomacy to advance human rights. When China violates \n     trade agreements or intellectual property rights, however, it \n     should be held accountable, and carefully targeted trade \n     sanctions may be warranted.\n       The piracy of intellectual property is a serious problem \n     for Western firms. China has been a major offender of \n     copyright laws and needs to comply with the rule of law. \n     China's membership in the World Trade Organization should be \n     conditioned on Beijing's adherence to international law.\n       The problem is that most less-developed countries, and even \n     some developed countries, violate intellectual property \n     rights. Using economic sanctions to punish pirates sounds \n     good in theory, but in practice sanctions are seldom \n     effective.\n       The real solution to piracy may have to wait for \n     technological changes that make it very costly to steal \n     intellectual property. And it may have to wait for the rule \n     of law to evolve in China and other less-developed countries.\n       As China develops its own intellectual property, there will \n     be a demand for new laws to protect property rights. The \n     uncertainty created by China's failure to protect these \n     rights can only harm China in the long run. Investors will \n     not enter a market if they cannot reap most of the benefits \n     of their investments.\n       Fan Gang, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social \n     Sciences, predicts that things will change in China as people \n     discover that clearly defined and enforced property rights \n     are to their advantage.\n       People, he said, ``are bound to find that all this cheating \n     and protecting yourself from being cheated consume too much \n     time and energy, and that the best way to do business is \n     playing by a set of mutually respected rules. New rules and \n     laws will be passed, and people will be ready to abide by \n     them.''\n       The United States has considerable leverage in dealing with \n     China and should not let it dictate U.S. foreign policy or \n     allow human rights to be a nonissue.\n       The United States is China's largest export market, and \n     U.S. investors rank third in terms of foreign direct \n     investment in China.\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\n     Clearly China would be harmed by any significant cutback in \n     trade with an investment from the United States.\n       The problem is that any sizable cutback would also harm the \n     United States and the world economy.\n       To avoid the high costs (and low probable benefits) that \n     stem from the use of trade sanctions, Congress should \n     consider using non-trade sanctions such as cutting of the \n     flow of taxpayer-financed aid to China--including aid from \n     the International Monetary Funds, the World Bank, and the \n     Asian Development Bank.\n       Another possible non-trade sanction is making public the \n     names of companies known to be using prison labor or \n     companies run by the People's Liberation Army so that U.S. \n     consumers can boycott their products.\n       The China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act, S. \n     810, introduced in the 105th Congress by Sen. Spencer \n     Abraham, R-Mich., lists those and other measures designed to \n     move China toward a free society.\n       The 106th Congress should return to that and other \n     legislation designed to change China's stand on human rights \n     and to liberate the China people from religious and political \n     prosecution.\n       (The passage of H.R. 2647, one of four ``Freedom of China'' \n     bills enacted by the 105th Congress as part of the 1999 \n     Defense Authorization Act, is a step in the right direction. \n     That bill requires publication of the names of PLA-run \n     companies operating in the United States.)\n       Congess should recognize that advancing economic freedom in \n     China has had positive effects on the growth of China's civil \n     society and on personal freedom.\n       According to Chinese dissident Wang Dan, ``Economic change \n     does influence political change. China's economic development \n     will be good for the West as well as for the Chinese \n     people.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2207-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 221.

A bill to designate the new hospital bed replacement building \nat the Ioannis A. Lougaris Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter in Reno, Nevada, in honor of Jack Streeter; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n    Ioanis A. Lougaris Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ndesignate the new hospital bed replacement building at the Ioannis A. \nLougaris Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, in honor of Mr. Jack Streeter.\n  Jack Streeter is Nevada's most decorated veteran from World War II. \nHe was born on December 1, 1921 in Ely, Nevada. For his valiant \nservice, he was awarded five Silver Stars, five Purple Hearts and the \ntwo Bronze Stars. He was a combat infantryman and served with the 1st \nInfantry Division (Big Red One). He left the service as a captain, U.S. \nArmy.\n  Mr. Streeter has an incredible life history of business and \nprofessional success. Mr. Streeter is an attorney at law, practicing \nfor over forty years in the State of Nevada.\n  Jack graduated from the University of Nevada Reno in 1943, where upon \nafter completing Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia, he \nentered the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant. He saw combat throughout \nEurope in the Second World War in such places as the Normandy invasion \non D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge, the St. Lo Breakthrough, Battle of \nMortain, Battle of Mons, Battle of Aaachen, and the Battle of Hurtgen \nForest.\n  After leaving the Army in 1945, Jack attended Hastings Law School in \nSan Francisco, California, graduating in 1948. He returned to practice \nlaw in Nevada. In 1950 he entered politics and was elected district \nattorney in Reno. As District Attorney he compiled an impressive \nprosecution record and founded the National District Attorney \nAssociation.\n  During the next 43 years of private legal practice, jack specialized \nin business law representing a variety of different enterprises. He was \nactive in many civic groups serving as president of the Nevada State \nJaycees, Sertoma Club, Reno Navy League, and Chairman of the \nCommissioning Committee for the U.S.S. Nevada trident submarine.\n  Jack is on the boards of directors of the Society of the First \nInfantry Division, the University of Nevada Foundation, Saint Mary's \nHospital Foundation, and he is a Knight of Malta. He also serves as the \npresident of the World Association of Lawyers.\n  Veterans in northern Nevada have long needed this new wing to their \nVA Medical Center and it is only fitting that it be named in honor of \nNevada's most decorated veteran from World War II.\n  The new facility I am requesting be named in honor of Jack Streeter \nis located in the complex known as the Ioannis A. Lougaris Va Medical \nCenter. Mr. Lougaris was the first living individual to have a VA \nMedical Center named in his honor.\n  Before World War II, John Lougaris remembered the veterans of World \nWar I and the lack of medical aid, especially in Nevada. As a National \nExecutive Committeeman from Nevada, he made many trips to Washington, \nDC, sixteen of them at his own expense, endeavoring to get a Veterans \nHospital established in Reno.\n  The first success was a 26-bed unit, built in 1939 with a $100,000 \nfederal grant. In 1944, John's efforts led to increasing the facility \nto 125 beds. He did not stop working and today the Reno VA Medical \nCenter which bears his honorable name, serves Nevada's veterans well as \na 107 bed facility which includes a 60 bed nursing home facility and 12 \nintensive care unit beds. The new bed replacement facility, which the \nbill I am offering today seeks to name after Jack Streeter, was built \nat the cost of $27 million and brings this hospital to a modern day \nstandard.\n  In recognition of John Lougaris's devotion, deep interest, and \nuntiring efforts in the development of a hospital to serve veterans in \nNevada and Northern California, the Congress of the United States, by \nPublic Law 97-66, rededicated the Reno VA Medical Center as the Ioannis \nA. Lougaris VA Medical Center on December 17, 1981.\n  It was certainly a well deserved gesture when Congress designated the \nVA Medical Center in honor of Ioannis A. Lougaris. It would now be \nequally fitting to name the new hospital wing in honor of Mr. Jack \nStreeter for his outstanding record of service to this Nation.\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my friend and \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, in introducing this important \nlegislation today to honor an individual whose extraordinary military \nservice record and faithful commitment to his community warrants \nspecial recognition.\n  As Senator Reid has explained, in the next few months a new wing will \nbe dedicated at the Ioannis A. Lougaris VA Medical Center in Reno, \nNevada. This five-story, 110-bed tower is a welcome addition to the \nReno VAMC, and will provide veterans in northern Nevada with the modern \nfacilities and quality inpatient care they so clearly deserve. The \npurpose of the legislation we are introducing today is to name that new \nwing after Mr. Jack Streeter, an individual whose lifetime is \nhallmarked by his exemplary service record, his steadfast dedication to \nthe veterans community and his leadership in numerous charitable and \nnonprofit organization.\n  I have had the opportunity to know Jack for many years now, dating \nback to my tenure as governor of Nevada. Anyone who has come into \ncontact with Jack Streeter, and who had the occasion to talk with Jack \nand learn more about his experiences, can understand and appreciate \nwhat an extraordinary individual this man is.\n  Jack Streeter's military service record is quite well known in the \nstate of Nevada. He is, in fact, the most decorated World War Two \nveteran in Nevada, having earned five Purpose Hearts, five Silver \nStars, and two Bronze Stars in the European Theater. Let me repeat that \nMr. President, because it truly is an astounding record. Five Purple \nHearts, five Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars.\n  As a young second lieutenant during the war, Jack saw action from the \nAllied invasion of Normandy to the decisive Battle of the Bulge in the \nwinter of 1944-45. Upon leaving the service in 1946, Mr. Streeter \nearned a law degree from Hastings Law School in San Francisco and later \nreturned to Reno, where he was soon elected as district attorney. He \nlater found the National District Attorney Association and participated \nin numerous civic organizations and foundations.\n  Jack Streeter's distinguished military service record, coupled with \nhis unyielding dedication to his community, merits the sort of \nrecognition and rememberence that this legislation will provide. To all \nNevadans who have had the opportunity to know Jack, he is a friend, a \ncivic leader, and most importantly, a champion of the community.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Reid and the entire Nevada \ndelegation in passing this proposal and naming this new wing after a \ntrue American hero.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 514. A bill to improve the National Writing Project; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n        legislation to reauthorize the national writing project\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the National Writing Project, the only Federal program to \nimprove the teaching of writing in America's classrooms.\n  Literacy is at the foundation of school and workspace success, of \ncitizenship in a democracy, and of learning in all disciplines. The \nNational Writing Project has been instrumental in helping teachers \ndevelop better teaching skills so they can help our children improve \ntheir ability to read, write, and think.\n  As the United States continues to face a crisis in wiring in school \nheightened by the growing number of at-risk students due to limited \nEnglish proficiency and the shortage of adequately trained teachers, \ncontinued Federal support for a program that works such as the National \nWriting Project is imperative.\n  The National Writing Project is a national network of university-\nbased teacher training programs designed to improve the teaching of \nwriting and student achievement in writing.\n  Through its professional development model, the National Writing \nProject recognizes the primary importance of teacher knowledge, \nexpertise, and leadership. The National Writing Project operates on a \nteachers-teaching teachers model. Successful writing teachers attend \nInvitational Summer Institutes at their local universities. During the \nschool year these teachers provide workshops for other teachers in the \nschools.\n  Teachers of all subjects benefit from the training, and the success \nof students who are taught by Writing Project teachers is evident: they \nscore better not just on writing examinations, but in reading, \nmathematics, and in other subjects.\n  Since 1973, the National Writing Project has served over 1.8 million \nteaches and administrators. Each year over 150,000 participants benefit \nfrom the National Writing Project programs in 1 of 156 United States \nsites located in 46 States and Puerto Rico. The National Writing \nProject generates $6.47 for every Federal dollar.\n  I am pleased, that for the first time since the National Writing \nProject was authorized for federal funding in 1991, the President has \nrequested funds to expand the National Writing Project in his budget \nfor Fiscal Year 2000.\n  This program has proven to be one of the most effective in education \ntoday. I am proud to be associated with it, and I compliment those who \nhave made it so successful across the nation.\n  When I first introduced this bill in 1990, it was cosponsored by 40 \nSenators, both Republicans and Democrats. I hope it will receive equal \nor greater support in the 106th Congress. I invite other Senators to \njoin me in sponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Reid, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Torricelli, and \n        Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 515. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, to \nmake it unlawful for any stockyard owner, market agency, or dealer to \ntransfer or market nonambulatory livestock, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                      downed animal protection act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Downed Animal \nProtection Act, a bill to eliminate inhumane and improper treatment of \ndowned animals at stockyards. The legislation prohibits the sale or \ntransfer of downed animals unless they have been humanely euthanized.\n  Downed animals are severely distressed recumbent animals that are too \nsick to rise or move on their own. Once an animal becomes immobile, it \nmust remain where it has fallen, often without receiving the most basic \nassistance. Downed animals that survive the stockyard are slaughtered \nfor human consumption.\n  These animals are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to handle \nhumanely. They have very demanding needs, and must be fed and watered \nindividually. The suffering of downed animals is so severe that the \nonly humane solution to their plight is immediate euthanasia.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today requires that these \nhopelessly sick and injured animals be euthanized by humane methods \nthat rapidly an effectively render animals insensitive to pain. Humane \neuthanasia of downed animals will limit animal suffering and will \nencourage the livestock industry to concentrate on improved management \nand handling practices to avoid this problem.\n  Downed animals compromise a tiny fraction, less than one-tenth of one \npercent, of animals at stockyards. Banning their sale or transfer would \ncause no economic hardship. The Downed Animal Protection Act will \nprompt stockyards to refuse crippled and distressed animals, and will \nmake the prevention of downed animals a priority for the livestock \nindustry. The bill will reinforce the industry's commitment to humane \nhandling of animals.\n  The problem of downed animals has been addressed by major livestock \norganizations such as the United Stockyards Corp., the Minnesota \nLivestock Marketing Association, the National Pork Producers Council, \nthe Colorado Cattlemen's Association, and the Independent Cattlemen's \nAssociation of Texas. All of these organizations have taken strong \nstands against improper treatment of animals by adopting ``no-downer'' \npolicies. I want to commend these and other organizations, as well\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\nas responsible and conscientious livestock producers throughout the \ncountry, for their efforts to end an appalling problem that erodes \nconsumer confidence.\n  Despite a strong consensus within industry, the animal welfare \nmovement, consumers, and government that downed animals should not be \nsent to stockyards, this sad problem continues, causing animal \nsuffering and an erosion of public confidence in the industry.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will complement industry effort to \naddress this problem by encouraging better care of animals at farms and \nranches. Animals with impaired mobility will receive better treatment \nin order to prevent them from becoming incapacitated. The bill will \nremove the incentive for sending downed animals to stockyards in the \nhope of receiving some salvage value for the animals and would \nencourage greater care during loading and transport. The bill will also \ndiscourage improper breeding practices that account for most downed \nanimals.\n  My legislation would set a uniform national standard, thereby \nremoving any unfair advantages that might result from differing \nstandards throughout the industry. Furthermore, no additional \nbureaucracy will be needed as a consequence of my bill because \ninspectors of the Packers and Stockyards Administration regularly visit \nstockyards to enforce existing regulations. Thus, the additional burden \non the agency and stockyard operators will be insignificant.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 516. A bill to benefit consumers by promoting competition in the \nelectric power industry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nthe electric utility restructuring empowerment and competitiveness act \n                            of 1999 (eureca)\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric \nUtility Restructuring Empowerment and Competitiveness Act of 1999. This \nlegislation empowers the states to restructure their electric \nindustries at the rate and in the way they decide. My legislation \nimposes no ``retail choice mandate'' or deadline on the States so as to \nfully allow the best market ideas and approaches to occur. As well, \nEURECA removes Federal impediments to competition and deregulates and \nstreamlines the industry.\n  My bill gives the States the leading role in implementing competition \nin the electric power industry. This approach contrasts with the bills \nintroduced in the House and Senate last Congress that required \ncompetition nationwide by a date certain. A Federal mandate on the \nStates requiring retail competition by a date certain is not in the \nbest interest of all classes of consumers. I am concerned such an \napproach would cause increased prices for low density States with \nrelatively low cost power. This bill will protect States' rights and \nallow States maximum latitude to adapt competition to their own \nindividual needs.\n  I believe States are in the best position to deal with this complex \nissue. Although the cost of electricity varies across the country, \nelectric industry restructuring can result in lower consumer prices for \neveryday goods and services, the development of innovative new products \nand services, and a growing, more productive economy.\n  We have spent the last two Congresses holding hearings to review the \nstate of competition in the electric power industry and discussing \nnumerous pieces of legislation dealing with restructuring. Meanwhile, \n20 individual States have passed their own legislation introducing \ncompetition into the retail electric industry and many other States are \nconsidering such proposals. According to industry statistics, nearly 50 \npercent of all Americans now live in States committed to retail \ncompetition. States are clearly taking the lead--they should continue \nto have that role--and this bill encourages more innovation by \naffirming States' ability to implement retail choice policies.\n  It is critical to the welfare of the States that each one have an \nopportunity to ready and equip themselves for a successful transition \nto a deregulated environment. By learning from the States which have \nalready implemented competition, other states can take precautions and \nadopt laws that will best protect them as they adjust to this new \ncompetitive environment. With FERC's Order 888, which created \ncompetitive wholesale power supply markets through the availability of \nnon-discriminatory open-access transmission service under tariff, we \nhave seen at both the State and Federal levels that we are now in a \ncritical testing period in the implementation of market-based policies. \nSpecifically, we saw the price spikes that occurred last summer in the \nMidwest. After holding a hearing on the subject, the experts agreed \nthat we are indeed in a transition period. Although no one could point \nto one specific reason for the occurrence, and many were suggested, all \nseemed to agree for the need of national reliability standards.\n\n  Traditionally, reliability of the transmission system was managed by \na voluntary, industry-led organization known as the North American \nElectric Reliability Council. We have added many new players to the \ntransmission grid, making for an increasingly decentralized and \ncompetitive U.S. electricity industry. And, as determined by a recently \nissued DOE Task Force Report, ``the old institutions of reliability are \nno longer sufficient.'' I have added a section on reliability to my \nlegislation. The industry collectively came up with a legislative \nproposal that would transform NERC from a voluntary system of \nreliability management to NAERO, an organization that is mandatory in \nnature and subject to FERC oversight. Sustaining system reliability is \ncrucial for protecting all classes of consumers and such an \norganization can help ensure that power markets function efficiently.\n  One of the most important aspects of this debate--assuring that \nuniversal service is maintained--is a critical function that each state \nPUC should have the ability to oversee and enforce. In my legislation, \nnothing would prohibit a state from requiring all electricity providers \nthat sell electricity to retail customers in that state to provide \nelectricity service to all classes and consumers of electric power. All \nclasses of consumers should have access to adequate, safe, reliable and \nefficient energy services at fair and reasonable prices, as a result of \ncompetition.\n  Mr. President, my proposal will create greater competition at the \nwholesale level by prospectively deregulating wholesale sales of \nelectricity. We did this in natural gas and it worked--I am confident \nit will work in electricity. Although everyone talks about \n``deregulating'' the electricity industry, it is really the generation \nsegment that will be deregulated. The FERC will continue to regulate \ntransmission in interstate commerce, and State PUCs will continue to \nregulate retail distribution services and sales.\n  When FERC issued Order 888, it allowed utilities to seek market-based \nrates for new generating capacity. This provision goes a step further \nand allows utilities to purchase wholesale power from existing \ngeneration facilities, after the date of enactment of this Act, at \nprices solely determined by market forces.\n  Furthermore, the measure expands FERC authority to require non-public \nutilities that own, operate or control transmission to open their \nsystems. Currently, the Commission cannot require the Power Marketing \nAdministration (PMAs), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), \nmunicipalities and cooperatives which own transmission to provide \nwholesale open access transmission service. Since approximately 22 \npercent of all transmission is beyond open access authority, requiring \nthese non-public utilities to provide this service will help ensure \nthat a true wholesale power market exists.\n\n  One of the key elements of this measure is streamlining and \nmodernizing the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) \nand the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). While both \nof these initiatives were enacted with good intentions, there is \nwidespread belief that the Acts have fulfilled their original \nobligations and have outlived their usefulness.\n  My bill amends Section 210 of PURPA on a prospective basis. Current \nPURPA contracts would continue to be honored and upheld. However, upon \nenactment of this legislation, a utility\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\nthat begins operating would not be required to enter into a new \ncontract or obligation to purchase electricity under Section 210 of \nPURPA.\n  With regard to PUHCA, I've included Senators Shelby's and Dodd's \n``Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1999.'' This language is \nidentical to the bipartisan legislation reported by the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in the 105th Congress. Under this \nproposal, PUHCA would be repealed. Furthermore, all books and records \nof each holding company and each associate company would be transferred \nto the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)--which currently has \njurisdiction over the 19 registered holding companies--to FERC. This \nallows energy regulators, who truly know the industry to oversee the \noperations of these companies and review acquisitions and mergers. \nThese consumer protections are an important part of PUHCA reform.\n  Mr. President, an issue that must be resolved in order for a true \ncompetitive environment to exist is that of utilities receiving \n``subsidies'' by the federal government and the U.S. tax code. For \nyears, investor owned utilities (IOUs) have claimed inequity because of \ntax-exempt financing and low-interest loans that municipalities and \nrural cooperative receive. On the other side of the equation, these \npublic power systems maintain that IOUs receive benefits in the tax \ncode such as accelerated depreciation, investment tax credits and \ndeferred income tax and many use tax-exempt debt for pollution control \nbonds. Are these in a way, ``subsidies?'' The jury is still out on how \nbest to tackle these difficult issues but without a doubt, we will need \nto come to a resolution.\n  Finally, my bill directs the Inspector General of the Department of \nthe Treasury to file a report to the Congress detailing whether and how \ntax code incentives received by all utilities should be reviewed in \norder to foster a competitive retail electricity market in the future.\n  Mr. President, with respect to federal comprehensive restructuring \nlegislation, it is the states themselves that hold the key to ultimate \nsuccess. EURECA allows states to continue to move forward and craft \nelectricity proposals that best fit their own particular needs. This \nlegislation is the best solution to move forward with a better product \nfor all classes of consumers and the industry as a whole.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. DeWine, \n        and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 517. A bill to assure access under group health plans and health \ninsurance coverage to covered emergency medical services; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n\n\n            ACCESS TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nChafee, Robb, and Mikulski, to introduce the Emergency Medical Services \nAct of 1999. Americans today are routinely denied coverage by their \nmanaged care plans for visits to the emergency department for \nlegitimate emergency medical conditions. This legislation establishes a \nnational definition, known as the prudent layperson standard, for the \npurposes of receiving emergency room treatment. The Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997 applied this definition to the Medicaid and Medicare programs. \nThe proposal would simply ensure that all private health plans afford \ntheir consumers the same kinds of protections available to Medicaid and \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, current law places patients in the unreasonable \nposition of fearing that payment for emergency room visits will be \ndenied even when conditions appear to both the patient and emergency \nroom personnel to require urgent treatment. For example, a patient who \nis experiencing chest pains and believes that she is having a heart \nattack may not be covered by a health plan if the diagnosis later turns \nout to be indigestion. Enactment of the ``prudent layperson'' \ndefinition would end this phenomena by ensuring coverage when a \nreasonable person, who believes that she is in need of care, presents \nherself at an emergency room and is treated.\n  Federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act \n(EMTALA), already requires that all persons who come to a hospital for \nemergency care be given a screening examination to determine if they \nare experiencing a medical emergency, and if so, that they receive \nstabilizing treatment before being discharged or moved to another \nfacility. As a result, emergency, room doctors and hospitals face a \ncatch-22. Practitioners are required by EMTALA and their own \nprofessional ethics to perform diagnostic tests and exams to rule out \nemergency conditions, but may be denied reimbursement due to HMO prior \nauthorization requirements or a finding after diagnosis that the \ncondition was not of an emergency.\n\n  This legislation also provides a process for the coordination of \npost-stabilization care. Consider this example: a patient goes into the \nemergency room complaining of chest pains, in an obvious emergent \ncondition. Subsequently, the chest pains subside, therefore, the \npatient is considered clinically ``stabilized.'' However, this does not \nmean that the patient is out of danger. At that point the emergency \nroom physician may recommend a follow up test, such as an EKG, but is \nfrequently unable to get the health plan to authorize any follow-up \ncare.\n  This portion of the bill would require that treating emergency \nphysicians and health plans timely communicate with each other to \ndetermine what the necessary post-stabilization care should be. Health \nplans, in conjunction with the treating physician, may arrange for an \nalternative treatment plan that allows the health plan to assume care \nof the patient after stabilization. For instance, the plan may \nrecommend that the patient by transferred to an in-network hospital, or \nit may agree to cover the tests recommended by the emergency room \nphysician.\n  Our legislation has been strongly endorsed by Kaiser Permanente, one \nof our nation's oldest, largest, and most respected managed care plans, \nand the American College of Emergency Physicians. The legislation has \nalso received the strong support of the American Osteopathic \nAssociation, the Federation of American Health Systems, and the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, among many others.\n  I would ask that my colleagues join us in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 520. A bill for the relief of Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and \nher husband, Diogenes Patricio Rojas; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                          private relief bill\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a private bill \nfor the relief of Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, \nDiogenes Patricio Rojas. My bill would grant permanent resident status \nto Janina and Diogenes, who face deportation later this month to the \nDominican Republic as a result of a technicality in current federal \nimmigration law.\n  Janina has been denied citizenship because her mother was the child \nof a U.S. citizen female and foreign male. Previous law allowed only \nchildren of U.S. citizen males and foreign females to claim U.S. \ncitizenship.\n  In 1994, Senator Paul Simon passed the Immigration and Nationality \nand Technical Corrections Act, which allowed individuals born overseas \nbefore 1934 to U.S. citizen mothers, and their descendants, to claim \nU.S. citizenship. As a result of that 1994 law, Janina's mother \nreceived U.S. citizenship in January 1996.\n  However, when Janina attempted to attain citizenship as a descendant \nof a direct beneficiary of this legislation, her application was \ndenied. Despite the 1994 law, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService required that Janina's mother meet transmission requirements: \nshe must have been physically present in the U.S. for 10 years prior to \nJanina's birth, 5 of which over the age of 16 years, in order for \nJanina to derive citizenship. Since her mother was prohibited from \nbecoming a U.S. citizen until 1996, however, this requirement is \nunreasonable.\n  While 60 years of discriminatory law was corrected in 1994, the \ncitizenship qualifications of the line of descendants of those U.S. \ncitizen females remain adversely impacted. The private relief bill I \nintroduce today will grant Janina and her husband Diogenes permanent \nresident status to continue\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\ntheir lives in this country until this provision can be amended.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 520\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to improve the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act and am especially pleased to be \njoined by Senators Feingold, Torricelli and Schumer as original \nsponsors on this law enforcement effort. I am also pleased that the \nsenior Senator from Colorado, Senator Campbell, is joining us, again, \nin this effort. We worked together closely and successfully last year \nto pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act into law.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, which President Clinton \nsigned into law on June 16, 1998, authorizes the Department of Justice \nto award grants to pay for half of the cost of providing bulletproof \nvests for State and local law enforcement officers. Beginning this \nmonth, the Department of Justice plans to open the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Program so that State, county and local law enforcement \nagencies may receive grants to pay for half of the cost of providing \nbody armor for their officers. The entire application and payment \nprocess for the program will occur electronically via the Internet at \nhttp://vests.ojp.gov. I am confident that this innovative process will \nbe a great success at harnessing the power of the information age to \nassist law enforcement do its job better, safer and more cost \neffectively. I want to commend the Attorney General and the Department \nfor making this effort.\n  To build on the success of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program, \nour bipartisan legislation would permit the Department of Justice to \nwaive, in whole or in part, the matching requirement for law \nenforcement agencies applying for bulletproof vest grants in cases of \nfiscal hardship. Some police departments in smaller jurisdictions may \nbe unable to contribute half of the cost of buying body armor for their \nofficers. This waiver provision was included in the Campbell-Leahy \nversion of the Act introduced last year, but was unfortunately \neliminated by others during House-Senate consideration of the final \nlegislation.\n  Our bipartisan bill is strongly supported by Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation Director Louis Freeh and the International Association of \nChiefs of Police.\n  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the \ncountry face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during \nroutine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives, and I believe this \nnew law will put vests on our State and local law enforcement officers \nwho put their lives on the line.\n  I look forward to working with all Senators to ensure that each and \nevery law enforcement community in Vermont and across the nation can \nafford basic protection for their officers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 521\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nimprove the quality of beaches and coastal recreation water, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n   beaches environmental assessment, closure, and health act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Beaches \nEnvironmental Assessment, Closure, and Health (BEACH) Act of 1999, \nlegislation which would amend the Clean Water Act to require states to \nadopt water quality standards for coastal recreation waters and to \nnotify the public of unhealthy conditions. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Torricelli, Senator Boxer, and Senator Lieberman in sponsoring \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, coastal tourism generates billions of dollars every \nyear for local communities and beaches are the top vacation destination \nin the nation. A recent survey found that tourists spend over $100 \nbillion in coastal portions of the twelve states that were studied. \nTravel and tourism to the beaches of the Jersey shore alone generates \nover $7 billion annually to local economies.\n  Unfortunately, the increased use of the coastal waters at our public \nbeaches and coastal parks for swimming, wading, and surfing can cause \nincreased risk to public health if these recreational waters are not \nproperly managed. Water pollution and water-borne bacteria and viruses \nfrom overflowing sewage systems can cause a wide range of diseases, \nincluding gastroenteritis, dysentery, hepatitis, ear, nose, and throat \nproblems, E. coli bacterial infections, and respiratory illness. Upon \ncontracting one of these water-borne diseases, the affected individual \noften remains contagious even when out of the water and may pass the \nillness to others. The consequences of these swimming-associated \nillnesses can be especially severe for children, elderly people, and \nthe infirm. In Maryland, the outbreak of the toxic Pfiesteria organism \nin several Chesapeake Bay tributaries prompted the state to close \nseveral rivers for public health reasons. Fishermen and swimmers who \nwere exposed to Pfiesteria complained of short-term memory loss, \ndizziness, muscular aches, peripheral tingling, vomiting, and abdominal \npain.\n  In a 1998 report on beach water quality, entitled Testing the Waters, \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council reported over 5,199 closings or \nadvisories of varying durations at U.S. beaches due to detected or \nanticipated unhealthy water quality in 1997. Many beaches closures and \nhealth advisories were a result of sewage spills and overflows.\n  The number of beach closings and advisories, while large, may \nrepresent only a small portion of the actual problem. This is because \nof an inconsistent approach among the states toward monitoring the \nwater quality of public beaches and notifying the public of unhealthy \nconditions. In fact, as of 1999, only nine states have comprehensive \nmonitoring programs and adequate public notification. Thirteen states \nhave regular monitoring and public notification programs for a portion \nof their recreational beaches. Among the remaining coastal and Great \nLakes\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nstates, some lack any regular monitoring of beach water quality, while \nothers have monitoring programs, but no programs to close beaches or \nnotify the public. As a result, a high bacteria level can cause a beach \nclosure in one state while, in another state, people may be allowed to \nswim in the water, despite the health risks.\n  Due in part to my urging, in 1997, the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) established its Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure \nand Health (BEACH) program to recommend appropriate monitoring criteria \nand public notification of beach water quality. While this program is a \ngood start, the reality is that the majority of states have not adopted \nEPA-recommended criteria to protect swimmer's health, and the agency \ndoes not possess the authority to require states to adopt their \nrecommended criteria.\n  Mr. President, my legislation would provide EPA the authority to \nrequire states to develop beach water quality monitoring and public \nnotification programs that adequately and uniformly protect public \nhealth. The BEACH Act would require EPA to conduct studies for use in \ndeveloping a more complete list of potential health risks associated \nwith unhealthy beach water quality, develop more effective testing \nmethods for detecting the presence of pathogens in coastal recreation \nwaters, and revise its water quality criteria for pathogens in such \nwaters. The legislation would also direct EPA to establish regulations \nrequiring monitoring of water quality at public beaches to determine \ncompliance with water quality and public safety criteria. The bill \nwould require states to notify local governments and the public of \ncurrent beach water quality. Where a state wishes to delegate its \ntesting, monitoring, and notification requirements to local \ngovernments, EPA must issue delegation guidance to a state and the \nstate must make resources available to the local government.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Beaches Environmental \n     Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the beaches and coastal recreation water of the United \n     States are valuable public resources that are used for \n     recreation by millions of people annually;\n       (2) the beaches of coastal States host many out-of-State \n     and international visitors;\n       (3) tourism in coastal zones generates billions of dollars \n     annually;\n       (4) increased population and urbanization of watershed \n     areas have contributed to the decline in the environmental \n     quality of coastal water;\n       (5) pollution in coastal water is not restricted by State \n     or other political boundaries;\n       (6) coastal States have different methods of testing and \n     parameters for evaluating the quality of coastal recreation \n     water, resulting in the provision of varying degrees of \n     protection to the public;\n       (7) the adoption of consistent criteria by coastal States \n     would enhance public health and safety, including the \n     adoption of consistent criteria for--\n       (A) testing and evaluating the quality of coastal \n     recreation water; and\n       (B) the posting of signs at beaches notifying the public \n     during periods when the water quality criteria for public \n     safety are not met; and\n       (8) while the adoption of consistent criteria would enhance \n     public health and safety, the failure to meet consistent \n     criteria should be addressed as part of a watershed approach \n     to effectively identify and eliminate sources of pollution.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purpose of this Act is to amend the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n     to require uniform criteria and procedures for testing, \n     monitoring, and notifying users of public coastal recreation \n     water and beaches--\n       (1) to protect public safety; and\n       (2) to improve environmental quality.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, six thousand miles from where I am \nstanding today, The Queen's Health System of Hawaii is providing health \ncare services that benefit the residents of all the Hawaiian Islands. \nThis year, approximately 18,000 inpatients and more than 200,000 \noutpatients will seek health care from The Queen's Health Systems. The \norganization maintains an open emergency room; admits Medicare and \nMedicaid patients; operates a 536-bed accredited teaching hospital; \noperates Molokai General Hospital; operates clinics on various islands; \nprovides home health care; supports nursing programs at Hawaiian \ncolleges and universities; and promotes good health practices in many \nother ways.\n  In 1885 Queen Emma Kaleleonalani, wife of King Kamehameha IV, \nbequeathed land which in large part composes the assets of The Queen \nEmma Foundation, a non-profit, tax-exempt, public charity. The \nFoundation s charitable purpose is to support and improve health care \nservices in Hawaii by committing funds generated by Foundation-owned \nproperties to The Queen's Medical Center, the Queen's Health Systems \nand other health care programs benefiting the community.\n  Much of the land bequeathed by Queen Emma to the Foundation is \nencumbered by long-term, fixed rent commercial and industrial ground \nleases. As these leases expire, the land and improvements revert back \nto the Foundation. The existing, aged improvements thereon will need to \nbe upgraded in order to enhance and continue the revenue-generating \npotential of the properties. However, the Foundation's available cash \nand cash flow are insufficient to implement these improvements which \nwould result in increased financial support to The Queen's Medical \nCenter, The Queen's Health Systems and other health care programs \nbenefiting the community. If the Foundation borrows the funds, any \nincome generated from those improvements would be subject to the debt-\nfinanced property rules of the unrelated business income tax provisions \nof the Internal Revenue Code. Since the income would be taxed at the \ncorporate rate, the amount ultimately available to The Queen's Health \nSystem would be greatly reduced.\n  Consequently, the generosity and intent of Queen Emma more than 100 \nyears ago are being frustrated by federal tax provisions intended to \nprevent abuses. I am sure the Congress never intended the unfortunate \nconsequences these provisions are having on what is virtually the sole \nsource of private financial support for this sound and unique system of \nproviding and delivering health care to the people of Hawaii.\n  Current law already allows an exception from the debt-financing rules \nfor certain real estate investments of pension trusts as well as an \nexception for educational institutions and their supporting \norganizations. The legislation I am introducing today grants similar \nrelief to institutions like The Queen Emma Foundation which provide and \ndeliver health care to the people of our nation.\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\n  I request unanimous consent that the full text of my bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 523\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, for nearly three years, the people of Guam \nendured war time atrocities and suffering. As part of Japan's assault \nagainst the Pacific, Guam was bombed and invaded by Japanese forces \nwithin three days of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor. At that time, \nGuam was administered by the United States Navy under the authority of \na Presidential Executive Order. It was also populated by then-American \nnationals. For the first time since the War of 1812, a foreign power \ninvaded United States soil.\n  In 1952, when the United States signed a peace treaty with Japan, \nformally ending World War II, it waived the rights of American \nnationals, including those of Guamanians, to present claims against \nJapan. As a result of this action, American nationals were forced to \nseek relief from the Congress of the United States.\n  Today, I rise to introduce the Guam War Restitution Act, which would \namend the Organic Act of Guam and provide restitution to those who \nsuffered atrocities during the occupation of Guam in World War II. \nThere are several key components to this measure.\n  The Restitution Act would establish specific damage awards to those \nwho are survivors of the war, and to the heirs of those who died during \nthe war. The specific damage awards would be as follows: (1) $20,000 \nfor death; (2) $7,000 for personal injury; and (3) $5,000 for forced \nlabor, forced march, or internment.\n  The Restitution Act would also establish specific damage benefits to \nthe heirs of those who survived the war and who made previous claims \nbut have since died. The specific damage benefits would be as follows: \n(1) $7,000 for personal injury; and (2) $5,000 for forced labor, forced \nmarch, or internment. Payments for benefits may either be in the form \nof a scholarship, payment of medical expenses, or a grant for first-\ntime home ownership.\n  This Act would also establish a Guam Trust Fund from which \ndisbursements will be made. Any amount left in the fund would be used \nto establish the Guam World War II Loyalty Scholarships at the \nUniversity of Guam.\n  A nine member Guam Trust Fund Commission would be established to \nadjudicate and award all claims from the Trust Fund.\n  The United States Congress previously recognized its moral obligation \nto the people of Guam and provided reparations relief by enacting the \nGuam Meritorious Claims Act on November 15, 1945 (Public Law 79-224). \nUnfortunately, the Claims Act was seriously flawed and did not \nadequately compensate Guam after World War II.\n  The Claims Act primarily covered compensation for property damage and \nlimited compensation for death or personal injury. Claims for forced \nlabor, forced march, and internment were never compensated because the \nClaims Act excluded these from awardable injuries. The enactment of the \nClaims Act was intended ``to make Guam whole.'' The Claims Act, \nhowever, failed to specify postwar values as a basis for computing \nawards, and settled on prewar values, which did not reflect the true \npostwar replacement costs. Also, all property damage claims in excess \nof $5,000, as well as all death and injury claims, required \nCongressional review and approval. This action caused many eligible \nclaimants to settle for less in order to receive timely compensation. \nThe Claims Act also imposed a one-year time limit to file claims, which \nwas insufficient as massive disruptions still existed following Guam's \nliberation. In addition, English was then a second language to a great \nmany Guamanians. While a large number spoke English, few could read it. \nThis is particularly important since the Land and War Claims Commission \nrequired written statements and often communicated with claimants in \nwriting.\n  The reparations program was also inadequate because it became \nsecondary to overall reconstruction and the building of permanent \nmilitary bases. In this regard, the Congress enacted the Guam Land \nTransfer Act and the Guam Rehabilitation Act (Public Laws 79-225 and \n79-583) as a means of rehabilitating Guam. The Guam Land Transfer Act \nprovided the means of exchanging excess federal land for resettlement \npurposes, and the Guam Rehabilitation Act appropriated $6 million to \nconstruct permanent facilities for the civic populace of the island for \ntheir economic rehabilitation.\n  Approximately $8.1 million was paid to 4,356 recipients under the \nGuam Meritorious Claims Act. Of this amount, $4.3 million was paid to \n1,243 individuals for death, injury, and property damage in excess of \n$5,000, and $3.8 million to 3,113 recipients for property damage of \nless than $5,000.\n\n  On June 3, 1947, former Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes \ntestified before the House Committee on Public Lands relative to the \nOrganic Act, and strongly criticized the Department of the Navy for its \n``inefficient and even brutal handling of the rehabilitation and \ncompensation and war damage tasks.'' Secretary Ickes termed the \nprocedures as ``shameful results.''\n  In addition, a committee known as the Hopkins Committee was \nestablished by former Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in 1947 to \nassess the Navy's administration of Guam and American Samoa. An \nanalysis of the Navy's administration of the reparation and \nrehabilitation programs was provided to Secretary Forrestal in a March \n25, 1947 letter from the Hopkins Committee. The letter indicated that \nthe Department's confusing policy decisions greatly contributed to the \nprograms' deficiencies and called upon the Congress to pass legislation \nto correct its mistakes and provide reparations to the people of Guam.\n  In 1948, the United States Congress enacted the War Claims Act of \n1948 (Public Law 80-896), which provided reparation relief to American \nprisoners\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\nof war, internees, religious organizations, and employees of defense \ncontractors. The residents of Guam were deemed ineligible to receive \nreparations under this Act because they were American nationals and not \nAmerican citizens. In 1950, the United States Congress enacted the Guam \nOrganic Act (81-630), granting Guamanians American citizenship and a \nmeasure of self-government.\n  The Congress, in 1962, amended the War Claims Act to provide benefits \nto claimants who were nationals at the time of the war and later became \ncitizens. Again, the residents of Guam were specifically excluded. The \nCongress believed that the residents of Guam were provided for under \nthe Guam Meritorious Claims Act. At that time, there was no one to \ndefend Guam, as they had no representation in Congress. The Congress \nalso enacted the Micronesian Claims Act for the Trust Territory of the \nPacific Islands, but again excluded Guam in the settlement.\n  In 1988, the now inactive Guam War Reparations Commission documented \n3,365 unresolved claims. There are potentially 5,000 additional \nunresolved claims. In 1946, the United States provided more than $390 \nmillion in reparations to the Philippines, and more than $10 million to \nthe Micronesian Islands in 1971 for atrocities inflicted by Japan.\n  In addition, the United States provided more than $2 billion in \npostwar aid to Japan from 1946 to 1951. Further, the United States \ngovernment liquidated more than $84 million in Japanese assets in the \nUnited States during the war for the specific purpose of compensating \nclaims of its citizens and nationals. The United States did not invoke \nits authority to seize more assets from Japan under Article 14 of the \nTreaty of Peace, as other Allied Powers had done. The United States, \nhowever, did close the door on the claims of the people of Guam.\n  A companion measure to my bill, H.R. 755, was introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Representative Robert Underwood. The issue of \nreparations for Guam is not a new one for the people of Guam and for \nthe United States Congress. It has been consistently raised by the \nGuamanian government through local enactments of legislative bills and \nresolutions, and discussed with Congressional leaders over the years.\n  The Guam War Restitution Act cannot fully compensate or erase the \natrocities inflicted upon Guam and its people during the occupation by \nthe Japanese military. However, passage of this Act would recognize our \ngovernment's moral obligation to Guam, and bring justice to the people \nof Guam for the atrocities and suffering they endured during World War \nII. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \ninserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to redesign \nthe $1 bill so as to incorporate the preamble to the Constitution of \nthe United States, the Bill of Rights, and a list of the Articles of \nthe Constitution on the reverse side of such currency; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                        LIBERTY DOLLAR BILL ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Liberty \nDollar Bill Act.\n  Last year, students at Liberty Middle School in Ashland, Virginia \ncame up with an idea. The measure I introduce today simply implements \ntheir vision. This bill directs the Treasury to place the actual \nlanguage from the Constitution on the back of the one dollar bill.\n  Our founding fathers met in 1787, to write what would become the \nmodel for all modern democracies--the Constitution. Washington, \nMadison, Franklin, Hamilton and many other great Americans met for four \nmonths that year to ignite history's greatest light of government.\n  They argued, fought, and compromised to create a lasting democracy, \nbuilt on a philosophy found in the preamble of the constitution. And \nthey protected this philosophy and these ideals by creating three \nbranches of government and divisions of power between the federal and \nstate governments found in the articles and the amendments of the \nConstitution.\n  Although our currency celebrates the men who first drafted the \nConstitution, it doesn't celebrate their most nobel achievement. \nShouldn't this greatest of American achievements be in the hands of all \nAmericans?\n  All presidents, likewise all public officers, swear to ``preserve, \nprotect and defend'' the Constitution. No country can survive if it \nloses its philosophical moorings. The freedoms and liberties we enjoy \ngive substance, value and meaning to the laws by which we live. Our \nNation's philosophy can be taken for granted in the daily business of \nlawmaking. Yet we can hear in John F. Kennedy's inaugural address that \nwe do not defend America's laws, we defend its philosophy--a philosophy \nembodied in the Constitution.\n  Seventy-five percent of Americans say that ``The Constitution is \nimportant to them, makes them proud, and is relevant to their lives.''\n  So important is this document that we built the Archives in \nWashington to house and safeguard it. Hundreds of thousands go there \neach year to see it. However, ninety-four percent of Americans don't \nknow all of the rights and freedoms found in the First Amendment. \nSixty-two percent of Americans can't name our three branches of \ngovernment.\n  Six hundred thousand legal immigrants come to America each year. \nOften their first sight of America is the Statue of Liberty, holding \nhigh her torch, symbolizing our light and our freedom. Many of these \nimmigrants become American citizens by the naturalization process and \nlearn more about the Constitution than many natural born citizens.\n  If America's most patriotic symbol--the Constitution--were on the \nback of the one dollar bill, wouldn't we all know more about our \nGovernment? The Constitution should be in the hands of every American.\n  Our Constitution is a beacon of light for the world. People \neverywhere should be able to hold up our one dollar bill as a symbol of \nthe freedom of modern democracy.\n  I am proud to join my colleague in the House of Representatives, \nChairman Tom Bliley,  and reintroduce the companion legislation in the \nSenate. The Liberty Dollar Bill Act directs the Secretary of the \nTreasury to incorporate the preamble to the Constitution of the United \nStates, the Bill of Rights, and a list of the Articles of the \nConstitution on the reverse side of the one dollar bill.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the students of Liberty Middle School. \nThe Constitution belongs to the people. It should be in their hands.\n  I want to commend the students of Liberty Middle School and their \nteacher, Mr. Randy Wright for their contribution to our Nation. I hope \nall my\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\ncolleagues in the Senate will see the wisdom of these students and join \nme as a cosponsor of this legislation. Let the Nation hear that the \nyounger generation can provide ideas that become the laws of our land.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 526. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nissuance of tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance public-private \npartnership activities relating to school facilities in public \nelementary and secondary schools, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             the public school construction partnership act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Grassley, \nKerrey, DeWine, Torricelli, and Hutchison to introduce the Public \nSchool Construction Partnership Act. As teachers, students, parents, \nand school administrators know, the United States faces a school \ninfrastructure crisis. Many of our schools are more than 50 years old \nand crumbling, and the General Accounting Office estimates that it will \ncost about $112 billion to bring them into good repair. Moreover, this \nestimate does not take into account the need for new construction. The \nU.S. Department of Education projects that some 1.9 million more \nstudents will be entering schools in the next 10 years. At current \nprices, it will cost about $73 billion to build the new schools needed \nto educate this growing student population. Mr. President, I might add \nthat my own State is gaining 60,000 new students each year. By the end \nof the decade, Florida's student enrollment will have increased 25 \npercent more than the population as a whole.\n  Education is rightfully a state and local matter, but the federal \ngovernment can play a helpful, non-intrusive role in assisting \ncommunities overwhelmed by explosive increases in student enrollment. \nWe at the federal level should help empower local school districts to \nfind innovative, cost effective ways to finance new schools and repair \naging ones.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Grassley provides new \nflexibility to state and local efforts to finance new schools and \nrepair older ones. I believe that we should be providing a ``cafeteria \nplan'' of options to choose from in order to enable local and state \ngovernments to have a variety of financing tools available to them. An \ninnovative means of financing the building or renovation of a school in \nan urban area like Miami won't necessarily be the best option for a \nrural town in Iowa. Therefore, our legislation provides four different \nalternatives to ease the burden of financing public school \nconstruction.\n  One alternative is to add educational facilities to the list of 12 \ntypes of facilities that can use private activity bonds. As you can \nsee, these bonds are used to finance a wide range of public projects: \nfrom airports and mass commuting facilities, to qualified residential \nrental projects and environmental enhancements of hydroelectric \ngenerating facilities.\n  The importance of adding public educational facilities to this list \nis that these bonds would be tax exempt. And I emphasize the word \npublic because private non-profit elementary and secondary schools \nalready have the ability to issue tax-exempt facility bonds. Public \nschools should have the same tax treatment. Our legislation gives \npublic schools parity with private schools.\n  The public/private partnership in school construction through the use \nof private activity bonds is already being used in the Canadian \nProvince of Nova Scotia. Here is how it works: a private corporation \nbuilds the school and leases it to the school district at a reduced \nrate. The private entity supplements the cost of the building by \nleasing it for other uses during non-school hours.\n  This approach has been a success. According to a study by Ron Utt at \nthe Heritage Foundation, 41 new schools have either been completed or \napproved for construction under the Public/Private Partnership Program. \nIn the next three years, Nova Scotia expects to replace 10 percent of \nits schools through such partnerships.\n\n  I am optimistic that enabling communities in the United States to \nhave the same opportunity will foster the same results.\n  Another portion of this legislation would help relieve some of the \nburdens on small and rural school districts.\n  Current law relieves small issuers of tax-exempt bonds for qualified \nschool construction from onerous federal arbitrage regulations, but \nmore relief is needed. The calculations required to determine the \namount of arbitrage rebate are extremely complex and often require that \na local government hire an outside consultant. Despite the trouble and \nexpense of compliance, rebate amounts are usually quite small. Local \ngovernments sometimes spend much more to comply with the rebate rules \nthan the amount actually rebated to the Treasury.\n  This legislation would permit school districts to keep funds earned \non bond proceeds instead of reimbursing the Treasury Department if the \nbonds offered by the district totalled less than $15 million that year, \nor if the bonds are spent within four years.\n  Our legislation would also increase the amount of bonds banks can \nhold and still receive tax exempt status. Currently, banks may deduct \ntheir interest expense for loans if the bonds are less than $10 million \nin a one year period. We would increase that limit to $25 million, \nallowing school bonds to be bought directly by the banks without having \nto undertake the complexities of accessing the public capital markets.\n  Changing these current tax laws would help local school districts \nthroughout the United States. Our legislation would foster even more \ninnovative approaches to finance the building and refurbishment of our \npublic schools. Such public-private partnerships would speed \nconstruction of new schools and reduce costs to communities.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am joining my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Graham, in introducing the School Construction \nFinancing Improvement Act of 1999.\n  The single most important source of funding for investment in public \nschool construction and rehabilitation is the tax-exempt bond market. \nTax-exempt bonds finance approximately 90 percent of the nation's \ninvestment in public schools. In my home state of Iowa over $625 \nmillion in tax-exempt bonds were issued to school districts in 1998 \nalone.\n  There is a well-recongized need throughout the country for billions \nof additional new dollars in school construction and rehabilitation. A \nreport from the General Accounting Office says urban schools alone need \n$112 billion in repairs over three years to bring their buildings back \ninto working order. That same study says about 14 million children \nattend U.S. schools in need of extensive repairs, and about 7 million \nattend schools with life threatening safety code violations.\n  American schoolchildren attending schools with leaky roofs, \ninadequate bathrooms, poor air quality, and unreliable fire protection \nequipment is an unacceptable state of affairs. We need to step up to \nthe plate and address this issue, not only promptly, but also properly. \nThe administration's proposed use of tax credit bonds is inherently \nunworkable and inefficient. The school districts in states all across \nthis land need greater flexibility not more federal regulations and \ncontrols.\n  Tax-exempt bonds have proven to be an effective financial instrument \nto fund school rehabilitation and construction. Therefore, it is \nappropriate and necessary to examine tax code limitations on the use of \ntax-exempt bonds for schools and to consider ways to amend the code to \ngive school districts even greater access to the capital they earnestly \nneed and deserve. Let's expand on something that works.\n  The administration has proposed policy initiatives to enhance and \nexpand the use of tax credit bonds called ``Qualified Zone Academy \nBonds'' or QZABs. However the QZAB program has proven incapable of \nattracting investors due to inherent flaws in tax credit bonds that \nmake them extremely illiquid and unpredictable investments, and \nspecific limitations on the use of these bonds imposed by the federal \ngovernment on the states. These significant and crippling limitations \ninclude the exclusion of individual investors from purchasing QZABs,\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\nthe requirement that school districts secure hard to come by ``private \nbusiness contributions'', and prohibitions on the use of QZABs to fund \nnew school construction projects.\n  Experience and study has shown that tax exempt bonds are a more \nworkable, more efficient, and more popular alternative to QZABs. This \nbill reflects my belief that the wisest course to achieving the goal of \nproviding schools with necessary capital to build and rehabilitate our \nnation's schools is to continue refining tax code limitations on the \nuse of tax-exempt bonds.\n  The legislation Senator Graham and I are introducing today is \ndesigned to narrowly target the use of tax-exempt bonds to school \nconstruction alone and do not change any tax code provisions designed \nto prevent abuse of bond issuance authority.\n  The first provision would allow school districts to make use of \npublic-private partnerships in issuing tax-exempt bonds for public \nschool construction or rehabilitation. The bonds would be exempt from \nthe annual state volume caps. This will allow schools to leverage \nprivate investment in school facilities and would encourage school \ndistricts to partner with private investors in new and creative ways.\n  The second provision addresses the current two year construction \nspend-down exemption in arbitrage rebate regulations. This policy \nallows the exemption of bonds from arbitrage rebate if the issuer \nspends virtually all its bond proceeds within two years of the time \nthese bonds for construction projects are issued. We recommend an \nextension of this exemption from two years to four years for school \nbonds. Often the two year limit is insufficient to cover major \nconstruction projects, especially when multiple projects are funded \nfrom a single bond issue. The extension of time limit on the exemption \nprovision will also improve the flexibility of school districts that \nuse bonds and relive the school bond issuer from superfluous and \nburdensome tax compliance costs.\n  The second provision would also raise from $10 million to $15 million \nthe volume of school construction bonds a small school district could \nissue each year and still qualify for the small-issuer arbitrage rebate \nexemption. This provision expands the benefits of the small-issuer \nrebate exemption to a much broader universe of small school bond \nissuers.\n  The third provision of the bill would permit banks to invest in \ncertain qualified tax-exempt school construction bonds without penalty. \nBefore the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that imposed a tax penalty on banks \nthat earn tax-exempt interest, commercial banks were one of the most \nactive groups of investors in the municipal bond market. This provision \nwould directly reduce the cost of borrowing for new school construction \nand would result in more investment in public schools.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Graham and myself in trying to \nhelp schools receive the crucial funds necessary to build and repair \nAmerica's schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 527. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to suspend temporarily the duty with respect to the personal \neffects of participants in certain athletic events; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\ntreatment of personal effects of participants in certain world athletic \n                                 events\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am introducing today an amendment to \nsubchapter II of chapter 99 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the \nUnited States. My amendment would allow athletes participating in world \nevents, such as the Salt Lake 2002 Winter Olympic Games, to bring into \nthe United States, duty free, such personal effects as equipment \nexpressly used in the sporting events, and then re-exported with \ndeparting athletes at the termination of the events.\n  This bill is needed to relieve both Customs officials and event \nparticipants of immense amounts of documentation required in the past \nfor such exceptions to Customs laws and practices. However, this \namendment does not exempt such items from inspection by Customs \nofficials, inspections which can be made entirely on their discretion, \nnor does it allow the entry of items barred under current law. This \nsame bill, which I introduced in the prior, 105th Congress was \nfavorably reported out by both the House Ways and Means Committee and \nthe Senate Finance Committee, and incorporated in the Omnibus Trade \nBill which failed passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 528. A bill to provide for a private right of action in the case \nof injury from the importation of certain dumped and subsidized \nmerchandise; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 unfair foreign competition act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose \nof introducing the Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 1999. This \nlegislation is in response to a crisis facing the steel industry in the \nUnited States as a result of subsidized and dumped goods coming into \nthe United States from a variety of countries--from Russia, from \nBrazil, from Japan, from Indonesia--where steel is being sold in the \nUnited States at far under cost of production and far under the price \nsteel is being sold for in those countries.\n  We know the financial problems which are present now in Russia where \nthey are very anxious to have dollars and are selling steel in America \nfor anything, virtually, that they can get for it. A similar problem \nhas arisen with respect to other countries.\n  The steel industry has modernized, spending some $50 billion, and \nsimply cannot compete with this kind of subsidy on dumped goods. \nThousands of steelworkers are losing their jobs. A few years back there \nwere 500,000 steelworkers in the United States; now that number is down \nto about 160,000, and more are going daily and weekly as a result of \nthis dumped steel coming into the United States.\n  The existing laws are totally insufficient. When the administrative \nprocedures are taken under existing law, it takes months. For example, \ncomplaints filed in September of 1998 will not be heard, adjudicated, \ndecided, until May. Then there will be some retroactive duty \nimposition. Meanwhile, thousands of steelworkers will be losing their \njobs. The steel industry will be suffering tremendous losses from which \nit cannot recover.\n  Beyond the issue of the industry itself and the workers, we have the \nparamount issue on national defense, the industrial base for the United \nStates.\n  My legislation would provide a private right of action so that \ninjured parties could go into a Federal court, into a court of equity, \nand get immediate relief. This legislation is similar to legislation \nwhich I have introduced as far back as 1982 where I sought injunctive \nrelief. It now appears that injunctive relief is not consistent with \nGATT, although GATT international trade laws are consistent with U.S. \ntrade laws which prohibit subsidized or dumped goods from coming into \nthe United States.\n  The remedy which is provided in this bill would be that tariffs would \nbe imposed at the direction of the Federal court as the form of \nequitable relief, and these tariffs would then be paid over to the \ndamaged parties--to the steelworkers who had sustained damages as a \nresult of losing their jobs and to the steel companies which had \nsustained damages from loss of sales as a result of this illegal steel \ncoming into the United States which is dumped or subsidized.\n  There have been rallies held across the United States and on the west \nend of the Capitol not too long ago. The Senate Steel Caucus, which I \nhave the privilege to chair, has had a series of hearings, including \none in Pittsburgh on February 18.\n  There are a variety of legislative proposals now pending before the \nCongress: Tariffs, changing the U.S. law to conform to international \nlaws to make it easier to get relief under 201 and 301. But there is \nnothing on the books which would be as effective as the kind of \nequitable relief which would be provided by this private right of \naction. There is litigation pending now in the Federal court in Ohio \nbrought by Wheeling-Pittsburgh where, after I conferred with the \nofficials of that company, they brought an equity action in the State \ncourts seeking equitable relief, and it has since been transferred to \nthe Federal courts. I believe that cause of action, that claim for \nrelief in the Federal court, is well founded.\n  This legislation would remove any doubt that the injured parties--the\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\nworkers, the companies, injured parties--would have a right to go into \nFederal court to get this relief on a prompt basis.\n  In a court of equity, as the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, \nhaving litigated extensively himself, it is possible to get a temporary \nrestraining order, a TRO, on an ex parte basis by the filing of \naffidavits. When that is done, then there has to be a hearing within 5 \ndays where the moving party then seeks a preliminary injunction. Then \nthe court hears the evidence and makes a determination as to a \npreliminary injunction, and then further hearings to make a \ndetermination as to a permanent injunction. I outline that very, very \nbriefly to signify the speed that you can have action if you go into \nthe Federal court.\n  A court of equity is designed to provide prompt relief upon the \nshowing of the requisite proofs. The difficulty with waiting for \nadministrative action, action by the executive branch, is that we know \nas a matter of experience that the executive branch defers to foreign \npolicy or defense policy.\n\n  There is grave concern in the administration, expressed by a variety \nof administration officials, about what will happen to the Russian \neconomy. Of course, there are grounds for concern about the Russian \neconomy but not sufficient concerns so as to override what will happen \nto the American steel industry. What happens to the Russians is \nimportant but, frankly, not as important to this Senator as what \nhappens to Pennsylvanians or to people in West Virginia or to people in \nIndiana, Ohio, or Illinois--to mention only a few of the States which \nare impacted by these subsidized and dumped goods.\n  I am reminded, Mr. President, about an event back in 1984 when there \nwas a favorable ruling for the steel industry from the International \nTrade Commission. The President had the authority to override that \ndetermination. My then colleague Senator Heinz and I made the rounds of \nthe International Trade Representative, William Brock, and of the \nSecretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldrige, and we found great sympathy \nwith having the laws of the United States and the international trade \nlaws enforced. When we talked to the Secretary of State and the \nSecretary of Defense, they were more concerned about their problems--\nforeign policy and defense policy. Ultimately, the President overruled \nthe International Trade Commission to the detriment of the American \nsteel industry. Regrettably, that is what happens.\n  We have had meetings of the Steel Caucus with the key officials of \nthe executive branch. When it comes to the Secretary of Commerce or the \nTrade Representative, there has been a certain amount of sympathy for \nthe position of the steel industry.\n  What we need to do is to take this issue out of international \npolitics--politics at the highest level, where there are concerns for \nforeign policy or defense policy--and move it into court, where the \nrule of law will govern and where, on a showing that there is a \nviolation of U.S. trade laws, a showing of a violation of international \ntrade laws, and there is a remedy which is GATT consistent, which is to \nimpose tariffs. The approach of having the tariffs then paid over to \nthe damaged parties is an idea which was originated by the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, on legislation which \nhe has introduced.\n  When we had sought injunctive relief, it had been sufficient just to \nstop the steel from coming into the United States immediately, and then \nthere would have been no further damage. That is not GATT consistent. \nIt is GATT consistent to have duties imposed, and then if any steel \ncomes in, those duties ought to be a deterrent to stop dumped and \nsubsidized steel from coming into the United States. But to the extent \nany further steel comes in, those duties would be collected by the \nTreasury and then paid over to the injured parties--the steelworkers \nwho have lost wages or lost their jobs, or the industry which has been \ndamaged by this illegal dumping and this illegal subsidy.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to reintroduce legislation \nto provide for a private right of action for an injured party to sue in \nFederal court to stop goods from coming into this country which are \nsubsidized, dumped or otherwise sold in violation of our trade laws. My \nlegislation, the Unfair Foreign Competition Act of 1999, is based on \nlegislation I have introduced since 1982 and most recently during the \n103rd Congress in 1993.\n  I have revised the legislation so that at the conclusion of the case \nand upon the finding of liability, the court will direct the Customs \nService to assess an antidumping duty on the dumped or subsidized \nproduct. Duties collected will be distributed to steelworkers for \ndamages sustained from loss of wages resulting from loss of jobs due to \nillegal imports, and the affected domestic producers of the product for \nqualifying expenditures which may include equipment, research and \ndevelopment, personnel training, acquisition of technology, health care \nbenefits, pension benefits, environmental equipment, training or \ntechnology, acquisition of raw materials, or borrowed working capital.\n  I am introducing this legislation to respond to the substantial \ndumping of foreign goods on the U.S. market, particularly steel. As \nHank Barnette, chief executive officer of Bethlehem Steel, wrote as \nearly as in an August 6, 1998 op-ed in the Washington Times, the United \nStates has become ``The Dumping Ground'' for foreign steel. He noted \nthat Russia has become the world's number one steel exporting nation \nand that China is now the world's number one steel-producing nation, \nwhile enormous subsidies to foreign steel. As one example, Mr. Barnette \ncited the Commerce Department's revelation that Russia, one of the \nworld's least efficient producers, was selling steel plate in the \nUnited States at more than 50 percent or $110 per ton below the \nconstructed cost to make this product, which ultimately costs our steel \ncompanies in lost sales and results in fewer jobs for American workers.\n  As chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I am well aware that the \ncurrent financial crisis in Asia and elsewhere has generated surges in \nU.S. imports of steel. Recently released statistics by the Department \nof Commerce note that the year-to-date final statistics through \nNovember of 1998 show steel imports of 35.1 million metric tons, an \nincrease of 8.7 million metric tons over the 26.4 million metric tons \nthrough November 1997. While the preliminary data on steel imports for \nDecember 1998 shows a decrease in imports of hot-rolled steel products, \none month is not a trend. In fact, overall steel imports in 1998 were \nconsiderably higher than in 1997, and total imports of hot-rolled steel \nwere up 73 percent from 1997 to 1998. The flooding of steel on the U.S. \nmarket from Asian countries, as well as countries of the former Soviet \nUnion and Brazil, have led the Senate and House Steel Caucuses to hold \njoint hearings and receive testimony from steel company executives and \nunion representatives on the growing problems of steel imports and \ntheir troubling effect on our economy and our ability to retain high-\npaying jobs.\n  I believe in free trade. But the essence of free trade is selling \ngoods at a price equal to the cost of production and a reasonable \nprofit. Where you have dumping--the sale of goods in the United States \nat prices lower than the price at which such goods are being sold by \nthe producing companies in their own country or in some other country--\nit is the antithesis of free trade. We have too long sacrificed \nAmerican industry and American jobs in the name of foreign policy or \ndefense policy, without having the proper enforcement of the laws \nbecause the executive branch, whether it is a Democratic administration \nor a Republican administration, has made concessions for foreign policy \nand defense interests.\n  For many years, foreign policy and defense policy have superseded \nbasic fairness on trade policy. I received a comprehensive education on \nthis subject back in 1984 when there was a favorable ruling by the ITC \nfor the American steel industry, but it was subject to review by the \nPresident. At that time my colleagues, Senator Heinz and I visited \nevery one of the Cabinet officers in an effort to get support to see to \nit that International Trade Commission ruling in favor of the American \nsteel industry was upheld. Then-Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige \nwas favorable, and International Trade Representative Bill Brock was \nfavorable. We received a favorable hearing in all quarters until we \nspoke with then-Secretary of State Shultz and\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\nthen-Secretary of Defense Weinberger who were absolutely opposed to the \nITC ruling. President Reagan decided to overrule the ITC, and U.S. \ntrade policy and workers again took second place to foreign policy \nconcerns.\n  In the current environment, I believe more than ever that it is \nnecessary for an injured industry to have an opportunity to go into \nfederal court and seek enforcement of America's trade laws, which are \ncurrently not being enforced adequately by the executive branch.\n  The only way to handle these important issues is to see to it that \nthere is a private right of action, which is a time-honored approach in \nthe context of antitrust law. I believe this is absolutely necessary if \nthe steel industry and other U.S. industries subject to unfair foreign \ncompetition are to have fairness and to be able to stop foreign \nsubsidized and dumped products from coming into this country.\n\n\n                    current administrative remedies\n\n  I have long been concerned about the export of subsidized or dumped \ngoods to the U.S. market and its impact on U.S. jobs and industries. \nEven when our government does act aggressively to enforce U.S. trade \nlaws, the process is extremely time consuming. It can take months after \nfiling a dumping action for the Commerce Department to complete its \ninvestigations, from the summary investigation to determine the \nadequacy of the petition, to the formal investigation of the evidence \npresented. The Commerce Department then issues a preliminary \ndetermination that products are being sold in the United States at less \nthan fair value. The Department must then make a final determination, \nwhich can consume several more months. In order to secure any relief, \nthough, the International Trade Commission (ITC) must also \nindependently review the case and make a determination about whether \nthe imports materially injure, or threaten to injure, the U.S. \nindustry. If the ITC finds injury or threat of injury, the Commerce \nDepartment instructs the Customs Service to collect antidumping duties.\n  In the current hot-rolled carbon steel case currently before the \nAdministration, the petitioners filed on September 30, 1998. The \ninvestigation by the Commerce Department's International Trade \nAdministration was not initiated until October 15, 1998. On November \n23, 1998, the Commerce Department found ``critical circumstances'' in \nthe case. Commerce determined that there was a surge in imports from \nJapan and Russia. This determination, coupled with the preliminary \ninjury decision, allows the Commerce Department to assess duties \nretroactively 90 days from the preliminary determination. On February \n12, 1999, the Department of Commerce determined the preliminary dumping \nmargin for Japan and Brazil. Later, on February 22, a preliminary \ndumping margin for Russia was determined. The Commerce Department then \ninstructed U.S. Customs to require deposits or bonds on imported steel \nfrom these countries for 90 days prior to the dumping margin \ndetermination and for any steel from these countries brought in after \nthe determination. The Department of Commerce is not expected to make a \nfinal determination until May 5, 1999; however, the assessment of \nduties is contingent on a favorable determination on injury to the \ndomestic industry made by the International Trade Commission on June \n12, 1999.\n  Assuming that all decisions are favorable, the petitioning industry \nwill have waited for months before any action is taken to remedy the \ninjury done to the industry and its workers. Therefore, a private right \nof action is necessary to enable our domestic industries to counter \nforeign subsidies, dumping, and customs fraud in a timely manner. My \nbill accomplishes this by providing timely relief by allowing for the \nrecovery of tariffs as a result of the illegal import.\n  We have seen a long history where American industries have been \nprejudiced, and American jobs have been lost, due to subsidized and \ndumped goods coming into this country. There is no adequate remedy at \nthe present time to provide domestic industries with timely relief from \nthe damage caused by such imports.\n\n\n           history of the private right of action legislation\n\n  Since entering the Senate, I have been actively involved on this \nissue. On March 4, 1982, I introduced S. 2167 to provide a private \nright of action in federal courts to enforce existing laws prohibiting \nillegal dumping or subsidizing of foreign imports. Hearings were held \non this bill before the Judiciary Committee on May 24 and June 24, \n1982. On December 15, 1982, I offered the text of this bill on the \nSenate floors as an amendment, which was tabled by a slim margin of 51 \nto 47.\n  During the 96th Congress, I reintroduced this legislation as S. 416 \non February 3, 1983. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this \nbill on March 21, 1983. I offered the text of S. 418 as an amendment to \nthe Omnibus Tariff and Trade Act of 1984 on September 19, 1984; the \namendment was tabled.\n  During the 99th Congress, I reintroduced this legislation as S. 236; \nI expanded the scope of this bill to include customs fraud violations \nand introduced S. 1655 on September 18, 1985, and the Judiciary \nCommittee favorably reported the bill by unanimous voice vote on March \n20, 1986. The Finance Subcommittee on International Trade held a \nhearing on S. 1655 pursuant to a sequential referral agreement. \nSignificant progress was made toward reaching a unanimous consent \nagreement for full Senate consideration of S. 1655 prior to adjournment \nof the 99th Congress, but the press of other business prevented its \ncoming to the floor for action.\n  In the 100th Congress, I reintroduced comprehensive legislation, S. \n361, to provide a private right of action in Federal court to enforce \nexisting laws prohibiting illegal dumping or customs fraud.\n  I expanded the scope of this bill in S. 1396, which I introduced on \nJune 19, 1987, to revise the subsidy provision to include a private \nright of action to allow injured American parties to sue in Federal \ncourt for injunctive relief against, and monetary damages from, foreign \nmanufacturers and exporters who receive subsidies and any importer \nrelated to the manufacturer or exporter. This bill would have provided \na comprehensive approach to address three of the most \npernicious, unfair export strategies used by foreign companies against \nAmerican companies: dumping, subsidies, and customs fraud.\n\n  During full Senate consideration of the Omnibus Trade and \nCompetitiveness Act (S. 490), I filed the text of S. 1396 as Amendment \nNo. 315 on June 19, 1987, and offered it as an amendment to the trade \nbill on June 25, 1987. This amendment, however, was tabled. I again \nfiled the text of this bill as an amendment to the Textile and Apparel \nTrade Act, S. 2662, on September 9, 1988, and to the Technical \nCorrections Act, S. 2238, on September 29, 1988.\n  On July 15, 1987, I joined Senator Heinz as an original cosponsor of \nan amendment to S. 490 to provide a private right of action in the U.S. \nCourt of International Trade for damages from customs fraud. Although \nthe amendment was accepted by the Senate, it unfortunately was dropped \nin conference.\n  In the 102nd Congress, I introduced similar legislation, S. 2508, \nbecause the Voluntary Restraint Agreements program was allowed to lapse \nin spite of the fact that no multilateral steel agreement was in place. \nIn fact, as announced by the United States Trade Representative, talks \non the steel accord had broken down. I might add that this was somewhat \nstrange, Mr. President, if not incomprehensible. The steel industry had \nbeen awaiting an agreement on a multilateral steel accord which would \nhave prevented subsidized and dumped goods from coming into the United \nStates, and then there was a specific recognition by the Trade \nRepresentative, that the effort failed. Not to extend the voluntary \nrestraint program at that time was a bit mystifying. In any event, the \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported S. 2508 by unanimous voice vote \non August 12, 1992. Again, the press of other business prevented the \nSenate from taking up this legislation on the floor.\n  In the 103rd Congress, I introduced this legislation again, S. 332, \nin an effort to move the legislative process forward. The legislation \nwas referred to the Judiciary Committee, but once again, the press of \nSenate business prevented further action on the bill.\n\n\n                 UNFAIR FOREIGN COMPETITION ACT OF 1999\n\n  In the 104th Congress, Senator Kohl and I introduced legislation to \ncriminalize economic espionage, which was\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\nultimately enacted into law. The bill that I am introducing toady, the \nUnfair Foreign Competition Act of 1999 will help to combat another form \nof illegality--the illegal subsidization and dumping of foreign \nproducts into U.S. markets, which steal jobs from our workers, profits \nfrom our companies and economic growth from our economy.\n  This legislation provides a private right of action in federal courts \nfor individuals or corporations who have been injured by dumping, \nsubsides, or customs fraud violations. The bill will enable industries \nto seek relief through the Federal courts to halt the illegal \nimportation of products.\n  There is nothing like the vigor of private plaintiffs when it comes \nto the enforcement of our trade laws. We need vigorous private \nenforcement--that this bill would spur--if we are to successfully chart \na course between the grave dangers of increased protectionism and the \ncertain peril which would result from unabated illegal foreign imports.\n  I believe the bill I am introducing today would have an important \ndeterrent effect on the practices of our foreign trading partners. \nUnder this bill, an injured party could file suit in the U.S. federal \ndistrict court for the District of Columbia or the Court of \nInternational Trade. If dumping or subsidies and injury are found, the \ncourt would then direct the Customs Service to assess duties on future \nimportation of the article in question.\n  Since current administrative remedies are not consistently and \neffectively enforced through the Commerce Department and the World \nTrade Organization, this private right of action is necessary to \nenforce the spirit of the law.\n  A reason to support this bill lies in its simplicity. We can enact \nthis legislation immediately without interfering with or precluding \nmore complex set of initiatives. The essence of this bill is to promote \nenforcement of existing trade laws and agreements, and, therefore, use \nour existing trade laws as our best defense against unfair foreign \npractices. My bill will free private enterprise to pursue remedies \nwithout delay and put a halt to many discriminatory trade practices.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me now in supporting this legislation to \nprovide relief to he unfair trade practices which constrain our \nnation's industry. We should be proud of the many improvements made by \nour industrial base over the past decade. Our corporations invested \ncapital and the quality of our products has risen dramatically; \nhowever, our nation's workers have suffered significant job losses \nwhile our corporations have tried to become more lean and competitive. \nClearly our business sector and each and every American has \nparticipated in and borne the burden of improving our competitive \nposition.\n  Even these significant advances however, are insufficient to compete \nin the face of illegal trade practices such as dumping, subsidies, and \ncustoms fraud. The best way to handle these trade issues is to provide \na private right of action which will allow U.S. industries the ability \nto stop foreign subsidies and dumping on the U.S. market in a timely \nfashion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url":

The \n     administrative and funding mechanisms that help schools in 1 \n     State improve may not prove successful in other States.\n       (2) Although the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 and other Federal education statutes afford flexibility \n     to State and local educational agencies in implementing \n     Federal programs, certain requirements of Federal education \n     statutes or regulations may impede local efforts to reform \n     and improve education.\n       (3) By granting waivers of certain statutory and regulatory \n     requirements, the Federal Government can remove impediments \n     for local educational agencies in implementing educational \n     reforms and raising the achievement levels of all children.\n       (4) State educational agencies are closer to local school \n     systems, implement statewide educational reforms with both \n     Federal and State funds, and are responsible for maintaining \n     accountability for local activities consistent with State \n     standards and assessment systems. Therefore, State \n     educational agencies are often in the best position to align \n     waivers of Federal and State requirements with State and \n     local initiatives.\n       (5) The Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act \n     allows State educational agencies the flexibility to waive \n     certain Federal requirements, along with related State \n     requirements, but allows only 12 States to qualify for such \n     waivers.\n       (6) Expansion of waiver authority will allow for the waiver \n     of statutory and regulatory requirements that impede \n     implementation of State and local educational improvement \n     plans, or that unnecessarily burden program administration, \n     while maintaining the intent and purposes of affected \n     programs, and maintaining such fundamental requirements as \n     those relating to civil rights, educational equity, and \n     accountability.\n       (7) To achieve the State goals for the education of \n     children in the State, the focus must be on results in \n     raising the achievement of all students, not process.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Local educational agency; state educational agency.--\n     The terms ``local educational agency'' and ``State \n     educational agency'' have the meanings given such terms in \n     section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965.\n       (2) Outlying area.--The term ``outlying area'' means Guam, \n     American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of \n     Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the \n     Federated States of Micronesia.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Education.\n       (4) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the 50 States, \n     the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, \n     and each outlying area.\n\n     SEC. 4.

On \nMarch 19th and 20th, he will be honored by Congregation Or Shalom on \nhis 18th anniversary as spiritual leader of the synagogue.\n  This is a significant milestone for Rabbi Wainhaus and his \ncongregation. Through his leadership at Congregation Or Shalom he has \nconstantly worked to reach out to every member of the congregation, \nyoung and old, and keep them involved in all aspects of congregation \nlife. He has particularly reached out to young adults as they have left \nhome for college and careers in order to keep them connected to their \nfamilies and community.\n  He has helped provide guidance and insight to innumerable people not \njust at Congregation Or Shalom but within the community as a whole. We \ncurrently face difficult times, and it is our families and friends, \ncombined with our churches and synagogues, that provide the support \nsystems which allow us to confront and overcome the challenges set \nbefore us. Through his service, Rabbi Wainhaus has helped many families \nover the years surmount these obstacles and make positive contributions \nto their communities.\n  As this congregation has grown over the years, with God's divine \nassistance, Rabbi Wainhaus has touched many lives throughout the \ncommunity. The people of Connecticut thank Rabbi Wainhaus for his \nservice, dedication, and contribution to our state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2228-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TAX TREATMENT FOR DOMESTIC DISTILLERIES\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I signed on as a cosponsor \nof S. 434, Senator Breaux's proposal to equalize the tax treatment for \ndomestic distilleries compared to their foreign competitors.\n  This is a good bill, and I hope it passes Congress. It would help cut \nunnecessary taxes for our domestic distilleries, and eliminate a \ncompetitive advantage that our current tax rules give to foreign \ndistilleries. I will certainly do what I can to help pass Senator \nBreaux's bill.\n  Mr. President, I am submitting this statement for the Congressional \nRecord to make one thing perfectly clear. In supporting this bill, I \nwant the Administration, and officials at the Treasury Department and \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to understand that by doing \nso I reject the connection that some have tried to make between the All \nin bond issue and Section 5010 of the tax code, the wine and flavors \ntax credit. I know that the suggestion has been made that any revenue \nloss to the U.S. Treasury caused by changes to the All in Bond rules be \noffset by repealing Section 5010. I reject that notion because there is \nno logical link between the two issues; the ``connection'' is a \nbureaucratic fiction.\n  Some who served with me on the conference committee that helped write \nthe tax provisions in the 1995 Balanced Budget Act will probably \nremember my successful efforts to eliminate a provision in the Senate \nbill that would have repealed Section 5010. My position on this matter \nhas not changed, and it is one issue on which I continue to keep a \nclose eye because of its importance to Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2228-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2228-S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BLIND PERSONS EARNINGS EQUITY ACT\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the \nBlind Persons Earnings Equity Act, a bill that will open up a world of \nopportunities for blind persons and greatly improve their lives. \nCurrently, the blind are discouraged from working by an overly \nrestrictive provision in the Social Security Act that limits the amount \nof income they may earn for themselves. The Blind Persons Earnings \nEquity Act would raise that earnings restriction and lessen the burden \nof at least one of the many obstacles to employment faced by the blind \ntoday.\n  Blindness has profoundly adverse social and economic consequences, \nand Social Security benefits are needed to offset the disadvantages \nsuffered by the blind. However, these same laws that are meant to help, \nmust be revised when it becomes clear they are hindering blind persons \nfrom joining the workforce and discouraging them from becoming fully \nengaged in society.\n  Instead of encouraging the blind to develop job skills and become \nproductive members of their communities, the law addressed by this bill \npenalizes them. Once their earnings rise above an amount that is barely \nsufficient to cover the most basic living expenses, their Social \nSecurity benefits are cut completely. No wonder it is estimated that \nover seventy percent of the employable blind population is either \nunemployed or underemployed.\n  This statistic, however, does not represent an unwillingness to work. \nOn the contrary, the blind want to work and take great pride in \ndeveloping the necessary skills that enable them to contribute to \nsociety.\n  I had the honor of knowing personally a great American leader who \njust happened to be blind. His name was Dr. Kenneth Jernigan and for \nover 25 years he led the organized blind movement in the United States. \nAs President for the National Federation of the Blind, he moved the \nnational headquarters to Baltimore where I had the opportunity to meet \nhim. Sadly, Dr. Jernigan passed away last year.\n  Dr. Jernigan may have been blind in the physical sense, Mr. \nPresident, but he was a man of vision nonetheless. In his leadership of \nthe National Federation of the Blind, he taught all of us to understand \nthat eyesight and insight are not related to each other in any way. \nAlthough he did not have eyesight, his insight on life, learning, and \nleading has no equal. Dr. Jernigan devoted his life to empowering the \nblind and encouraging them to be active members of society. He fought \nto improve their access to information, education, jobs, and public \nfacilities.\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\n  The overly restrictive earnings cap in the Social Security Act \nrepresents precisely the kind of unfair law and barrier to employment \nthat Dr. Jernigan battled throughout his life. He knew first hand about \nthe devastating impact that restrictions such as this could have on the \naspirations and hope of blind persons already struggling to overcome \ntremendous challenges.\n  Congress itself has recognized the overly restrictive nature of this \nearnings cap. In 1996, we raised the cap for senior citizens with \npassage of the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act. However, the \nearnings limitation for blind individuals was left unchanged. Up until \nthat point, for almost twenty years, the same earnings cap had applied \nto both senior citizens and blind persons under the Social Security \nAct. With passage of the 1996 Freedom to Work Act, seniors were \nencouraged to remain active and continue working, but the disincentive \nto work was unfortunately left in place for the blind. Consequently, by \n2002, seniors will be permitted to earn up to $30,000, but blind people \nwho earn over $14,800 (less than half as much) will lose their \nbenefits.\n  There is no justification for raising the earnings cap for one group \nand not the other. Why should we distinguish between two groups that \nfor over twenty years were treated even-handedly under the law? What \nhas changed to cause us to discriminate between the two and encourage \none to work while greatly limiting the opportunities of the other? By \nreestablishing parity in the treatment of blind persons and senior \ncitizens under the Social Security Act, this legislation will restore \nfairness to this law and will remedy a policy that has kept the blind \nlocked out of rewarding, self-fulfilling employment.\n  Although a small number of blind persons may become newly eligible \nfor benefits as a result of this change, their number will be a mere \nfraction of the thousands who do not work because of the disincentive \nimposed by this earnings limit. By enabling these beneficiaries to \nwork, the overall net effect of this bill will be to increase payments \nto the Social Security trust funds and bring additional revenue to the \nFederal Treasury as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this necessary legislation that will \nensure the blind are treated fairly under the law and will empower \nthousands of blind beneficiaries to become more engaged in society \nthrough productive employment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2229-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO STUDENT VOLUNTEERS\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate and honor two young Oregonians who have received national \nrecognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Mr. \nCody Hill of Portland and Mr. Quinn Wilhelmi of Eugene have recently \nbeen named State Honorees from Oregon in the 1999 Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity Awards program, an annual honor confered on only one high \nschool student and one middle-level student in each state, the District \nof Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. Cody Hill, nominated by Lincoln High School, created and \ncurrently coordinates a program called ``Guns Aren't Fun,'' a toy gun \ntrade-in event to encourage kids to trade in their toy guns for other \nnon-violent toys. His idea is currently being developed into a non-\nprofit organization to spread the message of non-violence across the \ncountry. Due to Cody's hard work and determination, more than one \nhundred toy guns have been turned in during two trade-in events. Cody \nhas worked closely with local non-profit organizations and, to date, he \nhas collected over $13,000 for the purchase of new toys. Cody has also \nreceived recognition in local newspaper detailing his volunteer work.\n  Mr. Quinn Wilhelmi, nominated by Roosevelt Middle School, began a \ntutoring program with fifth grade students in his former elementary \nschool. Quinn's program works to develop the student's writing skills \nby helping them compose their autobiographies. Through his initiative, \nQuinn was able to recruit several of his classmates to join in this \neffort as well, and he has made a tremendous impact on several younger \nstudents while working as a writing mentor.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are \nless involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that \nwe encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young \npeople have made. Young volunteers like Cody and Quinn are inspiring \nexamples to us all, and are among our brightest hopes for a better \ntomorrow. I applaud them for their initiative in seeking to make their \ncommunities better places to live, and for the positive impact that \nthey had on the lives of others. In recognition of their efforts, Cody \nand Quinn will come to Washington, DC in early May, along with other \n1999 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country. While in \nWashington, ten students will be named America's top youth volunteers \nof the year by a distinguished national selection committee.\n  I would also like to recognize four other young Oregonians who were \nrecognized as Distinguished Finalists for their outstanding volunteer \nservice: April Choate of Bend, Jennifer Fletcher of Portland, Julia \nHyde of Portland, and Tiffany Wright of Springfield. They deserve high \npraise for their hard work and determination in helping others in their \ncommunities.\n  It is clear that these young people have demonstrated a level of \ncommitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary, and I \nbelieve they deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions \nshow that young Americans can, and do, play important roles in their \ncommunities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold \ntremendous promise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2229-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2229-S2230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IMPEACHMENT TRIAL PROCEDURES\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with the impeachment trial now \nbehind us, I wanted to take a moment to make a few comments about the \nprocess that we experienced and suggest some of the lessons that we \nlearned. I hope that in the weeks and months to come, we can look back \ndispassionately and try to take advantage of those lessons to make some \nchanges in the Senate's rules that might serve us well in future \nimpeachment trials.\n  The process used in the impeachment trial in the Senate was \nimperfect, but this is not surprising. The only truly apposite source \nof precedents took place more than 130 years ago. The value of the \nJohnson procedural precedents has been undermined in part by the \nchanges in our politics, our culture and our technology.\n  There are many aspects of the trial that history will undoubtedly \nlook upon with favor. Chief Justice Rehnquist, a son of Shorewood, \nWisconsin, presided fairly and with dignity. His few rulings were not \nchallenged. Perhaps most important, he provided a steady hand with a \ndose of humor. We are all in his debt.\n  In addition, senators approached the trial with dignity and \ncollegiality. At the moment of greatest tension between the advocates, \ngood will among senators never faltered. I understand that this may, in \npart, be due to the fact that the ultimate outcome of this trial was \nnever in doubt. Having said that, however, senators, really without \nexception, took their duties and each other seriously. The impeachment \nof a president is a painful process, and, as I will discuss further in \na moment, it ought to be painful. The stakes were very high in this \ntrial, yet the Senate remained a place of civility. This was in stark \ncontrast to the impeachment process in the House of Representatives. I \nhope the relative harmony in the Senate restored to this process some \nof the legitimacy lost in the partisan din of the other body.\n  The House Managers and the President's counsel did well in their \nindividual presentations. At the outset we senators caucused together \nand reached a fair, if imperfect, roadmap for the early stages of the \ntrial. Ultimately, we agreed on a procedural course that took us \nthrough the verdict. The tone throughout was civil and the arguments, \nby and large, on point.\n  But we did tie the hands of the advocates in some ways, and perhaps \ndenied ourselves the fullest possible presentation of the evidence and \narguments. The trial consisted, except for the unusual, and not always \nhelpful, question period, of opening arguments followed\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\nby several iterations of closing arguments. These arguments were \ninterspersed with video snippets from grand jury depositions and \ndepositions by the House Managers. This arrangement, pieced together as \nwe went along, did not always make for a coherent narrative.\n  The House Managers' theory of the case required us to accept a \nnarrative, a story of conspiracy, lies and efforts to thwart justice. \nAs they told the story, each sinister act was offered as evidence of \nthe coherent whole. They had trouble telling a story, due partly to \nflaws in their theory and, to be fair, perhaps in small part due to \nflaws in our process. We had no live witnesses. The parties alternated \ncontrol of the floor, creating a dynamic of thrust and parry, rather \nthan a methodically constructed narrative.\n  The managers' complaints about the process in turn became a recurrent \ntheme in their arguments, resulting in greater, and sometimes unfair, \nlatitude for them in their efforts to make the case. For example, on a \ndisappointing party line vote, the President was denied fair notice of \nthe snippets of taped testimony that would be woven into the House \nManagers' arguments. Then the Senate allowed the House Managers to \nreserve two of their three hours of closing arguments for a \n``rebuttal'' which included new iterations of their various \naccusations, with no opportunity for the defense to reply.\n  The question of witnesses was distorted on both sides by political \nconsiderations. The House Managers were counseled by their allies in \nthe Senate not to seek too many witnesses, lest they unnerve Senators \nwith visions of unseemly testimony on the floor. The President's \ndefenders declared that no witnesses were necessary; they argued that \nthe House Managers had passed up their chance to hear fact witnesses in \nthe House Judiciary Committee hearings. Neither approach was sound--\nwitnesses would have helped, but they should have been chosen and \npresented in a thoughtful way. I believe, for example, that Betty \nCurrie was a very important potential witness. She was nowhere to be \nfound, apparently because the managers made a political calculation \nthat they would do without her testimony, trading away the strongest \npiece of their obstruction case.\n  In the end, both sides made strategic decisions in this trial at the \nmercy of a fluid and unpredictable procedure. That led to an element of \nchance in the trial that I believe was unfortunate. And it also led to \ncomplaints from each side about the fairness of the process that were a \ndistraction from the substance of the trial. I therefore recommend to \nfuture presidential impeachment courts that at the very outset they try \nhard to achieve consensus on a procedure that will govern the entire \ntrial.\n  The process was not only flawed in the procedure on the floor. In the \nmidst of the trial, the Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr, at the \nbehest of the House Managers, sought from the District Court an order \ncompelling Monica Lewinsky to travel to Washington to submit to a \nprivate interview with the House Managers. This interposed the court \nand the Independent Counsel in matters properly reserved to the Senate, \nin which the Constitution vests the sole power to try impeachments. In \nso doing, he undermined the bipartisan agreement of the Senate that it \nwould make procedural determinations regarding witnesses following the \nopening arguments and the question period.\n  Both the Republican and Democratic caucuses met throughout the trial \nto discuss the proceedings. I attended these meetings and I do not \nassert that they were improper, but we could have better lived up to \nour oath to do impartial justice, if we had not held those regular \nparty caucuses. Those meetings must have seemed to some of our \nconstituents to be the place where we plotted a partisan course. This \ncould not have helped the people to have confidence in our work.\n  Time and again, we saw the House Managers and the President's lawyers \nclearly responding to advice from Senators. At times they held formal \nmeetings with Senators. There were countless casual conversations about \nthe case between Senators and the advocates for both sides. We are not \nsolely jurors, in the traditional sense, but as triers of fact and law, \nwe would do well in future impeachment trials to avoid these \ninteractions, which really amount to ex parte communications.\n  The greatest flaw in the process was the lack of openness in \ndeliberations. The modern Senate has no excuse for locking the people \nout of any of its proceedings except for the most serious reasons of \nnational security. The Chief Justice ruled forcefully that the Senate \nin an impeachment trial is not a jury in the ordinary sense of the \nword. With that ruling, any pretext for closed deliberations was \ndestroyed. We should quickly take steps now that the trial is over to \nchange the archaic rules that forced this process behind closed doors \nat crucial moments. The American people should be able to watch us and \nhear us at every stage in a process that could lead to removal of a \nPresident they elected. Secrecy in these proceedings is wrong and can \nonly undermine public confidence in this important constitutional \nevent.\n  Mr. President, impeachment trials should be extremely rare. To make \nthis more likely, the process of impeachment in the Senate should not \nbe quick, convenient, and painless. Making it so only invites its \nfurther abuse. Adherence to a thorough process can provide a \nstabilizing bulwark against this kind of abuse. That is one of the \nreasons I opposed premature motions to dismiss the Articles of \nImpeachment and supported the House Managers' motions to depose \nwitnesses and to admit those depositions into the record. The hasty and \nabbreviated impeachment process of the other body helped contribute to \na feeling of two armed encampments facing each other in a high stakes \ncontest rather than a search for truth or justice. Whether a President \nis convicted or acquitted, no credible or politically sustainable \nresult can possibly come from such a process.\n  I believe it is important for us to review and analyze the process by \nwhich we conducted this trial and look honestly and critically at what \nworked and what didn't. We should then make changes to the process, \nnow, while the experiences of this trial are fresh in our minds, and \nhand down to the next Senate that faces the unfortunate task of \nmounting an impeachment trial rules and procedures that will help it \nconduct the trial in a manner worthy of the weighty constitutional duty \nthat the Framers of the Constitution bequeathed to it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2230-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2230-S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DRUG FREE CENTURY ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio and a number of my colleagues in \nsupporting the Drug Free Century Act. This bill continues last year's \nefforts in the fight against drug use in our country in the form of the \nWestern Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, the Drug Free Communities Act, \nand the Drug Demand Reduction Act, all of which I supported.\n  During my tenure in office I have read, listened to, and weighed the \ndebate over illegal drug use and the policy our nation should follow in \ndealing with illegal drugs. In an attempt to put an end to that growing \nproblem, I signed onto the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. \nThis act was a bipartisan piece of legislation that authorized $2.6 \nbillion over three years for drug eradication and interdiction efforts \ndesigned to restore a balanced anti-drug strategy. It offered \nsignificant promises for the reduction of the supply of coca and opium \npoppy in Latin America, as well as improving intelligence and \ninterdiction capabilities against the national security threat posed by \nmajor narcotics trafficking organizations.\n  Although this bill received bipartisan support and was signed by the \nPresident, the FY2000 anti-drug budget was cut by the Administration by \nalmost $100 million below that appropriated in FY1999. I ask you, Mr. \nPresident, what kind of signal are we sending to our nation's youth if \nwe allow this to happen? We in Congress took the necessary steps last \nyear in restoring a balanced, coordinated anti-drug strategy. We must \ncontinue our efforts and we must impress upon the Administration the \ncommitment needed in order to carry out that strategy.\n  My colleague has pointed out that drug use and criminal activity \nsince 1992 wiped out any gains made in the previous decade. America has \nwitnessed an increase in illegal drug use\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\namong our nation's younger generation. Recent polls show that drug use \namong our nation's eighth graders has increased 71 percent since 1992. \nWe have seen a reverse in gains made in the 1980s and early 1990s by \nde-emphasizing law enforcement and interdiction while relying on drug \ntreatment programs for hard-core abusers in the hopes of curbing drug \nusage.\n  In Montana alone, drug use among high school-aged youth has also \nrisen. According to the Montana Office of Public Instruction's Youth \nRisk Behavior Survey, marijuana use among high school aged youth has \nrisen approximately 18% since 1993. However, that 18% only represents \nan increase in one time use by teenagers. In fact, the same survey \nsuggests that the percent of adolescents who have used marijuana \nrepeatedly in the last 30 days has risen by 13%. But it isn't just \nmarijuana use that has increased, Mr. President. No. In fact, a more \ndeadlier drug, cocaine, is increasing in use among Montana teens. \nApproximately 5% according to the survey. This is the sad trend that \nour nation's youth is following, and the reason we in Congress need to \nmake a strong statement against drug use. I believe that The Drug Free \nCentury Act is such a statement.\n  The Drug Free Century Act is a comprehensive approach to the nation's \nanti-drug policies. It strengthens education, treatment, law \nenforcement, and drug interdiction efforts. Although it is only the \nfirst step in our anti-drug strategy, it sends a clear message to the \nnation and our youth that we are committed to eliminating illegal drugs \nin the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2231-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OFFICER BRIAN ASELTON\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nyoung man who made the ultimate sacrifice for his community. Officer \nBrian Aselton of the East Hartford Police Department lost his life on \nJanuary 23, 1999 when he responded to a noise complaint call that \nturned out to be anything but routine. Instead, Brian became the \neleventh Connecticut police officer killed in the line of duty in the \nlast ten years.\n  This tragedy has touched the entire region; more than ten thousand \ncivilians and law enforcement officials attended Brian's funeral. We \nhave all tried to come to terms with the utter senselessness of his \ndeath. Brian was a young man at the start of a promising career with a \nsupportive nucleus of family and friends. Truly, he embodied the \ndetermination, strength, and spirit that is such an integral part of \nour nation's history. Yet, in an instant, Brian's life and the lives of \neveryone who loved him changed forever.\n  Every law enforcement officer puts his or her life on the line to \nprotect citizens every day. Too often, we as civilians forget the \ndangers of the occupation and do not show these brave and dedicated \nofficers the respect they deserve. Officer Aselton, killed in the line \nof duty, serves as a solemn reminder to us all of the responsibility \nborne by police officers across the state and nation. Every day, the \nmen and women in uniform put their lives at risk so that we can live in \ncommunities where we and our families can feel safe. And unfortunately, \nit takes a tragic event like this for us to truly understand the \ndedication of these peace officers to the neighborhoods they serve.\n  With the support of the East Hartford Police Department and other \nofficers across the region, the Aselton family has begun the necessary \nhealing process. Yet, with his loss, the town of East Hartford and the \nState of Connecticut have been diminished. At Brian's funeral, everyone \njoined together across municipal and state borders and stood together \nas a single family honoring one of our own. Now that Brian is gone, it \nis incumbent on us to maintain those bonds. Each one of us must \nrecognize that we are all part of the same family and the simple things \nimportant to us are also the simple things important to our neighbors. \nThese are the personal steps that we should take to truly honor his \nmemory. If we can each devote the same commitment to these principles \nthat Brian devoted to his duties as a police officer, we will, through \nour progress as a society, have made some sense out of his untimely \ndeath.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2231-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate the class from Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon, \nthat will be representing the state of Oregon in the national finals of \nthe program We the People . . . The Citizens and the Constitution. \nThese young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national \nfinals and through their experience have gained knowledge and \nunderstanding of the principles and values that support our \nconstitutional democracy.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress, consisting of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. \nThe student testimony is followed by a period of questioning during \nwhich the judges probe students for their depth of understanding and \nability to apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  It is so important that our young people come to understand and \nappreciate these unique concepts and values which knit our nation \ntogether. For it is their leadership which must guide our country's \nfuture, and their wisdom which must be equal to our country's need. \nAgain, I congratulate the student team from Lincoln High School and \nthank each for their dedication and diligence.\n  The student team from Lincoln High School consists of: Graham Berry, \nNicole Byers, Brianna Carlisle, Naomi Cole, Violet Dochow, Andrew Dunn, \nEtopi Fanta, Jordan Foster, Ian Galloway, Arianna Hearing, Sarah \nHodgson, Britta Ingebretson, Aaron Johnson, James Knowles, Ashley \nLinder, Katharine Mapes, Heather Marsh, Amanda Morganroth, Joshua \nMoskovitz, David Murphy, Eric Nadal, Simone Neuwelt, Melissa Nitti, \nLauren Olson, Aubrey Richardson, Caitlin Ryan, Jonathan Schwartz, \nElizabeth Smith, Paul Susi, and Katherine Wax, with Hal Hart and Chris \nHardman serving as their teacher advisors. They are currently \nconducting research and preparing for the upcoming national competition \nin Washington, DC. I wish the students and teachers the best of luck at \nthe We the People national finals and I look forward to their visit to \nCapitol Hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/03/senate-section/article/S2231-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2231-S2232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

The \n     preceding sentence does not apply to nonrevenue legislation \n     originating in the Senate.\n       (f) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve \n     as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which \n     they do not serve as voting members.\n       (g) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by \n     any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before \n     that subcommittee.\n       (h) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the \n     staff director to insure that--\n       (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee \n     is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;\n       (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full \n     committee is holding hearings; and\n       (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same \n     time.\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may \n     meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two \n     subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the \n     approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of \n     the committee and subcommittees involved.\n       (i) All nominations shall be considered by the full \n     committee.\n       (j) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably \n     frequent meetings of the full committee to permit \n     consideration of legislation reported favorably to the \n     committee by the subcommittees.\n       Rule 18. Transcripts of Committee Meetings.--An accurate \n     record shall be kept of all markups of the committee, whether \n     they be open or closed to the public. This record, marked as \n     ``uncorrected,'' shall be available for inspection by Members \n     of the Senate, or members of the committee together with \n     their staffs, at any time. This record shall not be published \n     or made public in any way except:\n       (a) By majority vote of the committee after all members of \n     the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to correct \n     their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately reflect \n     statements made.\n       (b) Any member may release his own remarks made in any \n     markup of the committee provided that every member or witness \n     whose remarks are contained in the released portion is given \n     a reasonable opportunity before release to correct their \n     remarks.\n       Notwithstanding the above, in the case of the record of an \n     executive session of the committee that is closed to the \n     public pursuant to Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the record shall not be published or made public in \n     any way except by majority vote of the committee after all \n     members of the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to \n     correct their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately \n     reflect statements made.\n       Rule 19.
