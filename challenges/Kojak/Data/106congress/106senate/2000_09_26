With the understanding of the acting majority leader, if \nI could have the attention of the Senator from Ohio, I ask that the \ntime be evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is already the order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask consent I be allowed to yield myself 12 minutes, \nand I ask consent that the Senator from Rhode Island be allowed to \nfollow with 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has just allocated more time than \nthe Senator has.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand the time allocation, there are 45 \nminutes. I thought I would yield 12 minutes to myself and 10 minutes to \nthe Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes a side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask consent that the Senator from Rhode Island be \npermitted to be recognized after me in the remaining time, and I yield \nmyself 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes at this time, if the clerk \nwill let me know.\n  Mr. President, I support the pending H-1B high-tech visa legislation. \nThe high technology industry needs skilled workers to ensure its \ncontinued growth. As we all know, the Nation is stretched thin to \nsupport these firms\n\n[[Page S9216]]\n\nthat are so important to the Nation's continuing economic growth. \nDemand for employees with training in computer science, electrical \nengineering, software and communications is very high, and Congress has \na responsibility to meet these needs.\n  In 1998, in an effort to find a stop-gap solution to this labor \nshortage, we enacted legislation which increased the number of \ntemporary visas available to skilled foreign workers. Despite the \navailability of additional visas, we have reached the cap before the \nend of the year in the last 2 fiscal years.\n  The legislation before us today addresses this problem in two ways. \nThe short-term solution is to raise the H-1B visa cap and admit greater \nnumbers of foreign workers to fill these jobs. The long-term solution \nis to do more to provide skills training for American workers and \neducational opportunities for American students.\n  Raising the cap for foreign workers without addressing our domestic \njob training needs would be a serious mistake. We cannot and should not \ncount on foreign sources of labor indefinitely. It is unfair to U.S. \nworkers, and the supply of foreign workers is limited. In their 1999 \nbook, The Supply of Information Technology Workers in the United \nStates, Peter Freeman and William Aspray report that other countries \nare experiencing their own IT labor shortages and are ``placing \npressures on or providing incentives to their indigenous IT work force \nto stay at home or return home.''\n  Furthermore, the jobs currently being filled by H-1B workers are \nsolid, middle-class jobs for which well-trained Americans should have \nthe opportunity to compete. The American work force is the best in the \nworld--energetic, determined, and hard working. Given the proper skills \nand education, American workers can fill the jobs being created by the \nnew high tech businesses.\n  It makes sense to insist that more of our domestic workers must be \nrecruited into and placed in these jobs. Countless reports cite age and \nrace discrimination as a major problem in the IT industry, along with \nthe hiring of foreign workers and layoff of domestic workers. According \nto an article Computerworld magazine, U.S. Census Bureau data show that \nthe unemployment rate for IT workers over age 40 is more than five \ntimes that of other unemployed workers.\n  Similar problems face women and minorities who are under-represented \nin the IT work force, and the shortage will continue unless they are \nrecruited and trained more effectively by schools, corporations, and \ngovernment programs.\n  Under the solution that may of us favor, the Department of Labor, in \nconsultation with the Department of Commerce, will provide grants to \nlocal work force investment boards in areas with substantial shortages \nof high-tech workers. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis for \ninnovative high-tech training proposals developed by the work force \nboards in cooperation with area employers, unions, and higher education \ninstitutions. This approach will provide state-of-the-art high-tech \ntraining for approximately 46,000 workers in primarily high-tech, \ninformation technology, and biotechnology skills.\n  Similarly, we must also increase scholarship opportunities for \ntalented minority and low-income students whose families cannot afford \ntoday's tuition costs. We must also expand the National Science \nFoundation's merit-based, competitive grants to programs that emphasize \nthese skills.\n  To provide adequate training and education opportunities for American \nworkers and students, we must increase the H-1B visa user fee.\n  At a time when the IT industry is experiencing major growth and \nrecord profits, it is clear that even the smallest of businesses can \nafford to pay a higher fee in order to support needed investments in \ntechnology skills and education. A modest increase in the user fee will \ngenerate approximately $280 million each year compared to current law, \nwhich raises less than one-third of this amount.\n  This fee is fair. Immigrant families with very modest incomes were \nable to pay a $1,000 fee to allow family members to obtain green cards. \nCertainly, high-tech companies can afford to pay at least that amount \nduring this prosperous economy.\n  In fact, according to public financial information, for the top 20 \ncompanies that received the most H-1B workers this year, a $2,000 fee \nwould cost between .002 percent and .5 percent of their net worth. A \n$1,000 fee would cost them even less.\n  This fee proposal will clearly benefit the country in the short- and \nlong-term. Companies get H-1B workers now, and they will benefit from \nthe workers and students served by programs funded with these fees.\n  This proposal presents a win-win, bipartisan approach to meeting the \nneeds and business and the U.S. work force. It is fair, responsible, \nand necessary, given the rapidly changing needs of society and our \nprosperous economy.\n  If we build on existing education and training programs and force our \nlabor and civil rights laws to prevent age, race, and gender \ndiscrimination, American workers and students can meet the long-term \nhigh-tech needs we face in the years ahead.\n  I look forward to debate on this legislation in the days to come. I \nthink it is a good bill, which can be improved with amendments to \naddress several key issues. For example, we must ensure that the H-1B \nvisa program is narrowly focused to address the skill-shortage. The \nunprecedented exemptions to the cap in the Hatch bill are unwarranted. \nInstead, we should ensure that workers with an advanced degree have \npriority for H-1B visas within the cap, and are subject to the same \nrequirements as all other applications.\n  Similarly, we must also ensure that the INS has sufficient funds to \nprocess high-tech visa applications and that certain institutions--all \neducational institutions, university teaching hospitals, nonprofits, \nand governmental research organizations--are appropriately exempted \nfrom the fee requirement.\n  The high-tech industry's pressing need for skilled workers isn't the \nonly immigration issue before Congress. There are also important family \nimmigration issues that must be addressed.\n  On several occasions in recent weeks, Democrats have attempted to \nbring the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act to the floor of the Senate \nfor debate and a vote. Before the August recess, Democrats attempted to \nbring this legislation before the Senate, but the Republican leadership \nobjected. Two weeks ago, Democrats were prepared to debate and vote on \nthis legislation as part of the high-tech visa bill, but our Republican \ncolleagues were unwilling to bring this measure to the floor and take a \nvote. Last Friday, Senator Reid asked Senator Lott for consent to offer \nthe Latino and immigrant fairness bill and the majority leader \nobjected. It is clear that Republican support for the Latino community \nis all talk and no action. When it's time to pass legislation of \nimportance to the Latino community, the Republican leadership is \nnowhere to be found.\n\n  Our Republican friends tell us that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness \nAct is a poison pill--that it will undermine the H-1B high-tech visa \nlegislation currently before the Senate. But, if Republicans are truly \nsupportive of the Latino legislative agenda, how can that be true?\n  If they support the reunification of immigrant families, as well as \nthe immigration agenda set by the high-tech community, we should be \nable to pass both bills and send them to the President's desk for \nsignature, for he strongly supports this bill. But Republican support \nfor the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act doesn't match Republican \nrhetoric on the campaign trail. Rather than admit this hypocrisy, the \nSenate Republican leadership continues to pay lip service to these \ngoals while blocking any realistic action to achieve them.\n  The immigrant community--particularly the Latino community--has \nwaited far too long for the fundamental justice that the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act will provide. These issues are not new to \nCongress. The immigrants who will benefit from this legislation should \nhave received permanent status from the INS long ago.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act includes parity for Central \nAmericans, Haitians, nationals of the former Soviet bloc, and \nLiberians. In 1997, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and \nCentral American Relief\n\n[[Page S9217]]\n\nAct, which granted permanent residence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who \nhad fled their repressive governments.\n  Other similarly situated Central Americans, Soviet bloc nationals, \nand Haitians were only provided an opportunity to apply for green cards \nunder a much more difficult and narrower standard and much more \ncumbersome procedures. Hondurans and Liberians received nothing.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will eliminate the disparities \nfor all of these asylum seekers, and give them all the same opportunity \nthat Nicaraguans and Cubans now have. Assurances were given at the time \nthat we granted that kind of special consideration for Nicaraguans and \nCubans that the others would follow in the next year. Those assurances \nwere given by Republican Senators and the administration alike. Now, if \nwe do not do that, we are failing that commitment. It will create a \nfair, uniform set of procedures for all immigrants from this region who \nhave been in this country since 1995.\n\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will also provide long overdue \nrelief to all immigrants who, because of bureaucratic mistakes, were \nprevented from receiving green cards many years ago. In 1986, Congress \npassed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which included \nlegalization for persons who could demonstrate that they had been \npresent in the United States since before 1982. There was a 1-year \nperiod to file.\n  However, the INS misinterpreted the provisions in the 1986 act, and \nthousands of otherwise qualified immigrants were denied the opportunity \nto make timely applications.\n  Several successful class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of \nindividuals who were harmed by these INS misinterpretations of the law, \nand the courts required the INS to accept filings for these \nindividuals. As one court decision stated: ``The evidence is clear that \nthe INS' . . . regulations deterred many aliens who would otherwise \nqualify for legalization from applying.''\n  To add insult to injury, however, the 1996 immigration law stripped \nthe courts of jurisdiction to review INS decisions, and the Attorney \nGeneral ruled that the law superceded the court cases. As a result of \nthese actions, this group of immigrants has been in legal limbo, \nfighting government bureaucracy for over 14 years.\n  Looking across the landscape, I cannot think of such a group of \nindividuals who were excluded from participation in a process that \nwould have permitted them to work legitimately in the United States. It \nwas the intention of Congress they be eligible to do so. It was the INS \nthat misled them and effectively denied them that opportunity. The \ncourts have found for those individuals.\n  Then legislation was passed to further exclude them, to take away the \njurisdiction of the Justice Department from implementing the court's \ndecision. That is unfair, and we have a responsibility to remedy that. \nWe can do that. We can do that here, on this legislation. We should do \nit. That process will permit about 300,000 Latinos to be able to get \ntheir green cards and become legitimate workers in our economy.\n  Our bill will alleviate this problem by allowing all individuals who \nhave resided in the United States prior to 1986 to obtain permanent \nresidency, including those who were denied legalization because of the \nINS misinterpretation, or who were turned away by the INS before \napplying.\n  Our bill will also restore section 245(i), a vital provision of the \nimmigration law that was repealed in 1997 and that permitted immigrants \nabout to become permanent residents to pay a fee of $1,000 and apply \nfor green cards while in the United States, rather than returning to \ntheir home countries to apply. Section 245(i) was pro-family, pro-\nbusiness, fiscally prudent, and a matter of common sense. Under it, \nimmigrants with close family members in the United States are able to \nremain here with their families while applying for legal permanent \nresidence. The section also allows businesses to retain valuable \nemployees. In addition, it provided INS with millions of dollars in \nannual revenue, at no cost to taxpayers. Restoring section 245(i) will \nkeep thousands of immigrants from being separated from their families \nand jobs for as long as 10 years.\n  The Nation's history has long been tainted with periods of anti-\nimmigrant sentiment. The Naturalization Act of 1790 prevented Asian \nimmigrants from attaining citizenship. The Chinese Exclusion Act of \n1882 was passed to reduce the number of Chinese laborers. The Asian \nExclusion Act and the National Origins Act which made up the \nImmigration Act of 1924, were passed to block immigration from the \n``Asian Pacific Triangle''--Japan, China, the Philippines, Laos, \nThailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, India, \nSri Lanka, and Malaysia--and prevent them from entering the United \nStates for permanent residence. Those discriminatory provisions weren't \nrepealed until 1965. The Mexican Farm Labor Supply Program--the Bracero \nProgram--provided Mexican labor to the United States under harsh and \nunacceptable conditions and wasn't repealed until 1964.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act provides us with an opportunity \nto end a series of unjust provisions in our current immigration laws, \nand build on the most noble aspects of our American immigrant \ntradition.\n  It restores fairness to the immigrant community and fairness in the \nNation's immigration laws. It is good for families and it is good for \nAmerican business.\n  The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, a consortium of \nbusinesses and trade associations and other organizations strongly \nsupports the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This coalition includes \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, health care and home care associations, \nhotel, motel, restaurant and tourism associations, manufacturing and \nretail concerns, and the construction and transportation industries.\n  These key industries have added their voices to the broad coalition \nof business, labor, religious, Latino and other immigrant organizations \nin support of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  This bill is strongly supported by a wide range of different groups, \nfrom the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO, to the various religious \ngroups, as a matter of basic, fundamental equity and fairness.\n  I daresay there are probably more groups that support the Latino \nfairness--just if you look at numbers--than even the H-1B. This is an \nissue of fairness. We ought to be about doing it. We are being denied \nthat opportunity by the Republican leadership, make no mistake about \nit.\n  Our bill will alleviate the problem also by allowing individuals who \nresided in the United States prior to 1986 to obtain permanent \nresidency by eliminating unfair procedures.\n  As I mentioned, this particular proposal has broad support from the \nbusiness community, from the workers, and from religious groups. Few \ndays remain in this Congress, but my Democratic colleagues and I are \ncommitted to doing all we can to see both the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act and the H-1B high-tech visa become law this year. That is \nwhat this whole effort is about.\n  If we are going to look out for the H-1B--and I am all for it--we \nought to also remedy the injustice out there applying to hundreds of \nthousands of individuals whose principal desire is to be with their \nfamilies and work here in the United States, and do so legally and \nlegitimately. We are being effectively shut out by the majority \ndecision to have a cloture motion filed which would exclude the \npossibility of inclusion. Our attempts to try to get it included have \nbeen denied. That is basically wrong.\n  I welcome the leadership of Senator Daschle and others to make sure \nwe are going to address this issue before we leave. Both of these \nmatters need attention. Both of them deserve action. Both of them \ndeserve to be passed.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to also speak about a grave \nomission with respect to the debate that is ongoing regarding H-1B \nvisas.\n  There is widespread support for the H-1B visa program. What has \nhappened is that our ability to also address other compelling \nimmigration issues has\n\n[[Page S9218]]\n\nbeen totally frustrated by this cloture process, by this overt attempt \nto eliminate amendments, to eliminate our ability to deal with other \nissues. One in particular that is compelling to me is the status of \n10,000 Liberians who have been here in the United States since 1989-\n1990, when the country of Liberia was thrust into a destructive civil \nwar.\n  These people came here. They were recognized, because of the violence \nin their homeland, as being deserving of temporary protective status. \nThat status was granted in 1991 by the Attorney General. For almost a \ndecade now they have been here in the United States, working, paying \ntaxes, raising families while not qualifying for any type of social \nbenefits such as welfare. Many of these people, who are here legally, \nhave children who are American citizens. They are within hours of \nlosing their protection and being deported back to Liberia.\n  In response to this pressing dilemma, I introduced legislation in \nMarch of 1999 cosponsored by Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Kerry, Senator Landrieu, Senator Hagel, and \nSenator L. Chafee. Our attempt was to allow these Liberians the \nopportunity to adjust to permanent resident status and one day become \ncitizens of this country. There are 10,000 located across the country. \nThey have been contributing members of these communities. Yet, because \nof the process we have adopted here, because of the unwillingness to \ntake up this issue--which is a key immigration issue, along with the H-\n1B--these individuals are perhaps facing expulsion from this country in \nthe next few days.\n  I hope we can deal with this. It is essential we do so. One of the \ngreat ironies of our treatment of the Liberians is that at the moment \nwe are prepared to deport them to Liberia, we are urging American \ncitizens not to go to that country because it is so violent.\n  Our State Department has released official guidance to Americans \nwarning them not to travel to Liberia because of the instability, \nbecause of the potential for violence, because of the inability of \ncivil authorities to protect not only Americans but to protect anyone \nin Liberia.\n  So we are at one time saying, don't go to Liberia if you are an \nAmerican citizen, but unless we pass this legislation or unless, once \nagain, the President authorizes deferral of forced departure--\nessentially staying the deportation of these Liberians--we are going to \nsend these people back into a country to which we are advising \nAmericans not to go.\n  Although this country had a democratic election a few years ago, it \nwas an election more in form than substance. It is a country governed \nby a President who is a warlord, someone who is not a constructive \nforce for peace and progress in that part of Africa. In fact, he \nstarted his political career by escaping from a prison in \nMassachusetts, going back to Liberia, and then organizing his military \nforces to begin this civil war. One of his first accomplishments, \naccording to the New Republic, was the creation of a small boys unit, a \nbattalion of intensely loyal child soldiers who are fed crack cocaine \nand refer to Taylor as ``our father.''\n  This is the leader of a country who has also been implicated in a \ndisturbance in the adjoining country of Sierra Leone. Month after \nmonth, we have seen horrible pictures of the degradations that are \ngoing on there in Sierra Leone. He is involved in that, supporting \nhomicidal forces in Sierra Leone.\n  This is not a place we want to send people back to--people who have \nresided in our country for 10 years, people who have been part of our \ncommunities, young people particularly, who know very little about \nLiberia and will be thrust back into a situation where their protection \nis in jeopardy and where their future is in great jeopardy in terms of \naccess to schools and education and other necessary programs.\n  For months now--starting last March--we have been lobbying \nintensively to get an opportunity at least to vote on legislation that \nwould allow these individuals to adjust to permanent status. That \nlegislative approach has been frustrated time and time again, most \nrecently with the decision that we would not accept certain amendments \nto this H-1B visa bill.\n  In fact, one of the ironies is that of those 10,000 Liberians, many \nof whom were professionals in their homeland, I suspect at least a few \nof them are working in these high-tech industries. If they are, the \nirony is that we would be sending them home so that the high-tech \ncommunity can complain about losing workers and needing more H-1B \nvisas. I think simple justice demands that we do both, that we press \nnot only for H-1B visas but also for some of the issues that have been \naddressed by Senator Kennedy, and the issue in Liberia. These people \ndeserve a chance to adjust their status and become full-fledged \nAmericans.\n  There is some discussion that they should go back to Liberia, but as \nI have tried to suggest in my remarks, this is a country that is \nchaotic at best. The Government is really subservient to the leadership \nof the President, Charles Taylor. It is an area of the world where \nthere are not social services and the basic economics of the country \nare faulty. I think all of these together suggest compellingly the need \nto allow the individuals to adjust.\n  I hope in the next few days, or in the remaining days of this \nlegislative session, we will have another opportunity to address this \nlegislatively. I certainly hope that if we are unable to do so, the \ncause will be taken up by the administration when it comes to \ndiscussions for the final legislative initiatives of this Congress, so \nwe will not leave these people once again in a gray area, in a \n``twilight zone,'' where they want to stay in this country but face the \nthreat of deportation each and every year. I hope we do better. I am \ndisappointed--gravely disappointed--we did not allow an opportunity to \nvote on this measure in conjunction with this H-1B legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise this morning to implore my \ncolleagues to support cloture and to quit playing around with this \nbill. There is no reason to have a filibuster on the motion to proceed \non bills as important as this. There has been a filibuster on the bill.\n  It seems to me we need to work together in moving forward to enact \nthe American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act, S. 2045. \nOne of our greatest priorities is, and ought to be, keeping our economy \nvibrant and expanding educational opportunities for America's children \nand its workers. That is my priority for this country and for my own \nhome State of Utah.\n  I am proud of the growth and development in my own home State that \nhas made Utah one of the leaders in the country and in the world in our \nhigh-tech economy. Utah's IT--or information technology--vendor \nindustry is among Utah's largest industries and among the top 10 \nregions of IT activity in the United States.\n  Notably, Utah was listed among the top 10 IT centers in the world by \nNewsweek magazine in November 1998. The growth of information \ntechnology is nowhere more evident and dramatic than in my own home \nState of Utah. According to UTAA, the Utah Information Technologies \nAssociation, our IT vendor industry grew nearly 9 percent between 1997 \nand 1998 and consists of 2,427 business enterprises.\n  In Utah and elsewhere, however, our continued economic growth and our \ncompetitive edge in the world economy require an adequate supply of \nhighly skilled high-tech workers. This remains one of our greatest \nchallenges in the 21st century, requiring both short- and long-term \nsolutions. This legislation, S. 2045, contains both types of solutions.\n  Specifically, a tight labor market, increasing globalization, and a \nburgeoning economy have combined to increase demand for skilled workers \nwell beyond what was forecast when Congress last addressed the issue of \ntemporary visas for highly skilled workers in 1998. Therefore, my bill, \nonce again, increases the annual cap for the next 3 years.\n  But that is nothing more than a short-term solution to the workforce \nneeds in my State and across the country. The longer term solution lies \nwith our own children and our own workers and in ensuring that \neducation and training for our current and future workforce matches the \ndemands in our high-tech 21st century global economy.\n\n[[Page S9219]]\n\n  Thus, working with my colleagues, I have included in this bill \nstrong, effective, and forward-looking provisions directing the more \nthan $100 million in fees generated by the visas toward the education \nand retraining of our children and our workforce. These provisions are \nincluded in the substitute which is before us today.\n  We are here today, however, as this session of Congress comes to a \nclose, with the fate of this critical legislation extremely uncertain. \nFrankly, when this bill was reported by the committee by an \noverwhelming vote of 16-2, I thought we were on track to move this \nrapidly through the Senate. I offered to sit down with other Members, \nincluding Senators Kennedy, Feinstein, and Lieberman, to work with them \non provisions regarding education and training. We have done that. I am \npleased to report that the substitute to which I have referred reflects \nmany of their ideas and proposals.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming days to \ntry to avoid a confrontational process. I hope we can get this done for \nAmerican workers and children and for our continued economic expansion.\n  The situation, as I understand it, is that there is little \ndisagreement on this bill itself. I have heard no arguments that the \nhigh-tech shortage is not real or that we should not move forward with \nthis short-term fix. Rather, it appears that the only dispute has been \nwhether or not we use the bill as a vehicle for other major and far-\nreaching changes in our immigration policy over which there is much \ncontention and which could scuttle this bill. And I think those who are \ntrying to get us in that posture understand that.\n  I sincerely hope we can move forward today. I hope my colleagues will \noverwhelmingly support this modest H-1B increase and quit delaying this \nbill. Let's get it through. This bill has important training and \neducation proposals for the children and workers in the 21st century.\n  The Hatch substitute amendment to S. 2045, the American \nCompetitiveness in the 21st Century Act, is a comprehensive legislative \nproposal to insure America's continued leadership edge in the \nInformation Age. It takes both short-term and long-term steps.\n  Let me summarize the proposal. With regard to long-term steps, this \nbill invests in the American workforce through a designated stream of \nfunding for high-tech job training; K-12 education initiatives; \nauthorizes a new program which provides grants for after school \ntechnology education; and helps our educational and research \ncommunities by exempting them from the cap on high-skilled \nprofessionals.\n  No. 2., the short-term steps: This bill addresses immediate skilled \nworker needs by authorizing a modest increase in temporary visas for \nhigh-skilled professionals.\n  When skilled professionals are at a premium, America faces a serious \ndilemma when employers find that they cannot grow, innovate, and \ncompete in global markets without increased access to skilled \npersonnel. Our employers' current inability to hire skilled personnel \npresents both a short-term and a long-term problem. The country needs \nto increase its access to skilled personnel immediately in order to \nprevent current needs from going unfilled. To meet these needs over the \nlong term, however, the American education system must produce more \nyoung people interested in, and qualified to enter, key fields, and we \nmust increase our other training efforts, so that more Americans can be \nprepared to keep this country at the cutting edge and competitive in \nglobal markets.\n  The Hatch substitute to S. 2045 addresses both aspects of this \nproblem. In order to meet immediate needs, the bill raises the current \nceiling on temporary visas to 195,000 for fiscal year 2000, fiscal year \n2001, and fiscal year 2002. In addition, it provides for exemptions \nfrom the ceiling for graduate degree recipients from American \nuniversities and personnel at universities and research facilities to \nallow these educators and top graduates to remain in the country.\n  The Hatch substitute to S. 2045 also addresses the long-term problem \nthat too few U.S. students are entering and excelling in mathematics, \ncomputer science, engineering and related fields. It contains measures \nto encourage more young people to study mathematics, engineering, and \ncomputer science and to train more Americans in these areas.\n  Under predecessor legislation enacted in 1998, a $500 fee per visa is \nassessed on each initial petition for H-1B status for an individual, on \neach initial application for extension of that individual's status, and \non each petition required on account of a change of employer or \nconcurrent employment. Under the Hatch substitute, this money is used \nto fund scholarships for low income students and training for U.S. \nworkers. Using the same assumptions on the rate of renewals, changes of \nemployer and the like that the committee and the administration relied \non in estimating the impact of the 1998 legislation, the increase in \nvisas should result in funding for training, scholarships and \nadministration of H-1B visas of approximately $150 million per year \nover fiscal year 2000, fiscal year 2001, and fiscal year 2002 for a \ntotal of $450 million. This should fund approximately 40,000 \nscholarships. This is important.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote for cloture today. I \nhope we can put this bill to bed. I hope there won't be any postcloture \nfilibusters. I hope there won't be any postcloture delays.\n  Let us get this bill passed. It is critical to our country. It is \ncritical to our information technology age, to our high-tech \ncommunities, and it is critical to keep us the No. 1 Nation in the \nworld. It makes sense, and it has widespread support throughout \nCongress.\n  It is being delayed by just a few people in this body--maybe not so \nfew but a number of people who basically claim they are interested in \nthe information technology industries and high-tech industries \nthemselves but who want to play politics with this bill.\n  I think we ought to quit playing politics and do what is right for \nour country. This is a bipartisan bill that really ought to be passed \ntoday.\n  With that, how much time do both sides have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah controls all remaining \ntime and he has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the 9 minutes to my colleague from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate being yielded the remaining \ntime.\n  I am a supporter of the H-1B visa legislation and have been so for \nquite some time, recognizing that it is very important for our country \nto make the accommodations to be able to supply this great and booming \neconomy the skilled workers necessary. I have been voting accordingly.\n  This debate should bring more urgency to our discussion on how to \nstrengthen our public school system, our college training \nopportunities, and our technical college network in this Nation so that \nin the future we don't have to fill these slots with workers who are \nnot Americans; that we can fill them with hard-working Americans \nbecause our school system and our education system have met the \nchallenge the taxpayers have laid out for us. We cannot hold our \nindustries hostage because perhaps there has been some failing on our \npart to provide the kind of educational system this Nation needs. That \nis why I have been supportive.\n  In addition, I wish there was more support in this body for including \nthe Latino fairness provision. I am disappointed that the amendment \ntree was filled in order to keep those of us on both sides of the \naisle, Democrats and Republicans, from considering this as a proper \nplace to add this important legislation--not to kill it, not to slow it \ndown, but to make it stronger. That is such an important issue to the \nLatino community, to Hispanic Americans who are looking for the same \njustice and equality that was promised for the Hondurans and \nGuatemalans as provided for the Nicaraguans.\n  I will be supplying a more in-depth statement on that subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No. \n     4178 to Calendar No. 490, S. 2045, a\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\n     bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with \n     respect to H-1B non-immigrant aliens:\n         Trent Lott, Chuck Hagel, Spencer Abraham, Phil Gramm, Jim \n           Bunning, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Sam Brownback, Rod \n           Grams, Jesse Helms, Gordon Smith of Oregon, Pat \n           Roberts, Slade Gorton, Connie Mack, John Warner and \n           Robert Bennett.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall under the rule is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 4178 to S. 2045, a bill to amend the Immigration and \nNationality Act with respect to H-1B nonimmigrant aliens, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

On this vote, the yeas are 94, the \nnays are 3. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The pending motion \nto recommit is out of order.\n  The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4183\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 4183.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. I had the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Chair be so kind as to explain \nwhere we are on the legislation now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are amendments pending, first and second \ndegree, to the underlying text of the bill, and there is a perfecting \namendment to the committee substitute, with a second-degree amendment \nthereto.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about this \nlegislation.\n  First, I think it is important to know that we--that is, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, myself, Senator Durbin, Senator \nLeahy, and Senator Graham--have a very important amendment we believe \nshould be considered during the time we are debating this issue. Our \namendment is called the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  We have had, in recent days, an inability to bring up legislation \nthat is extremely important to the Senate. This legislation deals with \na number of issues that were discussed on the floor yesterday briefly, \nbut it deals with the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.\n  In 1996, there was slipped into one of the bills a provision that \ntook away a basic, fundamental American right of due process.\n  As a result of legislation we passed in 1986, thousands of people who \ncame to this country were entitled to apply to adjust their \nlegalization status. However, inserted in legslation that we passed in \n1996, was language that, in effect, denied them a due process hearing.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't want to interrupt the line of thought of the \nSenator. I understand the majority leader put in place two amendments \nthat were actually Democratic amendments--at least one amendment was \nproposed by Members of our side. I have been in the institution now for \n38 years, and I have never heard of another Senator calling up someone \nelse's amendment before the Senate.\n  We want to be involved in the substance of this and get the H-1B \nmeasure put on through. But I am just wondering if I understand \ncorrectly that the majority leader now has filed a cloture motion and \ngone ahead and called up the Senator's amendment. Maybe that Senator \nhas been notified; maybe he is on his way here. But I am just \nwondering, I say to the deputy leader for the Democrats, whether I \nunderstand the situation correctly. Is that the understanding of the \nSenator from Nevada, that this is the situation?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is interesting. This is an unusual \nsituation where we have amendments that have been filed by other \nSenators being called up by someone else. I think it is very \ntransparent, I say to my friend from Massachusetts and others within \nthe sound of my voice, it is very transparent. All we want is a fair \ndebate and the ability to vote on this amendment.\n  For example, George W. Bush says he wants to make sure that our \nimmigration laws are fair to the Hispanic population of this country. \nIf he wants to be so fair to the Hispanic population of this country, \nwhy doesn't he call the Republican leadership in the House and Senate \nto let us bring forward this legislation that the Hispanic communities \nall over America want? They won't let us do that. They know the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts was here to be recognized so that this amendment \ncould be offered.\n  I have the floor now. I had other things to do this morning, but with \nSenate procedures such as they are, I\n\n[[Page S9221]]\n\nhad the opportunity to get the floor, and I am going to keep the floor \nfor a while because I am going to talk about what is going on in this \ncountry.\n  Does the Senator have a question, without my losing the floor?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. So that people watching this have some \nunderstanding, we have an H-1B proposal that is before the Senate, and \nthere is virtual unanimity in the Senate in favor of it. There are some \ndifferences in terms of the training programs, to make sure we get \nadditional funding so these jobs will be available for Americans down \nthe road. Maybe people are trying to block that particular amendment. \nThese are good jobs. Why should we not have training for Americans to \nbe able to have these jobs in the future? I would like to be able to \nmake that case and move ahead.\n  There are other amendments, as the Senator pointed out. On the one \nhand--I ask my colleague if he doesn't agree--we are looking out after \nthe high-tech community with the H-1Bs. There is a need also in \nMassachusetts, and I support that. On the other hand, there is a need \nin terms of equity, fairness, justice, and also economically to make an \nadjustment of status so that men and women who are qualified ought to \nbe able to get a green card to be able to work. It just so happens they \nare Latinos.\n\n  Evidently, that is the difference here, as far as I can figure out. \nOtherwise, I can't understand why, on the one hand, we are permitting \nand encouraging people to go to high-tech, but not to go to work in \nsome of the other industries, even though the Chamber of Commerce, the \nAFL, and the various church groups are in strong support of it. The \neconomics of it are that there is a very critical need for it.\n  Can the Senator possibly explain why we are being denied an \nopportunity to complete our business in terms of the high-tech and also \nin the other areas that have been strongly supported by groups across \nthis country? As far as I can figure out, it is that they are basically \nof Hispanic heritage.\n  I am asking a question to the Senator from Nevada. Has the Senator \nheard one reason from the other side--because it is the other side that \nis stopping this--why they won't do it? What is the reason? Why won't \nthey engage in a debate on this particular issue? All we have, Mr. \nPresident, is silence on the other side. Here we are trying to give \nfairness to the Latinos and against the background where we had two \nMembers on the other side, Senator Abraham and Senator Mack, who last \nyear said they favored these kinds of adjustments for the Latinos. They \nsaid it in the last Congress. I don't doubt that that is their position \nnow.\n  We can dispose of this in an hour or so this afternoon. But what \npossibly is the reason the majority leader says, no, we are not going \nto deal with that? We are going to call up amendments of other Senators \nwho haven't even been notified to come over here and deal with this. \nWhat is going on here?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me answer a number of questions because \nthe Senator asked a number of questions.\n  First of all, I spoke yesterday to the National Restaurant \nAssociation. I agree with my friend from Massachusetts that it is \nimportant we do something for high-tech workers. I support efforts in \nCongress that have allowed 430,000 people to come to the United States \nto be high-tech workers, principally from India----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. A good chunk from China. India is No. 1 and China is No. \n2.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts. I am glad \nwe have done that.\n  There is another group of people the restaurant owners believe should \nbe allowed to come. They are essential workers, skilled and semi-\nskilled workers. We have hundreds of thousands of jobs in America today \nthat aren't being filled. Why? Because there aren't enough Americans to \ntake the jobs. That is why we have, as listed on the chart behind the \nSenator from Massachusetts, so many supporters from the business \ncommunity of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. If we had a bigger \nboard, we would have three times that many names on it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will withhold, here is another chart \nshowing double the numbers of groups that support this proposal as \nwell. These are all of the groups. Here is the National Restaurant \nAssociation listed in support of this proposal.\n\n  What is the argument on the other side? I thought I heard somebody \nsay, ``We don't want to confuse these issues.'' I don't think there is \nmuch confusion about what is being considered around here. There isn't \na lot of confusion about it. It is very basic and rather fundamental. \nThe adjustment of status that was applied just over a year ago in terms \nof the Nicaraguans and Cubans was going to be extended to others, \nincluding the El Salvadorans, Hondurans, Haitians, and Guatemalans. \nThey have been effectively discriminated against. We were going to \nadjust for those. And then for about 300,000 citizens here in this \ncountry who are being denied a green card, under the law, according to \nthe courts, they should be entitled to go to work.\n  The courts have said it was a bureaucratic mistake that they were \ndenied that opportunity to be able to get a green card to go to work. \nThen the Congress went ahead and effectively withdrew the authority of \nthe Justice Department to implement what the courts have found was a \ngross injustice and gross unfairness to Latinos. Effectively, they \nwiped out their remedy.\n  What this amendment will do is just give them the opportunity to make \nthat adjustment. This is all about working. It is about working. It is \nabout a green card and working. That is what this is basically about. \nWe hear lectures from the other side all the time about how we want to \nencourage people to work. These groups want to work. They want to work. \nThey are unable to work because of the refusal of the majority leader \nto permit consideration of this amendment.\n  I see we are joined by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Then the majority leader calls up Democrats' amendments without even \nnotifying the Senators they are being called up.\n  This is rather embarrassing, I would think, for Members to have \namendments called up and they are over in their office trying to do \nconstituency work. Their constituencies are going to wonder: Where in \nthe world is my Senator? His amendment, or her amendment, is before the \nSenate. Where is that individual?\n  In 38 years I have never seen that.\n  I hope we are not going to have lectures from the other side: Well, \nwe are in charge around here. Evidently they don't care very much about \nthe rules, or at least about the courtesies and the degree of civility \nwe have had about calling up other Senators' amendments. This goes just \nas far as I can possibly imagine.\n  The one thing that bothers me is, what is it that they fear? What is \nit possibly that they fear which causes us to have to take all of this \ntime to pass this legislation?\n  Maybe the Senator from Illinois will respond. I want to direct it to \nthe Senator from Nevada. What is it that they fear? Why is it that they \ntake these extraordinary, unique, exceptional steps to deny a fair \ndebate about fairness to Latinos?\n  Mr. REID. In answer to the Senator, I repeat that I have the greatest \nrespect for the thousands of people who came to this country and are \nhere now as a result of H-1B legislation. It is very important. Those \nhigh-tech jobs are important. But I say to my friend from Massachusetts \nthat it is just as important to people who work in these restaurants \nand who work in these health care facilities as nurses, as cooks, as \nwaiters, as waitresses, and as maids, their jobs are just as important \nbecause people who are running these establishments need these \nessential workers. That is who they are. ``Essential workers.'' They \nare skilled and semi-skilled workers.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts that we have had a hue and cry \nfrom the people on the other side of the aisle and from the Governor of \nTexas and others saying they believe there should be fairness to Latino \nimmigrants. The best way to express that desire for fairness is to \nallow us to vote on this measure.\n  Let's have an up-or-down vote on the amendment offered by myself, the \nSenator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Reed of \nRhode Island, and Senator Graham of Florida. Let's move this debate \nalong. We could speed up the time. We would agree to a half hour evenly \ndivided. It could take 30 minutes. Vote on it and move on.\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\n  I would like to see how people would express themselves on this vote. \nIt is very important.\n  I have a constituency that is watching this very closely. The State \nof Nevada has the sixth largest school district in America: the Clark \nCounty School District. In that school district, over 25 percent of the \nchildren are Hispanic.\n  In Nevada, we also have 20,000 people, the majority of whom are \nHispanic who are unable to work because they were, in effect, denied \ndue process by a sneaky thing put in the 1996 act. I want them to have \na due process hearing to determine whether or not they should remain in \nthe United States. I believe the vast majority would remain here \nbecause fairness would dictate that they should.\n  That is what this is all about--basic fairness. That is why we call \nit the Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  I say to anyone within the sound of my voice that if we are \ninterested in speeding up what is going on here in Washington, in the \nCongress, let's have a vote on this measure that Senator Kennedy, I, \nand others are pressing. We will agree. I said we will take 30 minutes, \nbut we would agree to 10 minutes evenly divided. Let's have a vote up \nor down on this measure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. What seems interesting to me is I helped to lead the fight \nyears ago in 1996 in my own committee to increase legal immigration in \nthis country. I have led the fight for that. We are talking about \ngiving amnesty to illegal immigrants while not increasing the caps on \nlegal immigration. Something is wrong.\n  Mr. REID. Is that the question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me complete my question. In order to make my question \nclear, I have to make these points.\n  We can't get caps lifted on legal immigration. It is my understanding \nthat on the H-1B bill--which just had a 94 to 3 vote and that should \npass right out of here, has had hearings, and everything else--you want \nto hold it hostage because you want to give amnesty to 500,000 illegal \nimmigrants.\n  Mr. REID. Is that the Senator's question to me?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask my question. Is it not true that this major new \namnesty program, which has not had one day of hearings, if it passes \nwould legalize up to 2 million people? I know there are those on your \nside who say there are one-half million illegal immigrants. Is it not \ntrue that the price tag for this major new amnesty program to legalize \nup to 2 million people is almost $1.4 billion, and that the underlying \nbill that we are trying to pass here--the H-1B bill--would basically \nprovide the high-tech workers that we absolutely have to have?\n  Mr. REID. With the greatest respect, I say to my friend, ask me a \nquestion. I have the floor, and I will be happy to answer.\n  Mr. HATCH. I did. Isn't it going to cost us $1.4 billion to give \namnesty to these illegal immigrants?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to respond to the question.\n  First of all, we are not talking about illegal immigrants. We are \ntalking about giving people who are in this country due process.\n  Mr. HATCH. Illegally in this country.\n  Mr. REID. And whether or not they are entitled to remain in this \ncountry. I believe in due process. One of the basic and fundamental \nassets that we have in this country, which sets us far and above any \nother country, is the legal system. We require and expect due process.\n  What we are saying is the bill that we passed in 1996 gave amnesty to \npeople who had been in this country for an extended period of time. A \nprovision was stuck in the 1996 Immigration Reform bill that denied \nthese people due process. Some of them didn't meet the deadline to file \nfor their amnesty because the INS ignored a law that we passed and \nPresident Reagan signed into law.\n  The question is not how much it is going to cost the Government but \nhow much it is going to cost the business sector in this country.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Health Care Association, \nthe American Hotel and Motel Association, the American Nursing \nAssociation, the American Nursery and Landscape Association, Associated \nBuilders and Contractors, and the Associated General Contractors \nsupport this amendment. I could read further for the next 15 minutes \nand give chart after chart of organizations that support this \namendment.\n  We believe it is good for the American economy. It is good for \nAmerican industry. It is the fair thing to do.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the assistant Democratic leader yield for a \nquestion as well?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend, the Democratic \nleader, for a question, without losing the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask the assistant Democratic leader--I wasn't on the \nfloor when this began. I ask if the Senator from Nevada could confirm \nwhat I understand to be our circumstance. I apologize for not being \nhere sooner. But as I understand the circumstances, our Republican \ncolleagues have filed cloture on second-degree amendments, and they had \nintended, as I understand it, to file it on the bill and made a \nmistake. We understand that. They have created a problem for themselves \nthat they are trying to get out of.\n  But my question is: I ask the Senator from Nevada if the issue is \nwhether or not we ought to have the right to offer an amendment.\n  We have been debating the issue of immigration as if an amendment \nwere pending. We have been debating this issue assuming that somehow \nthere is opposition on the Republican side and support for an amendment \non the Democratic side.\n  In the normal course of debate, you ultimately lead to a vote on an \namendment. As I understand it, the Republicans have denied us the right \nto offer an amendment. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct.\n  It would seem to me the best way to handle this is to accept the two \namendments. We, the minority, will accept, on a voice vote, the two \namendments that have been filed, and then I think the fair thing would \nbe to allow us to proceed on an amendment that has been filed. It is \nright here: Mr. Kennedy, for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Graham, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Daschle submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 2045, the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me ask the assistant Democratic leader, I have to \nsay for those who may not have watched the 106th Congress, we have \nestablished a new threshold. It used to be anytime a majority opposed \nan amendment, they would vote against it. They would perhaps make a \nmotion to table an amendment, we would have the debate, they would \nvote, and the issue would be behind us. Oftentimes, the minority would \nlose. That is the way it used to be.\n  Then our colleagues on the other side of the aisle raised it another \nnotch. They said: We don't think you ought to have the right to offer \nan amendment, so we will file cloture on a bill denying you the right \nto even offer an amendment. That was the new threshold.\n  We have gone through many, many of these--in fact, a record number. I \nhave given presentations on the floor regarding the number of times our \ncolleagues have actually filed cloture to deny us the right to offer an \namendment.\n  This now reaches way beyond that. For the first time--maybe in \nhistory--our Republican colleague, without his even knowing it, has \noffered a Democratic amendment, has second-degreed that amendment, \ncontinued to file cloture, to say with even greater determination, we \nare not going to let you offer an amendment.\n  I ask the assistant Democratic leader in the time he has been in the \nSenate whether he can recall a time when we have ever seen the majority \ngo to that length to deny Members the right to offer an amendment in \nthe Record dealing with immigration or any other issue for that matter?\n  Mr. REID. I have not. I don't think anyone else has. I say to the \nleader and anyone else listening, all we want to do----\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor; does he \nyield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. I do not.\n  Mr. HATCH. Just this point.\n\n[[Page S9223]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend, without losing the floor, \nMr. President, or any of the time I might have. I ask unanimous consent \nthe Senator from Utah be allowed to direct a parliamentary inquiry to \nthe Chair without my losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. My colleague is always gracious. I have heard this comment \nabout this being the first time anybody has called up another person's \namendment. Parliamentary inquiry: Is this the first time?\n\n  As I recall, last year Senator Reid called up an amendment of Senator \nJeffords.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair repeat the question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question was, Is this the first time this \nhas happened? Do you recall Senator Reid calling up an amendment of \nSenator Jeffords? That was the question.\n  ``Riddick's Rules of Procedure,'' on page 34, cites several examples.\n  Mr. HATCH. This isn't the first time.\n  Mr. REID. Reclaiming the floor, I say to my friend from Utah, there \nmay have been other occasions, and the Chair certainly is right in \nindicating that it has been done before.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator allow the Chair to state the answer to my \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. The Chair already stated the answer.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The answer was on page 34 of Riddick's; there \nare several examples of that having happened.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would the assistant Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the point I was trying to make, \nand I asked the response of the assistant Democratic leader, I don't \nknow that I have ever seen the majority go to the extremes they have on \nso many of the levels I have described to deny Members the right to \noffer amendments.\n  Have there been precedents where the Senators have offered another \nDemocrat or Republican amendment? Of course. But have they done so with \nall of the other layers of opposition, parliamentarily, that have been \nnow shown to be the case here? Again, I argue, no, they have not. I \nthink this is the most remarkable set of circumstances.\n  What is amazing to me is we have already offered a limit on time. All \nwe want is a simple opportunity to debate the issue for a brief period \nso we can be on record with regard to fairness for these many millions \nof immigrants who are looking to us right now for relief. That is all \nthey are doing. Whether they are Liberians, whether they are Latinos, \nwe have a responsibility in this Congress to respond.\n  The President has said to me personally, and he has said in as many \nways as he knows how, that he will demand this legislation be addressed \nbefore the end of the Congress. He has said that. If we don't do it on \nthis, on what will we do it?\n  So I ask the assistant Democratic leader if he shares my conviction \nthat, first, this extraordinarily unique set of circumstances again \nreflects the opposition on the part of the majority to basic fairness \nprocedurally and basic fairness with regard to Latinos in this country \ntoday?\n  Mr. REID. I answer the leader's question as follows: First of all, it \nis very clear that the President will accept nothing short of this \nlegislation. In fact, there is a letter. I don't think it is any \nsecret. We have more than 40 signatures from the Democrats--we only \nneeded 34--to the President, saying if, in fact, he does veto this, we \nwill sustain that veto.\n  I also say to my friend, it is obvious the majority does not want \nthis legislation to pass. They are trying to confuse it. The managing \nword is always ``illegal immigration.'' This is not about illegal \nimmigration. It has everything to do with fairness in our immigration \nlaws, and helping the American business community in essential fields \nwhere they cannot fill the jobs.\n  In Nevada, we have approximately 20,000 people who want to work--who \nwant to go back to work. They have had their work cards withdrawn. They \nhave had their mortgages foreclosed. They have had their cars \nrepossessed. People in America who have children--wives, husbands, \nAmerican citizens--all they want is a fair hearing. All they want is a \nfair hearing that would allow them to keep their families together. \nThat is what this legislation is all about.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield for one last question, I also \nyield the Senator from Nevada 30 minutes of my time.\n  I hope the Latino community, the Liberian community, all of those \ncommunities concerned about this immigration language, understand why \nwe are here. We are here in the last days of this session to make right \nthe problem that has existed all too long. We want to make it right. \nThe President wants to sign this legislation. Unfortunately, apparently \nwith unanimity, every one of our Republican colleagues oppose this. We \nhaven't heard one of them come to our position on this issue.\n  I hope the Latino community understands that. I hope those who are \nconcerned about fairness at the end of this session understand that. I \nhope they will do all they can to reflect their feelings and their \nopinions before it is too late. We still have time to do this. We still \nshould do it this week. We ought to do it on this bill. I hope our \nRepublican colleagues will reconsider.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is a national leader as part of his \nresponsibilities. The Senator from South Dakota is not doing this \nbecause there are a lot of minorities in South Dakota; in fact, there \nare very few. He is doing this because it is the right thing to do. It \nis fair to people who are in America and want the right to have their \nstatus adjusted or reviewed in a due process hearing. That doesn't \nsound too unreasonable to me.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield for a question from my colleague \nfrom California without losing the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I thank him and Senator Daschle, our \nleadership team here, for what you are doing. The Senator from Utah \nasked, I thought, a very reasonable question when he said: What is this \ngoing to cost?\n  I say to my friend, on the issue of cost--and I think this is \nimportant--what happens to a family when the worker in that family is \ntold to leave? Because if we do not pass this law--which is what our \nfriends want; they do not want us to pass this law--that worker goes \nback to the country of origin and has to wait 10 years there, leaving \nbehind--let us say it is a man in this case--a wife and children, \nchildren who are citizens of this country.\n  My friend from Utah says: Illegal.\n  Those are American children. If we do not act, their dad is going to \nbe deported. For 10 years they will have to wait. What happens to the \ncost when a wage earner has to leave this country, perhaps for up to 10 \nyears, leaving the children behind? The Senator pointed out the \nbusiness community is without workers, so they are going to have to pay \nmore to get fewer workers. That is a cost. But what is the cost if \nthese people have to go on welfare, I say to my friend, because the \nbreadwinner is summarily removed from this country because we have \nfailed to act on this immigration fairness act?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the distinguished assistant leader yield for another \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. The cost here is very apparent. First of all, this person \nis being deported without a due process hearing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. REID. This person being deported leaves behind a job that is \nunfilled. That employer looks and looks to try to find somebody to fill \nthat job. What is the cost of that, and then the cost, many times, to \nour welfare system, our criminal justice system, our education system.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. REID. The costs are untold. I do not know what they would be, but \nwe know they would be remarkably high. There are sociologists and \nmathematicians who could figure it out. That is why I say to my friend \nfrom California, we have dozens and dozens and dozens of groups of \npeople and organizations that support doing something.\n  I said earlier, I say to my friend from California--I spoke yesterday \nto the National Restaurant Association. They\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\nare desperate for people to work in their establishments. They are \ndesperate for people to clean dishes, wait tables, cook food, serve \nfood. I say to my friend from California, that job may not be very \nglamorous, one of those jobs I have described, but it is just as \nimportant to the individual who has it as the 420,000 high-tech jobs \nthat we have allowed people from outside the U.S. to come here to fill, \njust as important.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the assistant minority leader yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mrs. BOXER. When I am completed I am sure there will be time for \nothers, but I do not want to lose my train of thought.\n\n  What my friend has said is when someone asks what is the cost of this \nimmigration fairness act amendment, we are saying it is more costly not \nto act because of the impact on the business community and their \nability to get help is huge. The impact on the family, when the \nbreadwinner has to leave behind American citizen children and perhaps \nthe mom has to go on welfare, is very high, not to mention the cost of \nsplitting up families. My friend has been a leader on this, as has my \nfriend from Utah as well. We know what happens when parents split up. \nWe know the costs to society. We know what happens to the kids. We know \nwhat happens to people using alcohol to dull the pain and all those \nthings, when a family is summarily split apart.\n  I do not hear my friends on the other side saying, ``change the law \nfor Nicaraguans or Cubans.'' Good for them, we should allow those \npeople to stay. What about the Salvadorans?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from California by saying she is \nabsolutely right. But one cost we have not calculated is: What is the \ncost to a family that is broken up? I said on the floor yesterday, and \nI will repeat--I am sorry some will have to listen to it more than \nonce--Secretary Richardson, now Secretary of Energy, was Ambassador to \nthe United Nations. He came to Nevada. We had a good day visiting, \ndoing work.\n  The last stop of the day was at a recreation center in an area of Las \nVegas that is mostly Hispanic. As we were approaching, our staffs said: \nLet's take you in the back door because there is a big demonstration \nout front. We think you should not be disturbed. You can go in; we have \npeople we have invited in and you could have a conversation.\n  We thought it over and we said, no, we are going to go in the front \ndoor. As we walked in the front door, we saw hundreds of people, many \nwith brown faces--although I have to tell you there were many white \nfaces as well and they were there to tell Secretary Richardson and I \nthat what was happening was unfair. They qualified under the 1986 \namnesty, but they had taken more than a year to file because the INS \nwas not playing by the rules, and they were not entitled, under the \n1996 provision that was tucked into the immigration reform bill, to a \ndue process hearing. They were saying:\n\n       I worked at Caesar's Palace. I was a cook. I made good \n     money. I had a union job. I bought my own home. I have lost \n     my home, I have lost my car, and now I am being asked to lose \n     my family. That is unfair. I have American children. Here, do \n     you want to see them? Here they are.\n\n  So I say to my friend from California, it is absolutely mandatory \nthat we push this legislation. I am so grateful that Vice President \nGore has stated publicly that he supports this legislation; not some \ndifferent legislation, not trying to wiggle out of it--he supports this \nlegislation.\n  I say to George W. Bush, I can't speak Spanish. I have three children \nwho speak fluent Spanish. I can't speak Spanish. He shows off speaking \nthe little bit of Spanish he knows. Let him speak English and come here \nand tell us he supports this legislation. That will show he supports \nthe Hispanic community in America and their priorities.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question without losing the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask to be added as cosponsor to this \namendment, that is so important, to the Latino and Immigrant Fairness \nAct.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The last question I have is this: Our colleagues are up \nin arms about allowing us to have a vote on this, but they are bringing \nout amendments without even asking the authors if they want them \nattached to this particular bill. It amazes me.\n  I guess the final question I have for my assistant leader is this: If \nour friends on the other side do not like this bill, why do they not \njust vote against it? We are not asking to pass this without a vote. \nAre we not asking for the ability to put this on the Senate floor, \ndebate it very briefly--or as long as they want? You yourself said, I \nthink, you would take 10 minutes of debate and whatever the other side \nwants. Is it not their right to vote against this fairness legislation \nif they so desire?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from California, as usual, you brought \nthings down so it is very easy to portray what is going on here; that \nis, they do not want to vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is it.\n  Mr. REID. They don't what to vote. They want to be able to go home \nand say they are for all this fairness and immigration. How can they \nprove it? Well, because they say so.\n  I say to my friend from California, the only way to prove this is to \nallow us to vote. This is a basic principle. If you don't like \nsomething, vote against it.\n  It appears to me that because the President and Vice President have \nbeen unflinching in this--they have said this legislation will pass or \nthis Congress will not adjourn. We have enough votes to sustain a veto. \nI think we are in good shape.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from Vermont. My friend \nfrom Illinois indicated he had a question. I will be happy to yield to \nmy friend from Illinois for a question without losing the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And then, Mr. President, if he will yield to me for a \nquestion also?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada for leading this debate. \nI think it is important from time to time, as we get into debate, if \nthe Senator would respond, for us to recap where we are so those who \nare trying to follow the debate understand it.\n  The underlying bill, the H-1B visa bill, will allow companies in \nAmerica to bring in skilled workers from overseas. They are telling us \nthey cannot find those workers in America's labor pool. We decided \nunder the H-1B visa, in 1998, to increase the number who could be \nbrought in this fiscal year to 107,500. They are telling us that number \nis inadequate. They cannot find the workers in America to fill their \nneeds and they do not want to move their companies overseas.\n  So the underlying bill--I ask the Senator from Nevada to confirm \nthis--the underlying bill, at the request of businesses across America, \nwould increase the number who can be brought in for these skilled labor \njobs to 195,000 a year. Am I correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friend from Illinois, that is part of the \nbill. There are other things included in it, but that is absolutely \nright.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the idea behind the underlying bill is that, at the \nrequest of business, we will bring in these skilled workers so they can \ncontinue to thrive in this economy, continue to create more jobs, and \nnot have to move their businesses overseas?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, we hear a hue and cry--\nand you and I have been doing some of the crying--about the businesses \nmoving overseas. One reason they are doing that is, of course, there is \ncheap labor overseas. But the other is they can't find enough people to \ndo the work here. So they throw their arms up and ask us to help them.\n  I believe it is so important we understand this legislation, of which \nthe Senator from Illinois has been a constant supporter, and as a \ncosponsor of the amendment we have filed, this Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act of 2000.\n  Let's not confuse this. My friend from Utah raised the words: \n``Illegal immigration. Aren't we supporting illegal immigration?'' Let \nthe Record be spread with the fact this is not about illegal \nimmigration. This has everything to do with fairness--fairness not\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\nfor some mystical people off on the horizon but for human beings who \nlive in Las Vegas, who live in Winnemucca, or Chicago, and other places \nthroughout America. All they want is a chance at the American dream. \nThey are not asking for anything other than a fair hearing and the \nright to work as they know how.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would further yield for a question, the \nunderlying bill, at the request of the business interests in this \nNation, will allow us to increase the number of skilled immigrants \ncoming in on temporary visas to 195,000 a year.\n  The amendment which the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, as well as the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed, Senator Leahy of Vermont, and I want to offer to this \nlegislation even addresses it, I think, with more persuasion because \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, which we are pushing as an \namendment to this bill, is supported not only by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce but by the AFL-CIO as well. Business groups and labor groups \nhave come together and said: If you are going to address the issue of \nimmigration, jobs, keeping the economy moving, don't stop with the H-\n1B, 195,000; deal with American workers who are here who need to be \ntreated fairly.\n  Am I correct in saying to the Senator from Nevada, this is one of the \nrare examples I have seen on an immigration issue where business and \nlabor have come together so strongly, saying to us this is the best \nthing for workers and their families and the economy, the amendment we \nare cosponsoring--the amendment being resisted by the Republican \nleadership, is it the same amendment?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois--and I apologize for not \nanswering the last question directly; the Senator from Illinois has \nprojected what is absolutely the question before the Senate; and that \nis, we, the Democrats, have been willing to support bringing high-tech \nworkers here. In fact, almost 500,000 of them have come here to work \nbecause the high-tech sector which is fueling our economy needs such \nworkers.\n  All we want to do is make sure that other essential workers--which is \nhow I refer to them--skilled and semi-skilled workers come here so that \nthey are able to do the work at Ingersoll-Rand, at Harborside \nHealthcare Corporation, at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, at Carlson \nRestaurants Worldwide and TGI Friday's, and at the Brickman Group, Ltd.\n  As the Senator has indicated, the American Federation of Labor, the \nAmerican Chamber of Commerce--where else have we been able to see these \ntwo groups coming together pushing a single piece of legislation? I can \ntell you one other, and that is a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right.\n  If the Senator would yield for a further question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the distinction here on the H-1B visa question \nis, we are talking about bringing new workers, new skilled workers, in \non a temporary basis to fill the needs of companies. The amendment, \nwhich we want to offer and which the Republicans are resisting, deals \nwith workers already in America, many of whom are asking to be treated \nfairly under our immigration laws. Business and labor, as well, are \nsaying they deserve to be treated fairly.\n  As an example, the Senator from Nevada has talked about those who \ncame to this country, started families, started working, paid their \ntaxes, never once committed a crime, building their communities and \ntheir neighborhoods, and are now caught in this snarl, this tangle, \nthis bureaucratic nightmare of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService. They are asking for their chance, as many of our parents and \ngrandparents had, to become American citizens legally and finally.\n  It strikes me as odd that those of us in the Senate who understand \nhow bad this immigration battle is for individuals and families would \nresist this amendment, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  In my office in Chicago, in my senatorial office, two-thirds of the \ncasework is on immigration. We are in a constant battle with the INS. \nWhat our amendment seeks to do is to say these people deserve fair \ntreatment. For goodness' sake, you can call yourself a compassionate \nconservative or a compassionate liberal or a compassionate moderate, \nbut if you believe in compassion, how can you resist an amendment that \nis going to give to these families here in America--working hard, \nbuilding our Nation--a chance to be treated fairly under the law?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my distinguished friend from Illinois, all \nthese people want is a fair hearing. Some of them, after they have a \nfair hearing, may not have merits to their case, and they may have to \ngo back to their country of origin. But in America, shouldn't they at \nleast be entitled to a fair hearing where they have due process? The \nobvious answer is yes.\n  I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator from Illinois on \nthis issue and his ability to articulate something that is so \nimportant. We all have the same situation in our offices, those of us \nwho have large minority populations. In my office, I have two Spanish-\nspeaking people working in my Las Vegas office, one in my Reno office, \nthe purpose of which is to work on these very difficult cases. I think \nit is very good that the Senator from Illinois can condense an issue so \nunderstandably.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Vermont wishes me to \nyield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Just for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield without losing my right to the floor. But \nbefore yielding to my friend, without losing my right to the floor, I \nwant to say to my friend from Vermont----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can only yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that. I have the floor. I am just making a \nstatement.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont, I am so proud of you. I say that for \nthis reason: I saw some statistics the other day about the State of \nVermont. You have very few minorities in Vermont. For you to be the \nnational leader on this issue that you have been takes a lot of \npolitical courage. It would be easy for you to be an ``immigrant \nbasher,'' to talk about how bad illegal immigrants are and how bad it \nis to be dealing with this issue. But you, as the ranking Democrat on \nthe Judiciary Committee, have stepped forward.\n  I say to my friend, the Senator from Vermont, you have stepped \nforward in a way that brings a sense of relief to this body because you \nhave no dog in the fight, so to speak. You are here because you are \ntrying to be a fair arbiter. You are the ranking Democrat on the \nJudiciary Committee. That is why we, the rest of the members of the \nminority, have followed you as a leader on matters relating to things \nthat come through that very important Judiciary Committee.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Vermont for a question, without \nmy losing the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my friend the Senator from Nevada has given \nme more credit than I deserve, but I do strongly support the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act, as just that, a matter of fairness, as \nsomething we should do. Whether we have a large immigrant population in \nour States or not, this is something where Senators are going to \nreflect the conscience of the Nation, as this body should.\n  My question is this. I was over at one of our latest investigation \ncommittee meetings. We tend to investigate rather than legislate in \nthis body. I was at a meeting where the Senate decided to go ahead and \ninvestigate the Wen Ho Lee investigation and, thus, hold up the FBI, \nwho were supposed to be debriefing Dr. Wen Ho Lee today under the court \nagreement. Instead, in the Senate we jumped in, feet first, to \ninterfere with that. I had to be off the floor to serve as Ranking \nDemocrat of Judiciary at that hearing. So I wonder if the Senator from \nNevada could explain the parliamentary procedure in which we find \nourselves. It seems somewhat of a strange one.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to respond to my friend from Vermont. There will \nprobably be chapters of books written about what has gone on today. It \nis going to take some political scientists and some academicians to \nfigure out what went on here today.\n  As of now, Senator Conrad from North Dakota filed an amendment, \naccording to the unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\norder that was in effect. The majority leader called up his amendment \nwithout notifying the Senator from North Dakota. Then Senator Lott \ncalled Senator Conrad's amendment and then offered a second-degree \namendment to Senator Conrad's amendment. It was very unusual.\n  The purpose, of course, is so we, the minority, once again, would be \nstymied from offering an amendment and how would that be so? Because \nthe majority does not want to vote on amendments, whether it is an \namendment on whether we should close the gun loophole as to whether \nemotionally disturbed people or criminals, may buy guns at gun shows or \npawnshops. That doesn't sound too unreasonable to me. This is a \nloophole that should be closed. They won't let us vote on the Patients' \nBill of Rights either.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a simple parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. They won't let us vote on anything dealing with \nprescription drugs, school construction, or lowering class size, as \nwell as on the very ``bad'' concept called the minimum wage. They don't \nallow us to vote on that because they don't want to be recorded. You \nknow how they will vote; they will vote no.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Vermont, that is why we are in the \nposition we are in.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a----\n  Mr. REID. Once again, we are prevented from moving forward. The \nSenate has worked a couple hundred years to vote on amendments. But \nrecently we have a new style. If you don't vote on something, you are \nbetter off than if you do.\n  In fact, I saw something earlier today where the majority leader said \n``that when the Republicans aren't here, their popularity goes up.'' \nBut here is the quote:\n\n       We were out of town two months and our approval rating went \n     up 11 points.\n\n  That was from February 3, 2000, by the leader. I think they have just \nextended this a little bit. Not only when they are out of town does \ntheir approval rating go up, I think they learned that if they don't \nhave to vote, their approval rating doesn't go down.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from Vermont, without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my friend yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. LEAHY. On this question, I have been here now with a number of \ndistinguished majority leaders, all of whom have been friends of mine: \nthe Senator from Montana, Mr. Mike Mansfield; the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Robert C. Byrd; the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Howard \nBaker; the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Robert Dole; the Senator from \nMaine, Mr. George Mitchell. During that time, I do not recall a case \nwhere a majority leader, even though they have the ability to call up \nan amendment, has ever done that without giving notice first to the \nSenator who sponsored the amendment. That is during my now almost 26 \nyears with all these distinguished, both Democratic and Republican, \nmajority leaders. Has it been the experience of the distinguished \nDemocratic deputy leader that if the leader is going to call up another \nSenator's amendment, that they give the sponsor notice?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Vermont, there was an interesting \ndiscussion on the floor yesterday where a Senator mentioned another \nSenator's name on the floor without advising that Senator that he was \ngoing to be using his name. And the most senior Democrat disagreed with \nthat. He said it was unfair to talk about another Senator when that \nSenator was not on the floor.\n  If we carry that logic to what the Senator just asked, I think it \nwould also be improper if Senator Leahy filed an amendment pursuant to \nan order that had been entered into the Senate and the Senator from \nNevada, without saying a word to the Senator from Vermont, called it \nup.\n  Now, we have been told by the Parliamentarian that there have been \ntimes in the past when other Senators have called up other Senator's \namendments. We all know that. I have called up amendments for you when \nyou haven't been here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. With my permission.\n  Mr. REID. With your permission. And you have done the same for me. \nThat is the way it works. But to do something where the Senator is over \nin his office waiting for a time to be able to offer his amendment and \nit is suddenly called up, I am not totally aware of this.\n  I say, through the Chair, to my friend from Utah, I would be happy to \nyield to my friend from Utah for a parliamentary inquiry, if I do not \nlose the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have three or four parliamentary inquiries. I will make \nthem very short.\n  It is my understanding, is it not, that the Latino fairness bill, \namendment No. 4185, was just introduced on July 25 of this year; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair does not have access to those dates.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is that a parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President?\n  Mr. HATCH. Is it not true that the amendment called the Latino \nfairness bill is No. 4184 and that it is not germane because 94-3, \nRepublicans and Democrats, have voted for cloture; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the opinion of the Chair that amendment \nNo. 4184 is not germane.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry: Since the Senate voted 94-3, \nDemocrats and Republicans, on a bipartisan way to limit debate, that \namendment would be moved out of order; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. I would say to the Chair----\n  Mr. HATCH. May I get an answer to my question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, through the Chair, I have no \nproblem with the Senator making these parliamentary inquiries. July 25, \nI don't know if that is right, but that is fine. I also think, as we \nsay in the law, his inquiry is not at this time justiciable. The fact \nthat the Parliamentarian, through the Chair, ruled that this amendment, \nif offered, would not be germane does not mean that that ruling is \ntaking place now. There is no ruling at this stage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator have other parliamentary inquiries.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. As long as I don't lose the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, the amendment, No. 4184, would not be \ngermane.\n  Mr. REID. I am reclaiming the floor. I say to my friend from Utah, \nthat question has already been answered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada can reclaim the floor.\n  Mr. REID. At an appropriate time, I hope we have the opportunity to \noffer this amendment. I came to the floor Friday and asked unanimous \nconsent that we be allowed to proceed to this. What the minority is \nsaying, is that there is no need to play any parliamentary games. What \nwe want to do is to be able to have an up-or-down vote on amendment No. \n4184, whether the underlying legislation was filed on July 25, February \n1, or 2 minutes ago. We want a vote on the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act of 2000. We want a vote. But, if the majority is going to \ncome in here under some parliamentary guise and say that it is not \ngermane, that is their right. But I want everyone to know--and I spread \nit across the record of this Senate--that is an obstacle that is \nunnecessary. They should allow us to vote on this if they believe that \nthere should be fairness, as we have tried to outline here today, \npeople who are already here, already working, or trying to work. We are \nnot hauling in new people from outside the borders of the country. We \nwant the people here to have a fair shot. That is all we want. If the \nmajority does not want that, let them vote against it. I started out \nsaying we would have an hour evenly divided. Then I said a half hour \nevenly divided. We are down to 10 minutes now, 5 minutes a side, that \nwe would take on this.\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\nWe want an up-or-down vote. I think it is fair to have an up-or-down \nvote on this amendment.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, without my losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada makes a compelling \nargument. Consider the extraordinary and, I believe, unprecedented \nprocedure of the majority leader in calling up an amendment of a \nDemocratic Senator who was not consulted. Note that the amendment is \nthe amendment filed just before the amendment that we have been trying \nto have considered to provide Latino and immigration fairness, the one \non which we are being denied consideration or a vote. The amendment on \nthe Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is something we ought to at least \nhave the guts to stand up and vote up or down on and let the Latino \npopulation of this country know where we stand.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, this exercise--to me, at least--\nappears to be an attempt to keep us from voting on something of \nsignificance to this country. Isn't this very similar to what we have \nseen on the question of judges, where anonymous holds from the \nRepublican side have stopped us from voting up or down on judicial \nnominations for months and years in some cases; and anonymous holds \nfrom the Republican side are currently preventing Senate action on the \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorization; and anonymous holds from \nthe Republican side have been preventing Senate action on the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, a bill to help fund \nbulletproof vests to protect our State and local police officers; and \nanonymous holds on the Republican side have prevented passage of the \nvisa waiver legislation; and anonymous holds on the Republican side are \npreventing the Senate from passing the Computer Crime Enforcement Act? \nIs there a pattern here? The majority appears not to want to allow the \nSenate to either vote for or against these measures. They should at \nleast allow us to vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will respond to only one of the things he \nhas listed because the obvious answer to every one is that he is right. \nAbout the bulletproof vests, that is very important to the people of \nNevada. Why? Because some people believe that Nevada, is a State that \nis very rural in nature. That is not true. Nevada is the most urban \nState in America because 90 percent of the people live in the \nmetropolitan Reno or Las Vegas areas. Ten percent live outside of Reno \nor Las Vegas. Those 10 percent, in Winnemucca and Lovelock, all through \nNevada--those little police departments cannot afford bulletproof \nvests. As a result of that, we have people who are hurt and not able to \ndo their work as well. Some of them have to buy their own vests and \nusually they are not very good.\n  What the legislation the Senator from Vermont has pushed, and we have \ngotten a little money on some of his legislation, we need to make sure \nthat in rural America, rural Nevada, in places such as Ely and Pioche \nand police officers in these rural places in Nevada get the same \nprotection against the criminal element that the people who are police \nofficers in the big cities have. So the Senator from Vermont is \nabsolutely right. We have a game being played here; they don't want to \nvote on tough issues. They have been pretty successful. And, I am sorry \nto say that they have been successful. We have spent little time \ndebating issues and voting. We have spent a lot of time thinking about \nwhat we are going to do next, which is normally nothing.\n\n  My friend from Rhode Island has asked that I yield to him for a \nquestion, which I will do if I do not lose my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, like the Senator, I am frustrated because we \nare trying to simply recognize the reality that there are many, many \nindividuals in the United States who have been here for years and who \ndeserve an opportunity to become permanent residents, and it is not \nonly within the Latino community but the Liberian community. These \nindividuals from Liberia came over legally, under temporary protective \nstatus. That is one of the pieces of legislation also frustrated by \nthis device to preclude amendments.\n  I wonder if the Senator might amplify the fact that, indeed, if we \nwere successful to get a vote on this measure, we could also address \nthe issue of 10,000 Liberians who are literally perhaps hours from \nbeing deported, except for administrative order, and it is a population \nthat has contributed to our communities; and we should recognize that \nthey deserve the opportunity to adjust to permanent status, and they \nare being ignored by these parliamentary maneuvers--worse than ignored.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there are ever any prizes given by a \nhigher being to someone who cares about a group of people who have no \none out there as their advocate or champion, Jack Reed from Rhode \nIsland will get one of those prizes. Nobody else has been as vocal a \nproponent for doing justice to those 10,000 individuals who have no \nother spokesperson. I congratulate the Senator for being very open and \nvocal. I have to tell him that but for him his amendment would not be \npart of this legislation about which we are speaking. I am very proud \nof the Senator from Rhode Island for the great work he has done.\n  I also respond in this way. Some of the people I am trying to help in \nNevada have been there 30 years--not 30 days, 30 hours, 30 months, but \n30 years. They want a fair hearing. When I first went to law school, I \nheard the words ``due process'' and really didn't know what that meant. \nI quickly came to learn in law school that it is the foundation of our \nsystem of justice. People who are here, no matter how they got here, \nshould be entitled to basic fairness. So I thank my friend from Rhode \nIsland for trying to help more than 10,000 Liberians get a fair \nhearing. That is basically what this is all about.\n  My friend from Florida has been on the floor now for a long period of \ntime. He has indicated to me that he has a question. I am happy to \nyield for a question without my losing the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, Senator Reed from Rhode Island has done an outstanding \njob of bringing to our attention the plight of those 10,000 Liberians, \nmany of whom are his friends in Rhode Island. I want to talk about \nanother group of about 10,000. That is a group of Haitians. There are \nmany more than 10,000 Haitians who have come to the United States in \nthe last decade, decade and a half, fleeing first the dictatorship of \nthe Duvaliers, and then the military dictatorship that succeeded the \nDuvaliers. Most of those Haitians came by boat and most had no \ndocumentation. They had no papers of any type when they came into the \ncountry.\n  Under the immigration law we passed in 1998, subject to one \nadditional complexity--which I will talk about at another time--which \nwe are trying to get resolved with this legislation, they will be \nentitled to make their case for legal residence in the United States. I \nthink at this point it is important we indicate that in virtually every \ninstance we are talking about, we are not talking about granting a \nlegal status and, certainly, not granting citizenship. What we are \ntalking about is giving people a chance to apply, and that their \napplication will be accepted and given appropriate due process and \nconsideration. Without the kind of provisions we are trying to \naccomplish in this Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, they can't even \nsubmit the papers to start the process.\n  Let me go back to the 10,000 Haitians who arrived by air. The irony \nis that they tended to be people who were under a particular threat of \ndeath or serious abuse and persecution. They felt the necessity not to \nbe able to wait for a boat but to get out as quickly as possible. In \norder to get on the airplane, they had to go to somebody who \ncounterfeits passports and other documentation that was required to get \non the plane and get out of Haiti in the 1980s and early part of the \n1990s. When they arrived in the United States they were not without \ndocuments. But they had false, counterfeit documents.\n  If you can believe it, under our current immigration law, we make a \ndistinction between a person who is flying--and arguably in a severe \ncase of persecution--with false documents and is denied the right to \napply for legal status, whereas a person who comes with no documents at \nall is allowed.\n  This legislation will correct what I think is one of the most \nindefensible examples of unfairness to people who essentially are in \nthe same condition\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\nbut have a minor technical differentiation--in this case, with no \ndocuments, OK; and, with false or counterfeit documents precluded from \nthe opportunity to apply. We would eliminate that and allow both the \nno-document Haitians and the counterfeit-document Haitians the \nopportunity to submit their case and attempt to persuade the INS to \njustify granting some legal status in the United States.\n  They have 10,000--what are referred to as the ``airport Haitians''--\nimmigrants with all of the characteristics that the Senator talked \nabout before. They have lived here a long time. Many of them have \nestablished families. Either they have U.S. citizen children or they \nhave become positive members of a community. They have all of the bases \nto be seriously considered for legal status, but they are being denied \neven the opportunity to apply because of this peculiarly perverse \nunfairness in our immigration law, which this legislation--if we had a \nchance to take it up, debate it, and vote on it--has the chance to \nrectify.\n  I appreciate my good friend, Senator Reid, giving me this opportunity \nto ask him the question.\n  Does the Senator think we ought to seize this moment and correct the \nunfairness that Senator Reed has pointed out with the Liberians--I \nsuggest an equal number of Haitians--in this Nation?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Florida has been such a leader on \nimmigration issues generally but more specifically this issue dealing \nwith Haitians. The State of Florida has been greatly affected by \nHaitian immigrants. All we are saying is let these people have their \nstatus adjusted. If it doesn't work out, they will have to suffer \nwhatever consequences. But don't deny them basic due process.\n  My friend from Louisiana asked that I yield to her for a question. I \nwould be happy to do so without losing the right to the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the Senator takes advantage of that \ntime, I would like to make an inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to the majority leader without \nlosing my right to the floor, which I lose in 5 minutes anyway.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is what I was going to inquire about. I believe we are \nscheduled to take a break in 5 minutes, at 12:30, for the respective \nparty policy luncheons. I had hoped to be able to make some comments \nand respond to some of the things that were said. I know that Senator \nHatch hoped to do that, too. In order to do that, if he is not going to \nhave time yielded, I guess the only alternative would be for me to \nyield leader time and ask unanimous consent that we extend the time for \n5 minutes beyond 12:30. Is that correct, Mr. President?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask a question of my good friend from \nNevada. The Senator from Florida has raised some interesting questions \nabout a particular group of people whom we, under our amendment, would \nseek to not give automatic citizenship to but the opportunity to apply. \nThe Senator from Rhode Island has spoken eloquently about a fairly \nlarge group of applicants who are just seeking an opportunity to apply.\n  Does the Senator know that there is a very large group of people from \nHonduras that are living in the New Orleans area of Louisiana with \nfamilies that will really be disrupted and separated if we don't \nprovide some kind of response?\n  I wish the Senator could perhaps shed some light on how difficult it \nis going to be for me to have to go back to Louisiana and explain to my \nbusiness leaders that I am trying to help them get visas for people to \nbuild the ships we need, to build powerplants to fuel this economy, and \nto bring people into this Nation, but yet I am not able to get our \nSenate to help us keep people who are already there employed and \nworking in shipbuilding, running our hotels, and our hospitals.\n  The leader has done such a good job. I just wanted to come to the \nfloor to say it is going to be very difficult for me to go back and \nsay: While we gave you some help with visas for people to be brought in \nto help, we are taking people away from you who are already employed, \nand we weren't able to correct that.\n  Could the Senator shed some light for people who are following this \ndebate on how it doesn't seem to make sense that on the one hand we are \ngiving new visas to people to come into our country, and yet we are \ntelling employers who are desperate for workers, particularly in my \nState of Louisiana in the New Orleans area, that we are going to \nactually take good workers away from them and ship them back to either \nHonduras or Guatemala or El Salvador?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Louisiana is absolutely \nright. We know there was a promise made to Honduran immigrants in this \ncountry that their status would be adjusted the same as the Cubans and \nthe Nicaraguans were adjusted. I was happy to recognize that the Cubans \nand Nicaraguans who are here deserve that. But for the Hondurans, this \ncountry has not lived up to the promise made to these people.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. That is why we have company after \ncompany and organization after organization supporting this \nlegislation. Senator Durbin has worked very hard on it, and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana has worked with him.\n  As has already been pointed out, supporters of the legislation \ninclude the Americans for Tax Reform, Empower American, AFL-CIO, Union \nof Needletrades and Industrial Textile Employees, Service Employees \nInternational Union, National Council of La Raza, League of United \nLatin American Citizens, Anti-Defamation League, Hadassah, The Women's \nZionist Organization, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Lutheran \nImmigration and Refugee Services, Jesuit Conference, American Bar \nAssociation, American Immigration Lawyers Association, Center for Equal \nOpportunity Club for Growth, Resort Recreation and Tourism Management, \nand the National School Transportation Association.\n  All we are saying is that these organizations are well-meaning. Why? \nBecause their livelihoods depend on having people to do the work.\n  All we want to do is satisfy basic fairness. I think the way that we \ncould have basic fairness is if the majority would allow us the right \nto vote on amendment No. 4184. It is as simple as that. I know my time \nis up.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I couldn't agree with the Senator more. I thank the \nSenator for yielding for that question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself a minute of leader time and \nallot the remainder of the time to Senator Hatch to comment on where we \nare and some of the things that have been said.\n  I know there is a lot of clarification and correcting that the Record \nneeds.\n  With regard particularly to workers in shipbuilding, I believe we \nhave plenty of people in my State of Mississippi who would be perfectly \nhappy to fill any job that might be available in the shipyards in my \nState.\n  It is very clear what has happened. For weeks, for months, this bill \nhas been delayed, stalled, by all kinds of demands for unrelated \namendments, amendments of all kinds. That resistance still continues.\n  The high-tech industry indicates this is vital to them--big and \nsmall--this has to be done, and there is bipartisan support.\n  The time is here. We are going to see very clearly whether we want to \nextend these immigrants visas or not. All the delays to change the \nsubject, deflect it, to demand votes on other things which could tangle \nup and cause problems for this bill will not work. We will file \ncloture. We are going to have successful cloture and we will either get \nthis bill done or not.\n  Everybody needs to understand here and outside this Chamber that it \nis time we get to the issue at hand, that we have a vote, get this work \ndone, and move on.\n  The Senators are entitled to make their case for other amendments. I \nthought we recognized last Friday in our exchange that there are other \nbills, there will be other venues where these amendments could possibly \nbe considered, if that is the will of the House and the Senate and the \nCongress.\n  The point is, do we want to pass it or not? Time is running out. It \nis time to make that decision. We will have a clear vote on it before \nthis week is out.\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard my friends on the other side \ntalk about how important this is. Why didn't they file the bill before \nJuly 25 of this year if it is so darned important, if politics isn't \nbeing played here.\n  Secondly, why did they all vote for this? Forty-three Democrats voted \nfor cloture. If they wanted this amendment, why did they vote for \ncloture? They understand the rule that, by gosh, we vote for cloture, \nend debate, so we can pass the bill.\n  The high-tech industry needs this bill, but it will be brought down \nif we can't get it passed. The Latino fairness bill has not even had 1 \nday of hearings. Yet they want to grant amnesty to illegal aliens of at \nleast a half million, and some think up to 2 million people, without 1 \nday of hearings. Where are the amendments to increase the number of \nlegal immigrants?\n  In 1996, we had a major debate on immigration and there was a serious \neffort to restrict the numbers of legal immigrants. I fought the fight \nto preserve the number of legal immigrants. That is Latino fairness. \nWhat my colleagues are advocating is a major amnesty program for \nillegal immigrants, without 1 day of hearing.\n  Let's just understand the 1982, 1986 situation. The fact is the bill \nbefore us, while termed ``Latino fairness,'' does nothing to increase \nor preserve the categories of illegal immigrants allowed in this \ncountry annually. If you listen to their arguments, why don't we just \nforget all our immigration laws and let everybody come in? There is an \nargument for everybody.\n  We all know what is going on: This is a doggone political game, \nstopping a very important bill that 94 people basically voted for today \nin voting to invoke cloture.\n  Their idea does nothing to shorten the long waiting period or the \nhurdles of persons waiting years to come to this country, playing by \nthe rules to wait their turn. What we hear is an urgent call to grant \nbroad amnesty to what could be more than a million to two million \nillegal aliens. Now, let's be clear about what is at issue here. Some \nrefer to the fact that a certain class of persons that may have been \nentitled to amnesty in 1986, have been unfairly treated and should \ntherefore be granted amnesty now. That is one issue, and I am certainly \nprepared to discuss--outside the context of S. 2045--what we might be \nable to do to help that class of persons. But that is not really what \nS. 2912 is about. Rather, this bill also covers that class plus \nhundreds of thousands, if not millions of illegal aliens who were never \neligible for amnesty under the 1986 Act because that Act only went back \nto 1982.\n\n  This is a difficult issue, Mr. President, and one with major policy \nimplications for the future. When we supported amnesty in 1986, it was \nnot with the assumption that this was going to be a continuous process. \nWhat kind of signal does this send? On the one hand, our government \nspends millions each year to combat illegal immigration and deports \nthousands of persons each year who are here illegally. But--But if an \nillegal alien can manage to escape law enforcement for long enough, we \nreward that person with citizenship, or at least permanent resident \nstatus.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues are aware of the \ncost of this bill to American taxpayers. Specifically, a draft and \npreliminary CBO estimate indicates this bill comes with a price tag \njust short of $1.4 billion over 10 years.\n  The bottom line is that the Senate is not and should not be prepared \nto consider this bill at this time. It raises far-reaching questions \nconcerning immigration policy, whose consequences have never been \naddressed by proponents.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my final few minutes is time that has been \ngiven to me by the leader and that time that I claim for myself to deal \nwith the pending legislation, the postcloture debate.\n  My friend from Utah indicated he was wondering why we didn't file our \nlegislation prior to May of this year. I say to my friend from Utah, as \nhe knows, we have been working on this legislation for more than 2 \nyears, following the 1996 legislation, which has caused much of the \ncontroversy and consternation to immigrants. That is the reason this \nlegislation is coming forward--one of the main reasons. Furthermore, \none of the main components of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act \nwould update the date of registry. I introduced legislation in August \nof 1999--last year--and updated legislation in April of this year, to \nchange the date of registry. So, I respect this isn't something we just \nstarted working on. We have been fighting for these provisions for \nyears.\n  We have talked about this. In fact, in May of this year, I wrote a \nletter to the majority leader urging him to move expeditiously to allow \nus time on the floor to consider the H-1B legislation. There have been \nno surprises. There has been adequate time for all the committees of \njurisdiction to hear this legislation at great length. There have \ncertainly been no surprises.\n  I repeat what was said earlier in this debate. The Democrats, by \nvirtue of this record, support H-1B. We voted for cloture. We believe \nthis legislation should move forward. But in the process of it moving \nforward, we think in fairness that the legislation about which we \nspeak; namely, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000, should \nmove forward also.\n  I repeat, if my friends on the other side of the aisle do not like \nthe legislation, then they should vote against it. We are not trying to \ntake up the valuable time of this Senate. But what we are doing is \nsaying we want to move forward on this legislation, and we are not \ngoing to budge from this Congress until this legislation is passed.\n  We have a record that substantiates the statement I just made. No. 1, \nwe moved Friday, we moved today, to proceed on this legislation. We \nhave been denied that opportunity.\n  No. 2, we have letters signed by more than 40 Senators and we have \nmore than 150 House Members who have signed a letter to the President, \nsaying if he vetoes this legislation, we will certainly support his \nveto. Your veto will be based on the fact that the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act of 2000 is not included in something coming out of this \nCongress.\n  What we are looking to, and the vehicle that should go forward, is \nthe Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. But if there is some \nother area, we will also support the President's veto on that.\n  This legislation, among other things, seeks to provide permanent and \nlegally defined groups of immigrants who are already here, already \nworking, already contributing to the tax base and social fabric of our \ncountry, with a way to gain U.S. citizenship. They are people who are \nalready here. They are working or have been working. The only reason \nthey are now not working is because the Immigration and Naturalization \nService slipped into the 1996 bill that these people, like the people \nin Nevada, are not entitled to due process. Some of my constituents in \nNevada have not had the ability to have their work permits renewed. \nThey have been rejected. Some have been taken away from them. People \nlost their homes, their cars, their jobs. I am sorry to say in some \ninstances it has even caused divorce. It has caused domestic abuse, \ndomestic violence. People who have been gainfully employed suddenly \nfind themselves without a job. . .their families torn apart.\n  We want a vote, an up-or-down vote. As I have said, we don't want a \nlot of time. We will take 10 minutes, 5 minutes for the majority, 5 \nminutes by the minority: Vote on this bill. We will take it as it is \nwritten.\n  I think anything less than an up-or-down vote on this shows the \nmajority, who in effect run this Senate, are unwilling to take what we \ndo not believe is a hard vote. From their perspective, I guess it is a \nhard vote because they do not want to be on record voting against basic \nfairness for people who are here. Although we are willing to vote to \nbring 200,000 people to this country--we support that, too--we think in \naddition to the people who are coming here for high-tech jobs, the \npeople who have skilled and semi-skilled jobs, who are badly needed in \nthis country, also need the basic fairness that this legislation \nprovides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9229-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9229-S9230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to speak to \nmy colleagues in this body as well as to our colleagues in the other \nbody regarding the subject on which the Senate has spent a considerable \namount of time; that is, pipeline safety, legislation which passed the \nSenate by a unanimous vote, with Republicans and Democrats supporting a \nunanimous consent request to pass this legislation without any dissent \nand without any arguments against it whatsoever.\n  On September 9, that bill passed the Senate and is now pending over \nin the other body where our House colleagues are taking a look at this \nlegislation, trying to figure out what course they should take.\n  This legislation passed this body by unanimous consent because of the \ngood work for over a year by colleagues in both parties. I particularly \ncommend and thank the chairman, who I understand is coming over from \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, for his good work and for \nworking with me as a member of the committee but also taking the rather \nunusual step of inviting other interested Senators to actually \nparticipate in the markup in the Commerce Committee.\n  I credit Senator McCain for making it possible for Senator Murray of \nWashington to come over and actually sit in on the hearings, which is \nunusual for a Member, to take the time not only to attend to her duties \nin her own committee but to take time to listen to witnesses in another \ncommittee, which she did sitting at the podium with those of us on the \nCommerce Committee and also participating in asking questions.\n  It was a good combination between what Senator McCain allowed, which \nwas a little unusual, and what Senator Murray was able to participate \nin because of her strong interest and because of what has happened in \nher State with the recent tragic accident involving a pipeline which \nexploded, resulting in the tragic death of individuals from her State.\n  The result of those hearings was a compromise piece of legislation, \nwhich is a 100-percent improvement over the current situation with \nregard to how we look at the issue of pipeline safety. This is an issue \nthat is extremely important to my State. We have over 40,000 miles of \nburied natural gas pipelines in the State of Louisiana.\n  If you look at a map of our State, it shows all of the buried \npipelines. It looks like a map of spaghetti in an Italian restaurant \nbecause we have pipelines all over our State transporting the largest \namount of natural gas coming from the offshore Gulf of Mexico as well \nas onshore pipelines that distribute gas not just to the constituents \nof my State but to constituents throughout the United States who depend \nupon Louisiana for a dependable source of natural gas. Pipelines in \nLouisiana are important not just to Louisianians but also to people \nfrom throughout this Nation.\n  The bill we have is one that requires periodic pipeline testing. It \nsays if we can do it from an internal inspection, we will do it that \nway. If that is not possible, we have to do it with what we call a \n``direct assessment'' of the lines, which actually means companies \nwould have to dig them up and physically inspect the lines.\n  We require enhanced operator qualifications to make sure the people \nwho are doing the work are trained and have a background in this \nparticular area. We call for investments in technology to look at \nbetter ways of doing what is necessary to ensure their safety.\n  States would be given an increased role. But I have to say that the \nprimary role would be the Federal Government's because these are \ninterstate pipelines we are talking about under the pipeline safety \narea.\n  Communities would also be given increased involvement. I think it is \nimportant to let them know where the\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\nlines are and that they are being inspected and also to hear their \nsuggestions. They don't regulate the pipeline safety requirements, but \nthey should be involved by being heard.\n  I think to the credit of everybody, particularly Senator Murray, this \ntype of feature involving local community involvement is 100 percent \nbetter than it used to be because in the past there was very little \ninvolvement whatsoever.\n  The problem we take to the floor today to talk about is time. This is \nnot rocket science. We don't have a lot of time to complete this bill. \nWe hope our colleagues in the House who use this Senate vehicle will \nbring it to the floor in the other body and handle it in an expeditious \nfashion.\n  I repeat, this bill passed the Senate by a unanimous vote. It should \nnot be controversial. It should be something that our friends and \ncolleagues in the other body, Republican or Democrat, would be able to \nsay we worked together with our Senate colleagues in an equal fashion \nand came to an agreement that this is good legislation.\n  It increases the safety of pipelines that are buried throughout the \nUnited States to help assure that we will not have some of the tragic \nevents we have had in the past. The companies we have dealt with in my \nState support this measure. They want some improvements. They have been \nvery helpful in making suggestions, as well as individuals and groups \nof concerned citizens who have made recommendations. We have taken all \nof them into consideration. We have a good piece of legislation that we \nhope our colleagues will be able to take up. Let's get it signed. If we \nlet some of the details guide the actions in the other body, \nunfortunately, we may end up with nothing instead of a good bill.\n  I think we should recommend this to our colleagues and do so today.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Louisiana for his efforts in \nmaking sure we pass a bill that will improve the safety of family and \nchildren who work or play near pipelines in this country. He is right; \nthe House has an obligation now to take up the bill that we have passed \nin the Senate and move it forward. I thank him and I agree with his \ncomments.\n  We have been joined by the chair of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nMcCain, who has done a tremendous job in moving this legislation \nforward. I personally thank him, as well.\n  It has been 16 months since a pipeline exploded in Bellingham, \nWashington and killed 3 young people. Back then, few Americans knew \nabout the dangers of our Nation's aging pipelines. But in the past \nyear--especially after the explosion in New Mexico last month--it \nbecame clear that this Congress had to do more to protect the public.\n  As my colleagues know, it is difficult to reform any major industry \nin just one year. But it was clear that we couldn't wait any longer to \nmake pipelines safer. We in the Senate had a responsibility to protect \nthe public, and I am pleased that the bill we passed earlier this month \nwill go a long way to making pipelines safer. It is a dramatic \nimprovement over the status quo.\n  That's why I've been so dismayed by what has happened in the House in \nrecent weeks. The House of Representatives has not passed--or even \nmarked up--any pipeline bill, but some Members have already called our \nbill inadequate. They also claim that they can pass a better bill this \nyear--with just a few scheduled legislative days left in this Congress. \nI don't see it happening.\n  I have worked on this issue for over a year and that's why I want to \naddress those claims--because they are based on three incorrect \nassumptions. The first fallacy is that the Senate bill will not improve \nsafety. We worked long and hard over many months to pass a strong bill. \nAnd this bill will improve safety.\n  Let's look at some of the provisions.\n  Expanding the public's right to know about pipeline hazards;\n  Requiring pipeline operators to test their pipelines;\n  Requiring pipeline operators to certify their personnel;\n  Requiring smaller spills to be reported;\n  Raising the penalties for safety violators;\n  Investing in new technology to improve pipeline safety;\n  Protecting whistle blowers;\n  Increasing state oversight; and\n  Increasing funding for safety efforts.\n  These are clear improvements over the status quo and they will make \npipelines safer. This is not a perfect bill, but we should not make the \nperfect the enemy of the good. Let's take the steps we can now to \nimprove pipeline safety.\n  Some also suggest that the Senate bill relies on the Office of \nPipeline Safety too much. Now it is clear that OPS has not done its job \nin the past. That is why this bill requires OPS to carry out \ncongressional mandates. And we in Congress have a responsibility to \nhold OPS accountable for doing its job. I intend to remain vigilant in \nthis area.\n  Our bill includes more resources for the agency. And today public \nscrutiny on the agency--especially after a report by the General \nAccounting Office and a report I requested from DOT's inspector \ngeneral--have put the agency under a microscope. I am confident that \nOPS today has a renewed commitment to safety. And I am pleased our bill \nincludes the right amount of new resources and tools to make pipelines \nsafer.\n  Let me turn to another assumption that has been made by some.\n  They suggest this bill could be amended significantly this year. \nThat's a long process even under normal circumstances. And this year \nthere are only a few days left. I don't see how it could happen this \nyear.\n  So some critics say--we'll start again next year--we'll do better \nnext year. That means it will be at least a year--maybe longer before \nthe issue is even brought up again.\n  And how can we have so much faith that we'll get anything stronger--\nor anything at all--under a new Congress and a new President?\n  Let me ask a simple question:\n  Would you take that bet if your family's safety depended on it? I \nwouldn't. And I don't think we can shirk our responsibility to protect \nthe public this year.\n  Before I finish, I do want to say something about those who have \nraised concerns about the Senate bill. They are good people with good \nmotives.\n  In some cases, they have paid too high a price. They want safer \npipelines. That is exactly what I want. Unfortunately, here in \nCongress--their position ends up ``making the perfect the enemy of the \ngood.'' And that means no reform at all.\n  Looking for some ``better bill'' really means no bill at all this \nyear. Rejecting the Senate bill really means accepting the inadequate, \nunsafe status quo for at least another year. I don't want another \nAmerican family to look at this Congress and say, ``why did you drop \nthe ball when you were so much closer to improving safety?''\n  Passing the Senate bill means we will finally get on the road to \nmaking pipelines safer. Once we're on that road we can always make \ncourse corrections. But we've got to get on that road to start with and \nthat's why I urge my colleagues in the House to pass the Senate bill \nimmediately.\n  We've got a strong bill. Let's put it into law.\n  Let me make it clear: It is critical that the House take up this bill \nthis year. Senator McCain has done an outstanding job. We owe the \npeople in my State, New Mexico, and other States that have had \naccidents, to do the right thing this year. I encourage this Congress \nto act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before she leaves the floor, I thank \nSenator Murray. Without her unrelenting efforts and that of her \ncolleague, Senator Gorton, I know we would not have passed the \nlegislation through the Senate, and I know it would not have been as \ncomprehensive nor as carefully done. I thank the Senator from \nWashington for her outstanding work, including that on behalf of the \nfamilies who suffered in this terrible tragedy in her home State. I \ncome to the floor today to once again bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues the urgency of passing and sending to the President pipeline \nsafety improvement legislation. While the Senate acted two weeks ago \nand passed S. 2438, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, the \nHouse has yet to take action on pipeline safety legislation. Despite \nthe efforts of Mr. Franks, chairman of the\n\n[[Page S9232]]\n\nHouse Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, Hazardous \nMaterials and Pipeline Transportation, who has introduced pipeline \nsafety legislation that is almost identical to S. 2438, the full House \nhas not advanced a pipeline safety bill. Time is running out.\n\n  I thank our colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, for his active \nparticipation. His knowledge and expertise on this issue has been \nessential.\n  Mr. President, each day that passes without enactment of \ncomprehensive pipeline safety legislation like that approved \nunanimously by the Senate places public safety at risk. As my \ncolleagues may recall, just prior to Senate passage of the Pipeline \nSafety Improvement Act, a 12-inch propane pipeline exploded in Abilene \nTexas, after being ruptured by a bulldozer. That accident resulted in \nthe fatality of a police officer. Sadly, that accident brings the total \nlives that have been lost in recent accidents to 16.\n  In Abilene, the victim was a 42-year-old police detective who just \nhappened to pass by in his car as the propane exploded across State \nHighway 36. Just last month, 12 individuals lost their lives near \nCarlsbad, New Mexico, after the rupture of a natural gas transmission \nline. And we cannot forget about last year's tragic accident in \nBellingham, Washington, that claimed the lives of three young men.\n  I repeat what I said two weeks ago during the Senate's consideration \nof the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act: we simply must act now to \nremedy identified safety problems and improve pipeline safety. To do \nless is a risk to public safety and will perhaps result in even more \nneedless deaths.\n  It is my hope that I will not have to come to this floor again to \nimplore our colleagues in the House to take action. It is not typical \nfor me to urge the other body to take up a Senate bill without \nmodification, but time is running out.\n\n  I also point out the strong support of our legislation by the \nadministration.\n  I will quote from Secretary Slater's press release issued after \nSenate passage of S. 2438:\n\n       I commend the U.S. Senate for taking swift and decisive \n     action in passing the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of \n     2000. This legislation is critical to make much-needed \n     improvements to the pipeline safety program. It provides for \n     stronger enforcement, mandatory testing of all pipelines, \n     community right-to-know information, and additional \n     resources.\n\n  I further want to point out my disappointment that some in the other \nbody are willing to put safety at risk for what appears to be pure \npolitical gain.\n  I am aware of a series of ``Dear Colleagues'' transmitted by some in \nthe House harshly criticizing the Senate bill. This same bill, \nunanimously approved by the Senate, is strongly supported by Secretary \nSlater for being a strong bill to advance safety. Therefore, I find the \ncriticism by a handful of House Members quite revealing when one of \nthose harshest critics only last year voted in support of moving a \nclean 2-year reauthorization of the Pipeline Safety Act out of the \nHouse Commerce Committee and the other critic has not taken any action \nthat I have seen to advance pipeline safety during this session. They \njust don't want a bill because they are betting on being in charge next \nyear. That is the kind of leadership the American people would reject.\n  I do not consider enacting S. 2438 to be the end of our work in this \narea. Indeed, I commit to our colleagues to continue our efforts to \nadvance pipeline safety during the next Congress.\n  I am willing for the committee to continue to hold hearings on \npipeline safety and will work to advance additional proposals that my \ncolleagues submit to promote it. But little more can be done in the \ntime remaining in the session. I don't see how it could be possible to \nmove any other pipeline safety bill prior to adjournment. Therefore, it \nis urgent for the House to act now.\n  The time is long overdue for Congress and the President to take \naction to strengthen and improve pipeline safety. We simply cannot risk \nthe loss of any more lives by lack of needed attention on our part. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues in the House to join ranks and support \npassage of pipeline safety reform legislation immediately so we can \nsend the bill on to the President for his signature. Lives are at risk \nif we don't act now.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, may I ask how much time I am allotted \nunder the unanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is provided up to 20 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9232-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9232-S9234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to address the Energy bill which \nhas been introduced by Senator Lott. We have had a good deal of \ndiscussion about this country's continuing dependence on imported \npetroleum products, particularly crude oil, to the point that currently \nwe are about 58-percent dependent.\n  As a consequence of the concern over the lack of adequate heating oil \nsupplies, particularly in the eastern seaboard, the President, on the \nrecommendation of the Vice President, made a determination to release \nabout 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is \na significant event.\n  I question the legality of that action. I question the meaning or \nsignificance of that action, but we can get into that a little later in \nmy comments. I am also going to touch on our realization of the high \nprice of natural gas, following our recognition of our dependence on \nimported oil.\n  Oftentimes, we do not see ourselves as others see us. I am going to \nread a paragraph from the New York Times article of September 26 called \n``Candidate In The Balance.'' It is by Thomas L. Friedman.\n  I quote:\n\n       Tokyo. It's interesting watching the American oil crisis/\n     debate from here in Tokyo. The Japanese are cool as cucumbers \n     today--no oil protests, no gas lines, no politicians making \n     crazy promises. That's because Japan has been preparing for \n     this day since the 1973 oil crisis by steadily introducing \n     natural gas, nuclear power, high-speed mass transit and \n     conservation, and thereby steadily reducing its dependence on \n     foreign oil. And unlike the U.S., the Japanese never wavered \n     from that goal by falling off the wagon and becoming addicted \n     to S.U.V.'s--those they just make for the Americans.\n\n  I think there is a lot of truth to that. As we reflect on where we \nare today, I think we have had an acknowledgement at certain levels \nwithin the administration that they have been ``asleep at the wheel'' \nrelative to our increasing dependence on imported oil.\n  This did not occur overnight. This has been coming on for some time. \nWe can cite specifics over the last 7 or 8 years, and in every section, \nU.S. demand is outpacing U.S. supply.\n  We saw crude oil prices last week at a 10-year high--$37 a barrel--\ntwice what they were at this time last year.\n  It is rather interesting to note the Vice President's comments the \nother day that the high price of oil was due to profiteering by big \noil. That is certainly a convenient political twist, isn't it--\nprofiteering by big oil. There was no mention that last year big oil \nwas very generously making crude oil available at $10 a barrel. You \nthink they did that out of generosity? Who sets the price of oil? Does \nExxon? British Petroleum? Phillips?\n  Big oil isn't the culprit; it is our dependence on the supplier. Who \nis the supplier? The supplier is OPEC, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico. \nThey have it for sale. We are 58-percent dependent, so they set the \nprice.\n  With crude oil at a 10-year high, gasoline prices are once again \nabove $1.57, $1.59, in some areas $2 a gallon.\n  Natural gas--here is the culprit, here is what is coming, here is the \ntrain wreck--$5.25 to $5.30 for deliveries in the Midwest next month. \nWhat was it 9 months ago? It was $2.16. Think of that difference.\n  Utilities inventories are 15-percent below last winter's level. How \nmany homes in America are dependent on natural gas for heating? The \nanswer is 50 percent, a little over 50 percent; that is, 56 million \nhomes are dependent on natural gas in this country. How many on fuel \noil? Roughly 11 million.\n  What about our electric power generation? Fifteen percent of it \ncurrently comes from natural gas. What is the increasing demand for \nnatural gas? We\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\nare consuming 22 trillion cubic feet now. The projections are better \nthan 30 trillion cubic feet by the year 2010.\n  The administration conveniently touts natural gas as its clean fuel \nfor the future, but it will not allow us to go into the areas where we \ncan produce more.\n  I remind my colleagues, I remind the Secretary of Energy, and I \nremind the Vice President and the President, there is no Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve for natural gas. You can't go out and bail this one \nout, Mr. President. The administration has placed Federal lands off \nlimits to new natural gas exploration and production.\n  More than 50 percent of the overthrust belt--the Rocky Mountain area, \nMontana, Wyoming, Colorado--has been put off limits for exploration. We \nhave a Forest Service roadless policy locking up an additional 40 \nmillion acres; a moratorium on OCS drilling until the year 2012. The \nVice President said he would even consider canceling existing leases.\n  You have a situation with increased demand and no new supply. What \ndoes this add up to? Higher energy prices for consumers this winter--a \ntrain wreck. This is going to happen. Yet the administration sits idly \nby and hopes the election can take place before the voters read their \nfuel bills.\n  So there we are. We now have situations in California, in San Diego, \nof electricity price spikes. We have possible brownouts. The reason is, \nthere is no new generation. You can't get permits for coal-fired \nplants.\n  It takes so long to get new generation on line.\n  Heating and fuel oil inventories, as I have indicated, are at the \nlowest level in decades, leaving us unprepared for winter. It is a lack \nof overall energy policy.\n  As to nuclear energy, 20 percent of the total power generated in this \ncountry comes from it. We can't address what to do about the waste. \nThis body stands one vote short of a veto override to proceed with the \ncommitments that we made to take that waste from the industry, waste \nthat the consumers have been paying for the Federal Government to take \nfor the last two decades.\n  Consumers have paid about $11 billion into that fund. The Federal \nGovernment was supposed to take the waste in 1998. It is in breach of \nits contract. The court has ruled that the industry can recover, and \nthey can bypass anything but the Court of Claims. That is how far that \nhas gone.\n  Let's look at crude oil and SPR.\n  With crude oil prices on the rise again, the administration has had \nto go back to OPEC time and time again to ask for more foreign oil. The \nassumption is, if they ask for 800,000 barrels, we get 800,000 barrels. \nWe get 17 percent of that. That is about 130,000 barrels. That is our \nportion. Everybody gets some of OPEC's increased production.\n  Foreign imports into this country in June were 58 percent. Compare \nthat with 36 percent during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. Recall the \ngasoline lines around the block at that time. The public was outraged. \nThey blamed everybody, including Government. Sounds familiar, doesn't \nit?\n  Ask Tony Blair from Great Britain how he feels about the protests in \nEngland and everywhere else in Europe. It is threatening some \ngovernments.\n  To ensure we have a supply to fall back on, in 1973, 1974, 1975, we \ncreated the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or SPR. That was our response \nto the Arab oil embargo. We have about 571 million barrels of storage \nin SPR. SPR was set up to respond to a severe supply interruption, not \nto manipulate consumer price for a political effect.\n  We can only draw down about 4.1 million barrels per day from SPR. \nRemember something a lot of Americans, a lot of people in the media, do \nnot understand: The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not full of heating \noil or gasoline or kerosene. It is full of crude oil. The crude oil has \nto be transported to a refinery. Our refineries are running at 96 \npercent of capacity.\n  The Vice President wants to release 30 million barrels from SPR to \n``lower prices'' for consumers. I question the legality of that at this \ntime because a drawdown can only occur if the President has found that \na severe energy supply interruption has occurred. The Secretary \nreleased oil without any such finding. His excuse is that this is not a \ndrawdown; it is a swap or an exchange.\n  This is the largest release of oil from SPR in its 25-year history, \nlarger than during the gulf war.\n  Secretary Richardson stated today that the 30 million barrels of \ncrude released from SPR may produce 3 to 5 million barrels of new \nheating oil. The U.S. uses 1 million barrels of heating oil per day.\n  So the obvious increase is 3, 4, 5 days' supply. That is not very \nmuch, is it? The Secretary's action regarding SPR may have an impact on \nprice but may not have a significant impact on the supply of heating \noil. That is just the harsh reality.\n  What about others? Well, Secretary of the Treasury Summers has \nindicated it is bad policy. He felt so strongly, he wrote a letter to \nAlan Greenspan. We have a copy of the memorandum that went from Mr. \nSummers, Secretary of the Treasury, to Alan Greenspan. I will refer to \nit in a moment.\n  Releasing SPR now weakens our ability to respond later to real supply \nemergencies. That is obvious to everyone. But I do want to enter into \nthe Record this letter, a memorandum of September 13 from Lawrence H. \nSummers, Secretary of the Treasury, to the President. The memorandum is \nentitled ``Strategic Petroleum Reserve.'' Page 2, top paragraph:\n\n       Using the SPR at this time would be seen as a radical \n     departure from past practice and an attempt to manipulate \n     prices. The SPR was created to respond to supply disruptions \n     and has never been used simply to respond to high prices or a \n     tight market.\n\n  I don't think there is any question about the intent of that \nstatement. It is bad policy. Alan Greenspan has indicated an agreement, \nor at least that is the impression we get.\n  The action that I indicated was illegal is illegal because it \nrequires a Presidential finding. It is contrary to the intent of the \nauthority for the transfer. And besides, we have not reauthorized the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. It is held up in this body by a Senator on \nthe other side who is objecting to the reauthorization of EPCA, which \ncontains the reauthorization for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nReleasing SPR oil now, as I indicated, weakens our ability to respond \nlater to real supply emergencies.\n  Where were we 7 years ago with regard to SPR? We had an 86-day day \nsupply of crude oil in SPR. Today, we have a 50-day supply. The \nadministration has previously sold almost 28 million barrels. They sold \nit at a loss of $420 million, the theory being you buy high and you \nsell low. I guess the taxpayers foot the bill by making it up with the \nincreased activity. I don't know what their logic has been, but that is \nthe history.\n  Earlier this year, the Vice President stated: Opening SPR would be a \ncompromise on our national energy security. He made that statement. \nObviously, he has seen fit to change his mind. Everybody can change \ntheir minds, but nevertheless I think it represents an inconsistency. \nWhat we need is a real solution, reducing our reliance on foreign oil \nby increasing domestic production and using alternative fuels, \nincentives, conservation, weatherization. I could talk more on that \nlater.\n  Also, it is interesting to note that the Vice President indicated his \nfamiliarization with SPR, that he was instrumental in the setting up of \nit. As we have noted, he was not in the Senate under the Ford \nadministration when it was established. That is kind of interesting \nbecause it suggests that he is happy to get aboard on the issue and, \nagain, may have had a significant role, but it is pretty hard to find \nthe record showing him having an active role.\n  Another point is our increased dependence on Saddam Hussein and the \nthreat to our national security in the sense that we are now importing \nabout 750,000 barrels of oil from Iraq a day. Just before this \nadministration, we carried out Desert Storm, in 1991-1992. We had 147 \nAmericans killed, 460 wounded, 23 taken prisoner. We continued to \nenforce, and continue today to enforce, a no-fly zone; that is, an \naerial blockade. We have had flown over 200,000 sorties since the end \nof Desert Storm. It is estimated to cost the American taxpayer about \n$50 million. Yet this administration appears to become more reliant on \nIraqi oil.\n\n  What we have is a supply and demand issue. Domestic production has \ndeclined 17 percent; domestic demand has\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\ngone up 14 percent. Iraq is the fastest growing source of U.S. foreign \noil--as I said, 750,000 barrels a day, nearly 30 percent of all Iraq's \nexports. We have been unable to proceed with our U.N. inspections in \nIraq. There is illegal oil trading underway with other Arab nations; we \nknow about it. Profits go to development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, training of the Republican Guard, developing missile \ndelivery capabilities, biological capabilities.\n  This guy is up to no good; there is absolutely no question about it. \nThe international community is critical of the sanctions towards Iraq. \nBut consider this: Saddam Hussein is known to put Iraqi civilians in \nharm's way when we retaliate with aerial raids. Saddam has used \nchemical weapons against his own people in his own territory. He could \nhave ended sanctions at any time--by turning over his weapons of mass \ndestruction for inspection; that is all. Yet he rebuilds his capacity \nto produce more. He cares more about these weapons than he apparently \ncares about his own people. That he is able to dictate our energy \nfuture is a tragedy of great proportion. Still, the administration \ndoesn't seem to get the pitch. Saddam gets more aggressive. His every \nspeech ends with ``death to Israel.'' If there is any threat to \nIsrael's security, it is Saddam Hussein.\n  He has a $14,000 bounty on each American plane shot down by his \ngunnery crews. He accuses Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil--here we go \nagain--the same activity before he invaded Kuwait in 1990. Saddam is \nwilling to use oil to gain further concessions. The U.N. granted Kuwait \n$15 billion in gulf war compensation. Iraq has retaliated and said it \nwill cut off exports. OPEC's spare capacity can't make up the \ndifference.\n  He has the leverage. We really haven't focused in on that. The U.N. \npostpones compensation hearings until after U.S. elections for fear of \nthe impact on the world market. He is dictating the terms and \nconditions. He says: You force me to pay Kuwait and I will reduce \nproduction. We can't stand that because that is the difference between \nroughly the world's capacity to produce oil and the world's demand for \nthat oil. And Saddam Hussein holds that difference.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed for another 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I will try this approach because I think it references our foreign \npolicy. If I get this right, we send him our dollars, he sells us the \noil, we put the oil in our airplanes and go bomb him. Have I got that \nright? We buy his oil, fill our planes, and go bomb him. What kind of a \nforeign policy is that? He has us over a barrel, and it is a barrel of \noil.\n  Another issue that is conveniently forgotten is refinery supply. \nSupply of crude oil is not the only issue. Even if we had more, we \ndon't currently have the capacity to refine it. That is what is wrong \nwith releasing oil from SPR. We don't have the ability for our \nrefineries to take more product currently. That is unfortunate, but it \nis a reality.\n  We had a hearing this morning. The industry said they are up to \nmaximum capacity with refinery utilization at 96 percent. We haven't \nbuilt a new refinery for nearly a quarter century. We have had 36 \nrefineries closed in this country in the last 10 years. This is due to \nEPA regulations.\n  We have the issue of reformulated gas. We have nine different \ngeographical reformulated gasolines in this country. The necessity of \nthat is the dictate from EPA. I am not going to go into that, but fuels \nmade for Oregon are not suitable for California; fuels made for \nMaryland can't be sold in Baltimore; Chicago fuels can't be sold in \nDetroit. We are making designer gasoline. The result: Refiners do not \nhave the flexibility to move supplies around the country or respond to \nthe shortages.\n  The administration's response? Well, it is pretty hard to identify. \nThey are trying to duck responsibility, hoping this issue will go away \nbefore the election takes place and the voters get their winter fuel \nbills. They are trying to keep this ``train wreck'' from occurring on \ntheir watch. They blame ``big oil'' for profiteering.\n  Think this thing through. Big oil profiteering: Where was big oil \nwhen they gave it away at $10 a barrel last year? Who sets the price? \nWell, it is OPEC, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico, because they \nhave the leverage; they have the supply. I think the American people \nare too smart to buy the issue of big oil profiteering. And the issue \nrelated to the industry is that during the time that we had $10 oil, we \nweren't drilling for any gas. We lost about 57,000 gas wells, and I \nthink 136,000 oil wells were taken out of production. Many were small.\n  So if we look at the areas where we get our energy, it is pretty hard \nto assume that there is any support in the area of domestic production \nand exploration because there is a reluctance to open up public land.\n  We have seen 17 percent less production since Clinton-Gore took \noffice. They oppose the use of plentiful American coal. EPA permits \nmake it uneconomic. We haven't had a new coal-fired plant in this \ncountry in the last several years. They force the nuclear industry to \nchoke on its own waste. Yet the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals now says \nthe utilities with nuclear plants can sue the Federal Government \nbecause it won't store the waste. That could cost the taxpayer $40 \nbillion to $80 billion. They threaten to tear down the hydroelectric \ndams and replace barge traffic on the river system by putting it on the \nhighways. That is a tradeoff? They ignore electric reliability and \nsupply concerns, price spikes in California, no new generation or \ntransmission. They claim to support increased use of natural gas while \nrestricting supply and preventing new exploration.\n  The Vice President indicated in a speech in Rye, NH, on October 21, \n1999, he would oppose further offshore leasing and would even look to \ncanceling some existing leases. Where are we headed? Downhill. It means \nhigher natural gas prices, higher oil prices, higher gasoline and fuel \noil prices, plus higher electricity prices. That equals, in my book, \ninflation.\n  We have been poking inflation in the ribs with higher energy prices, \ndriving all consumer prices higher. One-third of our balance of \npayments is the cost of imported oil. We are a high-tech society. We \nuse a lot of electricity for our activities--computer activities, e-\nmail, and everything else. All this boils down to the makings of a \npotential economic meltdown.\n  What we need is a national energy strategy which recognizes the need \nfor a balanced approach to meeting our energy needs. We need all of the \nexisting energy sources. We have the National Energy Security Act \nbefore us on this floor. We want to increase energy efficiency, \nmaximize utilization of alternative fuels/renewables, and increase \ndomestic oil supply and gas production. We want to reauthorize EPCA, \nreauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Our bill would increase \nour domestic energy supplies of coal, oil, and natural gas by allowing \nfrontier royalty relief, improving Federal oil/gas lease management, \nproviding tax incentives for production, and assuring price certainty \nfor small producers.\n  We want to allow new exploration. Twenty percent of the oil has come \nfrom my State of Alaska in the last two decades. We can open up the \nArctic Coastal Plain safely, and everybody knows it. The reason is that \nwe want to promote new clean coal technology, protect consumers against \nseasonal price spikes, and foster increased energy efficiency.\n  Regardless of how you say it, American consumers really need to \nunderstand that this train wreck is occurring and it is occurring now. \nWe have to develop a balanced and comprehensive energy strategy, one \nthat takes economic and environmental factors into account at the same \ntime, and one that provides the prospect of a cleaner, more secure \nenergy in the future.\n  We have this energy strategy. We have it proposed. It is on the floor \nof this body. This administration does not. They are just hoping the \ntrain wreck doesn't happen on their watch. The consequences of over 7 \nyears of failed Clinton-Gore energy policies are now being felt in the \npocketbooks of working American families. Mr. President, we deserve \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for up \nto 1 hour.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9235-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n                           THE ENERGY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would be remiss, following the remarks \nof the Senator from Alaska, if I didn't comment on the whole energy \nissue, which is one of great concern to families, individuals, and \nbusinesses across America.\n  I have listened carefully as critics of the Clinton-Gore \nadministration came out with statistics about the reason for our plight \ntoday. One that is often quoted, and was quoted again by the Senator \nfrom Alaska, is the fact that we have not built a new refinery in the \nUnited States for the last 24 years. I have heard this over and over \nagain. There are two things worth noting. If I am not mistaken, during \nthe last 24 years, in only 8 of those years have we had a Democratic \nadministration. So if there has been any laxity or lack of diligence on \nthe energy issue, I think that statement reflects on other \nadministrations as much as, if not more than, the current \nadministration.\n  Secondly, the people who make that statement hardly ever note that \nexisting refineries have been expanded dramatically across the United \nStates. That is the case in Illinois and in so many other States. I \nthink it is worth noting that to say we have ignored the increased \nenergy demands for our economy is not a complete statement. We have \nresponded to them. The question, obviously, is whether we have \nresponded enough.\n  There have also been statements made as to whether oil companies have \nbeen guilty of price gouging or profiteering. Those of us in the \nMidwest who, this spring, endured increases in gasoline prices of $1 a \ngallon, and more, in a very short period of time did not believe that \nmarket forces were at work. We believed what was at work was the forces \nof monopolies that virtually can dictate prices to American consumers. \nWe were not alone in our belief. The Federal Trade Commission, after \nlooking at the issue, could find no reasonable economic or market \nexplanation for this increase in gasoline prices in Chicago or \nMilwaukee.\n  The other side would blame the Environmental Protection Agency and \nvirtually everybody connected with the Clinton administration. Yet \nthere was no evidence to back up those claims. As a consequence, the \nFTC is investigating oil companies to determine whether or not they did \ntake advantage of consumers, businesses, and families across the \nMidwest. We believe it cost tens of millions of dollars to our local \neconomy, and I believe if any fine is ultimately imposed on the oil \ncompanies, it should go to benefit the businesses and families who were \nthe victims of these high gasoline prices by these oil companies.\n  The Senator from Alaska also made reference to the decision of this \nadministration within the last few days to release oil on a swap basis \nfrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It was a hot topic. Mr. Bush and \nMr. Gore were involved in this debate for a long period of time. The \nquestion, obviously, is whether or not it is going to have any impact \non our growing concern about the cost of fuel and energy, particularly \nthe cost of heating oil. Well, we might be able to speculate for a long \ntime, but we don't have to.\n  I call the attention of my colleagues in the Senate to this morning's \nWashington Post in the business section. The headline reads ``Price of \nCrude Oil Drops Below $32.'' Let me read from this article by Kenneth \nBredemeier of the Washington Post:\n\n       The price of oil fell to its lowest level in a month \n     yesterday in the wake of the Clinton administration's \n     announcement last week that it is releasing 30 million \n     barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help \n     ensure adequate supplies of home heating oil this winter.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       ``It was not unexpected,'' said John Lichtblau, chairman of \n     the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ``It reflects the \n     fact that inventories will be increased. This is not a sharp \n     decline, but it is headed in the right direction. They could \n     fall somewhat more.''\n       Lichtblau said that while very recently there had been \n     speculation about $40-a-gallon oil, ``now there's speculation \n     that it will drop to below $30. The assumption has changed \n     directionally.''\n\n  So those who would argue against Vice President Gore and President \nClinton's position on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, saying it won't \nhelp consumers and families and it won't help businesses, frankly, have \nbeen proven wrong by this morning's headline in the business section of \nthe Washington Post. This is not a campaign publication, this is a \nreport on the realities of the market. Of course, we can't stop with \nthat effort. We have to continue to look for ways to reduce the cost of \nenergy so that families and businesses can continue to profit in our \nstrong economy.\n  But I think the suggestion of the Senator from Alaska embodied in \nthis bill that we begin drilling for oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge in his State is the wrong thing to do.\n  I recently ran into the CEO of a major oil company in Chicago. I \nasked him about this. How important is ANWR to the future of petroleum \nsupplies in the United States? He said: From our company's point of \nview, it is a nonissue. There are plenty of sources of oil in the \nUnited States that are not environmentally dangerous situations. He \nbelieves--and I agree with it--that you do not have to turn to a \nwildlife refuge to start drilling oil in the arctic, nor do you have to \ndrill offshore and run the risk of spills that will contaminate beaches \nfor hundreds of miles. There are sources, he said, within the U.S. that \nare not environmentally sensitive that should be explored long before \nwe are pushed to the limit of finding sources in these environmentally \nsensitive areas.\n  But the Senator from Alaska and many of our colleagues are quick to \nwant to drill in these areas first. Their motive I can't say, but I \nwill tell you that I don't believe it is necessary from an energy \nviewpoint. There are plenty of places for us to turn. But drilling for \nnew oil energy sources is not the sole answer, nor should it be. We \nshould be exploring alternative fuel situations.\n  They come to the floor regularly on the other side of the aisle and \nmock the suggestion of Vice President Gore in his book ``Earth In The \nBalance'' that we look beyond the fossil-fueled engine that we use \ntoday in our automobiles, trucks, and buses and start looking to other \nsources of fuel that do not create environmental problems. They think \nthat is a pipedream; that it will never occur. Yet they ignore the \nreality that two Japanese car companies now have a car on the road that \nuses a combination of the gas-fired engine with electricity; with \nfossil-fueled engines, and those that do not rely only on fossil fuels \nto prove you can get high mileage without contaminating the atmosphere.\n  I am embarrassed to say again that the vehicles we are testing first \ncome from other countries. But they are proving it might work. We \nshould explore it. It seems an anathema to my friends on the other side \nof the aisle to consider other energy sources.\n  But if we can find, for example, a hydrogen-based fuel which does not \ncontaminate the atmosphere and gives us the prospect of providing the \nenergy needs of this country, why wouldn't we explore that? Why \nshouldn't we push for that research?\n  That is the point made by Vice President Gore. It is a forward \nvisionary thing that, frankly, many people in the boardrooms of oil \ncompanies might not like to consider. But I think we owe it to our kids \nand future generations to take a look at that.\n  To go drilling in wildlife refuges and off the shores of our Nation \nwith the possibility of contaminating beaches is hardly an alternative \nto sound research. I think we should look at that research and consider \nit as a real possibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9235-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9235-S9237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         H-1B VISA LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the reason for my rising today is to \naddress the issue that is pending before us, which is the H-1B visa \nbill. This is a bill which addresses the issue of immigration.\n  Immigration has been important to the United States. But for the \nAfrican Americans, many of whom were forced to come to the U.S. against \ntheir will in slavery, most of us, and our parents and grandparents \nbefore us, can trace our ancestry to immigrants who came to this \ncountry. I am one of those people.\n  In 1911, my grandmother got on a boat in Germany and came across the \nocean from Lithuania landing in Baltimore, MD, and taking a train to \nEast St. Louis, IL. She came to the United\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\nStates with three of her children. Not one of them spoke English. I am \namazed when I think about that--that she would get on that boat and \ncome over here not knowing what she was headed to, not being able to \nspeak the language, unaware of the culture, and taking that leap of \nfaith as millions have throughout the course of American history.\n  What brought her here? A chance for a better life--economic \nopportunity, a better job for her husband, and for her family, but also \nthe freedoms that this country had to offer. She brought with her a \nlittle prayer book that meant so much to her and her Catholic church in \nLithuania. It was printed in Lithuanian. It was banned by Russian \nofficials who controlled her country. This woman who could barely read \nbrought this prayer book, considered contraband, because it meant so \nmuch to her. She knew once she crossed the shores and came into America \nthat freedom of religion would guarantee that she could practice her \nreligion as she believed.\n  She came, as millions did, in the course of our history--providing \nthe workers and the skills and the potential for the growth of this \neconomy and this Nation.\n  As we look back on our history, we find that many of these newcomers \nto America were not greeted with open arms. Signs were out: ``Irish \nNeed Not Apply.'' People were giving speeches about ``mongrelizing the \nraces in America.'' All sorts of hateful rhetoric was printed and \nspoken throughout our history. In fact, you can still find it today in \nmany despicable Internet sites. That has created a political \ncontroversy around the issue of immigration, which still lingers.\n  It wasn't that long ago that a Republican Governor of California led \na kind of crusade against Hispanic immigration to his State. I am sure \nit had some popularity with some people. But, in the long run, the \nRepublican Party has even rejected that approach to immigration.\n  The H-1B visa issue is one that really is a challenge to all of us \nbecause what we are saying is that we want to expand the opportunity \nfor people with skills to come to the United States and find jobs on a \ntemporary basis. We are being importuned by industry leaders and people \nin Silicon Valley who say: You know, we just can't find enough skilled \nworkers in the United States to fill jobs.\n  We ask permission from Congress, through the laws, to increase the \nnumber of H-1B visas that can be granted each year to those coming to \nour shores to work and to be part of these growing industrial and \neconomic opportunities.\n  Historically, we have capped those who could be granted H-1B visas--\n115,000 in fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000, and 107,500 in fiscal \nyear 2001. The bill we are debating today would increase the number of \npeople who could be brought in under these visas to 195,000 per year.\n  I think it is a good idea to do this. I say that with some reluctance \nbecause I am sorry to report that we don't have the skilled employees \nwe need in the United States. Surely we are at a point of record \nemployment with 22 million jobs created over the last 8 years. But we \nalso understand that some of the jobs that need to be filled can't be \nfilled because the workers are not there with the skills. We find not \nworker shortages in this country but skill shortages in this country.\n\n  I think there are two things we ought to consider as part of this \ndebate. First, what are we going to do about the skill shortage in \nAmerica? Are we going to give up on American workers and say, well, \nsince you cannot come up with the skills to work in the computer and \ntechnology industry we will just keep bringing in people from overseas? \nI certainly hope not.\n  I think it is our responsibility to do just the opposite--to say to \nourselves and to others involved in education and training that there \nare things we can do to increase and improve our labor pool.\n  The second issue I want to address in the few moments that I have \nbefore us, is the whole question of immigration and fairness.\n  Many of us on the Democratic side believe that if we are going to \naddress the issue of immigration that we should address it with \namendments that deal with problems which we can identify.\n  I came to the floor earlier and suggested to my colleagues that in my \nChicago office, two-thirds of our casework of people calling and asking \nfor help have immigration problems. I spend most of my time dealing \nwith the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Sometimes they come \nthrough like champions. Many times they do not. People are frustrated \nby the delays in their administrative decisions; frustrated by some of \nthe laws they are enforcing; and frustrated by some of the treatment \nthat they receive by INS employees.\n  What we hope to do in the course of this bill is not only address the \nneed of the high-tech industry for additional H-1B visas and jobs, but \nalso the need for fairness when it comes to immigration in our country.\n  In the midst of our lively and sometimes fractious debates in the \nSenate, I hope we can all at least take a moment to step back and \nreflect on our very good fortune. We are truly living in remarkable \ntimes. The economy has been expanding at a record pace over the last 8 \nor 10 years. A few years ago we were embroiled in a debate on the \nSenate floor about the deficits and the growing debt in this country. \nWe now find that the national topic for debate is the surplus and what \nwe can do with it. What a dramatic turnaround has occurred in such a \nshort period of time. It has occurred because more Americans are going \nto work and more people are making more money. As they are more \ngenerous in their contributions to charities and as they are paying \nmore in taxes at the State and Federal level, we are finding surpluses \nthat are emerging in this country. That, of course, is the topic of \ndiscussion.\n  Unemployment is at a historic low. So are poverty rates. Our crime \nrates are coming down. Household incomes have reached new heights. Our \nmassive Federal debt--an albatross around the neck of the entire \nNation--has all but vanished, replaced by surpluses that have inspired \nmore than a bit of economic giddiness.\n  We have a need in this country for many high-skilled technology \nworkers. We are all witnesses to this incredible technological \nrevolution, the Internet revolution that is unfolding at a pace almost \ntoo rapid for the imagination to absorb. Indeed, in many respects it \nhas been a revolution in modern information technology that has \nrevolutionized the fields of business, medicine, biology, \nentertainment, and helped to spur our robust economy.\n  When I visit the classrooms across Illinois, particularly the grade \nschool classrooms, I ask the kids in the classroom if they can imagine \nliving in a world without computers. They shake their heads in \ndisbelief. I remember those days, and I bet a lot of people can, too. \nIt was not that long ago. Technology has transformed our lives. These \ntwo phenomena, a vibrant economy and an amazing technology, have \ncombined to create an unprecedented level of need in American industry \nfor skilled technology workers, for men and women to design the \nsystems, write the software, create the innovations, and fix the bugs \nfor all the marvelous technology that sits on our desktops or rides in \nour shirt pockets.\n  The Information Technology Association of America reports the \nindustry will need an additional 1.6 million workers to fill \ninformation technology positions this year. A little more than half of \nthese jobs will go unfilled due to a shortfall of qualified workers. \nMr. President, 1.6 million workers are needed; with only 800,000 people \nwe cannot fill the jobs.\n  Another trend marks our modern age, the trend towards economic \nglobalization. The other day, we passed the legislation for permanent \nnormal trade relations with China. It is not surprising that our \nindustries are looking for highly skilled workers in the United States. \nWhen they can't find them here, they start looking in other countries.\n  Why should workers in another country want to uproot themselves, \nleave their homes and families, and make the long journey here? The \nsame reason that my grandparents did, and their parents might have \nbefore them. They made the journey because for thousands, America is \nthe fairest, freest, greatest country there is. It is a land like no \nother, a land of real opportunity, a land where hard work and\n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\ngood values pay off, a land where innovation, creativity, and hard work \nare cherished and rewarded, a land where anyone, whether a long-time \nresident whose family goes back to the Revolutionary War, or a brand-\nnew immigrant clutching a visa that grants them a right to work, can \nachieve this American dream.\n  We have before the Senate this bill to open the door for that dream \nto greater numbers of high-tech workers, workers the information \ntechnology industry needs to stay vital and healthy. It is a good idea \nto open that door wider. I support it. It is the right thing to do. We \ncan do it in the right manner. We can meet the demanding needs of the \ntechnology situation and create a win-win situation for all American \nworkers, no matter what their craft or what their skills, while \navoiding the pitfalls that a carelessly crafted high-tech visa program \nwould create.\n  To do it the right way, we have to consider the following: First, we \nmust make available to industry an ample number of high-tech worker \nvisas through a program that is streamlined and responsive enough to \nwork in ``Internet time.''\n  At the same time, we must set appropriate criteria for granting these \nhigh-tech visas. There is a temptation to hire foreign workers for no \nother reason than to replace perfectly qualified American workers. \nPerhaps it is because foreign workers are deemed more likely to be \ncompliant in the workplace for fear of losing their visa privileges or \nbecause they are willing to work for lower wages, or because they are \nless expectant of good work benefits.\n  Whatever the perception, we must be on guard against any misuse of \nthe visa program. There must be a true need, a type of specialty that \nis so much in demand that there is a true shortage of qualified \nworkers.\n\n  We must also bear in mind that we have not just one, but two \nprincipal goals that must be held in balance. The first goal is to \nfulfill a short-term need by granting high-tech visas. The second, and \nultimately more important goal, is to meet our long-term need for a \nhighly skilled workforce by making sure there are ample educational \nopportunities for students and workers here at home. A proposal to \naddress this need will receive strong support if it embraces the goal \nof training our domestic workforce for the future demands of the \ntechnology industry and provides the mechanisms and revenue to reach \nthat goal.\n  It is interesting that in every political poll that I have read, at \nvirtually every level, when asking families across America the No. 1 \nissue that they are concerned with, inevitably it is education. I have \nthought about that and it has a lot to do with families with kids in \nschool, but it also has a lot to do with the belief that most of us \nhave in America--that education was our ticket to opportunity and \nsuccess. We want future generations to have that same opportunity.\n  I see my friend, Senator Wellstone from Minnesota. He has taught for \nmany years and is an expert in the field of education. I will not try \nto steal his thunder on this issue. But I will state that as I read \nabout the history of education in America, there are several things we \nshould learn, not the least of which is the fact that at the turn of \nthe last century, between the 19th and 20th century, there was a \nphenomena taking place in America that really distinguished us from the \nrest of the world.\n  This is what it was: Between 1890 and 1918, we built on average in \nthe United States of America one new high school every single day. This \nwasn't a Federal mandate. It was a decision, community by community, \nand State by State, that we were going to expand something that no \nother country had even thought of expanding--education beyond the \neighth grade. We started with the premise that high schools would be \nopen to everyone: Immigrants and those who have been in this country \nfor many years. It is true that high schools for many years were \nsegregated in part of America until the mid-1950s and 1960s, but the \nfact is we were doing something no other country was considering.\n  We were democratizing and popularizing education. We were saying to \nkids: Don't stop at eighth grade; continue in school. My wife and I \nmarvel at the fact that none of our parents--we may be a little unusual \nin this regard, or at least distinctive --went beyond the eighth grade. \nThat was not uncommon. If you could find a good job out of the eighth \ngrade on a farm or in town, many students didn't go on.\n  Around 1900, when 3 percent of the 17-year-olds graduated from high \nschool, we started seeing the numbers growing over the years. Today 80 \nor 90 percent of eligible high school students do graduate.\n  What did this mean for America? It meant that we were expanding \neducation for the masses, for all of our citizenry, at a time when many \nother countries would not. They kept their education elite, only for \nthose wealthiest enough or in the right classes; we democratized it. We \nsaid: We believe in public education; we believe it should be available \nfor all Americans. What did it mean? It meant that in a short period of \ntime we developed the most skilled workforce in the world.\n  We went from the Tin Lizzies of Henry Ford to Silicon Valley. We went \nfrom Kitty Hawk to Cape Canaveral. In the meantime, in the 1940s, when \nEurope was at war fighting Hitler and fascism, it was the United States \nand its workforce that generated the products that fought the war not \nonly for our allies but ultimately for ourselves, successfully.\n  That is what made the 20th century the American century. We were \nthere with the people. We invested in America. Education meant \nsomething to everybody. People went beyond high school to college and \nto professional degrees. With that workforce and the GI bill after \nWorld War II, America became a symbol for what can happen when a \ncountry devotes itself to education.\n  Now we come into the 21st century and some people are resting on \ntheir laurels saying: We proved how we can do it. There is no need to \nlook to new solutions. I think they are wrong. I think they are very \nwrong. Frankly, we face new challenges as great as any faced by those \ncoming into the early days of the 20th century. We may not be facing a \nwar, thank God, but we are facing a global economy where real \ncompetition is a matter of course in today's business.\n  We understand as we debate this H-1B visa bill, if we are not \ndeveloping the workers with the skills to fill the jobs, then we are \nremiss in our obligation to this country. Yes, we can pass an H-1B visa \nas a stopgap measure to keep the economy rolling forward, but if we \ndon't also address the underlying need to come to the rescue of the \nskill shortage, I don't think we are meeting our obligation in the \nSenate.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9237-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9237-S9241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               H-1B VISAS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wanted to ask the Senator--I know Illinois is an \nagricultural State, as is mine. Many of our rural citizens, for \nexample, desperately want what I think most people in the country want, \nwhich is to be able to earn a decent living and be able to support \ntheir families. At the same time we have our information technology \ncompanies telling us--I hear this all the time; I am sure the Senator \nfrom Illinois hears this--listen, we need skilled workers; we don't \nhave enough skilled workers; and we pay good wages with good fringe \nbenefits. Is the Senator aware we have people in rural America who are \nsaying: Give us the opportunity to develop these skills? Give us the \nopportunity to be trained. Give us the opportunity to telework. With \nthis new technology, we can actually stay in our rural communities. We \ndon't have to leave.\n  Is the Senator aware there are so many men and women, for example, in \nrural America--just to talk about rural America--who are ready to \nreally do this work, take advantage of and be a part of this new \neconomy, but they don't have the opportunity to develop the skills and \nto have the training? Is that what the Senator is speaking to?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is right. I am sure he finds the same thing \nthat I do in rural Illinois when he goes through Minnesota. There are \ntowns\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\nliterally hanging on by their fingernails, trying to survive in this \nchanging economy, and some of them are responding in creative ways. In \nPeoria, they have create a tech center downtown, jointly sponsored by \nthe Chamber of Commerce, the local community, and the community \ncollege, where they are literally bringing in people, some our ages and \nolder, introducing them to computers and what they can learn from them. \nSo they are developing skills within their community, the lifelong \nlearning that I mentioned earlier.\n  Down in Benton, IL, which is a small town that has been wracked by \nthe end of the coal mining industry, for the most part, in our State, \nthey have decided in downtown Benton not to worry about flowers planted \non the streets but rather to wire the entire downtown so they will be \nable to accommodate the high-tech businesses that might be attracted \nthere. They are trying to think ahead of the curve.\n  I am not prepared to give up on American workers. I know Senator \nWellstone is not, either. We need to address the need for more training \nand education in rural and urban areas alike.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask the Senator one other question? I am in \ncomplete agreement with what the Senator is saying. I had hoped to \nintroduce an amendment to the H-1B bill that dealt with the whole issue \nof telework. I think we could have gotten a huge vote for it because \nthis is so important to what we call greater Minnesota.\n  I wish to pick up on something the Senator said earlier. He talked \nabout his own background. The last thing I am going to do is to go \nagainst immigrants and all they have done for our country. I am the son \nof an immigrant. I have a similar background to that of my colleague, \nbut I wanted to give one poignant example. I think we both tend to draw \nsome energy just from people we meet.\n  On Sunday, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission--and \nI give Chairman Kennard all the credit in the world--came out to \nMinnesota to do a 3-day work session with Native Americans. When we \ntalk about Native Americans, we are talking about first Americans, \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Do you know what they are saying? They are saying: In \nour reservations, we have 50-percent-plus poverty. In fact, they are \nsaying it is not only the Internet; they still don't have phone service \nfor many. What they are saying is they want to be part of this new \neconomy. They want the opportunity for the training, the \ninfrastructure, the technology infrastructure.\n\n  Yet another example: I am all for guest workers and immigrants coming \nin. But at the same time we have first Americans, Native Americans--I \nsee my colleague from Maryland is here. We talk about the digital \ndivide--who are way on the other side of the digital divide. There is \nanother example which I think we have to speak to in legislation at \nthis time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with Senator Wellstone. As he was making those \ncomments, I thought to myself, that is right up Senator Mikulski's \nalley, and I looked over my shoulder and there in the well of the \nSenate she is. Senator Mikulski addressed this issue of providing \nopportunities to cross the digital divide so everybody has this right \nto access. I invite the Senator to join us at this point. We were \ntalking about the H-1B bill that addresses an immediate need but \ndoesn't address the needs of the skill shortage which she raised at our \ncaucus luncheon, or the digital divide. I would like to invite a \nquestion or comment from the Senator from Maryland on those subjects.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator for his advocacy on this issue.\n  First of all, I acknowledge the validity of the high-tech community's \nconcerns about the availability of a high-tech workforce. The proposal \nhere is to solve the problem by importing the people with the skills. I \nam not going to dispute that as a short-term, short-range solution. But \nwhat I do dispute is that we are precluded from offering amendments to \ncreate a farm team of tech workers. This is what I want to do if I \nwould have the right to offer an amendment.\n  We do not have a worker shortage in the United States of America. I \nsay to the Senator, and to my colleagues, we have a skill shortage in \nthe United States of America. We have to make sure the people who want \nto work, who have the ability to work, have access to learning the \ntechnology so they can work in this new economy.\n  The digital divide means the difference between those who have access \nto technology and know how to use technology. If you are on one side of \nthe divide, your future as a person or a country is great. If you are \non the wrong side, you could be obsolete.\n  I do not want to mandate obsolescence for the American people who do \nnot want to be left out or left behind. That is why I want to do two \nthings: No. 1, have community tech centers --1,000 of them--where \nadults could learn by the day and kids could learn in structured \nafterschool activities in the afternoon. Then, also, to increase the \nfunding for teacher training for K-12, where we would have a national \ngoal that every child in America be computer literal by the time they \nfinish the eighth grade. And maybe they then will not drop out.\n  That is what we want to be able to do. I do not understand. Why is it \nthat farm teams are OK for baseball but they are not OK for technology \nworkers, which is our K-12?\n  I share with the Senator a very touching story. A retail clerk I \nencounter every week in the course of taking care of my own needs was a \nminimum wage earner. I encouraged her to get her GED and look at tech \ntraining at a local community college. She did that. In all probability \nshe is going to be working for the great Johns Hopkins University \nsometime within the month. She will double her income, she will have \nhealth insurance benefits, and it will enable enough of an income for \nher husband to take a breather and also get new tech skills.\n  But they have to pay tuition. They could do those things. I think we \nneed to have amendments to address the skill shortage in the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. She has been a real \nleader on this whole question of the digital divide. She caught it \nbefore a lot of us caught on. Now she is asking for an opportunity to \noffer an amendment on this bill. Unfortunately, it has been the \ndecision of the leadership in this Chamber that we will not be able to \namend this bill. We can provide additional visas for these workers to \ncome in from overseas on a temporary basis, but they are unwilling to \ngive us an opportunity to offer amendments to provide the skills for \nAmerican workers to fill these jobs in the years to come.\n  Alan Greenspan comes to Capitol Hill about every 3 or 4 weeks. Every \nbreath he takes is monitored by the press to find out what is going to \nhappen next at the Federal Reserve. On September 23, he gave an unusual \nspeech for the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He called on Federal \nlawmakers to make math and science education a national priority. Who \nwould have guessed this economist from the Federal Reserve, the \nChairman, would come and give a speech about education, but he did. He \ncalled on Congress:\n\n       . . . to boost math and science education in the schools.\n       He said it was ``crucial for the future of our nation'' in \n     an increasingly technological society.\n       He noted 100 years ago--the time I mentioned, when we \n     started building high schools in this country at such a rapid \n     rate--only about 1 in 10 workers was in a professional or \n     technical job, but by 1970 the number had doubled. Today \n     those jobs account for nearly one-third of the workforce.\n       Greenspan said just as the education system in the early \n     20th century helped transform the country from a primarily \n     agricultural, rural society to one concentrated in \n     manufacturing in urban areas, schools today must prepare \n     workers to use ever-changing high-technology devices such as \n     computers and the Internet. . . .\n       ``The new jobs that have been created by the surge in \n     innovation require that the workers who fill them use more of \n     their intellectual potential,'' Greenspan said. . . .'' This \n     process of stretching toward our human intellectual capacity \n     is not likely to end any time soon.''\n\n  If we acknowledge that education and training is a national problem \nand a national challenge, why isn't this Congress doing something about \nit?\n  Sadly, this Congress has a long agenda of missed opportunities and \nunfinished business. This is certainly one of them. For the first time \nin more than\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\ntwo decades, we will fail to enact an Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. At a time when education is the highest priority in this \ncountry, it appears that the Senate cannot even bring this matter to \nthe floor to debate it, to complete the debate, and pass it into law.\n  It is an indictment on the leadership of the House and the Senate \nthat we will not come forward with any significant education or \ntraining legislation in this Congress.\n  We will come forward with stopgap measures such as H-1B visas to help \nbusinesses, but we will not come forward to help the workers develop \nthe skills they need to earn the income they need to realize the \nAmerican dream.\n  I remember back in the 1950s, when I was a kid just finishing up in \ngrade school, that the Russians launched the satellite, Sputnik. It \nscared us to death. We didn't believe that the Russians, under their \nCommunist regime, and under their totalitarian leadership, could ever \ncome up with this kind of technology, and they beat us to the punch. \nThey put the first satellite into space.\n  Congress panicked and said: We have to catch up with the Russians. We \nhave to get ahead of them, as a matter of fact. So we passed the \nNational Defense Education Act, which was the first decision by \nCongress to provide direct assistance to college students across \nAmerica. I am glad that Congress did it because I received part of that \nmoney. I borrowed money from the Federal Government, finished college \nand law school, and paid it back. And thousands like me were able to \nsee their lives open up before them.\n  It was a decision which led to a stronger America in many ways. It \nled to the decision by President Kennedy to create the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, putting a man on the moon and, of \ncourse, the rest, as they say, is history.\n  Why aren't we doing the same thing today? Why aren't we talking about \ncreating a National Security Education Act? Senator Kennedy has a \nproposal along those lines. I would like to add to his proposal \nlifetime learning so that workers who are currently employed, as \nSenator Wellstone said, have a chance to go to these tech centers that \nSenator Mikulski described, to community colleges, and to other places, \nto develop the skills they need to fill these jobs that we are now \ngoing to fill with those coming in from overseas.\n  Make no mistake--I will repeat it for the Record--I have no objection \nto immigration. As the son of an immigrant, I value my mother's \nnaturalization certificate. It hangs over my desk in my office as a \nreminder of where I come from. But I do believe we have an obligation \nto a lot of workers in the U.S. today who are looking for a chance to \nsucceed. Unfortuantely, we are not going to have that debate. The \ndecision has been made by the leadership that we just don't have time \nfor it.\n\n  Those who are watching this debate can look around the Chamber and \nsee that there are not many people here other than Senator Wellstone \nand myself. There has not been a huge cry and clamor from the Members \nof the Senate to come to the floor today. The fact is, we have a lot of \ntime and a lot of opportunity to consider a lot of issues, and one of \nthose should be education.\n  I might address an issue that Senator Wellstone raised earlier, as \nwell as Senator Mikulski. How will workers pay for this additional \ntraining? How can they pay for the tuition and fees of community \ncolleges or universities? It is a real concern.\n  In my State, in the last 20 years, the cost of higher education has \ngone up between 200 and 400 percent, depending on the school. A lot of \npeople worry about the debt they would incur. I am glad to be part of \nan effort to create the deductibility of college education expenses and \nlifetime learning expenses. I think if you are going to talk about tax \nrelief--and I am for that--you should focus on things that families \ncare about the most and mean the most to the country.\n  What could mean more to a family than to see their son or daughter \nget into a school or college? And then they have to worry about how \nthey are going to pay for it. If they can deduct tuition and fees, it \nmeans we will give them a helping hand in the Tax Code to the tune of \n$2,000 or $3,000 a year to help pay for college education.\n  I think that is a good tax cut. I think that is a good targeted tax \ncut, consistent with keeping our economy moving forward, by creating \nthe workforce of the future. It is certainly consistent with Alan \nGreenspan's advice to Congress, as he looks ahead and says, if we want \nto keep this economy moving, we have to do it in a fashion that is \nresponsive to the demands of the workplace. Many Members have spoken \ntoday, and certainly over the last several months, of the importance of \nskills training.\n  Robert Kuttner, who is an economist for Business Week, wrote:\n\n       . . . what's holding back even faster economic growth is \n     the low skill level of millions of potential workers.\n\n  I think that is obvious. As I said earlier, in visiting businesses, \nit is the No. 1 item of concern. The successful businesses in Illinois, \nwhen I ask them, What is your major problem? they don't say taxes or \nregulations--although they probably mention those--but the No. 1 \nconcern is, they can't find skilled workers to fill the jobs, good-\npaying jobs. It really falls on our shoulders to respond to this need \nacross America.\n  The sad truth is, we have allowed this wonderful revolution to pass \nmany of our people by. We have to do something about American \neducation. It is imperative that we look to our long-term needs, \nexpanding opportunities in our workforce.\n  This means providing opportunities in schools, but also it means \nafterschool programs, programs during the summer, worker retraining \nprograms, public-private partnerships, and grants to communities to \ngive the workforce of the future a variety of ways to become the \nworkers of the 21st century.\n  As far as this is concerned, I say, let a thousand flowers bloom, let \ncommunities come forward to give us their most creative, innovative \nideas on how they can educate their workforce and students to really \naddress these needs.\n  We have to improve K-through-12 education. I will bet, if I gave a \nquiz to people across America, and asked-- What percentage of the \nFederal budget do you think we spend on education K through 12? Most \npeople would guess, oh, 15, 20, 25 percent. The answer is 1 percent of \nour Federal budget. One percent is spent on K-through-12 education.\n\n  Think about the opportunities we are missing, when we realize that if \nwe are going to have more scientists and engineers, you don't announce \nat high school graduation that the doors are open at college for new \nscientists and engineers.\n  Many times, you have to reach down, as Senator Wellstone has said, to \nmake sure that the teachers are trained so that they know how to \nintroduce these students to the new science and the new technology so \nthat they can be successful as well. That is part of mentoring for new \nteachers. It is teacher training for those who have been professionals \nand want to upgrade their skills.\n  I would like to bring that to the Senate floor in debate. I would \nlike to offer an amendment to improve it. But no, we can't. Under this \nbill, all we have is the H-1B visa. Bring in the workers from overseas; \ndon't talk about the needs of education and training in America.\n  In addition to improving K-through-12 education, we also have to look \nto the fact that science and math education in K-through-12 levels \nreally will require some afterschool work as well.\n  It has been suggested to me by people who are in this field that one \nof the most encouraging things they went through was many times a \nsummer class that was offered at a community college or university, \nwhere the best students in science and math came together from grade \nschools and junior highs and high schools to get together and realize \nthere are other kids of like mind and like appetite to develop their \nskills. I think that should be part of any program.\n  The most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress has noted \nthat we are doing better when it comes to the number of students who \nare taking science courses. We are doing better when it comes to SAT \nscores in science and math. But clearly we are not going to meet the \nneeds of the 21st century unless we make a dramatic improvement.\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\n  Teacher training, as I mentioned, is certainly a priority. In 1998, \nthe National Science Foundation found that 2 percent of elementary \nschoolteachers had a science degree--2 percent in 1998; 1 percent had a \nmath degree; an additional 6 percent had majored or minored in science \nor math education in college. In middle schools, about 17 percent of \nscience teachers held a science degree, 7 percent of math teachers had \na degree in mathematics; 63 percent of high school science teachers had \nsome type of science degree; and 41 percent of math teachers in high \nschool had a degree in that subject.\n  It is a sad commentary, but a fact of life. In the town I was born \nin, my original hometown, East St. Louis, IL, I once talked to a leader \nin a school system there. It is a poor school system that struggles \nevery day.\n  He said, he'd allow any teacher to teach math or science if they \nexpress a willingness to try, because they couldn't attract anyone to \ncome teach with a math and science degree. We can improve on that. We \ncan do better. There are lots of ways to do that, to encourage people \nto teach in areas of teacher shortages and skill shortages, by offering \nscholarships to those who will use them, by forgiving their loans if \nthey will come and teach in certain school districts, by trying to \nprovide incentives for them to perhaps work in the private sector and \nspend some time working in the schools. All of these things should be \ntried. At least they should be debated, should they not, on the floor \nof the Senate? And we are not going to get that chance. Instead, we \nwill just limit this debate to the very narrow subject of the HB visa.\n  We also need to reach out to minorities. When it comes to developing \nscience and engineering degrees, we certainly have to encourage those \nwho are underrepresented in these degree programs. The National Science \nFoundation reports that African Americans, Hispanics, and Native \nAmericans comprise 23 percent of our population but earn 13 percent of \nbachelor's degrees, 7 percent of master's degrees, and 4.5 percent of \ndoctorate degrees in science and engineering.\n  Recruiting young people in the high-tech field will require \ninitiatives to not only improve the quality of math and science \neducation but also to spark kids' interest. I talked about the summer \nprograms in which we can be involved, but there are many others as \nwell. The National Defense Education Act should be a template, a model, \nas the GI bill was, for us to follow. It really was a declaration by \nour Government and by our people that the security of the Nation at \nthat time required the fullest development of the mental resources and \ntechnical skills of its young men and women. That was said almost 50 \nyears ago. It is still true today. The time is now for the Congress to \nstep up to the plate and reaffirm our commitment to education.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 13 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me close by addressing another critically important amendment \nwhich is not being allowed with this bill. It is one of which I am a \ncosponsor with Senators Kennedy and Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Harry \nReid of Nevada. It is entitled the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. \nThere are many issues which come to the floor of the Senate, but there \nare few that enjoy the endorsement and support of both the AFL-CIO and \nthe national Chamber of Commerce. This bill is one of them.\n  What we wanted to propose as an amendment was a change in our \nimmigration laws to deal with some issues that are truly unfair. While \nwe look to address the needs of the tech industry, we should not do it \nwith blinders on. There are many other sectors of this robust economy--\nperhaps not as glamorous as the latest ``dot-com'' company but still \nvery much in need of able and energetic workers--that have difficulty \nfinding workers they need in the domestic workforce. Oddly enough, many \nof these workers are already here. They are on the job. They are \nraising families. They are contributing to their communities. They are \npaying taxes. But they are reluctant to step forward.\n  I am speaking now of immigrants who come to this country in search of \na better life. Many immigrants left their homelands against their will. \nThey left because of the appallingly brutal conditions they \nencountered, whether at the hands of despotic Central American death \nsquads or in the chaotic collapse of much of Eastern Europe. To stay \nthere in those countries meant death for themselves and their families.\n  I am reminded of those immortal words of Emma Lazarus on our Statue \nof Liberty: Give me your tired, your poor.\n  Maybe some of these immigrants are tired. Who could blame them? Many \nof them are poor. I can tell you this: Whether people come from other \nlands to work in high-tech jobs, as the H-1B visa bill addresses, or \nclean the offices, wash the dishes, care for our children, care for our \ngrandparents and parents in nursing homes, these are some of the \nhardest working people you will ever see. As Jesse Jackson said in a \ngreat speech at the San Francisco Democratic Convention: They get up \nand go to work every single day.\n\n  Here they are in this new land, looking to make the best new start \nthey possibly can. But for many of these immigrants, we require them to \nmake that effort with one hand, and maybe even both hands, tied behind \ntheir backs. I am afraid our current immigration laws are so \ncumbersome, so complex, and so inherently unfair that thousands of \nimmigrants to this country are afraid to become fully integrated into \nthe workforce, afraid because our laws, our regulations, and sometimes \nthe unpredictable policies of the INS have created a climate of \nuncertainty and fear.\n  Employers are looking for workers. The workers are looking for jobs. \nBut they are afraid to step forward. There are thousands upon thousands \nof people in this country, this great country of ours, who are being \ntreated unfairly--people who have lived here now for years, sometimes \ndecades, but are still forced to live in the shadows, where they are \nloathe to get a Social Security number, respond to a census form, or \nopen a bank account. People who are an essential component of this \nthriving economy--everybody knows this. People who are doing jobs that \nmost other people simply do not want to do. Yet we refuse them the \nbasic rights and the opportunities that should belong to all of us.\n  There is no other way to say it: This is simply a matter of an unfair \nsystem, created by our own hands here on Capitol Hill, that is ruining \nlives, tearing families apart, and keeping too many people in poverty \nand fear. We have the means at hand to change this. With an amendment \nto this bill, we can rally the forces in the Senate to change the \nimmigration laws and make them fairer. My good colleagues, Senators \nKennedy and Reed, and I have made a vigorous effort to bring these \nissues to the floor. We have been stopped at every turn in the road. We \nwant to have a vote on the bill, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  I can't go back to my constituents in Illinois and tell them, yes, we \nmade it easy to bring in thousands of high-tech workers because Silicon \nValley had their representatives walking through the Halls of Congress \nand on the floor of the Senate and the House, but we couldn't address \nyour needs because you couldn't afford a well paid lobbyist. No, we \nhave to do the very best we can to be fair to all. That is a message \nthat will inspire confidence in the work we do in the Senate.\n  Let me tell you briefly what this bill does. This bill, the Latino \nand Immigrant Fairness Act, supported by both organized labor and the \nChamber of Commerce, establishes parity; that is, equal treatment for \nimmigrants from Central America and, I would add, from some other \ncountries, such as Liberia, where Senator Reed of Rhode Island has told \nus that literally thousands of Liberians who fled that country in fear \nof their lives, by October 1 may be forced to return to perilous \ncircumstances unless we change the law; where those who have come from \nHaiti, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Eastern Europe, and other \ncountries, who are here because of their refugee status seeking asylum, \nmay see the end of that status come because the Congress failed to act. \nWe will have their future in our hands and in our hearts. I hope the \nSenate and Congress can respond by passing this reform legislation.\n  We also have decided, since 1921, from time to time to give those who \nhave\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\nbeen in the United States for a period of time, sometimes 14 years, and \nhave established themselves in the community, have good jobs, have \nstarted families, pay their taxes, don't commit crime, do things that \nare important for America--to give them a chance to apply for \ncitizenship. It is known as registry status. The last registry status \nthat we enacted was in 1986, dating back to 1972. We think this should \nbe reenacted and updated so there will be an opportunity for another \ngeneration.\n\n  Finally, restoring section 245(i) of the Immigration Act, a provision \nof the immigration law that sensibly allowed people in the United \nStates who were on the verge of gaining their immigration status to \nremain here while completing the process. This upside down idea has to \nbe changed--that people have to return to their country of birth while \nthey wait for the final months of the INS decision process on becoming \na citizen. It is terrible to tear these families apart and to impose \nthis financial burden on them.\n  I hope we will pass as part of H-1B visa this Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act. It really speaks to what we are all about in the \nCongress, the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n  Many people have said they are compassionate in this political \ncampaign. There are many tests of compassion as far as I am concerned. \nSome of these tests might come down to what you are willing to vote \nfor. I think the test of compassion for thousands of families ensnared \nin the bureaucratic tangle of the INS is not in hollow campaign \npromises. The test of compassion for thousands from El Salvador, \nGuatemala, Honduras, and Haiti refugees asking for equal treatment is \nnot in being able to speak a few words of Spanish. The test of \ncompassion for hard-working people in our country who are forced to \nleave their families to comply with INS requirements is not whether a \npublic official is willing to pose for a picture with people of color.\n  The test is whether you are willing to actively support legislation \nthat brings real fairness to our immigration laws. That is why I am a \ncosponsor of this effort for the 6 million immigrants in the U.S. who \nare not yet citizens, who are only asking for a chance to have their \nability to reach out for the American dream, a chance which so many of \nus have had in the past.\n  These immigrants add about $10 billion each year to the U.S. economy \nand pay at least $133 billion in taxes, according to a 1998 study. \nImmigrants pay $25 billion to $30 billion more in taxes each year than \nthey receive in public services. Immigrant businesses are a source of \nsubstantial economic and fiscal gain for the U.S. citizenry, adding at \nleast another $29 billion to the total amount of taxes paid.\n  In a study of real hourly earnings of illegal immigrants between \n1988, when they were undocumented, and 1992 when legalized, showed that \nreal hourly earnings increased by 15 percent for men and 21 percent for \nwomen. Many of these hard-working people are being exploited because \nthey are not allowed to achieve legal status. The state of the \nsituation on the floor of the Senate is that we are giving speeches \ninstead of offering amendments. It is a sad commentary on this great \nbody that has deliberated some of the most important issues facing \nAmerica.\n  Those watching this debate who are witnessing this proceeding in the \nSenate Chamber must wonder why the Senate isn't filled with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle actively debating the important issues of \neducation and training and reform of our immigration laws. Sadly, this \nis nothing new. For the past year, this Congress has done little or \nnothing.\n  When we see all of the agenda items before us, whether it is \neducation, dealing with health care, a prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare, the Patients' Bill of Rights for individuals and families to \nbe treated fairly by health insurance companies, this Congress has \nfallen down time and time again. It is a sad commentary when men and \nwomen have been entrusted with the responsibility and the opportunity \nand have not risen to the challenge. This bill pending today is further \nevidence that this Congress is not willing to grapple with the \nimportant issues that America's families really care about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to also speak now about \nthe H-1B bill on the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I have 10 minutes to speak on that \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I will not speak a long time. But I \nwant to raise a couple of issues that other colleagues have spoken to \nas well.\n  I come from a State with a very sophisticated high-tech industry. I \ncome from a State that has an explosion of information technology \ncompanies. I come from a State that has a great medical device \nindustry. I come from a State that is leading the way.\n  I am very sympathetic to the call on the part of business communities \nto be able to get more help from skilled labor, including skilled \nworkers from other countries. I am more than sympathetic to what the \nbusiness community is saying. I certainly believe that immigrants--men \nand women from other countries who help businesses and work, who stay \nin our country--make our country a richer and better country.\n  I am the son of a Jewish immigrant who was born in Ukraine and who \nfled persecution from Russia. But I also believe that it is a crying \nshame that we do not have the opportunity--again, this is the greatness \nof the Senate--to be able to introduce some amendments: an amendment \nthat would focus on education and job training and skill development \nfor Americans who could take some of these jobs; an amendment that \ndeals with telework that is so important to rural America, and so \nimportant to rural Minnesota.\n\n  I hope there is some way I can get this amendment and this piece of \nlegislation passed, which basically would employ people in rural \ncommunities, such as some of the farmers who lost their farms, who have \na great work ethic, who want to work, and who want to have a chance to \ndevelop their skills for the technology companies that say they need \nskilled workers. They can telework. They can do it from home or \nsatellite offices. It is a marriage made in heaven. I am hoping to \nsomehow still pass that legislation. I hope it will be an amendment on \nthis bill because, again, it would enable these Americans to have a \nchance.\n  My colleague from New Mexico is one of the strongest advocates for \nNative Americans. This was such an interesting meeting this past Sunday \nin Minnesota. I give FCC Chairman Kennard a lot of credit for holding a \n3-day workshop for people in Indian country who not only don't have \naccess to the Internet but who still don't have phones. They were \ntalking about guest workers and others coming to our country. These \nwere the first Americans. They were saying: we want to be a part of \nthis new economy; we want to have a chance to learn the skills. We want \nto be wired. We want to have the infrastructure.\n  I hope there can be an amendment that speaks to the concerns and \ncircumstances of people in Indian country.\n  Finally, I think the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is important \nfor not only the Latino community but also for the Liberian community. \nI am worried about the thousands of Liberians in Minnesota who at the \nend of the month maybe will have to leave this country if we don't have \nsome kind of change. This legislation calls for permanent residency \nstatus for them. But I am terribly worried they are going to be forced \nto go back. It would be very dangerous for them and their families. I \ncertainly think there is a powerful, moral, and ethical plan for the \nLatino and Latina community\n\n[[Page S9242]]\n\nin this legislation. We had hoped that would be an amendment. Again, it \ndoesn't look as if we are going to have an opportunity to present this \namendment. I don't think that is the Senate at its best.\n  I will vote for cloture on a bill that I actually think is a good \npiece of legislation but not without the opportunity for us to consider \nsome of these amendments. They could have time limits where we could \ntry to improve this bill. We can make sure this is good for the \nbusiness community and good for the people in our country who want to \nhave a chance to be a part of this new economy, as well as bringing in \nskilled workers from other countries. I think we could do all of it. It \ncould be a win-win-win.\n  The Senate is at its best when we can bring these amendments to the \nfloor and therefore have an opportunity to represent people in our \nStates and be legislators. But when we are shut down and closed out, \nthen I think Senators have every right to say we can't support this. \nThat is certainly going to be my position.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9242-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION PROVISIONS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I spoke yesterday for a bit and in the \nEnergy Committee today for a bit about energy policy. I guess I believe \nso strongly about this issue that I want to speak again perhaps from a \nlittle different vantage point.\n  I would like to talk today about the ``invisible priority'' that has \nexisted in the United States for practically the last 8 years. The \n``invisible priority'' has been the supply of reliable affordable \nenergy for the American people.\n  Let me say unequivocally that we have no energy policy because the \nInterior Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the \nEnergy Department all have ideological priorities that leave the \nAmerican consumer of energy out in the cold.\n  Making sure that Americans have a supply of reliable and affordable \nenergy, and taking actions to move us in that direction, is the \n``invisible priority.'' And that is giving the administration the \nbenefit of the doubt.\n  ``Not my job'' is the response that the Interior Department of the \nUnited States gives to the energy crisis and to America's ever-growing \ndependence upon foreign oil and, yes, I might say ever-growing \ndependence upon natural gas. The other alternatives, such as coal, \nnuclear, or other--``not my job.''\n  It is also the response that the Environmental Protection Agency \ngives when it takes actions, promulgates rules, and regulations. Their \noverall record suggests--let me repeat-- ``not my job,'' says the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  The Interior Department, making drilling for oil and natural gas as \ndifficult as possible, says, ``Don't bother us.''\n  ``It is not my job'', says the Department of Interior. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's job is to get a good environmental \npolicy based on sound science and be the enemy of an ideologically pure \nenvironmental policy at the expense of providing energy that we need.\n\n  My last observation: In summary, the ``Energy Department'' is an \noxymoron. It is anti-nuclear but pro-windmills. I know many Americans \nask: what is the Senator talking about? Nuclear power is 20 percent of \nAmerica's electricity. At least it was about 6 months ago. We have an \nEnergy Department for this great land with the greatest technology \npeople, scientists and engineers, that is pro-windmills and anti-\nnuclear.\n  I will say, parenthetically, as the chairman of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee on Appropriations, the last 3 years we put in a tiny bit \nof money for nuclear energy research and have signed it into law as \npart of the entire appropriation, and we do have a tiny piece of money \nto look into the future in terms of nuclear power. It is no longer \nnothing going on, but it is a little bit.\n  Boy, do we produce windmills in the United States. The Department of \nEnergy likes renewables. All of us like them. The question is, How will \nthey relieve the United States from the problem we have today? I guess \neven this administration and even the Vice President, who is running \nfor President, says maybe we have a crisis. Of course we have a crisis. \nThe Federal Government spent $102 million on solar energy, $33 million \non wind, but only $36.5 million on nuclear research, which obviously is \nthe cleanest of any approach to producing large quantities of \nelectricity.\n  Sooner or later, even though we have been kept from doing this by a \nsmall vocal minority, even America will look back to its early days of \nscientific prowess in this area as we wonder how France is doing it \nwith 87 percent of their energy produced by nuclear powerplants.\n  With all we hear about nuclear power from those opposed, who wouldn't \nconcede that France exists with 87 percent or 85 percent of its energy \ncoming from nuclear powerplants? They do, and their atmosphere is \nclean. Their ambient air is demonstrably the best of all developed \ncountries because it produces no pollution.\n  We have an administration that, so long as we had cheap oil, said \neverything was OK, and we couldn't even seek a place to put the residue \nfrom our nuclear powerplants, the waste product. We couldn't even find \na place to put it. We got vetoes and objections from the \nadministration. Yet there are countries such as France, Japan, and \nothers that have no difficulty with this problem; it is not a major \nproblem to store spent fuel.\n  Let me move on to wind versus nuclear. Nuclear produced 200 times \nmore electricity than wind and 2,000 times more than solar. As I \nindicated, solar research gets three times more funding than nuclear \nresearch and development.\n  The wind towers--we have seen them by the thousands in parts of \nCalifornia and other States, awfully strange looking things. They are \nnot the old windmills that used to grace the western prairie. They have \nonly two prongs. They look strange.\n  We are finding wind towers kill birds, based on current bird kill \nrates. Replacing the electric market with wind would kill 4.4 million \nbirds. I am sure nobody expects either of those to happen. However, \nmore eagles were killed in California wind farms than were killed in \nthe Exxon Valdez oil spill.\n\n  The Energy Department calls wind a renewable energy policy, and the \nSierra Club calls wind towers the Cuisinart of the air.\n  I will discuss the SPR selloff. For almost 8 years, energy has been \nthe ``invisible priority'' for the U.S. Government led by Bill Clinton \nand the current Vice President.\n  Incidentally, the Vice President, who is running for President, had \nmuch to do with this ``invisible priority;'' he was the \nadministration's gatekeeper on almost all matters that dealt with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and almost all matters that dealt with \nthe Department of the Interior in terms of the production of energy on \npublic land.\n  Let me talk about the SPR selloff for a minute. Treasury Secretary \nSummers warned President Clinton that the administration's proposal--\nnow decision--to drive down energy prices by opening the energy reserve \nwould be ``a major and substantial policy mistake.'' He wrote the \nPresident, and Chairman\n\n[[Page S9243]]\n\nGreenspan agreed, that using the SPR to manipulate prices, rather than \nadhering to its original purpose of responding to a supply disruption, \nis a dangerous precedent. Summers added that the move would expose us \nto valid charges of naivete, using a very blunt tool to address heating \noil prices.\n  American refineries today have to make so many different kinds of \nfuel because of environmental protection rules that no one would \nbelieve they would be capable of doing. They were running at 95 percent \nof capacity last week. We have not built a new refinery in almost 20 \nyears.\n  What has happened: America builds no energy, no refining capacity, \nbecause it is too tough environmentally to do that and live up to our \nrules and regulations. Yet you can build them in many other countries, \nand people are surviving and glad to have them--at least, new ones--\nbecause they are doing a great job for their economy and producing the \nvarious kinds of products that come from crude oil. Yet America, the \nbiggest user in this area, has built none.\n  If we take the supply of SPR out of SPR, it will still need to be \nrefined into heating oil. I have just indicated there is hardly any \nroom because there is hardly any capacity.\n  The invisible policies wait ominously on the horizon, boding serious \nproblems. We have found that natural gas produced in America, drilled \nfor by Americans, offshore and onshore, is the fuel of choice. Now we \nare not even building any powerplants that use coal as the energy that \ndrives them because it is too expensive, too environmentally rigorous, \nand nobody dares build them. They build them elsewhere in the world but \nnot in America.\n  We use natural gas, the purest of all, and say fill your energy needs \nfor electricity using natural gas. Guess what happened. The price has \ngone to $3.35 per cubic feet; 6 months ago it was $2.16. And the next \nprice increase is when the consumers of America get the bills in \nOctober, November, and December for the natural gas that heats their \nhouse and runs their gas stove because we have chosen not to use any \nother source but natural gas to build our electric generating tower \nwhen hardly any other country in the world chooses that resource. They \nchoose coal or some other product rather than this rarity of natural \ngas.\n  Now 50 percent of the homes in America are dependent upon natural \ngas. The companies that deliver it are already putting articles in the \nnewspaper: Don't blame us; the price is going up.\n  Who do you blame? I think you blame an administration that had no \nenergy policy and for whom energy was an ``invisible priority.'' It was \nan ``invisible priority'' because the solutions lay within EPA, the \nInterior Department, and an Energy Department that was paralyzed by an \nattitude of anti-production of real energy. That is the way they were \nleft by Hazel O'Leary, the first Secretary of Energy under this \nPresident, and Mr. Pena; and Bill Richardson is left with that residue.\n  Fifty percent of homes are heated by natural gas. I predict the bills \nwill be skyrocketing because we are using more and more of it because \nwe have no energy policy, and American homeowners are the ones who will \nsee that in their bills. When they start writing the checks with those \nincreases, they are going to be mighty mad at someone.\n  Don't get fooled. The candidate on the Democratic side, if the \nelection is not over by the time that happens, will blame those who \nproduce natural gas for they are related to oil and gas production. \nWould you believe, as we stand here today, 18 percent of the \nelectricity generated in America is produced by natural gas? Oh, what a \npredicament we have gotten ourselves into because we have an invisible \nenergy policy ruled over by an Environmental Protection Agency that \nnever asked a question about energy and an Interior Department that \ntakes property and land of the United States out of production.\n  I want to tell you a couple of facts. As compared to 1983, 60 percent \nmore Federal land is now off limits to drilling. On October 22, 1999, \nVice President Gore, in Rye, NH, said:\n\n       I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no \n     new drilling.\n\n  Then we have ANWR. It is off limits.\n  Offshore drilling is off limits. We could double our domestic oil \nsupply if we opened offshore drilling. Yet we will have more and more \ntransports hauling in refined and crude oil products, creating more and \nmore risk for our ports where they are bringing it in. Yet we maintain \nwe cannot do any more drilling because it is too dangerous.\n  The multiple-use concept in our public domain is, for all intents and \npurposes, practically dead. We have 15 sets of new EPA regulations. Not \none new refinery has been built since 1976. Now we have soaring \ngasoline prices. I understand my time is up.\n  Would Senator Kennedy mind if I take 1 more minute? I will wrap it \nup.\n  I will close with one more fact, and I will put the others in the \nRecord. Californians usually spend about $7 billion a year in \nelectricity. The price spikes were so dramatic that they spent $3.6 \nbillion in 1 month, the month of July--half of what they annually spend \nwas spent in 1 month.\n  Why? California is a big electricity importer. There is growing \ndemand. Silicon Valley companies are big energy users. Demand is up 20 \npercent in the San Francisco area over last year but no new capacity \nhas been built.\n  Environmental regulations make building a new plant nearly impossible \nin California. I predicted exorbitant home heating bills this coming \nwinter even while we were experiencing the gasoline price spikes in the \nMidwest.\n  It used to be that one type of gasoline was suitable for the entire \ncountry. There are now at least 62 different products. One eastern \npipeline handles 38 different grades of gasoline, 7 grades of kerosene, \n16 grades of home heating oil and diesel. Four different gasoline \nmixtures are required between Chicago and St. Louis--a 300 mile \ndistance. As a result of these Federal/local requirements, the industry \nhas less flexibility to respond to local or regional shortages.\n  We have 15 sets of new environmental regulations: Tier II gasoline \nsulfur, California MTBE phaseout; blue ribbon panel recommendations; \nregional haze regs; on-road diesel; off road diesel; gasoline air \ntoxics; refinery MACT II; section 126 petitions; gasoline air toxics; \nnew source review enforcement initiative; climate change; urban air \ntoxics; residual risk.\n  The MTBE groundwater contamination issue is going to make the \ngasoline supply issue even more complicated and reduce industry's \nflexibility to meet demand.\n  S. 2962 includes a wide array of new gasoline requirements that are \nboth irrelevant and detrimental to millions of American motorists. \nLegislation mandates the use of ethanol in motor fuel. This would cut \nrevenues to the highway trust fund by more than $2 billion a year.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy has projected that S. 2962 would \nincrease the consumption of ethanol in the Northeast from zero to \napproximately 565 million gallons annually.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, no energy policy is better than this \nadministration's energy policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9243-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9243-S9244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for months, Democrats and Republicans \nhave offered their unequivocal support for the H-1B high tech visa \nlegislation. In addition, Democrats have tried--without Republican \nsupport--to offer the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  Democrats have worked tirelessly to reach an agreement with the \nRepublicans to bring both of these bills to the floor for a vote. In \nfact, 2 weeks ago, Democrats were prepared to debate and vote on this \nlegislation as part of their high-tech visa bill, but our Republican \ncolleagues were unwilling to bring this measure to the floor and take a \nvote. And last Friday, Senator Reid asked Senator Lott for consent to \noffer the Latino and Immigrant Fairness bill and the Majority Leader \nobjected. No matter what Democrats have done, the Republican leadership \nhas been determined to avoid this issue and prevent a vote.\n  Our Republican friends tell us the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act \nis a poison pill--that it will undermine the H-1B high tech visa \nlegislation currently before the Senate. But, if Republicans are truly \nsupportive of the Latino legislative agenda, that cannot possibly be \ntrue.\n  If they support the reunification of immigrant families as well as \nthe immigration agenda set by the high tech community, we should be \nable to pass both bills and send them to the President's desk for \nsignature.\n  I have three letters from children who wrote to the President about \nthe significance of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act to families. \nI will read them quickly for the Senate.\n\n       Dear Bill Clinton.\n       My mom is a member of late amnesty.\n\n  That is the provision under which they would have received the \namnesty. Then the INS put out rules and regulations so they were unable \nto make the application. Then they went to court and found out later \nthey had legitimate rights and interests; they should have received \namnesty. Nonetheless, their rights were effectively eliminated by the \n1996 act. So now they are in serious risk of deportation.\n\n       Dear Bill Clinton.\n       My mom is a member of late amnesty. The Immigration wants \n     to report my mom. They don't want her here. She should have \n     permission to stay here because I was born here. Please don't \n     take her away from me and my brothers. I'll trade you my best \n     toy for my mom. Like my bike and my little collections of \n     cars. Don't take her away from me! Please.\n\n  Signed Ernesto\n  Here is another:\n\n       Dear President Clinton,\n       Please don't take my parents away from me. I love them very \n     much and my sisters too. We have been together for a lot of \n     years and I don't want to be separated now so please don't \n     separate us.\n\n  Signed Larry.\n\n       Hi. My name is Blanca. I'm 8 years old. I feel bad for my \n     parents. I want my parents to have their work permit back so \n     that they could work hard as they used to work to overcome \n     our lives in Los Angeles. I am willing to give you, Mr. \n     President, Bill Clinton, my favorite doll for my parents' \n     work permit.\n       Thank you!\n       Blanca\n\n  These are real situations. We are talking about families who ought to \nbe here as a matter of right under the 1986 immigration bill. Their \ncause has been upheld by the courts.\n  The 1996 act, intentionally or not, effectively wiped out those \nrights, and those individuals are subject to deportation. The children \nof these individuals are American citizens, born in this country, but \nthe parents are subject to deportation and live in fear of this.\n  The 1986 act was a result of a series of studies done by the Hesburgh \nCommission, of which I was a member and so was the Senator from \nWyoming, Mr. Simpson. There were a number of provisions in that act. \nIncluded in that act was an amnesty provision for people who had been \nhere for some period of time, who had worked hard and were part of a \ncommunity, trying to provide for their families. These letters are \nexamples of individuals who are now at risk, and we are attempting to \nresolve their family situation. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act \nis a family value issue.\n  I suggest, that if we are talking about families and about keeping \nfamilies together, that this particular provision is a powerful one.\n  The Chamber of Commerce and a long list of organizations including, \nthe AFL-CIO, the Anti-Defamation League, Americans for Tax Reform, and \nvarious religious organizations, support this legislation and have \npointed out the importance of it to the economy and the importance of \nit to keeping families together. They have been strong supporters for \nthese different provisions.\n  There were other amendments we hoped to offer as well. They dealt \nwith the training of Americans for jobs that would otherwise be filled \nby H-1B visa applicants. The average income for these jobs is $49,000. \nThese jobs require important skills. There are Americans who are ready \nand willing to work but do not have the skills to work in these \nparticular areas. We wanted an opportunity to offer amendments to deal \nwith this. This would not have required additional expenditures. We \nwere going to have a modest fee of some $2,000 per application that \nwould have created a sum of about $280 million that would have been \nused for skill training and work training programs, and it also would \nhave provided assistance to the National Science Foundation in \ndeveloping programs, particularly in outreach to women and minorities, \nwho are under-represented in the IT workforce.\n  There was some allocation of resources to reduce the digital divide, \nand others to expedite the consideration of these visas and make them \nmore timely, which are both important. That was a rather balanced \nprogram. Members can argue about the size and the allocation of \nresources in those areas, but nonetheless, it appears those provisions \nare relevant to the H-1B legislation. But we were prohibited under the \naction taken to even bring up these matters.\n  These issues can be resolved quickly. Under the proposal that was \nmade by Senator Daschle, we would have 1 hour of debate on the issue of \nskill training, which is enormously important. I personally believe we \nhave to understand that education is going to be a continuing life \nexperience. And for those who are in the job market, training and \neducation is going to be a life experience if they are to continue to \nget good jobs and enhance their skills.\n  These are all related to the subject at hand, but we have been denied \nthe opportunity to offer them. Instead, we have been virtually free of \nany serious work on the floor of the Senate since 10:15 this morning. \nAnother day has passed. Under the deadline that was established by the \ntwo leaders, the Senate will recess at the end of next week. Meanwhile, \nanother day has passed and we continue to be denied the opportunity to \nremedy a fundamental injustice. We continue to be denied the \nopportunity to bring up the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, and the \nopportunity to debate and reach a conclusion on these matters.\n  We are ending another day, but I wonder what the intention is and why \nwe continue to have this circus, so to speak. Americans are wondering. \nWe are in the last 2 weeks of this Congress, and we have passed two \nappropriations bills. What is happening on the floor of the U.S. \nCongress? What Americans have seen today is a long period of quorum \ncalls and the denial of Members to offer amendments in a timely way to \nreach a resolution of matters of importance, such as the H-1B \nlegislation and the Latino and Immigration Fairness Act.\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\n  I thought when we were elected to the Senate, it was a question of \npriorities and choices. When I first came to the Senate, I heard this \nwould be a great job if you didn't have to vote. I laughed when I first \nheard that. Now it is back. It is a great job if you don't have to \nvote. Now we are prohibited from voting and indicating our priorities \non H-1B and the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. It is unfortunate \nthat this is the case.\n  I am going to print in the Record a number of the letters that have \nbeen sent to me in support of these provisions. Some of the most moving \nones have been from some of the religious organizations.\n  I want to be notified by the Chair when I have 10 minutes remaining.\n  I have a letter from the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, \none of the very best refugee services. I have followed their work over \na long period of time. They are first rate. Here is what they wrote:\n\n       We understand and appreciate the needs of our country's \n     high-tech industries and universities for highly skilled \n     employees. We also feel, however, that legislation to benefit \n     the most advanced sectors of our society should be balanced \n     with relief for equally deserving immigrants who fled \n     persecution and political strife, seek to remain with close \n     family members or long worked equally hard in perhaps less \n     glamourous jobs. A comprehensive bill would be a stronger \n     bill vindicating both economic and humanitarian concerns.\n\n  They have it just about right.\n  I have another letter from the Jesuit Conference that says:\n\n       As you aim to make our immigration policy more consonant \n     with U.S. reality, we ask you to recognize the present \n     situation of thousands of immigrants from El Salvador, \n     Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti who fled political and \n     economic turmoil in their countries years ago and are now \n     living and working in the United States without permanent \n     immigration status. Many of those immigrants have built \n     families here and have strengthened the U.S. economy by \n     providing services to the manufacturing industry with the \n     essential low-wage workers they need. Congress has already \n     acknowledged the need to ameliorate the harsh effects of the \n     1996 immigration law. In 1997, it passed the Nicaraguan \n     Adjustment and Central American Relief Act that allowed \n     Cubans and Nicaraguans to become permanent residents, but \n     gave Salvadorans and Guatemalans limited opportunities to do \n     so.\n       Haitians and Hondurans were completely excluded from the \n     1997 law. In 1997, Haitians were given hope for equal \n     treatment and fairness by passage of the Haitian Relief Act, \n     but the spirit of the legislation was ultimately thwarted by \n     messy and slow lawmaking. It is time to remedy the unequal \n     treatment received by Central Americans and Caribbeans once \n     and for all.\n\n  The list goes on with group after group representing the great face \nof this nation pointing out the moral issues involved. Evidently they \nare not of sufficient and compelling nature that we are permitted to \nget a vote in the Senate. We are denied that opportunity, even though \nthere is support from a long list of groups that understand the \neconomic importance of this to certain industries. But the moral \nreasons, the family reasons, the sense of justice which are underlined \nby members of the religious faith I find compelling.\n  I believe deeply that by failing to act, we are denying ourselves a \ngreat opportunity to remedy a great injustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9245-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Friday night, an armed man walked \ninto a gay bar in Roanoke, VA and opened fire wounding six gay men and \nkilling another. According to news reports, the gunman asked for \ndirections to the closest gay bar and confessed that he was shooting \nthem because they were gay. This vicious shooting was clearly a crime \nmotivated by hate. The victims were targeted solely because of their \nsexual orientation. The message of hate against the gay community was \nclear.\n  Hate crimes are a national disgrace. They are an attack on everything \nthis country stands for. They send a poisonous message that some \nAmericans are second class citizens because of their race, their ethnic \nbackground, their religion, their sexual orientation, their gender or \ntheir disability. We need to take a strong and unequivocal stand \nagainst these despicable crimes whenever and wherever they happen.\n  This Congress has a real opportunity to make a difference in the \nfight against hate-motivated violence. Two months ago, as an amendment \nto the Defense Authorization Bill, a strong bipartisan majority of the \nSenate voted in favor of hate crimes legislation that will close the \nloopholes in current law. I pay tribute to the Presiding Officer for \nhis strong support of this endeavor. The House of Representatives has \nalso demonstrated its strong bipartisan support for passing this \nimportant legislation on the defense bill.\n  Despite this unique opportunity, the Republican leadership in the \nSenate and the House continue to oppose including the hate crimes \nprovisions in the conference report on the Defense Authorization Bill. \nBy removing hate crimes legislation from the bill, the Republican \nleadership will send a disturbing message about its lack of commitment \nto equal protection of the law and to civil rights for all Americans.\n  I urge Majority Leader Lott, Speaker Hastert, and the conferees on \nthe Defense Bill to do the right thing. Both the House and the Senate \nstrongly favor action this year against hate crimes. Now is the time \nfor the Congress to act by sending a clear and unmistakable signal to \nthe American people that the federal government will do all it can to \nsee that these despicable offenses are punished with the full force of \nthe law.\n  Just last Friday night, one of the most horrendous and horrific kinds \nof crimes was committed by an armed man walking into a gay bar in \nRoanoke, VA. Interestingly, Virginia has hate crimes legislation, but \nit is not based upon sexual orientation. So that is a major opening in \nthat law.\n  The legislation, which has passed in the Senate, would be able to \naddress this issue. We should have the opportunity to vote on it. It \nwas included in the defense authorization bill. It was strongly \nsupported on the instructions by the House of Representatives. That \nconference is still open. I am a member of that conference. It is one \nof the last remaining items. It ought to be included. If we need a \nreminder of why it is important to pass this legislation, we have that \ntragic circumstance.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thought I asked for a 10-minute warning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 1 minute 20 seconds prior to the 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I raise one other item of priority, and \nthat is the failure to take action on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  If we don't take action, this will be the first time in 35 years \nwhere the Senate has failed to take action on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I, again, bring to the attention of our \ncolleagues the commitment that was made by the majority leader going \nback to 1999.\n  On January 6, 1999, he said:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. . . . \n     For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act. That is important.\n\n  On January 29, 1999:\n\n       But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's \n     not going to just be words. . . .\n\n  On June 22, 1999:\n\n       Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in \n     the Congress this year. . . .\n\n  On February 1, 2000:\n\n       We're going to work very hard on education. I have \n     emphasized that every year I've been Majority Leader. . . . \n     And Republicans are committed to doing that.\n\n  On February 3, 2000:\n\n       We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act. . . . Education will be a high priority in this \n     Congress.\n\n  Here we are in May of 2000:\n\n       . . . I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. . . . But \n     education is number one in the minds of the American people \n     all across this country and every state, including my own \n     state. For us to have a good, healthy, and even a protracted \n     debate and amendments on education I think is the way to go.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator now has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask the Chair to let me know when I have 2 minutes remaining.\n  Final statement, July 25:\n\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\n\n       We will keep trying to find a way to get back to this \n     legislation this year and get it completed.\n\n  We have not been able to do that. We have been unable to do it. The \nbasic reason that we have been unable to do it is because those on this \nside wanted to offer a series of amendments--on smaller class size; \nwell-trained teachers in every classroom in America; help and \nassistance in the construction of schools, in the modernization of \nschools; afterschool programs; assurance that we are going to have \ntough accountability; that we are also going to reduce the digital \ndivide; and access for continuing education programs; but we also \nwanted to make sure that we were going to take the necessary steps to \nhelp make the schools safe and secure--and once that became evident, \nthen there was a different mood around here. Then that bill was \neffectively pulled by the majority. We do not yield on the issue of \nmaking sure we do everything we possibly can to make sure that schools \nare going to be safe and secure.\n  I draw attention to the tragic situation today in the Carter Woodson \nMiddle School in New Orleans, LA. Two teenage boys have been involved \nin another school shooting. Someone passed a gun in through a fence, \nand a young child used it. That child shot another child, and then he \ndropped the gun. Another child picked up the gun and shot the initial \nshooter. Both children are critically injured and in surgery. School \nhas been canceled for 3 days.\n  We have pressing education issues to address. We have pressing needs \nto try to make our communities safer and more secure and to remove the \nopportunities for children to acquire the weapons of destruction that \nend up taking other children's lives. But we are denied that. As a \nresult, we will not have the chance to reauthorize.\n\n  I say that because we heard from the majority leader that we are not \ngoing to take up education because we are not going to consider gun \nlegislation, in spite of the fact that in 1994, our majority leader co-\nsponsored gun legislation that was proposed by a Republican Senator. \nThey didn't complain then and say it was inappropriate or irrelevant at \nthat time. It is relevant to make sure that schools are safe and \nsecure.\n  I heard a great deal in the last few days about what is happening in \nthe schools of this country. All of us understand that we have \nchallenges that exist in our inner-city schools and many of our rural \nschools. We understand that. But I am kind of tired of people just \ntearing down the public school system. That has become rather \nfashionable. We have heard that in part of the national debate. I am \njust going to bring some matters to the attention of the Senate.\n  First are the number of students who are taking advanced math and \nscience classes--this is from 1990 to 2000. On precalculus, the number \nof students went from 31 to 44 percent; on calculus, from 19 percent to \n24 percent; on physics from 44 percent to 49 percent--a very \nsignificant increase in the number of children who are taking more \nchallenging courses in our high schools, according to the College \nBoard.\n  On this chart we see the growth in the percent of students who are \ntaking the scholastic aptitude tests. This went from 33 percent in \n1980, to 40 percent in 1990, and up to 44 percent. The trend lines are \nmoving up. It is not an enormous amount of progress from 40 percent to \n44 percent, but nonetheless it is showing an enhancement of the total \nnumber of children who are taking those tests.\n  Here are the SAT math scores. They are the highest in 30 years. This \nis important because we have many more children taking them.\n  It is one thing that we have a small number of children taking the \ntest, now we have expanded the number of children who are taking the \ntest nationwide. And what do we see? The SAT math scores are the \nhighest in 30 years. They have been moving up now consistently over the \nlast few years. Actually, in the early years, in terms of minorities, \nthe difference has actually diminished.\n  What we are saying is that there are some very important indicators \nthat are going in the right way. I was quite interested in hearing the \nGovernor of Texas talk about how our schools are in all kinds of \ntrouble and how it happens to be the Vice President's fault. But \nmeanwhile the States themselves have 93 cents out of every dollar to \nspend. They are the ones who have the prime responsibility to spend on \neducation. So the question comes down to, if they are the ones who have \nthe prime responsibility, is it fair enough to ask what these Governors \nhave been doing over this period of time?\n  Federal participation has been targeted on the neediest children. \nThey are the toughest ones to try and bring educational enhancement and \nacademic achievement to; they are the ones who are targeted. \nNonetheless, we see what has been enhanced. There have been some very \nnotable kinds of improvements. I think the State of North Carolina, \nunder Governor Hunt, has been one of the outstanding examples of total \nimprovement in how they have been dealing with troubled schools--those \nschools that have been facing challenges. Instead of the proposal that \nis offered by Governor Bush in this particular instance, which would \ndraw money from it and effectively close down that school, we find out \nhow they are handling that with Governor Hunt in North Carolina. In \nNorth Carolina they send in teams to help restructure both the \npersonnel and the curriculum. What is happening is major achievements \nand accomplishments.\n  Those are the kinds of ideas we ought to be embracing, the ones that \nhave been tried and tested and have been effective.\n  I want to show, finally, where we are going over a long period of \ntime in terms of enrollment. It will continue to rise over the next \ncentury. We are failing in this Congress to have a debate and a \nconclusion on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We had 6 days \nof discussion on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; 2 days for \ndebate only. Then we had eight votes--one vote was a voice vote; three \nwere virtually unanimous. So we had four votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have not had the full debate and discussion of what \nAmerican parents want. The fact is, projected over the next years, we \nare going to see virtually a doubling of the number of children, up to \n94 million. The children in this country and the parents deserve a \ndebate and discussion in the Senate on education. They have been denied \nthat. For the first time in the history of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, the Senate has failed to meet its commitment in this \narea.\n  I regret that, Mr. President. I wish we were debating that instead of \nhaving long quorum calls or lengthy speeches on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I retain the remainder of my time under cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9246-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9246-S9247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               H-1B VISAS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am tempted to jump into the debate about \neducation. The problem is not people taking courses. It is learning \nsomething from the courses you are taking.\n  I remind my colleagues that the SAT test changed several years ago so \nthat the minimum requirements to play football in division 1 went up \nfrom 700 to 840. You might think: Rejoice, we have raised academic \nstandards in athletics in college. The truth is, the test was \nrecentered so that everybody's score was raised by 140 points at that \nlevel. I do not look at Senator Kennedy's test scores and rejoice that \nwe now have achieved the level we had in 1961. Can you imagine any \nother debate in America where people say: We have great success; we \nhave equaled what America did in 1961.\n  I don't call that success. I call that failure. I call that failure \nbecause with all the resources we are spending, the fact that we have \nyet to achieve what we had achieved in 1961 is the greatest indictment \nof our education bureaucracy and a failed system that believes that \nFederal control and Federal money is the answer.\n  But I am not going to discuss that right now. I want to remind people \nof what has happened all day today here in the Senate. Our Democrat \ncolleagues say they are for the H-1B program. They say they want to \nallow high-tech workers to come into the country to help us continue to \ndominate the world in high-tech jobs so that\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\nwe can continue to have economic growth. They go out to Silicon Valley \nand say: We are with you. We are for the H-1B program. Yet they have \nspent all day filibustering it.\n  I don't understand it. You are either for it or you are against it. \nNow they say: Well, we are for it, but you have to pass a whole bunch \nof bills doing other things before we are going to let you adopt it.\n  I think it is time for those who need this bill to say to our \nDemocrat colleagues: If you are for the bill, let us vote on it.\n  We have all heard the cliche, ``if you have friends like that, you \ndon't need enemies.'' The point I want to remind people about is that \nall day long, the Democrats have been filibustering the H-1B program. \nSo if anybody thinks they are for it, the next time they stand up and \nsay they are for the program, I think the obvious thing to ask is, if \nyou are for it, why are you holding it up?\n  We need this bill because we want to keep America growing. I believe \nour Democrat colleagues are putting politics in front of people. This \nbill is important to maintain economic growth. It is important to \nmaintain our technical superiority.\n  I want people to know, with all the thousands of issues that have \nfound their way to the floor of the Senate this afternoon, that what \nthis debate is about is that our Democrat colleagues say they are for \nthe H-1B program, but they are preventing us from voting on it. If you \nare for it, let us vote on it then. If you are for it, end all these \nextraneous debates. If you want to debate giving amnesty to people who \nviolated America's law, then offer that somewhere else. Propose a bill, \nbut let us vote on the H-1B program.\n  Why do we need it? We need it because we want to maintain the \neconomic expansion that is pulling people out of poverty. We want to \nmaintain our technological edge. But we can't do those things if the \nDemocrats don't let us pass this bill.\n  If you are following this debate, don't be confused. They say they \nare for H-1B, the passage of this bill, but they are working every day \nto throw up roadblocks, to stop it, and to demand some payment for \nletting us pass it.\n  Let me make it clear, no tribute is going to be paid on this bill. \nThere is not going to be a deal where they get paid off to pass this \nbill. They go to California and to Texas and other places and say: We \nare for the high-tech industry. We are for the H-1B program. But the \ncold reality is that on the floor of the Senate today, we did not get \nto vote on it. We did not get to pass it. We did not make it law. We \ndid not do what we need to do to maintain this economic prosperity and \nto maintain our edge in the high-tech area because the Democrats are \nfilibustering H-1B. They say they are for it, but when it gets right \ndown to it, actions speak louder than words.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, I have listened to the debating \nback and forth on the issue of whether we do H-2A or H-1B.\n  I would like the American people to know that I think there is a lot \ngoing on behind the scenes. I think there is a lot that needs to happen \nbehind the scenes, and quickly because both of these issues are \nlegitimate issues. I believe America needs to make up its mind whether \nwe want the high-tech industry to remain an American industry. It is \nvital to our economic good, and we are all proud of it. We all want to \nencourage it. We need to help the high-tech industry by raising the H-\n1B visas temporarily. Otherwise, this is an industry that is prepared \nto move to other shores. I would rather they remain on our shores \nbecause I think it does us an enormous amount of good.\n  In my State, and in the State of the Senator from Nevada, and so many \nStates, we are seeing small businesses thrive with the development of \nthis new technology.\n  But I also want to speak to the need that we not abandon the cause of \nthe Hispanic and Latino workers. There are many proposals right now \naddressing their needs.\n  I happen to be a cosponsor of a bill, being argued by many on the \nother side of the aisle, which help these workers.\n  I think it is a crying shame that we have people living in the \nshadows of our society right now. These are people who are here; yes, \nmany of them illegally, probably well over a million, and maybe as many \nas 2 million people who are working primarily in agricultural \nindustries. These illegal workers have infiltrated many other \nindustries as well. They have been here for a decade and more. Many \npeople worry that if Congress addresses the worker shortage in \nagriculture, more illegal workers will come. I have news for them. They \nhave already come. They are here. They live among us and contribute to \nour economy. They are contributing to our tax rolls, frankly, without \nthe benefit of law.\n  I believe Republicans and Democrats ought to find a way as human \nbeings to reach out to the illegal farm worker community. If it isn't \nwith amnesty, there are ways we can allow them to be here legally.\n  A lot of people say we have no worker shortage in agriculture. I tell \nyou that we don't if you include all the illegals. But we owe something \nbetter to these workers and something better to their employers than an \nillegal system.\n  It is a crying shame, and we ought to be ashamed of it in the Senate, \nand do something about.\n  I know Speaker Hastert is working on this issue in the House. I \nbelieve our Senate leadership is working on it here.\n  But I am in a dilemma. I will admit it right here on the floor of the \nSenate. I want to help the high-tech industry by providing them with \nhighly skilled temporary workers, but I also want to help the workers \nin the agricultural industry who contribute to our economy and deserve \nour attention as well.\n  I hope that our leadership will respond quickly to the needs of the \nagricultural industry, as well as the dignity its workers deserve.\n  I see our leader is on the floor.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has voted 94-3 \nto invoke cloture with respect to H-1B legislation.\n  As Members know, cloture limits debate and restrains amendments to \ngermane amendments only.\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\n  With that in mind, I want all Senators to know that the Senate is \ngoing to conduct a final vote on this legislation. We are committed to \nthat, and we will get to that point even if it takes some more time. I \nhope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will allow this bill to \nbe voted on in the Senate. We have worked on it for months trying to \nget agreements to find a way to get conclusion. But it is time that we \nget to the conclusion and have a vote. I predict that the final vote on \nthis bill will be somewhat like the vote we had on the FAA \nreauthorization bill some 4 years ago. There was a lot of resistance. \nIt took a week to get to a final conclusion. The final vote was \nsomething like 97-3. I suspect that when we get to a final vote here it \nwill be 90-10, if we can ever get a vote on the substance.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would be happy to vitiate the cloture \nvotes on this bill if the Democrats would agree to that. I think we \ncould get a time agreement and have germane amendments that could be \noffered, and we could complete it in a reasonable period of time. \nPerhaps we should have gone through a procedural effort different from \nwhat we wound up with, but I really thought that once we had the \ncloture vote this morning, we would be able to get some sort of \nreasonable time agreement--6 hours or more if necessary--and get to a \nconclusion so that we could move on to other issues. I am still open to \nthat. I know Senator Reid has put a lot of time on it and had some \nremarks today. I certainly understand that. The issue or issues that \nhave been raised, I think, could be or would be considered on other \nbills and other venues. I hope we can work together to find a way to \ncomplete this important legislation.\n\n  Failing that, I had no alternative but to go this route.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't really understand because I haven't \nbeen there, but I have some idea of the burden that the Senator bears. \nI really do. It hurts me--I care a great deal about the Senator as a \nperson--to delay what I know the Senator believes is extremely \nimportant.\n  However, I believe we should resolve this quickly. We could have a \nvote in the morning on H-1B. We, the minority, don't oppose H-1B. As I \nhave said today, we want a vote on the amendment filed which we have \nbeen talking about all day. We will take 5 or 10 minutes a side and \nvote. We could be done with this legislation tomorrow at 2 o'clock in \nthe afternoon or 10 o'clock in the morning, whatever the leader \ndecided.\n  The debate we have had today has been constructive but, in a sense, \nunnecessary. I hope the majority leader, the man who has the burden of \ncontrolling what goes on here, especially in his waning days of this \nCongress, will meet with the caucus or make the decision unilaterally, \nor whatever it takes, and move on. Take care of the high tech people. \nAlso, take care of the restaurant workers and other people who also \nneed to be taken care of.\n  Again, we will take as little as 5 minutes on this amendment and have \na vote and go about our business.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond to Senator Reid, I think \nhe knows an effort was made a few days ago to see if we couldn't clear \na limited number of amendments--and either without identifying what \nthose amendments would be or identifying them--and we are not able to \nclear it. We couldn't clear it on this side.\n  We had Senators on this side that wanted to offer other issues, too, \nincluding the H-2A issue, involving how we deal with visas for \nagricultural workers. There are some Members who think we ought to do \nthat. There are others who didn't think we ought to do it on this bill. \nWhile I understand what the Senator is saying, I have not been able to \nclear that, and therefore I had to move forward to try to get the bill \nto conclusion.\n  I always enjoy working with the Senator from Nevada. He has been \nunfailingly fair and has worked with us to move a lot of issues. I \nappreciate that. I regret we couldn't get this cleared. I did try to, \nbut I couldn't get it done. So now we need to get to a conclusion on \nthe underlying.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I realize the leader, as Senator Reid said, has a lot of \nburdens. But today the House passed, by a vote of 415-3, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act--24 Republicans and all Democrats. Seventy-one \ncosponsored the Violence Against Women Act.\n  I wonder if the leader would be willing to agree to a 10-minute time \nagreement and we could vote on the Violence Against Women Act tomorrow \nor some day?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say we are going to try to clear that \nbill so we can get it into conference with the House. If we run into \nproblems, whatever they may be, it is my intent that legislation will \nbe on a bill that is signed into law before the end of this session. It \nis our intent to get it done. We will try a variety of ways to achieve \nthat. We will want to put it on a bill that we hope will be signed into \nlaw. We are not going to try to put it on something that might not be. \nWe will also be taking cognizance of what the House has done.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will allow me a moment, it may be helpful \nfor consideration to know I spoke with Republican leadership in the \nHouse on this issue, as well as here, and I am confident we can arrive \nat a bill that wouldn't require a conference.\n  So if the leader concludes at some point--and I take the leader at \nhis word and he always keeps it--the intention is to bring this up, I \nthink it may be possible we could literally pass a bill that would not \nrequire a conference. I raise that possibility.\n\n[[Page S9249]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. We will be working on that. I have had other bills that I \nthought would zip right through'', no problem. We have one from the \nFinance Committee, the FSC issue, which is very important to compliance \nwith the WTO decision. I am concerned now we may not be able to get \nthat cleared.\n  We are trying to get appropriations bills considered by the Senate. \nWe are trying to get an agreement to take up the District of Columbia, \nand we ran into a problem. I think maybe we are fixing that problem, \nbut I am saying to the Senator at this point it is hard to get \nclearances. We did get one worked on regarding the water resources \ndevelopment bill, and we are doing other issues.\n  This is a bill we will find a way to get done before this session is \nover. We will see what happens when we get it together and try to work \nthrough it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. As I indicated \nto the majority leader, this may be a unique bill not unlike the one my \nfriend, the Presiding Officer, has on sex trafficking on which he has \nworked so hard. This doesn't even have those problems. This has 415 \nMembers of the House voting for it; 3 voting against it; 71 cosponsors \nin the Senate. I am willing to predict, if we can agree to bring it up \nwithout amendment, we will get 85 to 95 votes. This is in the category \nof a no brainer. Henry Hyde is a sponsor of it. It is the Biden-Hatch \nbill.\n  The only point I make, and I will be brief, time is running out. The \nViolence Against Women Act expires this Sunday, September 30. It took \nme 8 years to get this thing done. It took 3 years after it was written \njust to get it considered. It took that long to get it passed. It has \nbeen in place for 5 years. There are no additional taxes required to \npay for this bill because there is a trust fund that uses the salaries \nthat were being paid to Federal officials who no longer work for the \nFederal Government; it goes into that fund.\n  As I said, if there was ever a no brainer, this one is it. Democrats \nlike it; Republicans like it. As Senator Herman Talmadge from Georgia, \nsaid to me one night regarding another issue when I walked into the \nSenate dining room: What's the problem, Joe? I guess I looked down. He \nwas chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I said: I'm having problems \nwith such and such an issue. He said: What is the problem, son? I \nrepeated; I thought he didn't hear me. He said: No, you don't \nunderstand. Republicans like it; Democrats like it. So just go and do \nit.\n  Well, that is where we are tonight. Democrats like the bill; \nRepublicans like the bill; the House likes the bill; the Senate likes \nthe bill; women like the bill; men like the bill, business likes the \nbill; labor likes the bill. So why don't we have the bill? And I have \nbeen hollering about this for 2 years now.\n  Hopefully, in light of what the majority leader said, maybe we will \nget to it. I was beginning to get a little despondent. I was even \nthinking of attaching the bill to the Presiding Officer's bill to make \nsure we get it done.\n  Today the Washington Post, in an editorial entitled ``Inexplicable \nNeglect,'' noted: ``There seems to be no good reason, practical or \nsubstantive, to oppose the reauthorization of the Violence Against \nWomen Act.''\n  I ask unanimous consent the totality of that editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Inexplicable Neglect\n\n       There seem to be no good reason, practical or substantive, \n     to oppose reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. \n     Originally passed in 1994, the act provides money to state \n     and local institutions to help combat domestic violence. It \n     is set to expire at the end of the month. Its reauthorization \n     has overwhelming bipartisan support. But House and Senate \n     leaders have yet to schedule a vote.\n       Versions of the bill have been favorably reported by the \n     judiciary committees of both chambers. Both would expand \n     programs that during the past five years have helped create \n     an infrastructure capable of prosecuting domestic violence \n     cases and providing services to battered women. Since the \n     original act was passed, Congress has devoted $1.5 billion to \n     programs created by it. The House and Senate bills differ, \n     but both would authorize more than $3 billion in further \n     support during the next five years. There is room to debate \n     the proper funding level relative to other priorities, a \n     matter which will be determined later by appropriators; and \n     the programs won't end immediately if the act lapses, because \n     funds have been approved for the coming year. But failing to \n     reauthorize would send the wrong message on an important \n     issue and, more important, could threaten future \n     appropriations.\n       With time in the 106th Congress running out, the Violence \n     Against Women Act may become a casualty for neglect rather \n     than of active opposition. But that's no comfort. Congress \n     ought to find the time to pass it before leaving town.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. The act of 1994 signaled the beginning of a national--and, \nI argue, historic--commitment to women and children in this country \nvictimized by family violence and sexual assault.\n  The act is making a real difference in the lives of millions of \nwomen. The legislation changed our laws, strengthened criminal \npenalties, and facilitated enforcement of protection orders.\n  I see my friend from California is here. When she was in the House of \nRepresentatives, she was one of the few people, man or woman, on either \nside that fought for 2 years to get this passed. I say to the Senator, \nthe majority leader indicated he plans on making sure that this gets \nvoted on this year. ``This year'' means the next couple of days or \nweeks. He says he wants to attach it to another bill.\n  I have been making the case, I say to my friend from California, that \nbased on the vote in the House, 415-3 and 71 Senators cosponsoring the \nBiden-Hatch bill here in the Senate, we should bring this up free-\nstanding. I was presumptuous enough to speak for you and others and say \nwe would agree to a 5-minute time agreement on the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for just a couple of quick \nquestions, and then I will allow him to, of course, finish his \nstatement.\n  First, I really came over to the floor when I saw the Senator took \ntime to speak on the floor about the Violence Against Women Act. It was \nmy great honor when I was in the House that he asked me to carry that \nbill those many years ago. I remember what a struggle it was. We \ncouldn't get that House at that time to recognize this problem.\n  I have heard my friend say many times, even the words ``domestic \nviolence'' indicate something that is different about this particular \nkind of violence; there is something that is domesticated about it. It \nis violence; it is anger; it is rape; it is hard to even describe what \nwomen, particularly women--although it does happen to men--go through.\n  So I took to the floor just to ask a couple of questions. In light of \nthe House passage with the kind of vote you rarely see over there--my \ngoodness, we hardly ever see a vote like that--and the fact it was \nfreestanding, wasn't attached to any other bill, doesn't my friend \nbelieve we should bring this up--I agree with him--with a short time \nagreement, 2 minutes a side? It doesn't matter to me. We have talked \nenough about this over the years.\n  Doesn't my friend agree it would be much better to just bring it up \nfreestanding instead of attaching it to another bill that some people \nmay have problems with? Why would we want to take this idea, this \nincredibly important idea that the Senator pushed through this \nCongress, and attach it to another bill that may be controversial?\n  Mr. BIDEN. In response to the question of the Senator, I fully agree \nwith her. I indicated that to the majority leader. To give the majority \nleader the benefit of the doubt, which I am prepared to do, I am not \nsure he understands how much support this has. When I indicated it \nshould be freestanding, he cited other bills he thought were going to \ngo through and they didn't go through and that was what he was worried \nabout.\n  He had to leave here necessarily and so didn't hear my response, \nwhich is, this is not like any other bill. I have not heard of any \nproblem. If any staff is listening--staffs of all one hundred Senators \nlisten to proceedings. They are assigned to listen to them. I ask \nanybody in the Senate who has any problem with the Biden-Hatch bill to \nplease come and let us know, to debate it. I do not know anybody who is \neven willing to debate it, to say they are not for it.\n  I would be dumbfounded, when in fact we bring this up, if we bring it \nup freestanding, if it didn't get everyone in the Senate voting for it. \nI would be astounded if it got fewer than 85 or 90\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\nvotes. I would not at all be surprised if it got 100 votes. But I am \nnot sure the majority leader understands that.\n  Frankly, what the Senator from California and I could do with \nSenators Hatch and Specter and others who are supportive of this bill--\nmaybe we can go see the majority leader tomorrow and lay out for him \nwhy we are so certain he will not get himself in a traffic jam if he \nbrings this bill up and why he doesn't need to attach it to anything \nelse.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right. I say to my friend, since we are strategizing here \nin front of the world----\n  Mr. BIDEN. The whole world.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We might want to see if we could get some signatures on a \nletter asking him to bring it up freestanding because it seems to me to \nbe the best thing to do.\n\n  Almost everything else we do, as my friend has pointed out, is \ncontroversial. But when you have a bill that has worked to increase the \nfunding for shelters and train judges and doctors and the rest, and as \na result we have seen a 21-percent decline in this kind of violence, it \nought to breeze through here.\n  But I really came to the floor to thank my friend for his leadership \nhere and his continued focus on this issue. A lot of us, as we get \nolder, start thinking: What have I done that I am really proud of? I \nknow my friend can truly say--and I can say it because I was fortunate \nhe involved me in this early on--this is one of the good things, one of \nthe great things.\n  I thank my friend and hope we can prevail on the majority leader to \nbring this up freestanding. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. I will follow onto that.\n  History will judge--and even that is a presumptuous thing, to think \nhistory will even take the time to judge, but some folks will judge \nwhether or not my career in the Senate accomplished anything. I know \nfor me, the single most important thing I have ever been involved in, \nand have ever done, and I care more about than anything I have ever \nbeen involved in, is this legislation. The thing I am most proud of is \nthat it has become a national consensus. It is not a Democratic issue; \nit is not a Republican issue; it is not a women's issue, not a men's \nissue. We have taken that dirty little secret of domestic violence out \nof the closet.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We have freed up, as a consequence of that, not only the \nbodies but the souls of millions of people and thousands and thousands \nof women.\n  As the Senator well knows, the hotline that she and Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Specter, and others have worked so hard to put in place, that \nhotline has received literally hundreds of thousands of calls--300,000 \nall told--tens of thousands of calls over the years since we passed \nthis, saying: Help me, help me. I am trapped.\n  I say to men who say: Gee, whiz, why don't women just walk away; Why \ndon't they just walk away from this abuse they get; There are a lot of \nreasons they don't, from being physically intimidated, to being \npsychologically intimidated, to having no place to go and no financial \nresources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield on this point?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think also--and I know he is so aware of this--another \nreason they do not walk away is their kids.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They fear for their kids. With all of the attention we \nhave paid to the entertainment industry--and the Chair has taken a lead \non this--to call to everyone's attention the excess of violence and the \nmarketing of too many R-rated films to kids, we know for sure, I say to \nSenator Biden, there is only one proven predictor that violence will be \npassed on to the next generation, and that is when the child sees a \nparent beat the other parent. We know that 60 percent or more of those \nkids are going to grow up in the same fashion.\n  I was going to leave now, but every time the Senator starts to bring \nup another point, it is so interesting, I am kind of spellbound. But \nthe bottom line is, with this bill we are helping women and children \nand families. We are standing for the values that I thought we all mean \nwhen we say ``family values.'' Again, my thanks.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I will not go through the whole of my statement. Let \nme just make a few other points.\n  I must say I compliment the Chair for his work and his, not only \nintellectual dedication but, it seems to me, passionate commitment to \ndo something about the international sex trafficking occurs. This is a \nwomen's issue internationally.\n  I suspect he feels the same way I feel about this legislation. I \nsuspect he believes there is probably not much more that he has done \nthat is as tangible and might affect the lives of people, that you \ncould look to, you could count, you could touch, you could see. When I \nsaid there are a lot of calls, literally over half a million women, \nover 500,000 women have picked up the phone and called, probably \nhuddled in the dark in the corner of their closet or their room, hoping \ntheir husband or significant other is not around, and said in a \nwhisper, ``Help me, help me''--given their name and address and said, \n``Help me.''\n  Think of that. Think of that. A half a million women have picked up \nthe phone. How many more have not picked up the phone?\n  The thing we should be aware of--and I know the Chair knows this--it \nis counterintuitive to think a child who watches his mother being \nbeaten to a pulp would then beat his wife or girlfriend later. That is \ncounterintuitive. Wouldn't you think that would be the last thing a \nchild would do? But the psychologists tell us it is the first thing. \nThey learn violence is a readily available and acceptable means of \nresolving power disputes.\n  You know, as the Chair I am sure knows--I am not being solicitous \nbecause of his work in this generic field--about 60 percent of the \npeople in prison today have been abused or were in families where they \nwitnessed abuse. This is not rocket science. I hope we get on with it.\n\n  There are a few things I want to mention. This bill does not merely \nreauthorize what we have done. I made a commitment, when I wrote this \nbill and we finally got it passed as part of the Biden crime bill, that \nI would go back and look at it--and others have, too, but personally \nsince I was so involved in it--and the parts that were working I would \ntry to beef up; the parts that were weak and did not make sense, I \nwould jettison. In the reauthorization, I would get rid of them.\n  I hope my colleagues will see we have kept that commitment. We take \nthe parts we found were lacking in our first bill and we, in fact, \nbeefed them up. We kept the police training, the court training, and \nall those issues. We kept the violent crime reduction trust fund which, \nby the way, gets about $6.1 billion a year from paychecks that are not \ngoing to Federal employees anymore and go into this trust fund. It \ntrains attorneys general and the rest.\n  What it does beyond all it has already been doing is it provides for \ntransitional housing for women. We have over 300,000, in large part \nthanks to Senator Specter from Pennsylvania, who has been so dedicated \nin his appropriations subcommittee to this. We have built all these new \nshelters. We do not send women to shantytowns. This is decent housing \nwith anonymity, giving them an opportunity to get out from under the \nmale fist abusing them, and they can bring their children with them.\n  Seventy percent of children on the street are homeless because their \nmothers are on the street, a victim of domestic violence. We realized \nthere is a gap here because there are so many women knocking down the \ndoor to get into these shelters to get out of abusive circumstances. We \ncan only keep them there for 30 days, 60 days, sometimes longer. They \ncannot go back home because their husband has either trashed the home \nor tried to sell the home or they have to move back in with the \nhusband. We tried to find some transitional housing that takes them \ndown the road for the next couple of years and gives them some hope.\n  We also beef up cross-State protection orders. For example: God \nforbid there is a woman staffer in ear shot and she lives in Virginia \nor Maryland or a nearby State and she went to the court and said: Look, \nmy husband or my boyfriend or this man has harassed me or beaten me, \nand I want him to\n\n[[Page S9251]]\n\nstay away from me. The court issues what they call stay-away orders, \nvictim protection orders.\n  That woman may work in the District of Columbia. Now she crosses the \nline from Virginia or Maryland into D.C., and she gets harassed. The \nman violates the order, and she goes to a D.C. cop or D.C. court. They \ndo not have any record of it. There is no record or they do not honor \nit. I am not talking about D.C. particularly. One State does not honor \nanother State.\n  What we have done is beefed up the requirement that States honor \nthese stay-away orders when women cross the line, literally cross a \nState line, cross a jurisdictional line.\n  There is a very well-known reporter at the Washington Post--although \nhe has written about this, I am not going to take the liberty of using \nhis name without his permission. His daughter was in a similar \nsituation in Massachusetts. She was abused by someone. A stay-away \norder was issued. She was in Massachusetts. She was in a different \ncounty. The man, in fact, violated the order. They went into a local \ncourt. The local court, because there were not computerized records, \ndid not know there was a State stay-away order.\n\n  By the way, the stay-away order says if you violate the order, you go \nto jail. If a man follows a woman into a different jurisdiction and the \njurisdiction knows that order exists and he violates the order, they \ncan arrest him and send him to jail on the spot because it is part of \nthe probation, in effect, to stay away. It is part of the sentence, if \nyou will; not literally a sentence. They can put him in jail.\n  George's daughter said: This guy has an order. He is not supposed to \nbe near me.\n  The judge said: We have no record of that order because they are not \ncomputerized for interchange of these records.\n  They walked outside the courtroom, and this man shot her dead. He \nshot dead on the spot the daughter of this famous Washington reporter \nbecause there was not the honoring, even within the State, of these \norders. We beefed that up.\n  By the way, in my State of Delaware, which has a relatively low \nmurder rate, 60 percent of all the people murdered in the last 2 years \nwere women murdered by their husband or their boyfriend. Did my \ncolleagues hear what I just said? Murdered by their husband or \nboyfriend. The vast majority of women who are murdered in America are \nmurdered by a significant other or their husband. This is not a game.\n  We are now in a position where there is, in fact, no authorization \nfor the continuation of this law for which we worked so hard. Come \nOctober 1, which is what, how many days? Today is the 26th. The point \nis, in less than a week, this law is out of business.\n  I have much more to say about this, but I will not take the time of \nthe Senate now. I am encouraged, I am heartened by what the House did. \nI am encouraged by what Senator Lott said to me today on the floor, and \nI look forward to the opportunity to convince the leader to bring this \nup in whatever form that will allow us to pass it because, again, this \nis not a Republican or Democratic issue. This literally affects the \nlives of thousands and thousands of women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9251-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9251-S9252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORTING DEMOCRACY IN SERBIA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on another matter which relates to another \nform of human rights, I wish to speak to the legislation we are going \nto bring up tomorrow, the Serbian Democratization Act of 2000. I am an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation. I am told that tomorrow we are \ngoing to get a chance to deal with this issue.\n  As everyone knows, Slobodan Milosevic is on the ropes. Despite \nMilosevic's massive systematic effort to steal Sunday's Yugoslav \nPresidential election, his state election commission had to admit that \nthe opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica won at least the plurality \nof the votes already counted; 48.22 percent to be exact.\n  According to opposition poll watchers, Kostunica in all probability \nactually won about 55 percent of the vote, which would have obviated \nthe need for a two-candidate second-round runoff with Milosevic, which \nnow seems likely.\n  It is still unclear whether the democratic opposition will go along \nwith this semi-rigged, desperation plan of Milosevic's to hang on by \nrigging the runoff. Even if Milosevic loses the runoff and is forced to \nrecognize the results of the election, he may still attempt to hold on \nto the levers of power through his control of the federal parliament \nand of the Socialist Party with its network of political cronies and \ncorrupt businessmen.\n  He may use the classic tactic of provoking a foreign crisis by trying \nto unseat the democratically elected, pro-Western government in \nMontenegro, a move I warned against on this floor several months ago.\n  We will have to wait and see for a few days before knowing exactly \nhow the situation in Yugoslavia is going to develop, but there is no \ndoubt whatsoever as to who the primary villain in this drama is. It \nwas, it is, and it continues to be Slobodan Milosevic, one of the most \ndespicable men I have personally met, and, as everyone in this Chamber \nknows, a man who has been indicted by The Hague Tribunal for war crimes \nand is the chief obstacle to peace and stability in the \nBalkans. Therefore, it should be--and has been--a primary goal of U.S. \nforeign policy to isolate Milosevic and his cronies, and to assist the \nSerbian democratic opposition in toppling him.\n\n  Earlier this year, with this goal in mind, the Serbian \nDemocratization Act of 2000 was drafted in a bipartisan effort. It is \nparticularly timely that the Senate consider this legislation tomorrow, \nprecisely at the moment when the Serbian people have courageously voted \nagainst Milosevic's tyranny that has so thoroughly ruined their country \nduring the last decade.\n  I would like to review the main provisions of the legislation we will \nbe voting on tomorrow and then propose alternative strategies for our \nrelations with Serbia, depending upon the outcome of the elections.\n  The act supports the democratic opposition by authorizing $50 million \nfor fiscal year 2001 to promote democracy and civil society in Serbia \nand $55 million to assist the Government of Montenegro in its ongoing \npolitical and economic reform efforts. It also authorizes increasing \nVoice of America and Radio Free Europe broadcasting to Yugoslavia in \nboth the Serbo-Croatian and Albanian languages.\n  Second, the act prescribes assistance to the victims of Serbian \noppression by authorizing the President of the United States to use \nauthorities in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to individuals living in Kosovo for relief, \nrehabilitation, and reconstruction, and to refugees and persons \ndisplaced by the conflict.\n  Third, the act we will vote on tomorrow codifies the so-called \n``outer wall'' of sanctions by multilateral organizations, including \nthe international financial institutions.\n  I talked about this with Senator Voinovich of Ohio, and we agreed \nthat we have to give the President more flexibility in this area.\n  Fourth, it authorizes other measures against Yugoslavia, including \nblocking Yugoslavia's assets in the United States; prohibits the \nissuance of visas and admission into the United States of any alien who \nholds a position in the senior leadership of the Government of \nYugoslavia of Slobodan Milosevic or the Government of Serbia and to \nmembers of their families; and prohibits strategic exports to \nYugoslavia, on private loans and investments and on military-to-\nmilitary cooperation.\n  The act also grants exceptions on export restrictions for \nhumanitarian assistance to Kosovo and on visa prohibitions to senior \nofficials of the Government of Montenegro, unless that Government \nchanges its current policy of respect for international norms.\n  The act contains a national interest waiver for the President. The \nPresident may also waive the act's provision if he certifies that \n``significant progress has been made in Yugoslavia in establishing a \ngovernment based upon democratic principles and the rule of law, and \nthat respects internationally recognized human rights.''\n  Clearly, if the democratic opposition triumphs in the current \nelections, the chances will increase dramatically that the President \nwill exercise this waiver option.\n\n[[Page S9252]]\n\n  We, the Congress, are saying to the people of Serbia that they are \nour friends, not our enemies. It is their Government, it is Slobodan \nMilosevic that is the problem, not the Serbian people.\n  Today in the Committee on Foreign Relations, we discussed at length \nwith Madeleine Albright what we should be doing about Serbia. I have \ndiscussed it as well with Senator Voinovich.\n  I see the Senator from Iowa is on the floor. He may be here for other \nreasons, but I know his keen interest in Serbia, the Serbian people, \nand the need for us to render assistance if they, in fact, move in the \ndirection of democracy.\n  The act calls for Serbia to cooperate with the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n  It also contains two important Sense of the Congress provisions. The \nfirst is that the President should condemn the harassment, threats, and \nintimidation against any ethnic group in Yugoslavia, but in particular \nagainst such persecution of the ethnic Hungarian minority in the \nSerbian province of Vojvodina.\n  The second voices support for a fair and equitable disposition of the \nownership and use of the former Yugoslavia's diplomatic and consular \nproperties in the United States.\n  Finally, in a move to facilitate the transition to democracy in the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, Congress authorizes the President to \nfurnish assistance to Yugoslavia if he determines and certifies to the \nappropriate congressional committees that a post-Milosevic Government \nof Yugoslavia is ``committed to democratic principles and the rule of \nlaw, and that respects internationally recognized human rights.''\n  Mr. President, the Serbia Democratization Act offers the President \nample flexibility in dealing with Serbia. If Milosevic should succeed \nin frustrating the will of the Serbian people by stealing this \nelection, the act will give the President of the United States a \ncomplete kit of peaceful tools to continue to try to undermine his \noppressive regime.\n  If, on the other hand, the democratic opposition led by Mr. Kostunica \nmanages to make its electoral victory stick, then the final provision \nof the act becomes the operative one in which we open up the spigot of \nincreased assistance to a democratic Serbia. Obviously, this would be \nthe preferred option.\n  Unfortunately, however, foreign policy is rarely so black and white. \nThe apparent winner of the election, Mr. Kostunica, is vastly \npreferable to Milosevic, but this may be a case of damning by faint \npraise. As many of my colleagues have heard me say on other occasions, \nI met Milosevic in Belgrade during the Bosnian war and called him a war \ncriminal to his face. Not only is he a war criminal, but he is \nthoroughly corrupt and anti-democratic.\n  Mr. Kostunica, by all accounts, is honest and democratic, a dissident \nin Communist times and a man with a reputation for probity. He seems, \nhowever, to represent a democratic, honest variant of a rather extreme \nSerbian nationalism.\n  His language describing NATO's Operation Allied Force has been \nstrident. Like Milosevic--and most other Serbian politicians--he calls \nfor the return of Kosovo to Belgrade's rule. But I am prepared to have \nan open mind on what he said. I can understand why, in running for \nPresident, being labeled by Mr. Milosevic as the ``dupe of the West'' \nand ``a puppet of the United States,'' he would feel the need to openly \ncondemn the United States.\n  I also do not have a problem with the fact that he may have used \ntough language with regard to Kosovo. There is a difference between \nwords and his actions. So I will have great problems with him if, in \nfact, he tries to again suppress the Kosovars, who, if he comes to \npower will probably increase their agitation for independence.\n  Moreover, Kostunica has repeatedly said that if he is elected he \nwould refuse to hand over The Hague those Serbs indicted by the \nInternational War Crimes Tribunal.\n  To a large extent Kostunica's criticism of Milosevic's policies \ntoward non-Serbs in the old Yugoslavia--Slovenes, Croats, Bosniaks, and \nKosovars--is that those policies resulted in four failed wars. There is \nno indication, for example, that Kostunica would cut off Belgrade's \nsupport for the radical Bosnian Serbs who on a daily basis are trying \nto undermine the Dayton Agreement.\n  Of course, as I have indicated earlier, Kostunica's policies must be \nseen in the context of an electoral campaign. Nonetheless, they do \nreflect what the traffic will bear. In other words, they reflect his \nview of contemporary Serbian society.\n  During the Bosnian war and after it, I often stated publicly that in \nmy opinion Croatian President Franjo Tudjman was cut from the same \ncloth as Milosevic--an aggressive, anti-democratic leader. The only \nreason I advocated helping to rebuild his army was because, unlike \nSerbia, Croatia did not represent a major threat to the region. In \nfact, in the summer of 1995 the reorganized Croatian Army provided the \nBosnian Army and the Bosnian Croat militia the support necessary to \nrout the Bosnian Serbs and bring all parties to the negotiating table.\n  Since Tudjman's death, Croatia has proven that beneath the surface of \nTudjman's authoritarianism a genuine, Western-style democratic body \npolitic survived. The newly elected government of President Stipe Mesic \nand Prime Minister Ivica Racan has utilized this mandate not only to \nenact domestic democratic reforms, but also to cut off support for the \nradical Herzegovina Croats who have done everything in their power to \nundo Dayton. The government has also taken the much less popular step \nof handing over to The Hague Tribunal several high-ranking Croats who \nwere indicted for alleged war crimes.\n  The United States has a great deal invested in a democratic, \nmultiethnic Bosnia, and if Serbia and the rest of the world is lucky \nenough to be rid of Slobodan Milosevic, we should not give him an ex \npost facto victory by applying a looser standard of behavior on his \nsuccessor than we have to Tudjman's successors in Croatia. To be blunt: \nrespect for Dayton and cooperation with The Hague Tribunal must be \nlitmus tests for any democratic government in Serbia.\n  I fervently hope that Mr. Kostunica emerges victorious in the \nYugoslav elections. If he does, the United States should immediately \nextend to him a sincere hand of friendship, with the assistance \noutlined in the pending legislation.\n  We should make clear to him that if he chooses to cooperate with us, \na ``win-win'' situation would result, with tangible benefits for the \nlong-suffering and isolated Serbian people who, we should never forget, \nwere this country's allies in two world wars during the twentieth \ncentury.\n  If, on the other hand, Mr. Kostunica comes to power and thinks that \nhis undeniable and praiseworthy democratic credentials will enable him \nto pursue an aggressive Serbian nationalist policy with a kinder face, \nthen we must disabuse him of this notion.\n  Should our West European allies choose to embrace a post-Milosevic, \ndemocratically elected, but ultra-nationalistic Serbia, then I would \nsay to them ``good luck; we'll concentrate our policy in the former \nYugoslavia on preparing democratic and prosperous Slovenia for the next \nround of NATO enlargement, on continuing to help reconstruct Bosnia and \nKosovo, and on supporting the democratic governments in Macedonia, \nCroatia, and Montenegro.''\n  Mr. President, the long-frozen, icy situation in Serbia appears \nfinally to be breaking up. I genuinely hope that Serbia is on the verge \nof democracy. I urge my colleagues to support the Serbia \nDemocratization Act of 2000 in order to enable our government \npeacefully to deal with any eventuality in that country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9252-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9252-S9254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND THE NOMINATION OF BONNIE CAMPBELL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to engage in a small colloquy with \nthe Senator. I tell my friend from Washington, I meant to get to the \nfloor before the Senator finished speaking on the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n\n[[Page S9253]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I know you switched from that to talk about our mutual \nenemy, Milosevic. But I wanted to, again, thank the Senator for his \nremarks and his strong support for the Violence Against Women Act. \nHopefully, we will get it over here from the House and pass in due \ncourse.\n  But I want to ask the Senator this question. The Senator knows the \nperson who heads the Violence Against Women Office in the Department of \nJustice, the former attorney general of the State of Iowa, Bonnie \nCampbell. She is the first and only person to head this office in all \nthese years. She has done a great job. I think both sides recognize \nthat.\n  I ask the Senator from Delaware, not only is it important to pass the \nViolence Against Women Act, to get it reauthorized, but isn't it also \nequally important to get people on the Federal bench who understand \nthis issue, who have worked on this issue, like Bonnie Campbell, whose \nnomination is now pending before the Judiciary Committee?\n  I ask the Senator, wouldn't it be a good thing for this country to \nhave someone with Bonnie Campbell's experience and her background and \nleadership in that office on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals? We \nhave had the hearings. She has been approved. We have had all the \nhearings. She is supported by the bar association, and by the Iowa \nPolice Association. She has broad-based support from both sides of the \naisle.\n  I ask the Senator, wouldn't her confirmation be good for this \ncountry? Wouldn't it be good to have someone in the Eighth Circuit like \nBonnie Campbell to make sure that the Violence Against Women Act was \nthoroughly enforced and upheld in our courts?\n  Mr. BIDEN. In response to my friend, the answer is absolutely yes. I \nwill tell him that because I was the one who authored that act. The \nPresident was very gracious in calling me and asking me who I would \nlike to see be the one to oversee that office. I recommended one, and \nonly one person, the former attorney general of the State of Iowa who \nhelped me write the act in the first instance, Bonnie Campbell.\n  I cannot tell you how disappointed, dismayed, and angry, quite \nfrankly, I have been, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, about the \nfact that--I will be blunt about it--our Republican colleagues in the \ncommittee and here will not allow this woman to have a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. The ABA rates her highly. As you said, everyone I \nknow in the Midwest who knows her, everyone, Republican and Democrat, \nlikes her.\n  I see my friend Slade Gorton on the floor. He knows a little bit \nabout the process of picking judges. I am confident he and others, as \nmy other colleagues in this room, would agree that qualified judges \nshould not be kept from being on the bench for politics.\n  People say: Well, this is the usual thing. We hold up these judges \nall the time near the end of a session when there is going to be a \nPresidential election.\n  That is flat malarkey. Ask the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, who is \na good friend of mine. He and I are on opposite ends of the political \nspectrum. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. My friend from \nIowa may remember this. We went into a caucus in the last 2 days when \nPresident Bush was the President of the United States. We were about to \ngo out of session, as we say in the Senate, and adjourn sine die. What \nhappened? We walked out onto the floor of the Senate. The Senator from \nTexas said he had several qualified judges in Texas, Republicans, and \nwhy were we holding them up.\n  I went to our caucus and said: We should pass those judges. Several \nin our caucus, two who are no longer here, said they opposed this. I \nsaid: Well, you are going to have to oppose me to do it. On the floor \nof the Senate, the last day, the last hour, the last session, we passed \nthose Texas judges.\n  I will never forget, the reason I love him so much, the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm--who I kiddingly call ``Barbwire'' Gramm; we kid each \nother--he walked up on the floor and put his hand out to me and he \nsaid: Joe, I want to thank you. You are one of the nicest guys here--\nthat is not true--but he said: You are one of the nicest guys here. I \nwant you to know one thing: I would never do it for you.\n  That is literally a true story, and he will repeat that story for \nyou. The truth is, it is not good politics. It is not good justice. It \nis not good anything, just to hold up somebody.\n  By the way, it has been held up for a year. It is not as if they have \nheld up this woman for the last 10 minutes, the last 10 days.\n  Mr. HARKIN. She has been in since earlier this year.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think the long answer to a very short question is, this \nis an outrage. It is an outrage that she is not on the bench now. And I \nwould hope that sanity would prevail.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator further, I had been hearing that one of \nthe reasons that it might be hard to get Bonnie Campbell through was, \nwell, this is a circuit court and it is right before an election. You \nhave to understand that in an election year, we don't confirm very many \ncircuit court judges. And so I looked back in the records. I wonder if \nthe Senator can attest to this, since he is on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I was chairman for every one of these people. I can \nprobably give you the names of all nine of these people.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In 1992, an election year, your committee confirmed nine \ncircuit court judges.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under a Republican President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. This is in the waning hours. This last one, we were \nliterally going out of session. I mean, we could have shut this place \ndown easily and walked away and pretended to have a clear conscience \nand said: We have done the Nation's work.\n  To be fair about it, there were three members of our caucus who \nripped me a new ear in the caucus for doing this, three of them. Two \nare gone; one is still around. No, we shouldn't do this. But this is an \nexample of what happens.\n  I have been here since 1972. It started in October of the 1972 \nelection. I wasn't here in the 1972 election. Then in the 1976 \nelection, they started to hold up judges. They started holding up \njudges somewhere around September. And then it moved; by the 1980 \nelection, they were being held up in July. This year, our Republican \nfriends started 18 months ago to hold these folks up.\n  This is what I am worried is going to happen, and I will end with \nthis. I am worried if we take back this place, we are going to have a \nlot of new women and men in this place say: Hey, the Republicans did \nthat. Mark my words. You will have a bunch of Democratic Senators who \nhave no institutional memory out here--if we have a Republican \nPresident and a Democratic Senate--holding up Republican judges a year \nout. This is bad, bad, bad precedent. This is not a good thing to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator further, is it true that we have only \nhad one circuit judge that was nominated this year, approved?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Best of my knowledge. I don't do it day to day as I did \nbefore. Coincidentally, he was from Delaware.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The other reason I have heard that they had had trouble \nwith Bonnie Campbell is that she wasn't nominated until early this \nyear.\n  I did some further research. Again, I ask the Senator, he has a lot \nof institutional knowledge. I looked up the circuit court judges in \n1992, to find out when they were nominated and when they were \nconfirmed. If we look, here is one who was nominated in January of \n1992, confirmed in September. Here is another one, January of 1992, \nconfirmed in February of 1992. We come clear down here, there is one \nhere, Timothy K. Lewis, nominated in September of 1992, hearing in \nSeptember, confirmed in October, right before the election, nominated \nby a Republican President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Look at Norm Stahl. Norm Stahl is in the first circuit, a \nNew Hampshire judge. Norm Stahl was nominated in March. I held the \nhearing in June, and in June of that year, 1992, election year, we \nconfirmed him. Justin Wilson didn't make it. There were reasons that \nthat occurred, by the way. I can understand a political party saying: \nHey, look, this nominee you have sent up is just not palatable to us. \nWe in the majority will not vote for that person. We are flat not going \nto. I got that. I understand that.\n  The deal I made honestly, straight up with President Bush--if he were \nhere,\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\nhe would acknowledge it, and my Republican colleagues on the committee \nwill tell you--I said: Here is what I will do. If there is someone who \nis absolutely, positively going to be a fire storm, if they are brought \nup, I will flag that person as soon as you name him, tell you what the \nproblem is, and tell you there is going to be a fight. And you can \ndecide whether you want to go forward or not go forward.\n  That is not the case with Bonnie Campbell. I ask the Senator a \nquestion: Has anyone come to him and said, the reason I am against \nBonnie Campbell is she is incompetent, or the reason I am against \nBonnie Campbell is because she doesn't have a judicial temperament, or \nthe reason I am against Bonnie Campbell is she is just not a mainstream \nperson? I mean, I haven't heard anybody tell me why they are against \nBonnie Campbell. Have you?\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I can tell the Senator, no one has ever said that to me. \nIn fact, Republicans in Iowa ask me why she is being held up. Why isn't \nshe going through? Mainstream Republicans are asking me that. \nEditorials are being written in Iowa papers saying the Senate ought to \nmove on this nominee and not hold her up. No, not one person has come \nup to me and said she is not qualified, not one person. When you were \nchairman and we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, we \nhad just the opposite of what we have now. Nine circuit court judges \nwere nominated in 1992 who were confirmed the same year.\n  Mr. BIDEN. In fairness, 5 of those 14 judges were not confirmed. We \nlaid out why, and there was a great controversy about it. We debated it \nand we laid out why.\n  Again, I never question the right of the Senate or an individual \nSenator to say, I do not want so-and-so on the bench and I will tell \nyou why and I will fight it.\n  I got that. I got that. I understand that. That is what the advise \nand consent clause is about. But what I don't get is: Hey, you know, \nshe is a Democrat, we are Republicans. We may win so we will not \nconfirm anybody until we determine whether we win.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't have all the memory the Senator has.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have too much of it, unfortunately.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am not on the Judiciary Committee. I had my staff look \nthis up. I did remember Mr. Carnes, who was highly controversial, a \nvery conservative assistant attorney general who was nominated that \nyear, a lot of civil rights groups opposed him because he was \nconsidered one of the nation's best attorneys in arguing for the death \npenalty. There was talk about him being insensitive to civil rights, \nregarding the death penalty. Even with all of that, we brought him out \non the floor and he passed in September of 1992. This was a \ncontroversial candidate. But, Bonnie Campbell has bipartisan support. \nSenator Grassley and I have been calling for a Senate vote on her \nconfirmation. She also has the bipartisan support from Democrats and \nRepublicans from my state of Iowa who worked with her when she served \nas Iowa attorney general.\n\n  (Mr. L. CHAFEE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. The point that is important to make for people who may be \nlistening is that we Democrats controlled the committee. I remember \nthis case explicitly because I got walloped. I ran for the Senate \nbecause of civil rights, and I got walloped because I held a hearing. \nEvery liberal group in the country castigated me for holding the \nhearing. And then we referred Judge Carnes to the Senate--get this--in \nSeptember of the election year; we confirmed a very controversial \njudge.\n  So, again, I understand the point the Senator is making. I just think \nthis is a terrible precedent that we are continuing to pile on here. I \nthink there is going to be a day when the nature of this place--as my \nRepublican friends told me: What goes around comes around. That is a \nnice political axiom, but it is not good for the courts. We have a \nfiduciary responsibility under the Constitution to deal with the third \ncoequal branch of the Government. We are not doing it responsibly. What \nthe Senator hasn't mentioned and won't go into because the floor staff \nwants me to make a request here--but that doesn't even count. The \nDistrict Court judges, where there are serious emergencies that exist \nbecause they cannot try the civil cases because the criminal cases are \nso backed up, we have held up for over a year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I apologize to my \nfriend from Washington who wants to speak. I did want to engage in this \ncolloquy because of the history of the circuit judges. But, more \nspecifically, everybody is now talking about the Violence Against Women \nAct and how it needs to be reauthorized. That must be done. Yet \neverybody is falling all over themselves. The House passed it today \nwith 415 votes in the House.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Isn't that amazing--415 votes? You only get that on \nresolutions, say, for motherhood and the flag.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You know what 415 votes says to me? It says that the \nHouse has given Bonnie Campbell an A-plus for her job in implementing \nthe provisions of the Violence Against Women's Act, since it became law \nin 1994. If you had somebody who had done a terrible job and given a \nbad impression of what the law was about, no, you would not have had \n415 votes. It is obvious to all that Bonnie Campbell has run that \noffice in an exemplary fashion, in a professional manner, and has \nbrought honor to the judiciary, to the Department of Justice, and to \nthis law that we passed here. Yet people are falling all over \nthemselves today talking about how the Violence Against Women Act needs \nto be reauthorized. It makes sense to put someone on the federal bench \nwho understands this important law because she helped write it and \nimplement it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. When she was attorney general, she helped write it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. She can help make sure that the law lives, that the \nViolence Against Women Act is enforced by the courts by being on the \nEighth Circuit. Yet she is being held up here. I will tell you, it is \nnot right. I hope when we take up the Violence Against Women Act, which \nI hope we do shortly, I will have more to say about this sort of split \npersonality that we see here. They say: Yes, we are for the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, but, no, don't put a woman on the circuit court who \nis widely supported, who has headed this office and did it in an \nexemplary fashion.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand the passion the Senator feels. \nIt is particularly difficult to go through this kind of thing when it \nis someone from your home State being so shabbily treated. I empathize \nwith him. I might say parenthetically, Bonnie Campbell--and we are not \nbeing colloquial calling her Bonnie. People might be listening and \nsaying, well, if this were a male, would they call him Johnny Campbell? \nBonnie Campbell is what she is known as. So we are not making up pet \nnames here. This is Bonnie Campbell.\n  This is a woman who has been an incredible lawyer, a first-rate \nattorney general in one of the States of the United States. She has run \nan office that, at its inception, didn't have a single employee, didn't \nhave a single guideline, didn't have a single penny when she came in. \nShe has done it in a fashion, as the Senator said, that the ABA thinks \nshe is first rate. Coincidentally, this will cause controversy, but we \nseem to hold up people of color and women for the circuit court. They \ntend to get slowed up more than others around here. It simply is not \nright. This is a woman who is as mainstream as they come, who is well \neducated. If anybody has a judicial temperament, this person has it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will join the Senator in whatever way he \nwants, as many times as he wants. I can't say enough good about \nAttorney General Campbell, and I have known her for a long time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9254-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9254-S9255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 3107\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Murray, and I believe others on both \nsides of the partisan divide, came to the floor to speak about the \nPipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. That bill was passed by the \nSenate unanimously. It resulted from a broad, bipartisan coalition that \nworked over a period of more than 1 year here in the Senate. It was \nsparked by my colleague and myself as a result of a terrible tragedy--\nan explosion in a gasoline pipeline in Bellingham, WA, that snuffed out \nthe lives of three wonderful young men, destroyed a magnificent park, \nand left physical damage that will be years in repair.\n  No individual involved in this debate got every single element in \nthat bill that he or she wished. Liquid and natural gas pipelines are \nvitally important to the Nation and the transportation of fuels.\n  Some thought renewal of the act would be somewhat weaker than the \npresent statutes. Others, myself included, wanted considerable \nstrengthening, particularly with respect to local input into the way in \nwhich such pipelines are managed in communities near homes, schools, \nparks, and the like.\n  The net result, however, is a pipeline safety renewal that is a \nconsiderable and significant improvement over the present act. There \nwill be more notice. There will be more severe penalties. There will be \ngreater opportunities for local comment and local participation.\n  But in spite of all of this work, in spite of the passage of this \nbill, little is happening in the House of Representatives.\n  The Bellingham Herald, the daily newspaper in the community subjected \nto this tragedy, pointed out just a little bit more than a week ago \nthat the passage of the Senate bill means nothing if it is not passed \nby the House.\n  Almost immediately, however, after the passage of the Senate bill, a \nnumber of Members of the House of Representatives began to place \nroadblocks in the way of the passage of the Senate bill, claiming it \nwasn't strong enough and it didn't do this, or it didn't do that, or it \ndidn't do something else.\n  The House of Representatives has had exactly the same opportunity to \ndeal with this issue as the Senate.\n  After a brief hearing a month or so after the accident took place, \nliterally nothing at all took place in the House of Representatives. \nMany of us here were led to believe that if the Senate bill were passed \nin its ultimate form, it would be taken up and easily passed in the \nHouse of Representatives--until these last-minute critics began to \npoint out what they consider to be the facts.\n  Talk is cheap. But talk doesn't create safer pipelines in the United \nStates. Those who oppose this bill have proposed nothing with the \nremotest chance of passage by the House of Representatives, much less \nthe Senate of the United States.\n  We have only a short time left. Those who criticize the bill as being \ntoo weak would do far better to pass the reforms that we have and \nattempt to build on them later than to destroy a bill which, if it does \nnot pass within the next few weeks, will have to begin its process all \nover again next year, with highly questionable prospects.\n  Believing that accomplishment is better than demagoguery and that a \nbill beats oratory any day, I come here to join with both Republican \nand Democratic colleagues to plead with the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives to take up the Senate bill, to debate it to the extent \nthe House wishes to do so, and to pass it so we can get it signed by \nthe President and enacted--which, incidentally, I am confident would \ntake place if the House were to pass the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9255-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a subject in a happy \nvein.\n  Yesterday, the President sent a letter to the Speaker and to our \nmajority leader on the subject of prescription drugs. In that letter he \nsaid:\n\n       I urge you to send me the Senate legislation to let \n     wholesalers and pharmacists bring affordable prescription \n     drugs to the neighborhoods where our seniors live.\n\n  That proposal was passed by the Senate a couple of months ago as an \namendment to the appropriations bill for the Department of Agriculture. \nIt was sponsored by my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, and by \nSenator Dorgan of North Dakota on the other side of the aisle, others, \nand myself. It is one of two or three ways that I have determined to be \nappropriate to reduce the cost of prescription drugs--not just to some \nAmericans, not just to seniors, not just to low-income seniors, but to \nall Americans--by ending, or at least arresting, the outrageous \ndiscrimination that is being practiced by American pharmaceutical \nmanufacturing concerns that are benefiting from American research and \ndevelopment aspects, benefiting from the research paid for by the \npeople of the United States through the National Institutes of Health, \nbut still discriminating against American purchasers by charging them \nfar more--sometimes more than twice as much--for prescription drugs \nthan they do for the identical prescription drugs in Canada, in the \nUnited Kingdom, in Germany, New Mexico, and elsewhere around the world.\n  The proposal by Senator Jeffords and others to which the President \nreferred at least allows our pharmacies and drugstores to purchase \nthese drugs in Canada or elsewhere when they can find identical \nprescription drugs at lower prices than the American manufacturers will \nsell them for to these American pharmacists, and to reimport them into \nthe United States and pass those savings on to our American citizens.\n  I don't often find myself in agreement with President Clinton, but I \ndo in this case. I believe he is entirely right to urge the Speaker and \nthe majority leader to include this proposal in the appropriations bill \nfor the Department of Agriculture or, for that matter, any other bill \ngoing through the Senate and the House of Representatives, so that we \ncan take this major step forward to slow down, at least, this \nunjustified discrimination in the cost of prescription drugs to all \nAmericans.\n  In this case, I join with the President in asking both the Speaker \nand our majority leader to use their best efforts, as I believe they \nare doing, to see to it that this overdue relief is in fact offered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9255-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9255-S9256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MICROSOFT APPEAL\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Supreme Court, with eight of nine \nJustices concurring, has just agreed with Microsoft that the notorious \nprosecution of Microsoft by the Department of Justice should go through \nthe normal process of appeal and should be determined and should be \nexamined by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals before \nany possible or potential appeal to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\n  This was a correct decision for a number of reasons, not the least of \nwhich is the complexity of the case and the length of the record which, \nunder almost any set of circumstances, would go through the normal \nappeals process.\n  The district court judge who decided the case and who has determined, \nI think entirely erroneously, that Microsoft must be broken up, wished \nto skip the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, stating that \nthis matter was of such importance that it should go directly to the \nSupreme Court. The real motivation of the lower court, I suspect, \nhowever, was the fact that one of the vital elements of the district \ncourt's decision is directly contradictory to a decision of just about \n2 years\n\n[[Page S9256]]\n\nago by the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals--the \nintegration of a browser/Microsoft operating system, a major step \nforward in technology and convenience for all of the purchasers of that \nsystem.\n  It is easy to understand why the district court judge didn't want to \ngo back to a higher court that he had directly defied, but that is no \njustifiable reason for skipping a District of Columbia Circuit Court of \nAppeals, and the Supreme Court, I am delighted to say, agrees with that \nproposition.\n  This matter is now on its normal way through the appeals process, a \nprocess that I am confident will justify, in whole or in major part, \nthe Microsoft Corporation, but only at great expense and at a great \nexpenditure of time.\n  Once again, I call on this administration or on its successor to see \nthe error of its ways in bringing this lawsuit in the first place. It \nhas been damaging to innovation in the most rapidly changing technology \nin our society, one that has changed all of our lives more profoundly, \nI suspect, than any other in the course of our lifetimes. It is \nimmensely damaging to our international competitiveness, encouraging, \nas it does, similar lawsuits by countries around the world that would \nlove to slow down Microsoft's competitive innovation so they could \ncatch up.\n  This is a field about which 10 or 15 years ago we despaired. Today, \nwe are clearly the world leaders. For our own Government to be hobbling \nour own competitiveness is particularly perverse. It opens up the \nproposition that innovations in software will have to be approved by \nJustice Department lawyers before they can be offered to consumers in a \nway that seems to me to be perverse.\n  It doesn't take a great deal of courage to say that I trust Microsoft \nsoftware developers in their own field more than I do Justice \nDepartment lawyers. At best, this was a private lawsuit, effectively \nbrought on behalf of Microsoft competitors but being paid for by the \ntaxpayers of the United States, where it should have, had it gone to \ncourt at all, been just that--a private lawsuit in which the Federal \nGovernment had little or no interest.\n  So, good news from the Supreme Court but news that can be greatly \nimproved by a new administration's fresh look and the dismissal of its \ncase in its entirety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9256-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of this \nbody to some very important negotiations that are underway.\n  We have debated many important subjects in this Congress as it comes \nto a close. Some of those larger subjects have been attempts to create \na prescription drug benefit for the Nation, how should we go about \ndoing that. We have had a long and intense debate on education. We have \nhad debates on the privacy issue, on bankruptcy reform.\n  One of the debates in which we have engaged that has captured the \nattention of many people around the Nation--Governors and mayors, local \nelected officials, chambers of commerce, outdoor enthusiasts, \nenvironmentalists across the board--is our debate about how we should \nallocate a small portion of this surplus; what is the proper way to \nallocate that to preserve and enhance the environment of our Nation.\n  As we begin this century, this is a debate worth having because if we \nmake the wrong decision, it will set us on a path where we will not be \nhappy to end up. We need to make a good decision now. We are in the \nvery crux of making that decision, as appropriators on both sides \ndebate the final outcome of this year's Interior appropriations bill.\n  I urge Senators to pay attention, as carefully as they can, to the \nongoing debates on how to allocate this funding.\n  On the one hand, there is a group saying: Let's just do more of the \nsame. As it comes to our environment, we don't need to do anything \ndifferently. Let's just do more of the same. Let's just give a little \nmore money to some Federal agencies to allocate the funding, and let's \njust come every year and decide year in and year out if we want to or \nif we don't, and how that money should be allocated.\n  There is a group of us called Team CARA, representing the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act, which has been negotiating since the \nbeginning of this Congress for a better way--a way that will bring more \nmoney to States on a guaranteed basis, money that Governors and mayors \nand local elected officials can count on--a revenue sharing bill, if \nyou will, for the environment. It is something that will turn in a \ndirection that will set us on a new and bold and exciting course.\n  I thank the President for his tremendous statements in the last \ncouple of days urging Congress to move in this direction. He is urging \nus to do everything we can to make CARA--the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act--the model. For the Record, I will submit something in \nwhich some States would be interested. I will be handing out this form \nlater today.\n  For instance, if we stick with the old method, Colorado would receive \n$3.6 million. It is a beautiful State with wonderful environmental \nneeds. They would get $3.6 million. Under CARA, if it is passed, \nColorado could receive $46 million a year, and the Governor and local \nelected officials would have input into how it was spent.\n  Let's take Georgia. Under this bill, this year they would get a \nmeasly $500,000. Under CARA, they would be guaranteed a minimum of $32 \nmillion a year.\n  Let's take Kentucky. Again, they would get a measly $500,000 in this \nyear's environmental bill. Under CARA, they would get a guarantee of \n$15 million a year for the preservation of open spaces, for wildlife \nconservation, and for the expansion of our parks and recreation.\n  Let's take Minnesota. Minnesota gets nothing in the bill being \nnegotiated. Under CARA, they would get $29 million a year.\n  I will be submitting the details because I am here to say let's allow \nthe best proposal to win in this debate. Let us fight it on its merits. \nLet us discuss the benefits of CARA. These are some of the benefits \nthat I am outlining.\n  New Jersey is one of our most populated States--the Garden State, a \nState that has just levied on its people a billion dollar bond issue to \npreserve open spaces. People in New Jersey feel strongly about this. \nUnder the old way, the way the negotiators are carving this up, they \nget a measly $875,000. Under CARA, they would receive $40 million a \nyear.\n  Let's take New York, another large State. They would get $2.8 million \nin the bill being negotiated, but if we stick to our guns and fight \nhard for CARA, New York could get $17 million a year. Most certainly, \nthe population deserves those kinds of numbers.\n  Finally, Washington State is a beautiful State, one that has a \nhistory of leading us in the environmental area. Washington gets fairly \nwell treated in this bill with $12.7 million. Under CARA, if we hold \ntrue to the principles, Washington State could get $47 million a year. \nThat is a big difference for the people of Washington State--from $12.7 \nmillion to $47 million. I could go on.\n  Under CARA, we have a guarantee. Under the current negotiations, the \nsame that has gone on for the last 25 years, there is no guarantee. I \nam saying that under CARA we can have full\n\n[[Page S9257]]\n\nfunding for the land and water conservation, help coastal States such \nas Louisiana that produce the necessary revenues. Under the old way--\nthe way that has been going on for 25 years--it has failed to meet our \nobligations and we get shortchanged. Under CARA, it is a real legacy. \nUnder the negotiations, the stage is set.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for giving me his remaining time. I see \nanother Senator on the floor who may want to speak on this issue. Let \nme conclude by urging the Members of the Senate to focus on these \nnegotiations, and I will be back later to give some more information on \nthis important issue. I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9257-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         YUGOSLAV ELECTIONS AND THE SERBIA DEMOCRATIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is clear that a fair vote count in this \nweekend's elections will result in victory for the candidate of the \nopposition forces. Mr. Vojislav Kostunica. The people of Yugoslavia \nclearly have voted for democratic change, and the time has come for \nYugoslavia's brutal dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, to have the decency \nto accept the will of his people and leave office peacefully.\n  Not surprisingly, Milosevic has indicated he intends to do no such \nthing. I fully expect him to do everything in his power to steal this \nelection to enable him to remain in power.\n  In order to support the majority of Serbs who voted for peace and \ndemocracy, I urge my colleagues to support the Serbia Democratization \nAct--legislation that I introduced more than 18 months ago--designed to \nundermine the murderous Milosevic regime and thereby support democratic \nchange in Serbia.\n  The Serbia Democratization Act calls for the United States to \nidentify and give aid to the democratic forces in Serbia opposing \nMilosevic's tyranny, including independent media and non-governmental \norganizations in Serbia. And it makes clear that unless and until there \nis a democratic government in Yugoslavia, the United States will \nmaintain the sanctions that we have in place today.\n  When the Serbian people finally gain the government in Belgrade that \nthey voted for this weekend--a government based on freedom, democracy \nand rule of law--I will lead an effort in Congress to ensure that the \nUnited States provides them with substantial support to assist their \nnation's democratic transition. I am hopeful that day will come soon.\n  I also commend the important role played by Montenegro in this \nweekend's elections. The decision by the vast majority of Montenegrins \nto boycott this election indicates the level of support in that \nrepublic for the course of democratic, free-market reforms proposed by \nPresident Djukanovic.\n  Montenegro deserves the support of the United States, and can serve \nas an example to the people of Serbia regarding the benefits they could \nenjoy in a post-Milosevic era.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9257-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                STOP TAX-EXEMPT ARENA DEBT ISSUANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, early this Congress, I introduced S. \n224, the Stop Tax-Exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act or STADIA for short. \nThis bill would end a tax subsidy that inures largely to the benefit of \nwealthy sports franchise owners, by eliminating tax-subsidized \nfinancing of professional sports facilities. This legislation would \nclose a loophole that provides an unintended Federal subsidy--in fact, \ncontravenes Congressional intent--and that contributes to the \nenrichment of persons who need no Federal assistance whatsoever.\n  This is the fourth time I have introduced this legislation, and I \nchose to keep the original effective date for a number of reasons. Most \nimportantly, because Congress intended to eliminate the issuance of \ntax-exempt bonds to finance professional sports facilities as part of \nthe Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n  At the same time, I recognized that a few localities may have \nexpended significant time and funds in planning and financing a \nprofessional sports facility, in reliance upon professional advice on \ntheir ability to issue tax-exempt bonds. Thus, in my original \nintroductory statement, I specifically requested comment regarding the \nneed for equitable relief for stadiums already in the planning stages.\n  In response to my request, several localities that had been planning \nto finance professional sports facilities with tax-exempt bonds came \nforward and provided the details necessary to craft appropriate \n``binding contract'' type transitional relief. Accordingly, I agreed to \nchange the bill in subsequent Congresses to exempt projects which had \nprogressed to a point where it would be unfair to stop them.\n  Now I have been contacted by others who make the case that retaining \nthe 1996 effective date creates a lack of certainty which is unhealthy \nfor communities desiring new stadiums and for the bond market itself. \nTherefore, I am inserting into the record my intention to modify the \neffective date if and when S. 224 is adopted in committee or on the \nSenate floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this language be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (b) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--The amendments made by this section shall \n     apply to bonds issued on or after January 19, 1999--\n       (2) Exception for construction, binding agreements, or \n     approved projects.--The amendments made by this section shall \n     not apply to bonds--\n       (A) The proceeds of which are used for--\n       (i) the construction or rehabilitation of a facility--\n       (I) if such construction or rehabilitation began before \n     January 19, 1999 and was completed on or after such date, or\n       (II) if a State or political subdivision thereof has \n     entered into a binding contract before January 19, 1999 that \n     requires the incurrence of significant expenditures for such \n     construction or rehabilitation and some of such expenditures \n     are incurred on or after such date; or\n       (ii) the acquisition of a facility pursuant to a binding \n     contract entered into by a State or political subdivision \n     thereof before January 19, 1999, and\n       (B) which are the subject of an official action taken by \n     relevant government officials before January 19, 1999--\n       (i) approving the issuance of such bonds, or\n       (ii) approving the submission of the approval of such \n     issuance to a voter referendum.\n       (3) Exception for final bond resolutions.--The amendments \n     made by this section shall not apply to bonds the proceeds of \n     which are used for the construction or rehabilitation of a \n     facility if a State or political subdivision thereof has \n     adopted a final bond resolution before January 19, 1999, \n     authorizing the issuance of such bonds. For this purpose, a \n     final bond resolution means that all necessary governmental \n     approvals for the issuance of such bonds have been completed.\n       (4) Significant expenditures.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (2)(A)(i)(II), the term `significant expenditures' means \n     expenditures equal to or exceeding 10 percent of the \n     reasonably anticipated cost of the construction or \n     rehabilitation of the facility involved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9257-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9257-S9258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to call attention to report language \nin the Senate version of the Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and related agencies appropriations bill, which directs the \nNational Endowment for Democracy (NED) to spend 20 percent of its \nbudget on ``nation-building'' activities in four war-stricken areas. \nThe language appears in the committee report. Although the language is \nnot mandatory, it sends a strong message that compliance by NED is \nexpected. I believe that the language should be deleted.\n  I would like to commend the work of the chairman and ranking member \nof the CJS Appropriations subcommittee, Senator Gregg and Senator \nHollings, for providing the NED with the resources to conduct its vital \nwork. NED and its four core institutes do an exceptional job in \nassisting grassroots democrats in more than 80 countries around the \nworld. NED has a strong track record, developed through involvement in \nvirtually every critical struggle for democracy over the past fifteen \nyears. NED supported the democratic movements that helped bring about \npeaceful transitions to democracy in Poland, the Czech Republic, Chile, \nand South Africa. NED is also playing an important role in supporting \nsome of the newer democracies, such as Indonesia, Nigeria, Croatia, and \nMexico.\n  I am very familiar with the work of NED and its institutes because I \nserve on NED's Board of Directors. I serve on the Board along with two \nother Senators and two Members of the House representing both political \nparties. We\n\n[[Page S9258]]\n\nare all concerned about the implications of the committee's report \nlanguage on the operations and mission of the Endowment.\n  In its report, the committee recommends that NED spend 20 percent of \nits entire budget to reconstitute civil governments in four seriously \ntroubled areas--Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kosovo, \nand East Timor. I am pleased to report that NED is working in each of \nthese areas on long-term democratic development. The Endowment is \nhelping non-governmental organizations, whose leaders are facing grave \ndanger to their personal safety, as they report on human rights abuses, \ncampaign for peace, and provide independent news and information to the \npublic.\n  We need to keep in mind that NED's mission is not to ``build'' \nnations or governments, but to help promote democracy. It does this \ngiving a helping hand to those inside other countries through financial \nand technical assistance to nurture a strong civil society and market \neconomy. NED is successful precisely because it targets its assistance \nto grassroots democratic groups.\n  I do not support the report language because its implementation would \nundermine NED's mission while forcing NED to withdraw scarce resources \nfrom other priority countries. It would be a mistake to divert NED's \nmodest budget to a handful of crisis situations which are already \nreceiving enormous sums of international assistance. It is unlikely \nthat the funds suggested in the report language could positively impact \nthese war-torn areas, but by consuming 20 percent of NED's budget, the \nlanguage will hamstring NED's ability to perform its work in many other \ncritical countries.\n  NED is a cost-effective investment that advances our national \ninterest and our fundamental values of democracy and freedom. It is \ncrucial, therefore, that we address the committee's goals in the report \nlanguage without compromising the ability of NED to carry out its work \neffectively.\n  I urge the Senate and House conferees on the Commerce, Justice, and \nState, the Judiciary, and related agencies appropriations bill to \ndelete the report language directing the NED to expend funds for \nnation-building activities in four troubled conflicts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9258-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REIMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in recent days we have heard a lot about \nvarious proposals that would allow for the reimportation of \nprescription drugs. Patients pay more for the prescription drugs in the \nUnited States than anywhere else in the world. That is just not right. \nThe Senate passed a proposal that Senator Jeffords and I authored that \nwould allow for the reimportation of prescription drugs as long as \ncertain steps are taken to ensure safety for American consumers.\n  I am pleased that the Administration and the Republican leaders in \nCongress have agreed to work together to take this common sense step \ntowards making prescription drugs more affordable for everyone. Dr. \nDavid Kessler, former head of the FDA, has sent me a letter expressing \nhis support for the Senate version of the reimportation language. Dr. \nKessler agrees that we must reform the current system so that American \nconsumers have access to safe and affordable medicine. At this time, I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from David \nKessler for the Dorgan-Jeffords proposal in which he expresses support \nfor our approach.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                               September 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     719 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: Thank you very much for your letter of \n     Sept. 12, 2000. I very much applaud the effort that you and \n     your colleagues are making to assure that the American people \n     have access to the highest quality medicines. As you know, my \n     concerns about the re-importation of prescription drugs \n     center around the issues of assuring quality products. The \n     Senate Bill which allows only the importation of FDA approved \n     drugs, manufactured in approved FDA facilities, and for which \n     the chain of custody has been maintained, addresses my \n     fundamental concerns. The requirement that the importer \n     maintain a written record of the chain of custody and batch \n     testing to assure the product is both authentic and \n     unadulterated provides an important safety net for consumers.\n       Let me address your specific questions. First, I believe \n     U.S. licensed pharmacists and wholesalers--who know how drugs \n     need to be stored and handled and who would be importing them \n     under the strict oversight of the FDA are well positioned to \n     safely import quality products rather than having American \n     consumers do this on their own. Second, if the FDA is given \n     the resources necessary to ensure that imported, FDA-approved \n     prescription drugs are the authentic product, made in an FDA-\n     approved manufacturing facility, I believe the importation of \n     these produces could be done without causing a greater health \n     risk to American consumers that currently exists. Finally, as \n     a nation we have the best medical armamentarium in the world. \n     Over the years FDA and the Congress have worked hard to \n     assure that the American public has access to important \n     medicine as soon as possible. But developing life saving \n     medications doesn't do any good unless Americans can afford \n     to buy the drugs their doctors prescribe. The price of \n     prescription drugs poses a major public health challenge. \n     While we should do nothing that compromises the safety and \n     quality of our medicine it is important to take steps to make \n     prescription drugs more affordable.\n       I applaud your efforts to provide American consumers with \n     both safe and affordable medicine.\n           Sincerely,\n     David A. Kessler, M.D.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9258-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ANGELS IN ADOPTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to again urge the Senate to \nbring up and pass, S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, \nVAWA II--we are quickly running out of time to reauthorize it. The \nauthorization for the original Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, \nexpires at the end of this week on September 30, 2000. There is \nabsolutely no reason to delay this bill which has overwhelming \nbipartisan support.\n  I have joined Senators from both sides of the aisle at rallies and \npress conferences calling for the immediate passage of this \nlegislation. The bill has 70 co-sponsors and is a significant \nimprovement of the highly successful original VAWA which was enacted in \n1994. There is no objection on the Democratic side of the aisle to \npassing VAWA II. Unfortunately, there have been efforts by the majority \nparty to attach this uncontroversial legislation to the ``poison pill'' \nrepresented by the version of bankruptcy legislation currently being \nadvanced by Republicans. I do not agree with stall tactics like this \none and believe we should pass VAWA II as a stand-alone bill, without \nfurther delay.\n  Yesterday, in New Mexico, where he was releasing funding made \navailable through VAWA for one of the country's oldest battered women's \nshelters, the President made a public plea for Congress to reauthorize \nVAWA, claiming, ``[T]his is not rocket science. Yes we're close to an \nelection . . . But it is wrong to delay this one more hour. Schedule\n\n[[Page S9259]]\n\nthe bill for a vote.'' I urge my colleagues to heed the cry of the \nPresident as he speaks on behalf of the almost 1 million women around \nthis country who face domestic violence each year.\n  The President called domestic violence ``America's problem'' and I \ncould not agree with him more. When we talk about reauthorizing the \nViolence Against Women Act we are not just talking about a big \nbureaucratic government program the effects of which we can't really \nsee. With this bill we are talking about reauthorizing critical \nprograms that have had a tremendous immediate effect on how this Nation \nhandles domestic violence and its victims. We are at risk of \njeopardizing what has been one of the most effective vehicles for \ncombating domestic violence if we let this law expire.\n  I have heard from countless people in Vermont that have benefitted \nfrom grant funding through VAWA programs. VAWA II ensures the success \nof these crucial programs such as the Rural Domestic Violence Grant \nprogram. These grants are designed to make victim services more \naccessible to women and children living in rural areas. I worked hard \nto see this funding included in the original VAWA in 1994, and I am \nproud that its success has merited an increased authorization for \nfunding in VAWA II. Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization \nEnforcement Grants have been utilized by the Vermont Network Against \nDomestic Violence and Sexual Assault, the Vermont Attorney General's \nOffice, and the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation \nServices to increase community awareness, to develop cooperative \nrelationships between state child protection agencies and domestic \nviolence programs, to expand existing multi disciplinary task forces to \ninclude allied professional groups, and to create local multi-use \nsupervised visitation centers.\n  I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence when I was \nthe Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. In those days, long \nbefore the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, there were \nnot support programs and services in place to assist victims of these \ntypes of crimes. Today, because of the hard work and dedication of \nthose in Vermont and around the country who work in this field every \nday, an increasing number of women and children are being aided by \nservices through domestic violence programs and at shelters around the \nNation. Lori Hayes, Executive Director of the Vermont Center for Crime \nVictim Services, and Marty Levin, Coordinator of the Vermont Network \nAgainst Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, have been especially \ninstrumental in coordinating VAWA grants in Vermont.\n  Let the Senate pass S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Act 2000 \nwithout further delay before its critical programs are jeopardized. It \nwas cleared for passage by all Democratic Senators two months ago and \nshould be passed today. It is past time to reauthorize and build upon \nthe historic programs of the Violence Against Women Act and do all that \nwe can to protect children from the ravages and lasting impact of \ndomestic violence.\n  A Washington Post editorial today called the failure to pass the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, ``inexplicable \nneglect,'' claiming that ``[t]here seems to be no good reason practical \nor substantive, to oppose reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct.'' That could not be more true Mr. President. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the editorial from the September 26, 2000 edition of the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 26, 2000]\n\n                          Inexplicable Neglect\n\n       There seems to be no good reason, practical or substantive, \n     to oppose reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. \n     Originally passed in 1994, the act provides money to state \n     and local institutions to help combat domestic violence. It \n     is set to expire at the end of the month. Its reauthorization \n     has overwhelming bipartisan support. But House and Senate \n     leaders have yet to schedule a vote.\n       Versions of the bill have been favorably reported by the \n     judiciary committees of both chambers. Both would expand \n     programs that during the past five years have helped create \n     an infrastructure capable of prosecuting domestic violence \n     cases and providing services to battered women. Since the \n     original act was passed, Congress has devoted $1.5 billion to \n     programs created by it. The House and Senate bills differ, \n     but both would authorize more than $3 billion in further \n     support during the next five years. There is room to debate \n     the proper funding level relative to other priorities, a \n     matter which will be determined later by appropriators; and \n     the programs won't end immediately if the act lapses, because \n     funds have been approved for the coming year. But failing to \n     reauthorize would send the wrong message on an important \n     issue and, more important, could threaten future \n     appropriations.\n       With time in the 106th Congress running out, the Violence \n     Against Women Act may become a casualty of neglect rather \n     than of active opposition. But that's no comfort. Congress \n     ought to find the time to pass it before leaving town.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9259-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NAKAMURA COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today the Washington state Congressional \ndelegation introduced bills in the House and in the Senate to honor a \nfallen hero, William Kenzo Nakamura, by designating the Seattle federal \ncourthouse in his honor. This brave soldier fought in Italy during \nWorld War II, and he died valiantly protecting his battalion. The day \nhe died, Mr. Nakamura had already risked his life and saved his combat \nteam by disarming an enemy machine gun stronghold. Mr. Nakamura should \nhave received the Medal of Honor for this act of bravery, but he did \nnot.\n  Even as this man's family was held in an internment camp in Idaho, he \nvolunteered for duty in the United States military, and he headed to \nItaly to serve his country. After his heroic and selfless deeds, Mr. \nNakamura was posthumously eligible for the Medal of Honor, but in World \nWar II the Army did not award Japanese-Americans the Medal of Honor. I \nwas pleased that earlier this year that twenty-two veterans, in similar \ncircumstances to and including Mr. Nakamura, received Medals of Honor \nfor their brave service in World War II. These men and their families \nwaited too long for proper recognition and appreciation, and these \nhonors are well deserved.\n  Though military heroes are often given medals for their service, the \npeople of Washington state would like to extend a special tribute to \nMr. Nakamura by naming the federal courthouse in Seattle in his honor. \nThis action has not only the support of the entire Washington \ncongressional delegation, but of local communities, veteran and \nmilitary retiree organizations, and by Medal of Honor recipients in the \nSenate, my friends Daniel Inouye and Bob Kerrey. To this outpouring, I \nadd my support and commitment to seeing this designation passed through \nthe Senate and acted into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9259-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nconcerning the IDEA Full Funding Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, before I begin, I would like to take this opportunity \nto thank\n\n[[Page S9260]]\n\nmy colleague, Senator Gregg, for his leadership on this important \nlegislation.\n  I rise today to lend my support to S. 2341, the IDEA Full Funding Act \nof 2000. One of my top priorities as a United States Senator has been \nto provide equal access to high quality public education for all \nchildren, including those with special needs. My commitment to \neducation for those with special needs began while I was a State \nlegislator and worked with the Oregon Disabilities Council to ensure \nthat children with special needs had equal access to a quality \neducation. I have continued that work here in the Senate, but realize \nthat we have a long ways to go.\n  This legislation takes a step in the right direction by funding the \nfederal mandates put forth in the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA). These federal funds will free up state and local \ndollars that can then be used in the classroom for new textbooks, \npencils and computers that are necessary for students to learn.\n  In 1954, the Supreme Court established, in Brown v. Board of \nEducation, that all children are guaranteed equal access to education \nunder the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. Despite this decision, it \nwas estimated that one million children with disabilities were being \ndenied access to public education. It was not until 1975, with the \npassage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, that equal \naccess to education was extended to children with disabilities.\n  The purpose of the 1975 IDEA legislation was ``[T]o assure that all \nchildren with disabilities have available to them, a free appropriate \npublic education which emphasizes special education and related \nservices designed to meet the unique needs, to assure the rights of \nchildren with disabilities and their parents or guardians are \nprotected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education \nof all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the \neffectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.''\n  With the passage of IDEA the federal government promised to assist \nstates with 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure \nfor disabled children. Based on the national average per pupil \nexpenditure for the year 2000, 40 percent of that average would \nrepresent approximately $2,500 per student. However, since 1975 the \nfederal government has not met this commitment. In fact, the federal \ngovernment gets an ``F'' in arithmetic in this instance, currently \npaying only 12.7 percent of the per pupil expenditure.\n  But, we are slowly working to improve this grade. In 1997, funding \nfor IDEA was only $2.6 billion. In the last 3 years, the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress has nearly doubled Federal funding on IDEA to \napproximately $4.9 billion. Although Congress has allocated more money \nto IDEA, current funding levels are 3.1 times less than what is needed \nto fully fund the forty percent commitment.\n  The purpose of providing this additional funding to the IDEA program \nis to free up local and state dollars. Currently state and local \neducation agencies have been forced to divert their precious resources \nto pay for the additional costs, due to federal mandates, of educating \nchildren with disabilities.\n  As a result, Washington has created an inappropriate and unfair \nconflict between children with disabilities and children without. We \nowe it to all children to live up to our responsibility and resolve \nthis conflict.\n  This important legislation would take a step in that direction by \nauthorizing funding for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act to reach the Federal government's goal of providing 40 \npercent of the national average per pupil expenditure to assist states \nand local education agencies with the excess costs of educating \nchildren with disabilities.\n  By steadily working to increase IDEA funding to $2 billion each year \nannually until 2010, Congress would increase opportunity and \nflexibility for local school districts to fund the programs that they \nfeel are best for their students, whether it be school construction, \nteacher training or smaller classrooms.\n  I was pleased to see that the House of Representatives passed similar \nlegislation, H.R. 4055, on May 3, 2000 with a 421-3 vote. It is my hope \nthat the Senate can follow the strong lead of the House and work for \nswift passage of this necessary legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9260-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9260-S9262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHILDREN'S PUBLIC HEALTH ACT OF 2000 AND THE YOUTH DRUG AND MENTAL \n                          HEALTH SERVICES ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate has now given \nfinal approval to an important bill that will go far toward improving \nour nation's public health infrastructure. I strongly support the \nChildren's Public Health Act of 2000 and the Youth Drug and Mental \nHealth Services Act (H.R. 4365). I hope this measure will soon pass the \nHouse as well.\n  It is obvious that we owe our colleagues on the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee a debt of gratitude for their \nperseverance and dedication in developing this landmark legislation \nwhich contains a number of provisions of importance to my home state of \nUtah.\n  The Children's Health Act of 2000 authorizes services that will \nensure the health and well-being of future generations of America's \nyoung people, our most precious resources. I can think of no more \nimportant aim for legislation than to focus on our nation's future by \nproviding for our children today.\n  At the same time, through the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services \nAct, the bill will address serious drug abuse issues that affect our \nyoung people, including a reauthorization of the important programs of \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA.\n  The SAMSHA reauthorization legislation will improve this vital agency \nby providing greater flexibility for states and accountability based on \nperformance, while at the same time placing critical focus on youth and \nadolescent substance abuse and mental health services. SAMHSA, formerly \nknown as the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, ADAMHA, was created in 1992 by Public Law 102-321, the \nADAMHA Reorganization Act. SAMHSA's purpose is to assist states in \naddressing the importance of reducing the incidence of substance abuse \nand mental illness by supporting programs for prevention and treatment.\n  SAMHSA provides funds to states for alcohol and drug abuse prevention \nand treatment programs and activities, and mental health services \nthrough the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, SAPT, and the \nCommunity Mental Health Services, CMHS, Block Grants. SAMHSA's block \ngrants are a major portion of this nation's response to substance abuse \nand mental health service needs.\n  As a proud supporter of H.R. 4365, I would like to highlight several \nprovisions that are based on legislation I have introduced.\n  First, this legislation reauthorizes the Traumatic Brain Injury Act, \na law I authored in 1996. By incorporating my bill, S. 3081, H.R. 4365 \nwill extend authority for the critical Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI, \nprograms from fiscal year 2001 through 2005.\n  Each year, approximately two million Americans experience a traumatic \nbrain injury; in Utah, 2000 individuals per year experience brain \ninjuries. TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in young \nAmericans, and the risk of a traumatic brain injury is highest among \nadolescents and young adults. Motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries, \nfalls and violence are the major causes. These injuries occur without \nwarning and often with devastating consequences. Brain injury can \naffect a person cognitively, physically and emotionally.\n  Important provisions added to the Traumatic Brain Injury Act through \nthis bill include extending the Center for Disease Control and \nPrevention's, CDC, grant authority so it may conduct research on ways \nto prevent traumatic brain injury. In addition, the legislation directs \nthe CDC to provide information to increase public awareness on this \nserious health matter. The bill also calls on the National Institutes \nof Health, NIH, to conduct research on the rehabilitation of the \ncognitive, behavioral, and psycho-social difficulties associated with \ntraumatic brain injuries.\n  Finally, the measure requests the Health Resource Services \nAdministration to provide and administer grants\n\n[[Page S9261]]\n\nfor projects that improve services for persons with a traumatic brain \ninjury.\n  I am grateful that the members of the HELP Committee were willing to \ninclude provisions from my legislation which reauthorizes this program. \nAs a result, many more deserving individuals whose lives and families \nhave been affected by a traumatic brain injury will now receive some \ntype of assistance or help.\n  Second, the Children's Health Act of 2000 also contains a bill that I \nauthored, S. 3080, to address a troubling yet treatable malady--poor \noral health in children.\n  I have been concerned over reports from Utah and around the country \nabout the poor oral health of our nation's children. A recent General \nAccounting Office report on dental disease calls tooth decay the most \ncommon chronic childhood disease and finds that it is most prevalent \namong low-income children.\n  Eighty percent of untreated decayed teeth is found in roughly 25 \npercent of children, mostly from low-income and other vulnerable \ngroups. Decay left untreated leads to infection, pain, poor eating \nhabits, and speech impediments.\n  Compounding this problem is that there are few places for these \nchildren to receive care. Low provider reimbursement rates from state-\noperated dental plans make it financially impossible for private \npractitioners to treat all the children in need. Today, there are a \nlarge number of children living in either the inner city or in rural \nareas who do not have a place to seek treatment. Our goal should be to \nprovide access to dental care to children, regardless of where they \nlive.\n\n  Therefore, I am pleased to report that the ``Children's Public Health \nAct of 2000'' contains provisions to address this serious health \nconcern. The legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to establish a program funding innovative oral health \nactivities to improve the oral health of children under six years of \nage. The legislation will make these grants available to innovative \nprograms at community health centers, dental training institutions, \nIndian Health Service facilities, and other community dental programs.\n  Let's face it, dental disease in young children is a significant \npublic health problem. And this legislation is the beginning of a \ncoordinated, inter-agency strategy that will assist states and \nlocalities reduce this preventable problem.\n  I am also pleased that we are considering the Youth Drug and Mental \nHealth Services Act. This legislation addresses many important issues \nsuch as drug abuse and mental health services and how to treat these \nserious problems within our society.\n  One issue that is highlighted in this bill is the prevention of teen \nsuicide. This is an issue that is rapidly becoming a crisis not only in \nmy State of Utah but throughout the entire country.\n  Young people in the United States are taking their own lives at \nalarming rates. The trend of teen suicide is seeing suicide at younger \nages, with the United States suicide rate for individuals under 15 \nyears of age increasing 121 percent from 1980 to 1992. Suicide is the \nthird leading cause of death for young people aged 15 to 24, and the \nfourth leading cause of death for children between 10 and 14. In 1997 \nstudy, 21 percent of the nation's high school students reported serious \nthoughts about attempting suicide, with 15.7 percent making a specific \nplan.\n  Utah consistently ranks among the top ten states in the nation for \nsuicide, and we continue to see increases in suicide rates among our \nyouth. In Utah, suicide rates for ages 15 to 19 have increased almost \n150 percent in the last 20 years. According to the CDC, Utah had the \ntenth highest suicide rate in the country during 1995-1996 and was 30 \npercent above the U.S. rate. This is one statistical measure on which I \nwant to see my state at the bottom.\n  Although numerous symptoms, diagnoses, traits, and characteristics \nhave been investigated, no single fact or set of factors has ever come \nclose to predicting suicide with any accuracy.\n  I have worked on legislation that will help us determine the \npredictors of suicide among at risk and other youth. We need to \nunderstand what the barriers are that prevent youth from receiving \ntreatment so that we can facilitate the development of model treatment \nprograms and public education and awareness efforts. It also calls for \na study designed to develop a profile of youths who are more likely to \ncontemplate suicide and services available to them.\n  This bill also contains provisions from S. 1428, the Methamphetamine \nAnti-Proliferation Act of 2000. I introduced this bill because of \nevidence that methamphetamine remains a threat to the entire country, \nand particularly to my state of Utah. Elements of this bill are also \ncontained in S. 486 as it was reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Throughout my travels in Utah, I have heard from state and local law \nenforcement officials, mayors, city councils, parents, and youth about \nthe seriousness of the methamphetamine problem.\n  Recently, I held two field hearings in Utah during which I heard \ndirectly from constituents whose lives had been affected by \nmethamphetamine. I listened to a mother tell a heart-wrenching story of \nhow her beloved daughter had become addicted to methamphetamine and how \nshe feared for her daughter's life. She tearfully described her \ndaughter as being two people, the person ``who has the values of our \nfamily, who is kind hearted and loving; and then there's our daughter \nwho's the meth user, and they are completely opposite.''\n  I also heard testimony from the wife of a methamphetamine addict. I \nheard how her husband's methamphetamine addiction destroyed their \nmarriage and their financial security. Painfully, she explained how her \nhusband put her and their infant son at risk when he decided to \nmanufacture methamphetamine in their home. She had no choice but to \nreport his activities to the police, a decision that undoubtedly will \nhaunt her for the rest of her life.\n  Methamphetamine use is an insidious virus sapping the strength and \ncharacter of our country. We need to attack it. This bill contains the \ntools to help the people of Utah and the rest of the country fight this \nwicked drug.\n  This bill bolsters the Drug Enforcement Agency's, DEA, ability to \ncombat the manufacturing and trafficking of methamphetamine by \nauthorizing the creation of satellite offices and the hiring of \nadditional agents to assist State and local law enforcement officials. \nMore than any other illicit drug, methamphetamine manufacturers and \ntraffickers operate in small towns and rural areas. And, unfortunately, \nrural law enforcement agencies often are overwhelmed and in dire need \nof the DEA's expertise in conducting methamphetamine investigations.\n  To address this problem, the bill authorizes the expansion of the \nnumber of DEA resident offices and posts-of-duty, which are smaller DEA \noffices often set up in small and rural cities that are overwhelmed by \nmethamphetamine manufacturing and trafficking. There are also \nprovisions to assist state and local officials in handling the \ndangerous toxic waste left behind by methamphetamine labs.\n\n  To counter the dangers that manufacturing drugs like methamphetamine \ninflict on human life and on the environment, the bill imposes stiffer \npenalties on manufacturers of all illegal drugs when their actions \ncreate a substantial risk of harm to human life or to the environment. \nThe inherent dangers of killing innocent bystanders and, at the same \ntime, contaminating the environment during the methamphetamine \nmanufacturing process warrant a punitive penalty that will deter some \nfrom engaging in the activity.\n  Finally, the bill increases penalties for manufacturing and \ntrafficking the drug amphetamine, a lesser-known, but no-less dangerous \ndrug than methamphetamine. Other than for a slight difference in \npotency, amphetamine is manufactured, sold, and used in the same manner \nas methamphetamine. Moreover, amphetamine labs pose the same dangers as \nmethamphetamine labs. Not surprisingly, every law enforcement officer \nwith whom I have spoken agreed that the penalties for amphetamine \nshould be the same as those for methamphetamine. For these reasons, the \nbill equalizes the punishment for manufacturing and trafficking the two \ndrugs.\n  While we know that vigorous law enforcement measures are necessary to \ncombat the methamphetamine scourge, we also recognize that we must act \nto prevent our youth from ever starting\n\n[[Page S9262]]\n\ndown the path of drug abuse. We also must find ways to treat those who \nhave become trapped in addiction. For these reasons, the bill contains \nseveral significant prevention and treatment provisions.\n  The comprehensive nature of this bill attacks the methamphetamine \nproblem on several fronts. It bolsters our law enforcement efforts to \ncrack down on traffickers, provides treatment and prevention funding \nfor our schools and communities, and authorizes much needed resources \nfor cleaning-up the toxic pollutants left behind by methamphetamine lab \noperators.\n  I have been working for over a year with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle and in both Houses of Congress to pass this important \nlegislation. It is important to highlight that, as part of this \nprocess, there have been changes to the bill made in response to \nlegitimate complaints raised by my colleagues and constituents. For \nexample, provisions relating to search warrants and the Internet have \nbeen deleted because of these concerns.\n  Overall, this bill represents a bipartisan effort that will result in \nreal progress in our continuing battle against the scourge of \nmethamphetamine.\n  Yet another important anti-drug abuse provision in this bill we are \nadopting today is the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, or the DATA bill. \nWith the bipartisan cosponsorship of Senators Levin, Biden and \nMoynihan, I introduced S. 324 last year, and I am pleased that this \nbill has been inserted in H.R. 4365.\n  In 1999, as part of the comprehensive methamphetamine bill, S. 486, \nthe DATA bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee and adopted by \nthe full Senate. The DATA bill also was included in the anti-drug \nprovisions that were adopted as part of the bankruptcy reform \nlegislation, S. 625, that passed the Senate last year. I hope the third \nSenate passage is indeed the charm.\n  The goal of the DATA provisions is simple but it is important: The \nDATA bill attempts to make drug treatment more available and more \neffective to those who need it.\n  This legislation focuses on increasing the availability and \neffectiveness of drug treatment. The purpose of the Drug Addiction \nTreatment Act is to allow qualified physicians, as determined by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, to prescribe schedule III, IV \nand V anti-addiction medications in physicians' offices without an \nadditional Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, registration if \ncertain conditions are met.\n  These conditions include certification by participating physicians \nthat they are licensed under state law and have the training and \nexperience to treat opium addicts and they will not treat more than 30 \nin an office setting unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nadjusts this number.\n  The DATA provisions allow the Secretary, as appropriate, to add to \nthese conditions and allow the Attorney General to terminate a \nphysician's DEA registration if these conditions are violated. This \nprogram will continue after three years only if the Secretary and \nAttorney General determine that this new type of decentralized \ntreatment should not continue.\n  This bill would also allow the Secretary and Attorney General to \ndiscontinue the program earlier than three years if, upon consideration \nof the specified factors, they determine that early termination is \nadvisable.\n  Nothing in the waiver policy called for in my bill is intended to \nchange the rules pertaining to methadone clinics or other facilities or \npractitioners that conduct drug treatment services under the dual \nregistration system imposed by current law. And nothing in this bill is \nintended to diminish the existing authority of DEA to enforce \nrigorously the provisions of the Controlled Substances Act. Doctors and \nhealth care providers should be free to practice the art of medicine \nbut they may never violate the terms of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  In drafting the waiver provisions of the bill, the Drug Enforcement \nAgency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse were all consulted. Secretary Shalala has provided her \nleadership in this area. As well, this initiative is consistent with \nthe announcement of the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, General Barry McCaffrey, of the Administration's intent to work \nto decentralize methadone treatment.\n  In 1995, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of \nSciences issued a report, ``Development of Medications for Opiate and \nCocaine Addictions: Issues for the Government and Private Sector.'' The \nstudy called for ``(d)eveloping flexible, alternative means of \ncontrolling the dispensing of anti-addiction narcotic medications that \nwould avoid the `methadone model' of individually approved treatment \ncenters.''\n  The Drug Addiction Treatment Act--DATA--is exactly the kind of policy \ninitiative that experts have called for in America's multifaceted \nresponse to the drug abuse epidemic. I recognize that the DATA \nlegislation is just one mechanism to attack this problem, and I plan to \nwork with my colleagues in the Congress to devise additional strategies \nto reduce both the supply and demand for drugs.\n  These provisions promote a policy that dramatically improves these \nlives because it helps those who abuse drugs change their lives and \nbecome productive members of society. We have work to do on heroin \naddiction. For example, a 1997 report by the Utah State Division of \nSubstance Abuse, ``Substance Abuse and Need for Treatment Among \nJuvenile Arrestees in Utah'' cites literature reporting heroin-using \noffenders committed 15 times more robberies, 20 times more burglaries, \nand 10 times more thefts than offenders who do not use drugs. We must \nstop heroin abuse in Salt Lake City and in all of our nation's cities \nand communities.\n  In my own state of Utah, I am sorry to report, according to a 1997 \nsurvey by the State Division of Substance Abuse, about one in ten \nUtahns used illicit drug in a given survey month. That number is simply \ntoo high; although I cannot imagine that my colleagues would not be \nsimilarly alarmed if they looked at data from their own states. We must \nprevent and persuade our citizens from using drugs and we must help \nprovide effective treatments and systems of treatments for those who \nsuccumb to drug abuse.\n  I hope that the success of this system will create incentives for the \nprivate sector to continue to develop new medications for the treatment \nof drug addiction, and I hope that qualified doctors will use the new \nsystem and that general practice physicians will take the time and \neffort to qualify to use this new law to help their addicted patients. \nI am proud to have worked with the Administration and my colleagues on \na bipartisan basis in adopting the DATA provisions and creating this \nnew approach that undoubtedly will improve the ability for many to \nobtain successful drug abuse treatment.\n  In closing, I also want to commend the many staff persons who have \nworked so hard on this bill. These include Dave Larson, Anne Phelps, \nJackie Parker, Marcia Lee, Kathleen McGowan, Leah Belaire, David \nRussell, Pattie DeLoatche and Bruce Artim in the Senate and Marc Wheat \nand John Ford in the House.\n  I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues in the \nHouse to pass it as quickly as possible. It is a bill that will raise \nawareness on children's health issues and, at the same time, assist \nthose who have specific needs with regard to alcohol abuse, drug abuse \nand mental health issues. It is a good consensus product and is worthy \nof our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9262-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9262-S9263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, September is Sea Cadet Month, and \ntoday I rise to pay tribute to the Naval Sea Cadet Corps. Sea Cadet \norganizations exist in most of the maritime nations around the world. \nHaving recognized the value of these organizations, the Department of \nthe Navy requested the Navy League to establish a similar program for \nAmerican youth.\n  Since their creation in 1958--and their federal incorporation by \nCongress in 1962--the Naval Sea Cadets Corps has encouraged and aided \nAmerican youth ages 13-17, training them in seagoing skills and \ninstilling within them patriotism, courage, and commitment. By teaching \nAmerica's youth the important role of maritime service in national \ndefense and economic stability, the Corps has produced responsible and \ncapable leaders.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Donna Sytek as she retires as Speaker of the New Hampshire \nHouse of Representatives. Donna's dedication to public service is \nremarkable, and she has done much in her twelve terms in the House to \nmake life better for the people of our great state.\n  Throughout her nearly quarter century as a member of the House, Donna \nhas worked tirelessly on issues about which she feels passionate: \ncrime, juvenile justice reform and education. She has shepherded \nnumerous bills into law, including legislation that established the \nDepartment of Corrections, legislation that guarantees truth in \nsentencing; and an anti-stalking law. She also authored two amendments \nto the New Hampshire Constitution, including one to limit abuse of the \ninsanity defense in 1984 and another to earmark sweepstakes revenues to \neducation in 1990. Donna has held many leadership positions during her \ndistinguished career as well. She has been active for many years in the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures and currently sits on their \nexecutive committee. She is also a former chairwoman of the New \nHampshire Republican Party and a past president of the National \nRepublican Legislators association.\n  Donna's position in the state legislature has allowed her to travel \nthe world to promote New Hampshire. She has visited Germany, England, \nTaiwan, Latvia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Israel to learn about their \ncultures and economies while helping them learn a little more about our \ngreat state.\n  Donna and her husband John have been fixtures in their hometown of \nSalem since they moved there almost 30 years ago. They devote their \ntime and energy to many local organizations including the Salem Boys \nand Girls Club and the Salem Visiting Nurse Association.\n  Donna's dedication to her community and the legislature are \nexemplary, and her accomplishments have not gone unnoticed. The editors \nof New Hampshire Editors Magazine named her ``the most powerful woman \nin New Hampshire'' in 1997.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Speaker Sytek for her tremendous \nservice to the people of New Hampshire and wish her good health and \nhappiness in her retirement. I am proud to call her my friend, and I am \nhonored to represent her in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9263-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9263-S9264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EDWARD MASTERS\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I would like to extend my appreciation \nand congratulations to former Ambassador Edward Masters on the occasion \nof his retirement on October 18 from his position as President of \nUnited States-Indonesia Society.\n  During his 30-year career in the Foreign Service, in which he reached \nthe senior rank of Career Minister, Ambassador Masters served as U.S. \nAmbassador to Indonesia and Bangladesh and Deputy Chief of Mission to \nThailand. He also held posts in India and Pakistan and an assignment as \ndirector of the State Department's Office of East Asian Regional \nAffairs that involved policy coordination for the entire area.\n  Indonesia figured prominently in both Ambassador Masters' diplomatic \nand private sector careers. As Political Counselor of the United States \nEmbassy in Jakarta from 1964-68, he worked on reconstructing U.S. \nrelations with Indonesia at a very difficult time. This included \nclosing out our economic aid, information and Peace Corps programs \nbecause of the highly adverse political situation in Indonesia. Toward \nthe end of that period, he worked with various elements of the U.S. \nGovernment and NGOs to reinstitute some of those programs but to do so \nin a way commensurate with Indonesian culture and sensitivities. He is, \nin fact, particularly known in both Indonesia and the United States for \nhis ability to work effectively in the Indonesian environment.\n  As United States Ambassador from late 1977 until the end of 1981, one \nof his major responsibilities was managing a large and very important \neconomic aid program. He worked in particular and in detail on the \nProvincial Development Program, the programs to expand Indonesia's food \ngrain production and enhance human resources development. Toward the \nend of his tour he organized various elements of the mission to develop \nprograms to get the U.S. Government more effectively behind the \nprograms to develop Indonesia's private sector and increase cooperation \nbetween that sector and the United States.\n  In 1994, Ambassador Masters was instrumental in forming the United \nStates-Indonesia Society. The Society is the preeminent institution in \nthe United States devoted to developing a broad range of programs aimed \nat developing greater awareness and appreciation about Indonesia and \nthe importance of the U.S.-Indonesia relationship in all major sectors \nin the U.S. Ambassador Masters has given briefings throughout the \nUnited States to academic institutions and other interested groups. He \nhas provided witness testimony on numerous occasions before the Senate \nand House Foreign Relations Subcommittees on East Asian and Pacific \nAffairs on numerous occasions. He has organized conferences and other \nforums bringing Indonesians and Americans together to discuss short and \nlong-term issues of mutual concern. One such conference he organized \nlast October in cooperation with the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington \nDC., brought some of the most impressive, influential, and \nknowledgeable individuals from Indonesia and the United States to \ndiscuss the 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries \nand to provide policy suggestions to both governments on how to \nstrengthen ties in the new millennium.\n  On September 28, 1998 the Indonesian government recognized Ambassador \nMasters' valuable contributions and decorated him with the Bintang \nMahaputra Utama, the second highest\n\n[[Page S9264]]\n\naward given by the Government of Indonesia for his commitment and \ncontribution to forging closer ties between the U.S. and Indonesia.\n  As Chairman, I would also like to recognize and say thanks Ambassador \nMasters for the valuable work he has done. When I began my tenure as \nChairman, Indonesia was--unfortunately--largely ignored in the United \nStates. Despite being the fourth largest country in the world, and the \nlargest Muslim country, its accomplishments and its importance to the \nUnited States as a friend and ally were largely overlooked and reduced \nto occasional tongue-lashings regrading Timor Timur.\n  I made changing that situation a top priority of my chairmanship. And \nmy job was made a lot easier by Ambassador Masters.\n  The United States-Indonesia Society has greatly shaped, increased \nawareness and knowledge and provided support to those of us in the \nUnited States, including both houses of Congress, the administration \nand the government, the press, NGO community, academia and the \npopulation at large on the importance of Indonesia to the United \nStates. Over the last two years this Society has become even more \nessential in helping the United States to understand the complex \ndynamics involved in moving from an authoritarian regime to the third \nlargest democracy in the world.\n  I understand why Ambassador Masters has decided to step down as \nPresident; he has earned the respite. But those of us concerned with \nthe U.S.-Indonesia relationship will surely miss him and his steady \nhand at the tiller. I can only profoundly thank him for his many years \nof public service to the United States, and to his life-long commitment \nto improving relations between the United States and Indonesia. As the \nIndonesians would say, ``Terima kasih banyak.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9264-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OBSERVANCE OF ROSH HASHANAH\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT.

But, as \nSenator Mack prepares to leave this institution, I can say with pride \nthat we achieved our goal of working together--and our staffs have \nworked together--on behalf of Floridians.\n  In offering this personal salute to Senator Mack, I also wish to \npraise the dedication and professionalism of his staff. On behalf of my \nfamily and my staff, I thank Senator Mack's staff--past and present--\nand wish them continued success.\n  During his two terms in the United States Senate, Senator Mack \nassembled a talented staff which made multiple contributions to public \nservice.

A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to permit a State to register a Canadian pesticide for \ndistribution and use within that State; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                      Pesticide Harmonization Bill\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, during the first few months of the 106th \nCongress in early 1999, I introduced a pesticide harmonization bill--S. \n394. Today, I am introducing a revised version of that legislation. The \nneed for this legislation has not changed.\n  Last year, I pointed out that when the U.S.-Canada Free Trade \nAgreement came into effect, part of the understanding on agriculture \nwas that our two nations were going to move rapidly toward the \nharmonization of pesticide regulations. However, we have entered a new \ndecade--and century, no less--and relatively little progress in \nharmonization has been accomplished that is meaningful to family \nfarmers.\n  Since this trade agreement took effect, the pace of Canadian spring \nand durum wheat, and barley exports to the United States have grown \nfrom a barely noticeable trickle into annual floods of imported grain \ninto our markets. Over the years, I have described many factors that \nhave produced this unfair trade relationship and unlevel playing field \nbetween farmers of our two nations. The failure to achieve \nharmonization in pesticides between the United States and Canada \ncompounds this ongoing trade problem.\n  Our farmers are concerned that agricultural pesticides that are not \navailable in the United States are being utilized by farmers in Canada \nto produce wheat, barley, and other agricultural commodities that are \nsubsequently imported and consumed in the United States. They \nrightfully believe that it is unfair to import commodities produced \nwith agricultural pesticides that are not available to U.S. producers. \nThey believe that it is not in the interests of consumers or producers \nto allow such imports. However, it is not just a difference in \navailability of agricultural pesticides between our two countries, but \nalso in the pricing of these chemicals.\n  Just last spring, our farmers were denied the right to bring a \npesticide across the border that was cleared for use in our country, \nbut was not available locally because the company who manufactures this \nproduct chose not to sell it here. They were selling a more expensive \nversion of the product here. The simple fact is, this company was using \nour environmental protection\n\n[[Page S9268]]\n\nlaws as a means to extract a higher price from our farmers even though \nthe cheaper product sold in Canada is just as safe. This simply is not \nright.\n  I have pointed out, time and time again, the fact is that there are \nsignificant differences in prices being paid for essentially the same \npesticide by farmers in our two countries. In fact, in a recent survey, \nfarmers in the United States were paying between 117 percent and \n193 percent more than Canadian farmers for a number of pesticides. This \nwas after adjusting for differences in currency exchange rates at that \ntime.\n\n  The farmers in my state are simply fed up with what is going on. They \nsee grain flooding across the border, while they are unable to access \nthe more inexpensive production inputs available in our ``free trade'' \nenvironment. And I might add, this grain coming into our country has \nbeen treated with these products which our farmers are denied access \nto. This simply must end.\n  As I stated earlier, today, I am introducing a new version of \nlegislation that would take an important step in providing equitable \ntreatment for U.S. farmers in the pricing of agricultural pesticides. \nAnd I want to point out what has taken place since introduction of the \noriginal pesticide harmonization bill--or maybe I should say--what has \nnot taken place.\n  I wrote the chairman of the Agriculture Committee on more than one \noccasion requesting hearings about the original version of this \nlegislation, but to no avail. I was disappointed, to say the least. \nEspecially, as I stated, since the need for this legislation has not \ndisappeared. On the contrary, it is still a hot issue along our \nnorthern border with Canada.\n  This bill would only deal with agricultural chemicals that are \nidentical or substantially similar. It only deals with pesticides that \nhave already undergone rigorous review processes and whose formulations \nhave been registered and approved for use in both countries by the \nrespective regulatory agencies.\n  The bill would establish a procedure by which states may apply for \nand receive an Environmental Protection Agency label for agricultural \nchemicals sold in Canada that are identical or substantially similar to \nagricultural chemicals used in the United States. Thus, U.S. producers \nand suppliers could purchase such chemicals in Canada for use in the \nUnited States. The need for this bill is created by pesticide companies \nwhich use chemical labeling laws to protect their marketing and pricing \nstructures, rather than protecting the public interest. In their \nselective labeling of identical or substantially similar products \nacross the border they are able to extract unjustified profits from \nAmerican farmers, and create unlevel pricing fields between our two \ncountries.\n  This bill is one legislative step in the process of full \nharmonization of pesticides between our two nations. It is designed \nspecifically to address the problem of pricing differentials on \nchemicals that are currently available in both countries. We need to \ntake this step, so that we can begin the process of creating a level \nplaying field between farmers of our two countries. This bill would \nmake harmonization a reality for those pesticides in which their actual \nselling price is the only real difference.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. \n        Gorton):\n  S. 3109. A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n1010 Fifth Avenue in Seattle, Washington, as the ``William Kenzo \nNakamura United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n          the william kenzo nakamura united states courthouse\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould designate the existing United States Federal Courthouse for the \nWestern District of Washington in Seattle, Washington, as the ``William \nKenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse.'' William Nakamura was born in \n1922, and grew up in Seattle, Washington. He attended public schools \nand was a student at the University of Washington when he and 110,000 \nother Japanese Americans were removed from their communities and forced \ninto internment camps.\n  For many, the disgrace of the internment camps and the injustice of \nthat American policy fostered resentment and anger. Rather than succumb \nto hate, William Kenzo Nakamura chose to fight for the very country \nthat had treated him unjustly. He enlisted in the 442d Regimental \nCombat Team, which went on to become the most decorated military team \nin U.S. history. While fighting in Italy, Pfc. William Nakamura was \nkilled on July 4, 1944. At the time of his death, he was providing \ncover for his retreating platoon. Earlier that day, he had also gone \nbeyond the call of duty and single-handedly destroyed a machine-gun \nnest.\n  Following his death, Nakamura's commanding officer nominated him for \nthe Medal of Honor. According to Army policy at the time, Japanese \nAmericans could not receive the Medal of Honor. Instead, Pfc. Nakamura \nwas awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the military's second \nhighest honor. This past June, Pfc. Nakamura and 21 other Asian-\nAmerican veterans of World War II were finally honored with the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. Senator Inouye, who served in the same \nunit as Mr. Nakamura, was one of those who received the Congressional \nMedal of Honor that day. I was proud to be present at the White House \nfor the ceremony.\n  I am pleased that both of the Medal of Honor recipients in Congress \nare original cosponsors of the bill: Senators Inouye and Kerry. I am \nalso honored to have my Washington state colleague, Senator Gorton, as \nan original cosponsor. Congressman McDermott is sponsoring this \nlegislation in the House, and I thank him for his efforts. Like many \nAsian-American veterans, Nakamura didn't hesitate when his country \ncalled. He and many others went to war and gave their lives for \nfreedoms which they and their families were denied at home.\n  Mr. President, we can't undo the injustice suffered by Japanese-\nAmericans during World War II, but we can give these noble Americans \nthe recognition they deserve. The William Kenzo Nakamura Courthouse \nwill serve as a permanent reminder that justice must serve all \nAmericans equally. I urge my colleagues to support this piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 3110. A bill to ensure that victims of domestic violence get the \nhelp they need in a single phone call; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9268-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9268-S9271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is the issue of violence in homes. \nAbout every 13 seconds a woman is battered. A home should be a safe \nplace. This is about anywhere from 5 to 10 million children witnessing \nthis violence--not on TV, not in the movies, but in their living rooms, \nand the effect it has on these children.\n  Today, I introduce a bill I would like to be able to have on the \nfloor of the Senate for a vote. If I don't get it done over the next \nweek or two, I am positive that there will be broad, bipartisan support \nfor this legislation. This is called the National Domestic Violence \nHotline Enhancement Act. I will send the bill to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Johnson, Bayh, and Kennedy. On the House side, \nRepresentative Connie Morella, who has done such great work in this \narea, is introducing the same piece of legislation today. I send this \nbill to the desk.\n  Darlene Lussier, from Red Lake Band, a Chippewa Indian reservation in \nMinnesota, called this bill the ``talking circle for all shelters.'' I \nwould like to name it the ``Talking Circle For All Shelters.''\n  This is modeled after the Day One project in Minnesota. This \nlegislation creates a web site that would allow the National Domestic \nViolence Hotline operators at shelters all around the country--and \nthere are 2,000 shelters; this is a map of all the shelters in the \nUnited States of America. It would enable, through this web site, \nshelters one telephone call from a woman in need of help to the \nhotline, or to any shelter, because we would have everybody hooked up \nelectronically under\n\n[[Page S9269]]\n\nvery safe and secure conditions. It would simply take one call for a \nwoman to be able to know where she and her children could go to get \naway from this violence, where they could go to make sure that she \nwould not lose her life, or that things would not get more violent at \nhome.\n  This is extremely important because what happens quite often is a \nwoman will finally get the courage and she knows she must leave. She \nknows it is a dangerous, desperate situation. But when she calls a \nshelter, they may be completely filled up and not have anywhere for her \nto go and then she doesn't know where to go. Then she is forced to stay \nin that dangerous home. Then she is battered again and her children \nwitness this, and quite often the children are battered as well. \nRemember, every 13 seconds a woman is battered in her home. A home \nshould be a safe place.\n  This piece of legislation is critically important. Right now, \naccording to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, only 43 \npercent of the shelters in the United States have Internet access. We \nhave to do better. In my State of Minnesota, last year 28 women were \nmurdered. This was ``domestic violence.'' This year--and the year is \nbarely half over--already 33 women in Minnesota have been murdered \nbecause of domestic violence. Three women were murdered within 8 days \nin northern Minnesota earlier this month. A woman, again, is battered \nevery 13 seconds, and 3 million to 5 million to 10 million children \nwitness this. Over 70 percent of these children themselves are abused.\n  I don't want to hear one more story about a woman being murdered by \nher husband or boyfriend. I don't want to hear one more story about a \nwoman being beaten, or her child fighting in school because he saw the \nviolence in his home. We have to end this. I don't want to hear one \nmore statistic about a quarter of homeless people on any given night \nare victims of domestic violence--women and children with nowhere to \ngo. This ``Talking Circle For All Shelters'' would enable a woman to \nget on this national hotline, or call the shelter, and everybody would \nbe linked up through a web site electrically, and she would be able to \nknow right away where she could go to be safe, so that her children \nwould be safe.\n\n  This is modeled after Minnesota's Day One web site. This links every \nshelter in Minnesota. Day One reports that 99 percent of women and \nchildren who call, because of this system, are assured services and \nshelter that meets their unique needs. I want to take this Minnesota \nmodel--this Day One web site model--and make sure this becomes \navailable for all women and all children throughout the United States \nof America.\n  David Strand, who is chief operating officer of Allina Health System \nin Minnesota, and who has led the way, along with United Way, in \nproviding the funding for this, talks about how important this is for \nhealing and how important it is to return to healthy communities.\n  Day One is all about healing. Day One is all about giving women who \nhave been battered and abused and their children a chance to heal. Day \nOne in Minnesota--and I want it to be Day One in the United States of \nAmerica--is about making sure when she needs to make the call, she can \ndo it and find out where she and her children can go. This is the \n``Talking Circle For All Shelters'' in America.\n  Over the past 5 years, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has \nreceived over 500,000 calls from women and children in danger from \nabuse. If we can take this Day One model in Minnesota, the web site \nthat we have, and we can now make this a national program, we can make \nsure that these women and these children will get the help they need. \nWe can make sure these women, when they make the call, will know where \nthey can go, as opposed to making a call, and the shelter they call \ndoesn't have any room and they don't know where to go, and then they \nstay and are battered again and, for all I know, they are murdered.\n  We can take this new technology and link up all of these shelters \nelectronically. We can make this a part of the national domestic \nviolence hotline, and we can make a real difference.\n  I want to introduce this today. I am absolutely sure we can pass this \nlegislation. I know we can do this. I know it is the right thing to do. \nI know there will be strong support from Democrats and Republicans as \nwell.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 3111. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan extension of time for the payment of estate tax to more estates with \nclosely held businesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n to provide an extension of time for the payment of the estate tax to \n               more estates with closely held businesses\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the estate tax imposes a true hardship on \nfamily-owned businesses. When a person dies, the estate tax must be \npaid within 9 months. Current law permits only a small number of \nbusiness owners to pay the estate tax in installments. The tax for most \nclosely held businesses, however, must be paid shortly after the \nowners' death. Often, business assets and even the business itself must \nbe sold to raise the cash to pay the tax. Closely held businesses, \nhowever, cannot be sold for their true value within so short a time. To \navoid such fire sales, elderly owners will often sell their businesses \nwhile still living to get a fair price.\n  Congress, as a matter of policy, should encourage the formation of \nfamily businesses and also support their continuation. The estate tax \nmeasures that the Senate recently voted on do not fully or immediately \nrespond to the problems of closely held, family-owned businesses. Due \nto revenue constraints, repeal of the estate tax must be slowly phased \nin. During that phase-in period, whether the tax rate is 45 percent, 35 \npercent, 25 percent, or 15 percent, many business owners will still \nneed to liquidate their businesses to pay the tax.\n  The alternative proposal to raise the deduction for qualified family-\nowned business interests to $2 million fails to answer the basic \nliquidity problem. These families have all their assets tied up in \ntheir businesses. They do not have the cash to pay the estate tax right \naway. Moreover, the strict eligibility rules and caps restrict the \nnumber of family businesses that can qualify for the QFOBI deduction. \nThe 10-year recapture rule, which is also part of the alternative \nproposal, also hampers the businesses that do qualify.\n  The bill that I and Senator Akaka introduce today would make all \nclosely held businesses eligible for temporary deferral and installment \npayment of the estate tax. My measure simply raises the number of \npermissible owners for qualifying closely held businesses from 15 to \n75, thereby expanding eligibility for the 4-year deferral and 10-year \ninstallment payment of the estate tax.\n  In the subchapter S Act of 1958, the Senate established special \nincome tax rules for closely held businesses. The Senate in the same \nlegislation also decided to collect the estate tax on closely held \nbusinesses over an extended payment period. By being allowed to pay the \nestate tax on the family businesses over 10 annual installments after \nan initial 4-year deferral, the surviving family members can continue \nto operate these businesses and use future earnings to pay the estate \ntax.\n  In 1996, Congress amended subchapter S to allow a small business \ncorporation to have up to 75 owners; this was intended to encourage \nclosely held businesses to give key workers a share in ownership. But \nthe eligibility rules were not changed for estate tax payment. By \nsharing ownership with workers as encouraged under the 1996 amendments \nto subchapter S, the owners of closely held businesses lose their \nestate tax relief. Although these businesses still qualify under \nsubchapter S, they are often no longer eligible for temporary deferral \nand extended installment payment of the estate tax.\n  The Treasury Department suggests that the qualification rules for \nsubchapter S and for estate tax relief should be made consistent once \nagain. During the debate on estate tax relief, Senator Roth and Senator \nMoynihan acknowledged this problem and pledged to correct it. \nAccordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9270]]\n\n                                S. 3111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide loans for the improvement of \ntelecommunications services of Indian reservations; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n\n\n Native American Telecommunications Improvement and Value Enhancement \n                                  Act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Native \nAmerican Telecommunications Improvement and Value Enhancement Act, the \nNATIVE Act. This bill provides a low interest loan program to build \ntelecommunications infrastructure for federally-recognized Indian \ntribes.\n  This legislation is timely. This week the Federal Communications \nCommission is hosting an Indian Telecom Training Initiative in St. Paul \nMinnesota to provide training to tribes on all phases of providing \ntelecommunications services to their members. Why is this so important?\n  At a time when 94 percent of Americans enjoy basic telephone service \nand the benefits derived thereof, only 47 percent of Native Americans \non reservations have service. This is even below the rate of the rural \nhomes, 91 percent.\n  Indian and Alaska Native people live in some of the most \ngeographically remote areas of the country. Most Alaska Native villages \nare reachable year-round by air only, have limited access by water, and \nhave no road connections. On the mainland, many Indian reservations are \nlocated west of the Mississippi, where the wide-open spaces often mean \nthat the nearest town, city, or hospital is several hours away by car.\n  Those that do not have a telephone do not have access to some of the \nbasic services that we take for granted each and every day.\n  Some cannot obtain access to medical care in an emergency. Others \ncannot reach prospective employers quickly and easily. Many cannot take \nadvantage of the commercial, educational, and medical care \nopportunities the Internet offers.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples:\n  Raymond Gachupin, governor of Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico, said he \nonce was unable to call for emergency help for a young man who had been \nshot because no phone was available.\n  William Kennard at an FCC Field Hearing in 1999 revealed a case on \nthe Navaho reservation in Arizona, where 1,500 school children have \ncomputers, but can't hook up to the Internet because the Information \nSuperhighway seems to have passed them by.\n  And then there is just the basic inconvenience of not having a \nreadily available means of communication:\n  The community of Bylas in Arizona, which has approximately 2,000 \nresidents, had only one payphone. People would line up at 6 o'clock in \nthe morning to use the phone. They would stand in line sometimes until \n12 o'clock midnight to use the phone. The only other way to talk to \npeople was if you saw them in town and then any news may be days old.\n  I know these stories are from the Southwestern United States but in \nmy home state of Montana many of the reservations lack phone service, \nover 60 percent of the homes on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, 55 \npercent on the Crow Reservation.\n  The Federal Communications Commission is stepping up to the plate to \nhelp solve this problem by reducing the cost of basic telephone service \nfor individuals on reservations through the Lifeline and Linkup \nprograms. The lifeline program could reduce the monthly cost of phone \nservice to one dollar, all eligible customers would see bills below \n$10. The Linkup program helps offset the cost of the initiating service \nby as much as $100.\n  As stated earlier, this week in St. Paul Minnesota, the FCC is \nconducting a training seminar for tribal telecommunications.\n  I commend the FCC for their efforts and want to assist where I can. \nThat is why I am introducing this valuable legislation.\n  The infrastructure costs for providing telecommunications services \ncan be very high especially in remote areas where customers can be more \nthan one mile apart. This legislation will help to keep those costs \ndown by lowering the cost of borrowing.\n  The NATIVE Act provides a $1 billion revolving loan fund with a \ngraduated interest rate pegged to the per capita income of the \npopulation receiving service. The interest rates range from 2 percent \nfor the poorest tribes up to 5 percent.\n  The plans submitted for loan approval will be subject to the \nrequirements of current Rural Utilities Service borrowers including \nservice capable of transmitting data at a minimum rate of one Megabit \nper second. This will ensure the system in place will connect Native \nAmericans to the Internet thereby opening up economic opportunities \nthat wouldn't otherwise exist.\n  The program is not intended to displace existing telecommunications \ncarriers who are providing service to Native Americans. In fact, the \nbill is specific in that loan funds can only be used to provide service \nto unserved and underserved areas, where existing service is deemed \ninadequate due to either cost or quality.\n  Additionally the Act establishes a matching grant program for \nconducting feasibility studies to determine the best alternative for \nproviding service.\n  The program will be administered by the Rural Utilities Service, an \nagency with over 50 years experience in lending for rural \ntelecommunications infrastructure throughout the country.\n  The RUS telecommunications program has provided financing for 866,000 \nmiles of line approximately one-tenth of which is fiber optic, serving \n5.5 million customers, including Native Americans. The RUS distance \nlearning/telemedicine program has funded 306 projects for rural schools \nand medical centers in 44 states since its inception in 1993 bringing \nimproved services for education and health care centers in rural \ncommunities. All without incurring any loan losses.\n  I have the utmost confidence that the Rural Utilities Service will \nsuccessfully administer this program.\n  To wrap up, Mr. President, I know that we cannot reach everyone. \nThere are some who simply do not want service in order to preserve \ntheir traditional way of living and others who feel owning a telephone \nis not a priority within the household budget; however, we should \nstrive to try to ensure telecommunications service to those who want \nand need to have a telephone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Robb):\n  S. 3115.

The current authority for the Commission expires in January \nof 2001, and this bill would extend that authority for another 10 \nyears. Joining me in introducing this legislation are Senators \nMikulski, Warner and Robb.\n  Mr. President, the C Canal National Historical Park is one of the \nmost unique in this Nation and one of the most heavily visited. It \nbegins in this great city, the Nation's Capital and extends 184 miles \nto its original terminus in Cumberland, Maryland. As you can imagine, \nthe development of plans for the preservation and use of this park is a \nmajor undertaking. It is no easy task to protect and preserve a park \nwhich averages 100 yards in width but is 184 miles long.\n  The work of the Commission is not finished. The Commission is \ncomposed of representatives of the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth \nof Virginia, the State of West Virginia, the District of Columbia, the \ncounties in Maryland through which the park runs, and members at large. \nThe passage of this\n\n[[Page S9271]]\n\nbill will permit the Commission to complete the rational process begun \nso many years ago to ensure that this unique part of America's natural \nand historical heritage is properly preserved.\n  I encourage those who are interested in the C Canal to join in \nsponsoring this legislation, and it is my hope that it can be enacted \nin this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/26/senate-section/article/S9271-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9271-S9272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Burns) was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to amend the \nTariff Act of 1930 to eliminate disincentives to fair trade conditions.\n\n\n                                 S. 717\n\n  At the request of Ms. Mikulski, the name of the Senator from \nLouisiana (Mr. Breaux) was added as a cosponsor of S. 717, a bill to \namend title II of the Social Security Act to provide that the \nreductions in social security benefits which are required in the case \nof spouses and surviving spouses who are also receiving certain \nGovernment pensions shall be equal to the amount by which two-thirds of \nthe total amount of the combined monthly benefit (before reduction) and \nmonthly pension exceeds $1,200, adjusted for inflation.\n\n\n                                 S. 874\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inouye, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 874, a bill to repeal the \nreduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals and \nentertainment.\n\n\n                                 S. 909\n\n  At the request of Mr. Conrad, the name of the Senator from New Mexico \n(Mr. Bingaman) was added as a cosponsor of S. 909, a bill to provide \nfor the review and classification of physician assistant positions in \nthe Federal Government, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1277\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from \nWashington (Mr. Gorton) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1277, a bill to \namend title XIX of the Social Security Act to establish a new \nprospective payment system for Federally-qualified health centers and \nrural health clinics.\n\n\n                                S. 1536\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the names of the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the \nSenator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. \nKohl), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from \nWisconsin (Mr. Feingold) were added as cosponsors of S. 1536, a bill to \namend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to extend authorizations of \nappropriations for programs under the Act, to modernize programs and \nservices for older individuals, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1762\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Lincoln, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Miller) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1762, a bill to amend the \nWatershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act to authorize the \nSecretary of Agriculture to provide cost share assistance for the \nrehabilitation of structural measures constructed as part of water \nresources projects previously funded by the Secretary under such Act or \nrelated laws.\n\n\n                                S. 1796\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1796, a bill to modify the \nenforcement of certain anti-terrorism judgements, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1900\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from \nMontana (Mr. Baucus) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1900, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a credit to holders of \nqualified bonds issued by Amtrak, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1957\n\n  At the request of Mr. Schumer, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1957, a bill \nto provide for the payment of compensation to the families of the \nFederal employees who were killed in the crash of a United States Air \nForce CT-43A aircraft on April 3, 1996, near Dubrovnik, Croatia, \ncarrying Secretary of Commerce Ronald H.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Physicians, providers of services, and suppliers of \n     medical equipment and supplies that participate in the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     must contend with over 100,000 pages of complex medicare \n     regulations, most of which are unknowable to the average \n     health care provider.\n       (2) Many physicians are choosing to discontinue \n     participation in the medicare program to avoid becoming the \n     target of an overzealous Government investigation regarding \n     compliance with the extensive regulations governing the \n     submission and payment of medicare claims.\n       (3) Health Care Financing Administration contractors send \n     post-payment review letters to physicians that require the \n     physician to submit to additional substantial Government \n     interference with the practice of the physician in order to \n     preserve the physician's right to due process.\n       (4) When a Health Care Financing Administration contractor \n     sends a post-payment review letter to a physician, that \n     contractor often has no telephone or face-to-face \n     communication with the physician, provider of services, or \n     supplier.\n       (5) The Health Care Financing Administration targets \n     billing errors as though health care providers have committed \n     fraudulent acts, but has not adequately educated physicians, \n     providers of services, and suppliers regarding medicare \n     billing requirements.\n       (6) The Office of the Inspector General of the Department \n     of Health and Human Services found that 75 percent of \n     surveyed physicians had never received any educational \n     materials from a Health Care Financing Administration \n     contractor concerning the equipment and supply ordering \n     process.\n\n     SEC. 3.

In \n     referring to themselves, Native Hawaiians use the term \n     `Kanaka Maoli', a term frequently used in the 19th century to \n     describe the native people of Hawaii.\n       ``(7) The constitution and statutes of the State of \n     Hawaii--\n       ``(A) acknowledge the distinct land rights of Native \n     Hawaiian people as beneficiaries of the public lands trust; \n     and\n       ``(B) reaffirm and protect the unique right of the Native \n     Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their cultural and \n     religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language.\n       ``(8) At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous \n     peoples in Hawaii in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived \n     in a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistence social \n     system based\n\n[[Page S9319]]\n\n     on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, \n     culture, and religion.\n       ``(9) A unified monarchical government of the Hawaiian \n     Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first \n     King of Hawaii.\n       ``(10) Throughout the 19th century and until 1893, the \n     United States--\n       ``(A) recognized the independence of the Hawaiian Nation;\n       ``(B) extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to \n     the Hawaiian Government; and\n       ``(C) entered into treaties and conventions with the \n     Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, \n     1842, 1849, 1875 and 1887.\n       ``(11) In 1893, John L. Stevens, the United States Minister \n     assigned to the sovereign and independent Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     conspired with a small group of non-Hawaiian residents of the \n     Kingdom, including citizens of the United States, to \n     overthrow the indigenous and lawful government of Hawaii.\n       ``(12) In pursuance of that conspiracy, the United States \n     Minister and the naval representative of the United States \n     caused armed naval forces of the United States to invade the \n     sovereign Hawaiian Nation in support of the overthrow of the \n     indigenous and lawful Government of Hawaii and the United \n     States Minister thereupon extended diplomatic recognition of \n     a provisional government formed by the conspirators without \n     the consent of the native people of Hawaii or the lawful \n     Government of Hawaii in violation of treaties between the 2 \n     nations and of international law.\n       ``(13) In a message to Congress on December 18, 1893, then \n     President Grover Cleveland reported fully and accurately on \n     these illegal actions, and acknowledged that by these acts, \n     described by the President as acts of war, the government of \n     a peaceful and friendly people was overthrown, and the \n     President concluded that a `substantial wrong has thus been \n     done which a due regard for our national character as well as \n     the rights of the injured people required that we should \n     endeavor to repair'.\n       ``(14) Queen Lili`uokalani, the lawful monarch of Hawaii, \n     and the Hawaiian Patriotic League, representing the \n     aboriginal citizens of Hawaii, promptly petitioned the United \n     States for redress of these wrongs and for restoration of the \n     indigenous government of the Hawaiian nation, but this \n     petition was not acted upon.\n       ``(15) The United States has acknowledged the significance \n     of these events and has apologized to Native Hawaiians on \n     behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii with the participation of agents and \n     citizens of the United States, and the resulting deprivation \n     of the  rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination in \n     legislation enacted into law in 1993 (Public Law 103-150; \n     107 Stat. 1510).\n       ``(16) In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii through \n     the Newlands Resolution without the consent of or \n     compensation to the indigenous peoples of Hawaii or their \n     sovereign government who were thereby denied the mechanism \n     for expression of their inherent sovereignty through self-\n     government and self-determination, their lands and ocean \n     resources.\n       ``(17) Through the Newlands Resolution and the 1900 Organic \n     Act, the Congress received 1,750,000 acres of lands formerly \n     owned by the Crown and Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom and \n     exempted the lands from then existing public land laws of the \n     United States by mandating that the revenue and proceeds from \n     these lands be `used solely for the benefit of the \n     inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for education and other \n     public purposes', thereby establishing a special trust \n     relationship between the United States and the inhabitants of \n     Hawaii.\n       ``(18) In 1921, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920, which designated 200,000 acres of the \n     ceded public lands for exclusive homesteading by Native \n     Hawaiians, thereby affirming the trust relationship between \n     the United States and the Native Hawaiians, as expressed by \n     then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane who was cited \n     in the Committee Report of the Committee on Territories of \n     the House of Representatives as stating, `One thing that \n     impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the \n     islands . . . for whom in a sense we are trustees, are \n     falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in \n     poverty.'.\n       ``(19) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique \n     status of the Native Hawaiian people by including in the Act \n     of June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781 et seq.), a provision to lease \n     lands within the extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit \n     fishing in the area `only by native Hawaiian residents of \n     said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their \n     guidance'.\n       ``(20) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands to the State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust \n     relationship which existed between the United States and the \n     Native Hawaiian people by retaining the exclusive power to \n     enforce the trust, including the power to approve land \n     exchanges, and legislative amendments affecting the rights of \n     beneficiaries under such Act.\n       ``(21) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for administration over portions of the ceded \n     public lands trust not retained by the United States to the \n     State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust relationship which \n     existed between the United States and the Native Hawaiian \n     people by retaining the legal responsibility of the State for \n     the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians under \n     section 5(f) of such Act.\n       ``(22) In 1978, the people of Hawaii amended their \n     Constitution to establish the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and \n     assigned to that body the authority to accept and hold real \n     and personal property transferred from any source in trust \n     for the Native Hawaiian people, to receive payments from the \n     State of Hawaii due to the Native Hawaiian people in \n     satisfaction of the pro rata share of the proceeds of the \n     Public Land Trust created under section 5 of the Admission \n     Act of 1959 (Public Law 83-3), to act as the lead State \n     agency for matters affecting the Native Hawaiian people, and \n     to formulate policy on affairs relating to the Native \n     Hawaiian people.\n       ``(23) The authority of the Congress under the Constitution \n     to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal or \n     indigenous peoples of the United States includes the \n     authority to legislate in matters affecting the native \n     peoples of Alaska and Hawaii.\n       ``(24) The United States has recognized the authority of \n     the Native Hawaiian people to continue to work towards an \n     appropriate form of sovereignty as defined by the Native \n     Hawaiian people themselves in provisions set forth in \n     legislation returning the Hawaiian Island of Kaho`olawe to \n     custodial management by the State of Hawaii in 1994.\n       ``(25) In furtherance of the trust responsibility for the \n     betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, the United \n     States has established a program for the provision of \n     comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention \n     services to maintain and improve the health status of the \n     Hawaiian people. This program is conducted by the Native \n     Hawaiian Health Care Systems, the Native Hawaiian Health \n     Scholarship Program and Papa Ola Lokahi. Health initiatives \n     from these and other health institutions and agencies using \n     Federal assistance have been responsible for reducing the \n     century-old morbidity and mortality rates of Native Hawaiian \n     people by providing comprehensive disease prevention, health \n     promotion activities and increasing the number of Native \n     Hawaiians in the health and allied health professions. This \n     has been accomplished through the Native Hawaiian Health Care \n     Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-579) and its reauthorization in \n     section 9168 of Public Law 102-396 (106 Stat. 1948).\n       ``(26) This historical and unique legal relationship has \n     been consistently recognized and affirmed by Congress through \n     the enactment of Federal laws which extend to the Native \n     Hawaiian people the same rights and privileges accorded to \n     American Indian, Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut \n     communities, including the Native American Programs Act of \n     1974 (42 U.S.C. 2991 et seq.), the American Indian Religious \n     Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. 1996), the National Museum of the \n     American Indian Act (20 U.S.C. 80q et seq.), and the Native \n     American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. \n     3001 et seq.).\n       ``(27) The United States has also recognized and reaffirmed \n     the trust relationship to the Native Hawaiian people through \n     legislation which authorizes the provision of services to \n     Native Hawaiians, specifically, the Older Americans Act of \n     1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), the Developmental Disabilities \n     Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1987, the \n     Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988, the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.), the \n     Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-579), \n     the Health Professions Reauthorization Act of 1988, the \n     Nursing Shortage Reduction and Education Extension Act of \n     1988, the Handicapped Programs Technical Amendments Act of \n     1988, the Indian Health Care Amendments of 1988, and the \n     Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act of 1990.\n       ``(28) The United States has also affirmed the historical \n     and unique legal relationship to the Hawaiian people by \n     authorizing the provision of services to Native Hawaiians to \n     address problems of alcohol and drug abuse under the Anti-\n     Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-570).\n       ``(29) Further, the United States has recognized that \n     Native Hawaiians, as aboriginal, indigenous, native peoples \n     of Hawaii, are a unique population group in Hawaii and in the \n     continental United States and has so declared in Office of \n     Management and Budget Circular 15 in 1997 and Presidential \n     Executive Order No. 13125, dated June 7, 1999.\n       ``(30) Despite the United States having expressed its \n     commitment to a policy of reconciliation with the Native \n     Hawaiian people for past grievances in Public Law 103-150 \n     (107 Stat. 1510) the unmet health needs of the Native \n     Hawaiian people remain severe and their health status \n     continues to be far below that of the general population of \n     the United States.\n       ``(b) Unmet Needs and Health Disparities.--Congress finds \n     that the unmet needs and serious health disparities that \n     adversely affect the Native Hawaiian people include the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Chronic disease and illness.--\n       ``(A) Cancer.--\n       ``(i) In general.--With respect to all cancer--\n\n       ``(I) Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality \n     rates in the State of Hawaii (231.0 out of every 100,000 \n     residents), 45 percent higher than that for the total State \n     population (159.7 out of every 100,000 residents);\n       ``(II) Native Hawaiian males have the highest cancer \n     mortality rates in the State of Hawaii for cancers of the \n     lung, liver and pancreas and for all cancers combined;\n       ``(III) Native Hawaiian females ranked highest in the State \n     of Hawaii for cancers of the lung, liver, pancreas, breast, \n     cervix uteri, corpus uteri, stomach, and rectum, and for all \n     cancers combined;\n       ``(IV) Native Hawaiian males have the highest years of \n     productive life lost from cancer in the State of Hawaii with \n     8.7 years compared to 6.4 years for all males;

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is \npassing S. 2272, the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act, SANCA. \nI strongly support this legislation, which will provide much needed \ndollars to the Nation's overburdened abuse and neglect courts. We added \nto their burdens in 1997, by passing the Adoption and Safe Families \nAct, ASFA, without providing adequate funding to assure effective \nimplementation. Courts nationwide are struggling to meet the \naccelerated timelines and other requirements of that legislation, which \nwas intended to expedite the process of securing safe, permanent, and \nloving homes for abused and neglected children.\n  SANCA will help ease the pressure, by making available to State and \nlocal courts some Federal funding to assure timely court hearings and \nreduce the case backlogs created by the ASFA. Both the Conference of \nChief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators have \nadopted resolutions in support of SANCA. It is without doubt a good \nidea.\n  This legislation authorizes $10 million over five years to assist \nstate and local courts to develop and implement automated case tracking \nsystems for abuse and neglect proceeding. It authorizes another $10 \nmillion to reduce existing backlogs of abuse and neglect cases, plus $5 \nmillion to expand the Court-Appointed Special Advocate, CASA, program \nin underserved areas. That is a total of $25 million that would help \naddress a very real problem that we in Congress helped to create.\n  In my own State of Vermont, the courts are committed to implementing \nthe ASFA and reducing the amount of time spent by children in foster \ncare settings. But they are having trouble meeting the Federal law's \ntight deadlines and procedural requirements.\n  My only concern with S. 2272 is the competitive grant method that it \nadopts for allocating grant money. By contrast, the model for S. 2272--\nthe Court Improvement Project, or CIP--allocates money by formula. \nCongress created the CIP grant program in 1993, to assist State courts \nin improving their handling of child abuse and neglect cases. On an \nannual basis, each State is awarded $85,000, and the remainder of the \nfunds are distributed by formula based on the proportionate population \nof children in the States. This has been a highly successful program. \nStates have combined CIP funds with State and local dollars to make \nsweeping changes in the way they handle child abuse and neglect cases.\n  Under SANCA, State and local courts would compete against each other \nfor a relatively small number of grants, and many will get no help at \nall, even if their needs are great. I understand that there is \ncompanion legislation, the ``Training and Knowledge Ensure Children a \nRisk-Free Environment, TAKE CARE, Act,'' S. 2271, which would authorize \nincreased assistance for every State to help improve the quality and \navailability of training for judges, attorneys, and volunteers working \nin the Nation's abuse and neglect courts. That bill was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance, which has yet to consider it. It is my hope that \nthe Senate will take up and pass S. 2271 before the end of this \nlegislative session.\n  Many other important bills remain pending before this body as we head \ninto the final weeks of the 106th Congress. I want to highlight one \nbill, which I introduced with Senators DeWine and Robb this summer, and \nwhich the Judiciary Committee reported by unanimous consent last week. \nThe Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, would authorize a $25 \nmillion Department of Justice grant program to help states prevent and \nprosecute computer crime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used \nto provide education, training, and enforcement programs for local law \nenforcement officers and prosecutors in the rapidly growing field of \ncomputer criminal justice. Our legislation has been endorsed by the \nInformation Technology Association of America and Fraternal Order of \nPolice. I hope all Senators can join us in our bipartisan effort to \nprovide our state and local partners in crime fighting with the \nresources they need in the battle against computer crime.\n  I commend Senator DeWine and Senator Rockefeller for their leadership \non the SANCA legislation and urge its speedy passage into law.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4209\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Senator DeWine has an amendment at the desk. I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Abuse and \n     Neglect Courts Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a \n     crucial and essential role in\n\n[[Page S9327]]\n\n     the Nation's child welfare system and in ensuring safety, \n     stability, and permanence for abused and neglected children \n     under the supervision of that system.\n       (2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law \n     105-89; 111 Stat. 2115) establishes explicitly for the first \n     time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be \n     the paramount consideration when any decision is made \n     regarding a child in the Nation's child welfare system.\n       (3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes \n     stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by \n     requiring timely decision-making in proceedings to determine \n     whether children can safely return to their families or \n     whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive \n     homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the \n     foster care system.\n       (4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster \n     care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 \n     specifically requires, among other things, that States move \n     to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those \n     children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 \n     months.\n       (5) While essential to protect children and to carry out \n     the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of \n     1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of \n     parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that \n     Act increase the pressure on the Nation's already \n     overburdened abuse and neglect courts.\n       (6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially \n     improved by the acquisition and implementation of \n     computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate \n     existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads \n     forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe \n     and stable families. Such systems could also be used to \n     evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the \n     purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the \n     Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.\n       (7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by \n     the identification and implementation of projects designed to \n     eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including \n     the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court \n     hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing \n     caseloads.\n       (8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the \n     Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further \n     strengthened by improving the quality and availability of \n     training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, \n     guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-\n     appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who \n     represent the children and the parents of children in abuse \n     and neglect proceedings.\n       (9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this \n     country are already committed to the quality administration \n     of justice, the performance of such courts would be even \n     further enhanced by the development of models and educational \n     opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already \n     been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, \n     case management, representation of children, automated \n     interagency interfaces, and ``best practices'' standards.\n       (10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial \n     officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that \n     proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run \n     efficiently and effectively. The performance of those \n     individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by \n     training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange \n     ideas with their peers.\n       (11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special \n     advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and \n     ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, \n     or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring \n     increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court \n     system. The Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit \n     from an expansion of this program to currently underserved \n     communities.\n       (12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, \n     comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, \n     model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with \n     respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the \n     purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by \n     reducing the average length of an abused and neglected \n     child's stay in foster care, improving the quality of \n     decision-making and court services provided to children and \n     families, and increasing the number of adoptions.\n\n     SEC. 3.
