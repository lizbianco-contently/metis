Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 4762, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4762) to amend the Internal Revenue Code for \n     1986 to require 527 organizations to disclose their political \n     activities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 7 \nminutes for closing remarks, with 5 minutes of that time to be under \nthe control of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of my 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, despite the claims in the press by some \nopponents of this measure, this bill is fair and evenhanded. It affects \ngroups on both sides of the political spectrum. It is not aimed at any \nparticular group or players in the elections. It is aimed at getting \nrid of secrecy. It is not an attempt to silence anyone. It is an \nattempt to give the American people information. They are entitled to \nhave this information about the groups who flood the airwaves with \nnegative ads during an election campaign.\n  I thank all my colleagues who supported the McCain-Feingold-Lieberman \namendment on the Department of Defense bill. They can be proud of what \nthey did. With that vote, they have started in motion a process that \nhas brought us to this day, when we will quickly pass and send to the \nPresident for his signature a good, fair, bipartisan bill that does the \nright thing for the American people.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I believe in full disclosure of who is \nfunding political campaigns. The public has a right to know who is \npaying for the political advertisements and direct mail that they see. \nWhile I think this bill may not go far enough in requiring disclosure \nof these groups, it is a first step and that is why I support H.R. \n4762.\n  H.R. 4762 requires disclosure for political organizations which are \ntax exempt under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. 527 \norganizations which directly advocate the election or defeat\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nof a particular candidate for federal office are subject to federal \nelection campaign law disclosure obligations. However, 527 \norganizations that do not directly advocate for the election or defeat \nof a particular candidate are not subject to these federal election \ncampaign laws and are not obligated to disclose the names of their \ncontributors nor how they send the contributions they receive. This \nbill correctly adds disclosure requirements to these 527 organizations \nso that the activities performed and identity of contributors to these \npreviously undisclosed will be available for public scrutiny, much like \nthose 527 organizations that have to disclose under the federal \nelection laws.\n  I am also glad that this bill follows the constitutional requirement \nthat revenue measures originate in the House of Representatives. If the \nrevenue measure did not originate in the House, then any member could \nsubject the bill to a ``blue slip,'' thereby voiding the entire bill, \nnot just the part of the bill that is a revenue measure. I opposed an \namendment similar to this bill a few weeks ago when it was offered as \nan amendment to the Defense Authorization bill because adoption of that \namendment would have subjected the Defense Authorization bill to such a \n``blue slip'' challenge. Since we are taking up a House-originated \nrevenue measure, I do not have the concerns which forced me to vote \nagainst the previous amendment.\n  However, I do have some concerns with this bill. First, this bill is \na tax measure and tax measures should first be addressed by this \ncommittee of jurisdiction, the Finance Committee. This we have not \ndone. In fact, the Fiance Committee was scheduled to have a hearing on \nJuly 12, 2000 to review this and other similar legislation dealing with \ndisclosure of political activity by tax-exempt and other organizations. \nThis hearing will not happen now and we will not be able to have the \nFinance Committee review how effective this legislation will be.\n  My second concern is that this bill may not do enough. By only \nfocusing on disclosure in one type of tax-exempt organization and not \non others, we leave open the use of the other type of tax-exempt \norganizations by those who want to hide their contributions and \nactivity behind the cloak of anonymity that these tax-exempt \norganizations provide. This view is shared by the staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation.\n  Finally, I am concerned that this legislation requires the Internal \nRevenue Service to do things that it is not prepared to do with regard \nto disclosure. For example, under the bill reported out of the Ways and \nMeans Committee, the IRS could partner with another agency--most likely \nthe Federal Election Commission--to provide that the results of the 527 \ndisclosure to the public. Unfortunately, this and other technical \nmatters that were addressed in the Ways and Means Committee bill were \nnot incorporated in this bill. I fear that we will have to address \nthese technical issues in the future in order to make the disclosure \nprovisions work to effectively provide this information to the public.\n  Because this bill is a first step and that some disclosure is better \nthan no disclosure, I will vote for H.R. 4762.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Brennan \nCenter for Justice expressing the view that this bill requiring \ndisclosure by 527 organizations is constitutionally sound be printed in \nthe Record. \n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Brennan Center for Justice,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 28, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to express the views of the \n     Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of \n     Law on the constitutional validity of attempts to seek \n     disclosure from organizations covered by Section 527 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code, as contained in the Lieberman-Levin-\n     Daschle-McCain Bills (S.B. 2582 and 2583).\n       Senate Bill 2582 seeks to completely close the current \n     Section 527 loophole, under which some organizations are \n     claiming that they exist for the purpose of influencing \n     electoral outcomes for income tax purposes, but that they are \n     not ``political committees'' for purposes of federal election \n     law. Senate Bill 2582 clarifies that tax exemption under \n     Section 527 is available only to organizations that are \n     ``political committees'' under FECA. Senate Bill 2583 is a \n     more limited bill, which requires Section 527 organizations \n     to disclose their existence to the IRS, to file publicly \n     available tax returns, and to file with the IRS and make \n     public reports disclosing large contributors and \n     expenditures.\n       Both of these bills are constitutionally sound. Buckley v. \n     Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), clearly established that groups \n     whose major purpose is influencing elections--the operative \n     test under both the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and \n     under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code--are \n     appropriately subject to federal disclosure laws. A close \n     textual analysis of Buckley reveals that the Supreme Court \n     explicitly recognized the legitimacy of mandatory disclosure \n     laws for organizations whose major purpose is influencing \n     elections.\n\n\n             understanding buckley's disclosure limitations\n\n       In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court considered the \n     constitutional validity of, among other things, various \n     disclosure provisions that Congress had enacted on federal \n     political activity. In general, the Court found mandatory \n     disclosure requirements to be the least restrictive means for \n     achieving the government's compelling interests in the \n     campaign finance arena. However, the Court believed that, \n     while it was constitutionally permissible to require advocacy \n     groups that ``expressly advocate'' for or against particular \n     federal candidates to comply with federal disclosure laws, \n     advocacy groups that engage in a mere discussion of political \n     issues (so-called ``issue advocacy'') cannot be subjected to \n     public disclosure.\n       The Supreme Court was concerned that FECA could become a \n     trap for unwary political speakers. Advocacy groups or \n     individuals that participate in the national debate about \n     important policy issues might discover that they had run \n     afoul of federal campaign finance law restrictions simply by \n     virtue of their having mentioned a federal candidate in \n     connection with a pressing public issue. The Court found that \n     FECA's disclosure provisions, as written, raised potential \n     problems both of vagueness and overbreadth.\n       Under First Amendment ``void for vagueness'' jurisprudence, \n     the government cannot punish someone without providing a \n     sufficiently precise description of what conduct is legal and \n     what is illegal. A vague or imprecise definition of regulated \n     political advocacy might serve to ``chill'' some political \n     speakers who, although they desire to engage in pure ``issue \n     advocacy,'' may be afraid that their speech will be construed \n     as regulable ``express advocacy.'' Similarly, the overbreadth \n     doctrine in First Amendment jurisprudence is concerned with a \n     regulation that, however precise, sweeps too broadly and \n     reaches constitutionally protected speech. Thus, a regulation \n     that is clearly drafted, but covers both ``issue advocacy'' \n     and ``express advocacy'' may be overbroad as applied to \n     certain speakers.\n       The Court's vagueness and overbreadth analysis centered on \n     two provisions in FECA--section 608(e), which adopted limits \n     on independent expenditures, and section 434(e), which \n     adopted reporting requirements for individuals and groups. \n     For these two provisions, the Supreme Court overcame the \n     vagueness and overbreadth issues by adopting a narrow \n     construction of the statute that limited its applicability to \n     ``express advocacy.'' However, the Court made it absolutely \n     clear that the ``express advocacy'' limiting construction \n     that it was adopting for these sections did not apply to \n     expenditures by either candidates or political committees. \n     According to the Court, the activities of candidates and \n     political committees are ``by definition, campaign related.'' \n     Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79.\n       The ``express advocacy'' limitation was intended by the \n     Court to give protection to speakers that are not primarily \n     engaged in influencing federal elections. However, because \n     candidates and political committees have as their major \n     purpose the influencing of elections, they are not entitled \n     to the benefit of the ``express advocacy'' limiting \n     construction. The Supreme Court never suggested, as no \n     rational court would, that political candidates, political \n     parties, or political committees can avoid all of FECA's \n     requirements by simply eschewing the use of ``express \n     advocacy'' in their communications. As discussed above, the \n     Supreme Court wanted to avoid trapping the unwary political \n     speaker in the web of FECA regulation. However, for political \n     parties, political candidates, and political committees, \n     which have influencing electoral outcomes as their central \n     mission, there is no fear that they will be unwittingly or \n     improperly subject to regulation.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Buckley Court's first invocation of the ``express \n     advocacy'' standard appears in its discussion of the \n     mandatory limitations imposed by FECA section 608(e) on \n     independent expenditures. Section 608(e)(1) limited \n     individual and group expenditures ``relative to a clearly \n     identified candidate'' to $1,000 per year. The Court, in \n     analyzing the constitutional validity of the $1,000 limit to \n     independent expenditures by groups and individuals, focused \n     first on the issue of unconstitutional vagueness. The Court \n     noted that although the terms ``expenditure,'' ``clearly \n     identified,'' and ``candidate'' were all defined in the \n     statute, the term ``relative to'' a candidate was not \n     defined. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 41. The Court found this \n     undefined term to be impermissibly vague. Id. at 41. Due to \n     the vagueness problem, the Court construed the phrase \n     ``relative to'' a candidate to mean ``advocating the election \n     or defeat of'' a candidate. Id. at 42.\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\n       Significantly, the Court did not adopt a limiting \n     construction of the term ``expenditure,'' which appears in a \n     definitional section of the statute at section 591(f). \n     Rather, the Court narrowly construed only section 608(e). Id. \n     at 44 (``in order to reserve the provision against \n     invalidation on vagueness grounds, Sec. 608(e)(1) must be \n     construed to apply only to expenditures for communications \n     that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate for federal office.''). The \n     limitations under section 608(e) apply only to individuals \n     and groups. Id. at 39-40. Political parties and federal \n     candidates have separate expenditure limits that did not use \n     the ``relative to a clearly identified candidate'' language, \n     see Sec. Sec. 608(c) & (f), which was found to be problematic \n     in section 608(e)(1).\n       The Court, having solved the statute's vagueness problem, \n     next turned to the question of whether section 608(e)(1), as \n     narrowly construed by the Court, nevertheless continued to \n     impermissibly burden the speaker's constitutional right of \n     free expression. The Court found the government's interest in \n     preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption, \n     although adequate to justify contribution limits, was \n     nevertheless inadequate to justify the independent \n     expenditure limits. Therefore, the Court held section \n     608(e)(1)'s limitation on independent expenditures \n     unconstitutional, even as narrowly construed.\n       In sum, in this portion of its opinion, the Buckley Court \n     did not adopt a new definition of the term ``expenditure'' \n     for all of FECA. Rather, the Court held that the limits on \n     independent expenditures imposed on individuals and groups \n     should be narrowly construed to apply only to ``express \n     advocacy,'' and that these limits were nevertheless \n     unconstitutional even as so limited. Because the limits on \n     independent expenditures in section 608(e) were ultimately \n     struck down by the Court, the narrowing construction of that \n     section became, in a practical sense, irrelevant.\n       The only other portion of the Buckley decision that raises \n     the ``express advocacy'' narrowing construction is the \n     Court's discussion of reporting and disclosure requirements \n     under FECA section 434(e). It is here that the Court makes it \n     absolutely clear, in unambiguous language, that political \n     committees and candidates are not entitled to the benefit of \n     the narrowing ``express advocacy'' construction earlier \n     discussed in section 608(e).\n       The Court begins its discussion of reporting and disclosure \n     requirements, by noting that such requirements, ``as a \n     general matter, directly serve substantial governmental \n     interests.'' Buckley, 424 U.S. at 68. After concluding that \n     minor parties and independents are not entitled to a blanket \n     exemption from FECA's reporting and disclosure requirements, \n     the Court moved on to a general discussion of section 434(e).\n       As introduced by the Court, ``Section 434(e) requires \n     `[e]very person (other than a political committee or \n     candidate) who makes contributions or expenditures' \n     aggregating over $100 in a calendar year `other than by \n     contribution to a political committee or candidate' to file a \n     statement with the Commission.'' Id. 74-75 (emphasis added). \n     The Court noted that this provision does not require the \n     disclosure of membership or contribution lists; rather, it \n     requires disclosure only of what a person or group actually \n     spends or contributes. Id. at 75.\n       The Buckley Court noted that the Court of Appeals had \n     upheld section 434(e) as necessary to enforce the independent \n     expenditure ceiling discussed above--section 608(e). Id. at \n     75. The Supreme Court, having just struck down these \n     independent expenditure limits, concluded that the appellate \n     court's rationale would no longer suffice. Id. at 76. \n     However, the Buckley Court concluded that section 434(e) was \n     ``not so intimately tied'' to section 608(e) that it could \n     not stand on its own. Id. at 76. Section 434(e), which \n     predated the enactment of section 608(e) by several years, \n     was an independent effort by Congress to obtain ``total \n     disclosure'' of ``every kind of political activity.'' Id. at \n     76.\n       The Court concluded that Congress, in its effort to be all-\n     inclusive, had drafted the disclosure statute in a manner \n     that raised vagueness problems. Id. at 76. Section 434(e) \n     required the reporting of ``contributions'' and \n     ``expenditures.'' These terms were defined in parallel FECA \n     provisions in sections 431 (e) and (f) as using money or \n     other valuable assets ``for the purpose of . . . \n     influencing'' the nomination or election of candidates for \n     federal office. Id. at 77. The Court found that the phrase \n     ``for the purpose of . . . influencing'' created ambiguity \n     that posed constitutional problems. Id. at 77.\n       In order to eliminate this vagueness problem, the Court \n     then went back to its earlier discussions of \n     ``contributions'' and ``expenditures.'' The Court construed \n     the term ``contribution'' in section 434(e) in the same \n     manner as it had done when it upheld FECA's contribution \n     limits. Id. at 78. It next considered whether to adopt the \n     same limiting construction of ``expenditure'' that it had \n     adopted when construing section 608(e)'s limits on \n     independent expenditures by individuals and groups.\n       ``When we attempt to define `expenditure' in a similarly \n     narrow way we encounter line-drawing problems of the sort we \n     faced in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 608(e)(1) (1970 ed., Supp. IV). \n     Although the phrase, `for the purpose of . . . influencing' \n     an election or nomination, differs from the language used in \n     Sec. 608(e)(1), it shares the same potential for encompassing \n     both issue discussion and advocacy of a political result. The \n     general requirement that `political committees' and \n     candidates disclose their expenditures could raise similar \n     vagueness problems, for ``political committee'' is defined \n     only in terms of amount of annual ``contributions'' and \n     ``expenditures,'' and could be interpreted to reach groups \n     engaged purely in issue discussion. The lower courts have \n     construed the words ``political committee'' more narrowly. \n     To fulfill the purposes of the Act they need only \n     encompass organizations that are under the control of a \n     candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination \n     or election of a candidate. Expenditures of candidates and \n     of ``political committees'' so construed can be assumed to \n     fall within the core area sought to be addressed by \n     Congress. They are, be definition, campaign related.\n       ``But when the maker of the expenditures is not within \n     these categories--when it is an individual other than a \n     candidate or a group other than a political committee--the \n     relation of the information sought to the purposes of the Act \n     may be too remote. To insure that the reach of Sec. 434(e) is \n     not impermissibly broad, we construe ``expenditure'' for \n     purposes of that section in the same way we construed the \n     terms of Sec. 608(e)--to reach only funds used for \n     communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat \n     of a clearly identified candidate''. Id. at 79-80 (footnotes \n     omitted) (emphasis added).\n       The Court in Buckley could not have been more clear. When \n     applied to a speaker that is neither a political candidate \n     nor a political committee, the term ``expenditure'' in \n     section 434(e) must be narrowly construed under the ``express \n     advocacy'' standard. However, when applied to organizations \n     that have as a major purpose the nomination or election of a \n     candidate, the ``express advocacy'' limiting construction \n     simply does not apply. The activities of these groups are, by \n     definition, campaign related, and legitimately subject to \n     regulation under FECA.\n       This, of course, is the only sensible reading of FECA. To \n     suggest that political candidates, political parties, or \n     political committees can escape FECA's regulatory reach by \n     merely eschewing the use of express words of advocacy, \n     reduces the law to meaninglessness. It may be necessary, as \n     the Court held, to give advocacy groups that are not \n     primarily engaged in campaign-related activity a bright-line \n     test that will enable them to avoid regulatory scrutiny. But \n     organizations whose very purpose is to influence federal \n     elections need no such safety net, and have not been given \n     one.\n\n\n        implications for regulation of section 527 organizations\n\n       FECA's definition of a ``political committee'' mirrors the \n     Internal Revenue Service's definition of a Section 527 \n     ``political organization.'' Under FECA, a ``political \n     committee'' is, among other things, ``any committee, club, \n     association, or other group of persons which . . . makes \n     expenditures aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a \n     calendar year.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 431(4)(A). The term \n     ``expenditures'' includes, among other things, ``any \n     purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, gift \n     of money or anything of value, made by any person for the \n     purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 431(9)(A)(i) (emphasis added).\n       Under the Internal Revenue Code, a Section 527 political \n     organization is defined as ``a party, committee, association, \n     fund, or other organization (whether or not incorporated) \n     organized and operated primarily for the purpose of directly \n     or indirectly accepting contributions or making expenditures, \n     or both, for an exempt function.'' 26 U.S.C. Sec. 527(e)(1) \n     (emphasis added). An ``exempt function'' within the meaning \n     of section 527 ``means the function of influencing or \n     attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, \n     or appointment of any individual to any Federal, State, or \n     local public office of office in a political organization, or \n     the election of Presidential or Vice-Presidential electors, \n     whether or not such individual or electors are selected, \n     nominated, elected, or appointed.'' 26 U.S.C. Sec. 527(e)(2) \n     (emphasis added).\n       Thus, any organization that is a Section 527 organization \n     is, by definition, organized and operated primarily for the \n     purpose of ``influencing or attempting to influence the \n     selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any \n     individual'' to public office. See 26 U.S.C. Sec. 527(e)(2). \n     Such an organization satisfies the ``major purpose'' standard \n     established by the Supreme Court in Buckley, and may \n     therefore be subject to reasonable public disclosure of its \n     sources of funding for its political activities. Buckley \n     offered protection to issue-oriented speakers and groups that \n     are not organized for the explicit purpose of influencing \n     election outcomes. Section 527 organizations, however, are \n     subject to reasonable mandatory public disclosure \n     requirements by virtue of their central mission.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       There is no question that the Supreme Court in Buckley was \n     concerned with protecting the rights of advocacy groups and \n     individuals to engage in constitutionally protected ``issue \n     advocacy.'' The Court was particularly concerned that the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act, as written, would become a \n     trap for unwary or unsophisticated political speakers. \n     However, the Court also recognized that there are some groups \n     of speakers--political candidates, political parties, and \n     political committees--whose major purpose is engaging in \n     electoral politics. For\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\n     these speakers, there is no danger of trapping the unwary, \n     and thus, the Court provided them with no special \n     constitutional protection. The actions of political \n     candidates, political parties, and political committees are \n     assumed to be campaign-related, and they are therefore \n     appropriately subject to federal disclosure laws.\n       In order to qualify for tax exempt status under Section 527 \n     of the Internal Revenue Code, an organization's primary \n     purpose must be to influence election outcomes. Because a \n     Section 527 organization is, by definition, primarily engaged \n     in political activity, it satisfies the ``major purpose'' \n     test promulgated in Buckley. Thus, there is no constitutional \n     impediment to subjecting Section 527 Committees to reasonable \n     disclosure laws. The ``express advocacy'' protections that \n     the Supreme Court promulgated in order to protect unwary \n     political speaker, as the Court itself explicitly recognized, \n     have no applicability in the context of an organization whose \n     primary purpose is engaging in electoral politics. Senate \n     Bill 2582, which clarifies that tax exemption under Section \n     527 is available only to organizations regulated as \n     ``political committees'' under FECA, as well as the more \n     limited Senate Bill 2583, which simply requires public \n     disclosure from Section 527 organizations, will both \n     withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                             E. Joshua Rosenkranz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, while I support the objectives of this \nlegislation, I regret that the Senate has chosen to rush ahead with a \nvote on this matter without following the customary Senate procedure. \nThis bill should have been referred to its committee of jurisdiction, \nthe Committee on Finance, and that committee ought to have had the \nopportunity to consider all its implications.\n  In fact, Chairman Roth and I agreed to schedule a hearing on this \nmatter for July 12. We contacted election and tax law experts to ask \ntheir opinions regarding fundamental questions surrounding Section 527 \norganizations.\n  As we thought, there are constitutional questions, and the \npossibility of unintended consequences that might result from this or \nsimilar legislation. The careful examination that Senator Roth and I \nhad planned is going to be cut short by our actions today. Without that \ncareful examination, we can only hope that our conduct will withstand \njudicial scrutiny and not create additional problems.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nMcCain, Feingold and Lieberman in voting to send to the President H.R. \n4762, a bill that hopefully will lead to closing one of the gaping \nloopholes in our Federal campaign finance laws. I use the words ``lead \nto'' because we aren't closing the so-called 527 loophole here today--\nwe are forcing the disclosure of the contributors who use the loophole. \nJust as the disclosure of soft money hasn't yet ended the soft money \nloophole, this disclosure won't automatically close the 527 loophole. \nMost of our reform work lies ahead. But, our action today will \nhopefully give us momentum toward ending both the Section 527 loophole \nand the soft money loophole.\n  Having been in the Senate over 20 years, now, I've witnessed how slow \nand frustrating the legislative process can be, and I've also witnessed \nhow we as an institution can come together quickly and directly when we \nsee a compelling need to do so. Senators Lieberman, Daschle, McCain, \nFeingold and I introduced legislation in the Senate, similar to H.R. \n4762, in April of this year. With the upcoming November elections we \nwere ever aware of the explosion in sham issue ad campaigns by \nanonymous contributors across the country that the public was going to \nexperience this year without Section 527 reform. We wanted to beat the \nclock and get this legislation in place in time to have an effect on \nthis year's campaigns.\n  With the leadership of a committed group in the House, and a \nsignificant bipartisan majority supporting such reform in the Senate, \nwe have been able to do that. I commend the many dedicated House \nmembers and Senators who worked to bring this vote about over the past \nfew weeks. The reforms we are passing today will have a meaningful \neffect on the campaigns being run this year.\n  The Section 527 loophole allows undisclosed, unlimited contributions. \nThese are stealth contributions--tens of millions of dollars of stealth \ncontributions that are off the campaign finance radar screen. How does \nthat happen--that an organization that claims--on its own--to exist for \nthe purpose of influencing an election can receive unlimited \ncontributions and kept them secret? Well, it happens because these \norganizations seeking a tax exemption under Section 527 of the Internal \nRevenue Service Code say one thing to the IRS to get the tax exemption \nand say the opposite to the Federal Election Commission to avoid having \nto register as a political committee.\n  The Internal Revenue Service Code defines an organization subject to \na tax exemption under Section 527 as an organization, ``influencing or \nattempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or \nappointment of any individual to any Federal, State or local public \noffice . . .'' The Federal Election Campaign Act defines a political \ncommittee which is subject to regulation by the FEC and that means \ndisclosure as an organization that spends or receives money ``for the \npurpose of influencing any election for Federal office.'' So people \ncreating these organizations are claiming, with a straight face, that \nthey are trying to influence an election in order to get the benefits \nof one agency while representing they are not trying to influence an \nelection in order to avoid the requirements of another. We often say, \n``You can't have it both ways,'' but persons forming these \norganizations, Mr. President, turn that saying on its head. They are, \nso far, having it both ways, and our campaign finance system and the \nrespect and trust of the American people in our elections and \ngovernment are paying the price.\n  Section 527 was created by Congress in the 1970's to provide a \ncategory of tax exempt organizations for political parties and \npolitical committees. While contributions to a political party or \npolitical committee are not tax deductible, Congress did provide for a \ntax exemption for money contributed and spent on political activities \nby an organization created for the purpose of influencing elections. At \nthe time Congress established the tax exemption, it assumed that such \norganizations would be filing with the FEC under the campaign finance \nlaws for the obvious reason that the language for both coverage by the \nIRS and coverage by the FEC were the same--``influencing an election.'' \nConsequently it was assumed that Section 527 didn't need to require \ndisclosure with the IRS, since the FEC disclosure was considerably more \ncomplete.\n  The legislation before us would require Section 527 organizations to \nfile a tax return, something they are not required to do now, and \ndisclose the basic information about their organization as well as \ntheir contributors over $200.\n  As good and important as this bill is, however, it does not stop the \nunlimited aspect of these secret contributions, nor the unlimited \ncontributions permitted through the soft money loophole. This victory \ntoday is but one battle in the overall campaign to enact the McCain-\nFeingold bill, and I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues to make that happen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to address an issue of \nimportance with respect to the 527 disclosure debate, and that is the \nconstitutionality of H.R. 4762. I assert that the 527 disclosure \nlegislation is Constitutional.\n  Among other things, the legislation requires 527 organizations \nclaiming tax exempt status to disclose their members who make \nsignificant contributions to support the 527's political advocacy. Some \nopponents maintain that the legislation runs afoul of the Supreme Court \nruling in NAACP v. Alabama, where as most of you know, the NAACP was \nprotected from having to disclose its membership list to the Alabama \ngovernment\n  The 527 disclosure legislation complies with the Constitution's \nprotection of freedom of association upheld in NAACP v. Alabama. It \ndoes not require the disclosure of membership rosters, per se, just the \nmembers who are making politically related donations. More important, \nit does not constitute a significant restraint on members' rights to \nassociate freely.\n  It is important to note that the circumstances are different here \nthan those that surrounded the Alabama government's treatment of the \nNAACP during the 1950's and 1960's. The Supreme Court recognized that \nthe members of the NAACP had every right to be concerned for their own \nand their families' safety if their identities were\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\npublicly disclosed. The prospect of public identification would have \nsignificantly discouraged people of color from joining the NAACP. While \npolitical contributors to 527 organizations may prefer to avoid public \nscrutiny, they have no need to fear for their lives as a result of that \nscrutiny.\n  That said, public safety is by no means the principal standard by \nwhich the 527 disclosure legislation will be judged. In the NAACP v. \nAlabama decision, the Supreme Court acknowledges that a valid \ngovernmental purpose must be weighed against the tendency for the \ndisclosure requirement to abridge an individual's freedom of \nassociation. The decision emphasized that the governmental purpose for \ndisclosure--in this case to prevent corruption of the American \npolitical system--must be achieved in the most narrow manner possible.\n  Like our Congressional leaders, I believe the more disclosure the \nbetter--as long as the associated requirements are constitutional. \nFocusing narrowly on 527 organizations is one thing that sets H.R. 4762 \napart from the Smith-McConnell legislation, to ensure that the \nlegislation survives a constitutional test. I would like to submit a \ncopy of the Smith-McConnell legislation, the Tax-Exempt Political \nDisclosure Act, into the record.\n  The Smith-McConnell legislation sweeps in business and labor \norganizations. As I said, disclosing their political activities is a \nlaudable goal. I have advocated a similar approach, but one that would \ninclude bright line tests to determine precisely when contributions and \nexpenditures would have to be disclosed. Those bright line tests, such \nas limiting the disclosure requirement to a time period close to an \nelection, are lacking in the Smith-McConnell bill.\n  Unlike business and labor organizations, which engage in activities \ncompletely unrelated to elections, 527's are clearly political \norganizations. 527 organizations by law must have the function of \ninfluencing or attempting to influence elections. The Supreme Court in \nthe Buckley decision upheld federal disclosure laws for these types of \norganizations. When it comes to disclosure laws for business and labor \norganizations, concerns about vagueness and overbreadth come into play.\n  527 organizations proliferated during the primary campaign season. \nMany had obscure names that made it hard to guess even the types of \nmembers funding political advocacy on behalf of each 527, much less \ntheir identities. Contrary to the 527's, most labor and business \norganizations have established identities, and clear-cut positions and \npurposes that go beyond funding issue ads. Since we have no window into \nthe world of 527's, a disclosure requirement is more valid when \ncompared with a disclosure requirement affecting labor and business \norganizations.\n  Unlike most, if not all, labor and business organizations, there is \nno way to determine how many members there are in a 527. In the example \nI often cite, there were only two contributors, each funneling what \nappears to be at least one million dollars into the accounts to be used \nfor campaign advocacy. While we may have no idea how many contributors \nthere are in a 527, or how much each contributed, you can bet their \nfavored candidates know.\n  In a press conference announcing introduction of his bill, Senator \nMcConnell admits the ``dubious constitutionally'' of his proposal. In \norder to regain the American public's trust, it is important that we \nsupport a proposal we feel confident will withstand the Court's \nscrutiny. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation \nsent to us by the House concerning disclosure for so-called ``Section \n527 organizations''.\n  I want to thank the efforts of those involved in making this day a \nreality, and that includes a bipartisan group from both sides of the \naisle and both sides of the Hill who have taken a leadership role in \nworking toward restoring Americans' faith in its election system. \nSenator McCain's herculean efforts and leadership on this issue have \nmade today's vote possible. In addition, Senator Feingold's leadership \nhas been invaluable, and Senators Lieberman and Jeffords and \nCongressmen Shays, Meehan, and Castle, have worked very hard to ensure \nthat this legislation was both considered and passed.\n  I believe that disclosure of campaign activities is the most \nfundamental component of campaign finance reform. On the one hand, \nproponents of measures like the McCain-Feingold bill point to greater \ndisclosure as part and parcel of additional reforms. On the other hand, \nopponents have argued that, rather than more comprehensive reforms, \nwhat we really need is simply more disclosure on what we already have. \nSo disclosure should be common ground where we can all come together, a \npoint proved by the overwhelming support for disclosure of 527 \norganizations in the House on a vote of 385-39.\n  As we know, these organizations have incorporated under the 527 \nsection of the tax code to get tax exempt status to influence federal \nelections, but then they argue to the Federal Elections Commission that \nfor their purposes these organizations aren't influencing federal \nelections, simply because they don't expressly advocate for the \nelection or defeat of a particular candidate.\n  Right now, they don't have to disclose any of their activity--who \nthey are, where they get their funding, and where they spend their \nmoney. Under this legislation, they will have to disclose on all their \nactivities, and because political activities are all they do, that is \nas it should be.\n  It has also been expressed that if we are to target 527's, we should \nalso have increased disclosure for other organizations that engage in \npolitical activities. And I couldn't agree more. Because the American \npeople ought to know who these groups are, their major sources of \nfunding, and where they are spending their money if they are working to \ninfluence a federal election. It's that simple.\n  Prior to this vote on 527's, we were working on legislation that \nwould do just that--a bipartisan, bicameral measure that would satisfy \nthe concerns that have also been raised about the scope of disclosure--\nthat it not be so broad as to cover all manner of activities that have \nnothing to do with elections.\n  So we crafted a bill that was neither overly broad or vague. We \nnarrowly and clearly defined political activities as those that mention \na candidate for office, targeted specifically to the candidate's \nelectorate, within a time frame near an election. And we only targeted \nlarge-scale communications so grassroots organizations will not be \naffected.\n  Our framework for this expanded disclosure drew from an amendment \nthat Senator Jeffords and I, along with Senators McCain, Feingold, \nLieberman, and others, developed and introduced in early 1998. Based on \na proposal developed and advanced by constitutional scholars, our \nmeasure was designed to withstand constitutional scrutiny, address some \nof the most egregious campaign abuses, and focus on areas where we know \nthe Supreme Court has already allowed us to go--like disclosure.\n  We've already been to the Senate floor twice with this language, and \nI'm proud to say that the constitutional arguments made against our \nprovision quite simply didn't hold water. And a majority of the Senate \nwent on record in support of our provision.\n  In short, the three major provisions of the bill we were working on \ncould be summed up as follows--disclosure, disclosure, and, finally, \ndisclosure. That's what we're talking about here--sunlight, not \ncensorship. Not speech rationing, but information.\n  I cannot emphasize enough that our effort would not have prevented \nanyone from making any kind of communication at any time saying \nanything they want. All we said is, if you're attempting to influence a \nfederal election, we ought to know who you are, your major sources of \nfunding, and where you're spending your money.\n  As the Brennan Center for Justice stated to me in a letter I had \nincluded in the Record in our first debate on Snowe-Jeffords, and I \nquote, ``As the Supreme Court has observed, disclosure rules do not \nrestrict speech significantly. For that reason, the Supreme Court has \nmade clear that rules requiring disclosure are subject to less exacting \nconstitutional strictures than direct prohibitions on spending.'' So if \nthe Congress is truly serious about increased disclosure, there is no \nreason\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nwhy they should be able to support our approach.\n\n  The fact is, we all have to disclose as candidates, and we should. Is \nit unreasonable when we know groups running ads or sending out mass \nmailings to the public are influencing federal elections to ask them to \ndisclose as well?\n  We know, for instance, that in the 1995-1996 election cycle, the \nAnnenberg Public Policy Center estimates that between $135 to $150 \nmillion was spent by outside groups not associated with candidates on \ntelevision ads. In the last cycle, that number jumped to between $275 \nto $350 million--more than double. But what we don't know is how much \nis being spent on efforts like mass mailings or phone banks, or who is \nfunding them, and this legislation is designed to tell us.\n  As for those so-called issue ads, if any doubt remains about the real \nintent of many of the broadcast ads we see, the Brennan Center recently \nreleased a report on television advertising in the 1998 congressional \nelections. What did they find? When all the ads were evaluated in terms \nof how many within two months of the general election were actually \npolitical ads and how many were simply discussing issues or \nlegislation, 82 percent were seen as campaign ads. Eighty-two percent. \nThere's no question what these ads are attempting to do--yet, under \ncurrent law, they fly right under the radar screen.\n  So, in short, our bipartisan approach got at the largest abuses while \nanswering the critics who say that what's good for the 527 \norganizations are good for other groups and unions and corporations as \nwell. Unfortunately, we did not reach agreement with the House on such \nan approach this year--but our work generated momentum for \nconsideration and passage of this 527 bill. And we must look at this as \na significant first step. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to \nbuild on this legislation with the broader approach of Snowe-Jeffords.\n  The passage of this bill should also make it that much more difficult \nfor those who supported it to now go back and say we shouldn't have \ngreater disclosure for other groups engaging in political activities \nwhen Snowe-Jeffords is introduced next year. In other words, what we \nhave done with this legislation is to throw a boulder in what has until \nthis point been the still and brackish pond of the campaign finance \nstatus quo, and the ripple effect will continue expanding ever outward.\n  Again, I want to thank everyone involved in this great victory and I \nhope we will move forward to expand our efforts on campaign finance \nreform in the next Congress.\n\n\n                        internal revenue service\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I understand that this legislation would allow the \nSecretary of the Treasury to partner with other Federal agencies, \nprincipally the Federal Election Commission, in a manner similar to \nthat contemplated under the bill reported by the Ways and Means \nCommittee. Is that understanding correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct. We want to allow the Internal Revenue \nService to enforce these disclosure rules with the assistance and \ncooperation of the Federal Election Commission.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as sponsor, I would like to make the final \ncomments.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this debate has come a long way from \nthe days of trying to regulate the speech of politicians and other \nmajor players on the American political scene. Just a few years ago, \nfolks on the other side of the aisle were trying to get taxpayer \nfunding for elections, spending limits for campaigns, and regulation of \nany group that mentioned a candidate in an ad two months before an \nelection day. As recently as last year, there were measures being \ndebated in the Senate that would have devastated the Republican Party \nin trying to compete with the Democrats and with well-funded outside \ngroups who are almost wholly and completely affiliated with the \nDemocrats--groups such as the labor unions, the plaintiffs' lawyers, \nthe Sierra Club, and the League of Conservation Voters.\n  This particular bill before us will not put Republicans at a \ndisadvantage in this fall election. And, of course, it will not put \nDemocrats at any disadvantage because it doesn't affect their political \naffiliates, the unions and the trial lawyers. In fact, it's hard to \ntell exactly who will be put at a disadvantage by this bill because \nthere are so few groups that will actually be impacted. So, in many \nrespects, it is a relatively benign and harmless bill.\n  But, let me be clear, there is an important constitutional principle \nat stake here--even though it may only affect a handful of groups in \nthis country. This bill takes us down the constitutionally dubious path \nof disclosure related to issue advocacy, which the Supreme Court has \nsaid, falls outside of the boundaries of government regulation. In \nfact, the federal courts following Buckley v. Valeo have routinely \nstruck down attempts to regulate speech that does not expressly \nadvocate the election or defeat of a federal candidate. Just two weeks \nago, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the latest attempt \nto regulate issue advocacy as a clear violation of the First Amendment. \nNevertheless, I say to my Republican colleagues, particularly those who \nare up for election this year, that is a pretty hard argument to \nexplain in a political campaign. The constitutional distinction between \nissue advocacy and express advocacy is complex and does not get reduced \nto a campaign commercial very easily.\n  So in light of the limited impact of this relatively benign bill, I \nrecommend to my Republican colleagues that they vote for this bill. I \nwill not be voting for it because I do think the constitutional law in \nthis area is rather clear. But, ultimately, this is not a spear worth \nfalling on 4 months in advance of an election. This vote will insulate \nthem against absurd charges that they are in favor of secret campaign \ncontributions or Chinese money or mafia money.\n  With regard to the few groups who may be in the 527 area, they will \nhave a choice to make, either to no longer be organized under section \n527 or to go to court. And, these groups will have to weigh the costs \nand make that choice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, indeed, marks a seminal day in the \nbattle to reform our electoral system and restore the faith of the \nAmerican citizenry that ours is a government of and for the people. \nThis is a vote for campaign finance reform. If the Senate approves this \nlegislation, it will be the first campaign finance reform bill to \nbecome law in 21 long years. It will be action that is long overdue.\n  Whether we want to admit the fact or not, perception has an \nunfortunate tendency to become reality. And the American people \nperceive the Congress as controlled by the monied special interests. If \nwe are to ensure the public's faith in its Government, we must \nobliterate that perception. This bill, although admittedly a very small \nstep, is a step towards ending that perception. This is a step we \nshould be proud to take.\n  This bill will not solve what is wrong with our campaign finance \nsystem. It will not do away with the millions of soft money dollars \nthat are polluting our elections. We must yet undertake the task of \ndoing away with soft money and make our Government more accountable to \nthe people we represent.\n  It will give the public information regarding one especially \npernicious weapon that is being used in modern campaigns. It is an \negregious and outrageous insult to the very principles of how \ndemocracies function.\n  The bill is fair. It affects both parties. It affects interests on \nboth sides of the aisle. It stifles no speech. It curbs no individual's \nrights, and it is clearly constitutional. If the Senate approves it \ntoday, it will become law, and the American people will be well served.\n  Before I close, I again thank the many who were involved with this \nissue. Many in the House courageously fought to pass this legislation. \nI thank and note again Congressmen Chris Shays, Marty Meehan, Mike \nCastle, Lindsey Graham, and Amo Houghton who all worked tirelessly on \nthis legislation. If it were not for their courage and tenacity, we \nwould not have this legislation before the Senate today.\n  In the Senate, a bipartisan coalition of those who believe in reform \nrefused to relent on this matter: Senators Snowe and Levin played key \nroles in\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\nensuring we move forward. Of course, I must pay special note of all the \nwork done by Senators Lieberman and Feingold. I am proud not only to \ncall them friends but partners in this crusade to return the Government \nto the people. I could be in no better company.\n  As I noted last night to all those who believe in reform, today is \nonly the first step, but it is a great first step and it is, indeed, a \ngreat day for democracy and a Government that is accountable to the \ngoverned. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 25 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Connecticut \nbe allowed to speak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nArizona whom I have come to call our commanding officer in the war for \ncampaign finance reform. I am proud to serve under him.\n  In this long struggle to cleanse our campaign finance system, we are \nabout to achieve a victory. In a campaign finance system that is wildly \nand dangerously out of control today, we are about to draw a line. We \nare about to establish some controls based on the best of America's \nnational principles.\n  The campaign finance reform adopted after the Watergate scandal had \ntwo fundamental principles: that contributions to political campaigns \nbe limited, and that they be fully disclosed.\n  These so-called 527 organizations totally violate and undermine both \nof those principles. Individuals, corporations, and associations can \ngive unlimited amounts to 527 organizations, and those contributions \nare absolutely secret, unknown to the public.

Mr. President, first, I commend my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle for their persistence in negotiating a Section 527 \ndisclosure bill that has passed both chambers of Congress. The \noverwhelming vote in both the House and Senate in support of H.R. 4762, \na bill mirroring a successful amendment we made to the Defense \nAuthorization bill several weeks ago, is an important step in fixing \nour broken campaign finance reform system.\n  Both parties have now acknowledged that some change in our campaign \nfinance laws is warranted, the first such legislative consensus on this \nissue since technical changes were made in 1979 to the Federal Election \nCampaign Act of 1974.\n  A majority has agreed that Section 527 organizations need to both \nfollow federal campaign law and to file tax returns. H.R. 4762, like \nour amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, requires Section 527s \nto disclose any contributors who give more than $200, and report any \nexpenditures of more than $500. Unlike our original amendment, it \nrequires a Section 527 organization that fails to disclose \ncontributions and expenditures to the IRS to pay a penalty tax on the \namounts it failed to disclose. The amendment we made to the Defense \nAuthorization bill would have removed a Section 527's tax exempt status \nfor the same violation. Although not as severe a penalty, I believe \nthat this change in the House version of this legislation does reflect \nthe spirit of the original Senate amendment.\n  Although disclosure is only part of the solution, the passage of H.R. \n4762 ensures that the public understands what these committees are, who \ngives them their money, and how they spend that money to impact \nelection outcomes. This law, once signed by the President, will close a \nmajor loophole and stop these stealth PACs from skirting campaign \nfinance requirements, and I was pleased to vote in support of it. \nHowever, we still have much to do.\n  We cannot, and must not, rest with this vote today. Our campaign \nfinance system still needs major overhaul if we are going to reduce the \ninfluence of almost unlimited amounts of campaign cash on our electoral \nsystem. Until a majority of our citizens believe again that our \ngovernment is ``by and for'' the people, we cannot stop our battle to \nreform this process. We need to pass a ban on soft money, reduce \nskyrocketing campaign expectations, and return our electoral process to \nthe people, where it belongs. The power in our country should rest with \nthe vote, not with the purse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6047-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6047-S6056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n                 RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nrequire.\n  Mr. President, this week, we got our first glimpse of the first rough \ndraft of the human genetic code.\n  The public-private partnership known as the Human Genome Project is \nthe genetic equivalent of putting man on the moon.\n  By decoding our genetic makeup, researchers may soon discover how to \ncure and even prevent heart disease, cancer, birth defects, and other \nserious medical conditions.\n  We have every reason to be hopeful about this breakthrough. But we \nalso have some reason to be concerned, because genetic information--\nused improperly--can also cause great harm.\n  Improvements in genetic testing can determine whether a person has an \nincreased chance of developing breast cancer, or colon cancer, or some \nother serious illness--years before symptoms even appear.\n  In the right hands, that information could save your life. In the \nwrong hands, that same information could be used to deny you insurance, \na mortgage, or even a job.\n  We need to make sure this new research--which has been funded largely \nby American taxpayers--is used to help America's families, not hurt \nthem. That is the goal of this amendment.\n  Francis Collins probably knows more about the potential of genetic \ntesting than anyone in the world. He is the head of the international \nresearch team that makes up the Human Genome Project.\n  Listen to what Dr. Collins said on Monday, the day the results of the \nfirst phase of the Human Genome Project were unveiled:\n\n       Genetic discrimination in insurance and the workplace is \n     wrong and it ought to be prevented by effective federal \n     legislation.\n\n  He added:\n\n       If we needed a wake-up call to say that it's time to do \n     this, isn't today the wake-up call?\n\n  Dr. Collins is right. It would be an absolute travesty if a test that \ncould save your life ends up costing you your job or your financial \nsecurity.\n  Genetic discrimination isn't just a theoretical possibility. It isn't \njust something that might happen in the future. It is already \nhappening--even without the information the human genome promises to \nuncover.\n  It is already happening to people like Terri Seargent.\n  Terri was a model employee who was moving up the corporate ladder--\nuntil\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\nthe day a test revealed that she carried a gene that might--here I \nemphasize ``might''--make her more susceptible to a potentially fatal \npulmonary condition.\n  Before her employers saw those test results, they used to give Terri \nglowing job performance reviews. But after they saw the results, they \nasked her to resign. She did, because she had no choice, because \ngenetic discrimination is not clearly prohibited--in the workplace, or \nanywhere else.\n  The solution is obvious. Dr. Collins is right. Our laws must keep \npace with advances in science and technology. No one should suffer \ndiscrimination solely because of his or her genetic makeup.\n  Last year, the President signed an executive order outlawing genetic \ndiscrimination in the workplace for Federal employees. It is now time \nto expand these important protections to all Americans.\n  That is why I am offering, along with my colleagues--Senators \nKennedy, Dodd, and Harkin--the Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health \nInsurance and Employment Act as an amendment to this bill.\n  Our bill has three major components:\n  First, it forbids employers from discriminating in hiring, or in the \nterms and conditions of employment, on the basis of genetic \ninformation;\n  Second, it forbids health insurers from discriminating against \nindividuals on the basis of genetic information; and\n  Third, it prevents the disclosure of genetic information to health \ninsurers, health insurance data banks, employers, and anyone else who \nhas no legitimate need for information of this kind.\n  Discrimination based on genetic factors is just as unacceptable as \nthat based on race, national origin, religion, sex or disability. In \neach case, people are treated unfairly, not because of their inherent \nabilities but solely because of irrelevant characteristics.\n  Genetic discrimination, like other forms of discrimination, hurts us \nall. It hurts our economy by keeping talented people out of the \nworkforce and diminishes us as a people. We cannot take one step \nforward in science but two steps back in civil rights.\n  And we will all pay the price in increased health care costs if we \nallow employers or insurers to use genetic information to discriminate. \nIf fear of discrimination stops people from getting genetic tests, \nearly diagnosis and preventative treatments, they may suffer much more \nserious and more expensive health problems in the long run. And we all \nhave to pay for that, as well.\n  Finally, genetic discrimination undercuts the Human Genome Project's \nfundamental purpose of promoting public health. Investing resources in \nthe Human Genome Project is justified by the benefits of identifying, \npreventing and developing effective treatments for disease. But if fear \nof discrimination deters people from genetic diagnosis, our \nunderstanding of the humane genome will be in vain.\n  A CNN/Time Poll released earlier this week, found that a full 80 \npercent of the respondents said genetic information should not be \navailable to insurance companies.\n  And almost half of all Americans believe there will be negative \nconsequences from the Human Genome Project. I think we ought to prove \ntoday that they are wrong.\n  Let us make sure that Americans are not afraid to take advantage of \nbreakthroughs in genetic testing. Dramatic scientific advances should \nnot have negative consequences for our health care.\n  We have an historic opportunity to preempt this problem. Today, \nCongress should expand the scope of its antidiscrimination laws to \ninclude a ban on genetic discrimination. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in supporting this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this week, as the leader has \npointed out, scientists announced the completion of a task that once \nseemed unimaginable; and that is, the deciphering of the entire DNA \nsequence of the human genetic code. This amazing accomplishment is \nlikely to affect the 21st century as profoundly as the invention of the \ncomputer or the splitting of the atom affected the 20th century. I \nbelieve that the 21st century will be the century of life sciences, and \nnothing makes that point more clearly than this momentous discovery. It \nwill revolutionize medicine as we know it today.\n  Already, genetic tests can be used to identify and help those who are \nat risk for disease, and those who are already diagnosed. Scientists \nare using new knowledge gained from the genetic code to design better \ntreatments for cancer, AIDS, depression, and many other conditions and \ndiseases.\n  Tragically, the vast potential of genetic knowledge to improve health \ncare will go unfulfilled it patients fear that information about their \ngenetic characteristics will be used as the basis for job \ndiscrimination or other prejudices. To realize the unprecedented \nopportunities presented by these new discoveries, we must guarantee \nthat private medical information remains private and that genetic \ninformation cannot be used for improper purposes.\n  I commend our leader, Senator Daschle, for offering this important \namendment that would do just that. It would give the American people \nthe protections against genetic discrimination they need and deserve.\n  The amendment would prohibit health insurers and employers from using \npredictive genetic information to discriminate in the health care \nsystem and the workplace. It would bar insurance companies from raising \npremiums or denying patients health care coverage based on the results \nof genetic tests, and prohibit insurers from requiring such tests as a \ncondition of coverage. In the workplace, the amendment would outlaw the \nuse of predictive genetic information for hiring, advancement, salary, \nor other workplace rights and privileges. And, because a right without \na remedy is no right at all, this important measure would provide \npersons who have suffered genetic discrimination in either arena with \nthe right to seek redress through legal action.\n  In too many cases, the hopeful promise of genetic discoveries is \nsquandered, because patients rightly fear that information about their \ngenes will be used against them in the workplace or the health system. \nThat fear is clearly well-founded. Today, employers and insurers can \nand do use this information to deny health coverage, refuse a \npromotion, or reject a job applicant--all in the absence of any \nsymptoms of disease.\n  Although many genetic discoveries and technologies are new, the \nproblems they raise with respect to discrimination in insurance and in \nemployment have been with us for decades.\n  It was clear in 1973 that new developments in genetics had the \npotential for enormous good, as well as significant harm. That's why I \nworked with the scientific community to bring together legal scholars, \nmedical professionals, and scientists at the Asilomar Conference Center \nto assess the risks and benefits of genetics. That conference formed \nthe basis for laws and established procedures for the use of genetic \ntechnology that helped create today's thriving biotechnology industry.\n  It was clear in 1993 and 1996 that genetic tests and information had \nthe potential not only to help patients, but also to harm them. That's \nwhy we included protections against genetic discrimination in the \nHealth Security Act of 1993 and the Kassebaum-Kennedy Act of 1996. \nWhile the Health Security Act did not become law, Kassebaum-Kennedy \ndid. Its protections were an important step forward, but were far from \ncomplete. Insurers can still use genetic information to outright deny \ncoverage or charge outrageous rates to individuals who are currently \nhealthy, but may have a genetic pre-disposition to a particular disease \nor condition.\n  And, with this week's announcement, it is more clear than ever before \nthat in the year 2000 the American people need strong federal laws to \nprotect them against the malicious misuse of genetic data. The century \nmay have changed, but the problem of discrimination hasn't--and neither \nhas my commitment to protect the American people from discrimination in \nall its ugly forms. Discrimination is discrimination whether it's done \nat the ballot box, on a job application, or in the office of an \ninsurance underwriter who denies an otherwise healthy patient\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\nthe health care they need based solely on the result of a genetic test \nor medical history of a family member.\n  This is the same form of discrimination that would be evident on the \nquestion of race. Individuals have virtually no kind of control over \ntheir genetic makeup. What we are saying now is, without these kinds of \nprotections, it will be permissible for insurance companies or for \nemployers to say: I am not going to hire that person because of the \ngenetic makeup they have, because it may mean they are going to get \nsicker over time and cost me in the workplace. Therefore, I am going to \ndeny that person. On the other hand, it will require workers to take \nthe test as a condition for employment. And then if they find that \ntheir genetic makeup demonstrates some kind of proclivity to acquire \nthis kind of disease, they won't hire them. That is what is happening. \nThey are going to find out that the workers are not going to take the \ntest, which is increasingly the case, because they don't want to risk \nnot being hired in a particular employment situation.\n  What happens is, they put themselves at greater risk of getting the \ndisease because they deny themselves all the preventive health care \nthat could keep them healthy and avoid getting sick and being more \nuseful and valuable citizens in the community.\n  Fear of genetic discrimination causes patients to go without needed \nmedical tests. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported \nthat 57 percent of women at risk for breast or ovarian cancer had \nrefused to take a genetic test that could have identified their risk \nfor cancer and assisted them in receiving medical treatment to prevent \nthe onset of these diseases because they feared reprisals for doing so.\n  As the potential for discrimination increases, more and more \nAmericans are becoming concerned about the danger that employers and \ninsurers will misuse and abuse genetic information. Just this week, in \nthe aftermath of the historic completion of the genome sequencing \nproject, a new CNN-Time magazine survey found that 46 percent of \nAmericans believe that sequencing the genome would have harmful \nresults.\n  Surely, using genetic information as a basis for discrimination would \nbe one of the most harmful consequences of this remarkable scientific \naccomplishment. Experts in genetics are virtually unanimous in calling \nfor strong protections to prevent such a misuse of science. Secretary \nShalala's advisory panel on genetic testing--consisting of experts in \nthe fields of law, science, medicine, and business--has recommended \nunambiguously that ``Federal legislation should be enacted to prohibit \ndiscrimination in employment and health insurance based on genetic \ninformation.''\n  Dr. Craig Venter, the president of the company that led the \nprivately-financed genome sequencing effort, has testified before the \nJoint Economic Committee that genetic discrimination is ``the biggest \nbarrier against having a real medical revolution based on this \ntremendous new scientific information.''\n  Without strong protections, the health and welfare of large numbers \nof our fellow citizens will be unfairly at risk. Last week, I was proud \nto stand with Terri Seargeant, a woman who carries a genetic trait that \ncan--if untreated--lead to a lung disease often called ``Alpha-1 \ndeficiency.'' Let me emphasize that this trait only carries the \npotential to develop the lung disease. If persons at risk for the \ndisorder take a simple genetic test and are appropriately treated, they \ncan prevent development of the disease.\n  Terri Seargent is such a person. She received a genetic test that \nrevealed her risk for this disease, and took the preventive measures \nneeded to avoid the onset of symptoms. She worked hard at her job and \nreceived consistently positive performance reviews and salary \nincreases. Nonetheless, her employer--who had access to her medical \nfiles and the records of her genetic tests--decided to terminate this \nhard-working, healthy employee. What are we to conclude except that she \nhad been fired on the basis of her genetic potential for disease?\n  And for every Terri Seargent, who has suffered actual discrimination, \nthere are millions of men and women across the nation who are either at \nrisk of genetic discrimination or fear getting tested because of \npossible reprisals in the workplace or health system.\n  National Human Genome Research Institute, ``Already, with but a \nhandful of genetic tests in common use, people have lost their jobs, \nlost their health insurance, and lost their economic well being because \nof the misuse of genetic information.''\n  Make no mistake: The potential for genetic discrimination is growing. \nAlready DNA ``chips'' are available that can determine a person's \ngenetic traits in only a few minutes. In the near future, genetic tests \nwill become even cheaper and more widely available than they re today. \nIf we do not pass legislation to ban genetic discrimination, it may \nbecome commonplace for an employer to require such tests, and to use \nthe results of these tests to decide which employees to hire or promote \nand which to deny such advancement, based in whole or in part on their \nperceived risk for disease.\n  Even now, some employers require information about a person's genetic \ninheritance as a condition of employment or part of the job application \nprocess. A recent American Management Association survey of more than \n2,000 companies showed that more than 18 percent of companies require \ngenetic tests or family medical history data from employees or job \napplicants. According to the same survey, more than 26 percent of the \ncompanies that require this information use it in hiring decisions.\n  President Clinton recognized the need for employees to be protected \nfrom the dangers of genetic discrimination. In an action of great \nvision and wisdom, President Clinton signed an Executive order on \nFebruary 8 of this year to ban any use of predictive genetic \ninformation as a basis for hiring, firing, promotion or any other \ncondition of employment in the federal workplace. With the stroke of a \npen, the President instituted for federal workers the types of \nprotections that this amendment would provide for all workers and all \npatients.\n  Our amendment is strongly supported by leading patient groups, \nmedical professional societies, and scientists. The need for these \nkinds of protections has been clearly and repeatedly endorsed by the \ntwo leaders of the genome sequencing project and by experts in law, \nmedicine, and science. A host of editorial boards have written in favor \nof congressional action to protect people in this area.\n  In many respects, people's genetic composition is essentially a \nblueprint of their medical past and a crystal ball of the possibilities \nfor their medical future. It is difficult to imagine more personal and \nmore private information. This powerful information should be shared \nbetween patients and their doctors--not their employer and their \ncoworkers.\n  The threat of genetic discrimination faces every American, because \nevery American carries unique genetic characteristics that indicate \nrisk of disease. This is not about Terri Seargent. This is about each \nand every one of us, and everyone we know.\n  The vote cast today in this Chamber will help determine whether the \nsecrets of our DNA will be used for beneficial or for harmful purposes. \nCongress should give the American people the strong and comprehensive \nprotection from genetic discrimination that they need and deserve. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, it is the purpose of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania now to send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, has time expired for the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have asked people on our side who have \nworked on this in the HELP Committee to come over. We believe this \namendment addresses important considerations and the objectives are \nvery valid: to stop discrimination in employment and in health \ncoverage.\n  What we would like to do is have an opportunity to propose a second-\ndegree amendment and then to arrange an orderly debate and have the \nvotes. That\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nis going to take a few minutes for us to accomplish. In the interim, it \nis our hope that we can move along and get a short time agreement on \nthe Ashcroft amendment, to present that and conclude it. By that time, \nour people will be in a position to present the second-degree \namendment. We can figure out a time agreement and move ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely \nright. We need to move on with this issue. However, there are a number \nof people who have come to the floor. We believe it is appropriate they \nbe allowed to complete their statements. It may take a little bit of \ntime. Senator Daschle has agreed at the appropriate time to move on \nthis and to go to something else. But Senator Kennedy would like to \nfinish his statement. There are others who want to speak on this issue. \nWe would like to stay on this issue for a while.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator from \nNevada how long he would like to stay on it--for 15 more minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I think it will take a little more time than that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I could just take 2 more minutes to conclude.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. SPECTER. What I would like to do would be to establish a \nparameter. This is the kind of subject which we could usefully debate \nfor several days. I would like to see what our amendment is on this \nside. We can compare them. Then we are in a position to have a \ndiscussion as to how long we ought to spend. If we are to finish this \nbill this afternoon or even today, we are going to have to move through \nthis amendment. We have other complicated amendments coming up.\n  Mr. REID. That is very appropriate. The Senator from Massachusetts \ndesires another 5 minutes; the Senator from Connecticut, 15 minutes; \nthe Senator from North Dakota, 10 minutes. Senator Harkin also wishes \nto speak.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We just had an offer of 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Kennedy, 5; the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Did my colleague say 5 for Senator Dorgan?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dorgan wishes 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So we have a total of 22 minutes--10, 7, and 5.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, with the understanding that we will come back for \nfurther debate on this issue at a subsequent time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be an \nadditional 22 minutes, at which point we will return to the Ashcroft \namendment. After that, we will present a second-degree amendment and \nwork through the time sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, CBO says the cost \nimpact of this proposal on business is negligible but a destructive \nimpact on individuals and society of the failure to act will be \nimmense.\n  On the part of this proposal that deals with employment, without this \nkind of amendment, those who have been responsible for the breakthrough \nin terms of the sequencing of the gene understand very well, and have \nstated repeatedly, we are going to have a new form of discrimination in \nemployment. We want to avoid that. Two, from a health point of view, if \npeople don't believe they are going to be secure either in employment \nor in getting health insurance, they are not going to take the tests \nand they are going to, therefore, deny themselves the kind of treatment \nthat is going to be available to them in order to remain healthy. So we \nought to take these steps that this amendment includes; it is \nessential.\n  We already know from what is happening today that a number of people \naren't taking these genetic tests because they fear genetic \ndiscrimination. This is one of the most important health issues we are \ngoing to face in this century. It has been identified by those on the \ncutting edge of progress in terms of the sequencing of the gene. We \nshould take their advice and counsel and accept the Daschle amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to address this amendment, but first \nI want to speak to another issue. I know people are meeting on the \nconference report on the emergency supplemental. One of the provisions \nbeing considered is whether to add the Nethercutt language in the House \nsupplemental.\n  I care deeply about a lot of provisions in the supplemental, \nincluding the Colombian aid package, but I want to let my colleagues \nknow I will use whatever parliamentary procedure is available to me if \nthat language comes over on the emergency supplemental. I know we all \nwant to get out of here in the next few days. I care about the bill, \nbut I also care about that language. I think it is wrong for it to be \nincluded in the bill. I want people to know I am serious about this. I \nwill use whatever procedures are available to me when it comes to the \nsupplemental if the Nethercutt language is included. I am going to meet \nwith members of the conference shortly and express that view there as \nwell.\n  I strongly support what Senator Daschle is proposing in his amendment \non genetic discrimination. The world received wonderful news this past \nweek that the genetic code had been deciphered. This discovery is \nbreathtaking in scope, and I suspect over the next 50 years we are \ngoing to see it change the nature of medicine in this country. So it is \nreally a remarkable occurrence, one that has been heralded, and \nproperly so, for giving us the ability to understand ourselves better. \nI applaud the remarkable work done by the NIH and Celera.\n  Why is it important to offer this amendment today in the context of \nthis bill? As we have seen with all the advances in technology, \ngenerally--and it has been a remarkable decade in that sense, with the \nInternet and communications technology--there is a great unease in the \ncountry about how much information people have about us as individuals.\n  We pride ourselves, I suppose, on the notion that we protect privacy \nin this country. It goes back to the founding days of our Republic. The \nright of privacy is as deeply rooted in the American conscience as \nalmost any other principle I can think of. Yet, there is this uneasy \nsense that with the explosion of technology, too many people have too \nmuch information about us that they ought not to have--at least without \nour permission. The idea that people can peer into our financial \nrecords and our medicine cabinets and that information can be \ndisseminated to broad audiences, violating our sense of privacy, is of \ngreat concern. And the genome breakthrough raises similar issues.\n  Let me share with you one anecdote. Last year I visited Yale \nUniversity to hear about some of the genetics research that is being \nconducted there. One of the studies is attempting to determine the \nlikelihood of certain women developing breast cancer by studying twin \ngirls. They are getting to the point where they can determine almost at \nthe birth, the possibility of individuals contracting breast cancer as \nadults. It is incredible information to have. Imagine parents of a \nnewborn baby knowing, because of the genetic makeup of that child, that \nthe baby has a possibility of contracting breast cancer. All of a \nsudden, diets change and lifestyles change. Prevention measures can be \ntaken. These are the kinds of things the deciphering of the genome is \ngoing to be able to do for us.\n  It is wonderful to be able to have that kind of information. But \nimagine just that the information Yale Medical School is uncovering \nbecomes available, as that child gets older, to an employer or to an \ninsurance company--not information that the person has contracted the \ndisease--but just that they might possibly do so. Just that \npredisposition for a certain illnesses can have a devastating impact on \nwhether than individual gets insurance or keeps their job.\n  This amendment says that when it comes to that information--the \npropensity for acquiring these problems--we ought to be able to protect \npeople in their jobs and in their ability to receive or get health \ninsurance.\n  This need not be a partisan issue. Senator Domenici and I, 3 years \nago, introduced legislation similar to this bill. We thought it was \ncritical to bring\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nup and address both insurance and employment discrimination. Two years \nago, many colleagues joined our colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, \nwho also offered strong legislation protecting patients from genetic \ndiscrimination in insurance. We have an opportunity today, with the \nbreakthroughs announced on Monday of this week, to really say as a \nbody--Republicans and Democrats across the board--this is an area where \nwe are going to, early on, establish some ground rules when it comes to \nthe use of genetic information.\n  I see that time has expired in terms of my few minutes.\n  I want our colleagues to know how important this amendment is, and I \nurge them to support it when the vote occurs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, am I to be recognized for 7 minutes? Is \nthat the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had intended to speak about this \namendment. But I am compelled to speak about the point that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut discussed at the start of his comments because it is \nso important, and it is timely.\n  At this moment, I understand there are meetings going on right now \nsomewhere in this building by a small group of people who are dealing \nwith a piece of legislation that was cobbled together around 3 o'clock \nin the morning a couple of days ago dealing with the issue of imposing \nsanctions on food and medicine around the world, and whether that will \nbe added to the supplemental bill that will be considered perhaps later \ntoday or tomorrow. If that is added, in my judgment, it is going to \ncause significant trouble.\n  Here is why: The House leaders have done what I am reminded of as the \n``Moon walk''. You know the Moon walk Michael Jackson used to do. It \nlooked like he was walking forward, but he was actually going backward. \nThat is what they have done with respect to this issue of sanctions.\n  Senator Dodd from Connecticut, myself, and others are saying we ought \nto end the use of sanctions on food and medicine anywhere in the world \nwhere it exists. This country has imposed sanctions on the shipment of \nfood and medicine. It is wrong. When we take aim at dictators, we hit \npoor people and hungry people and sick people. It is not the best of \nwhat America stands for.\n  We ought to end all sanctions on food and medicine. Yet what was done \nin the House of Representatives 2 days ago, in my judgment, comes up \nfar short. In fact, in some areas, it loses ground.\n  I want to point out an article in the Washington Post. I will come \nlater with the legislation itself. But the Washington Post describes \nthis legislator from Florida who opposes eliminating sanctions. She \nsaid the agreement will make it as difficult as possible for such sales \nto take place with respect to Cuba. Why? Because they prohibit private \nfinancing of the sale of food to Cuba. What is that about? It has \nnothing to do with good or common sense. They are not trying to get rid \nof sanctions. It has everything to do with the irrational notion about \nCuba, and that if we can somehow restrict the food and medicine going \nto Cuba, we will enhance America's foreign policy. It is crazy. It \ndoesn't make any sense at all.\n  Here is where we have sanctions: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North \nKorea, and Sudan. These countries are countries that our Government has \ndecided are not behaving properly. I support slapping them with \neconomic sanctions. I do not support including food and medicine in \nthose sanctions.\n  I do not support using food as a weapon. We are trying very hard to \nget rid of this practice of using food as a weapon. Seventy Senators \nvoted last year to stop using food as a weapon.\n  We have a provision in the Senate agriculture appropriations \ncommittee bill that will come to the floor of the Senate within several \nweeks that includes an approach that will eliminate the use of food and \nmedicine as part of our sanctions.\n  I think we ought not give up here. We ought to fight on behalf of our \nfamily farmers and others to say that we want to abolish the use of \nsanctions that include food and medicine.\n  The proposition that was cobbled together over in the House at 2 \no'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning by some people who really do not \nwant to do this, have made it seem as if they have made progress in \nthis area. But, in fact, they have lost ground in a couple of cases, \nand especially with respect to Cuba in a couple of other circumstances. \nThere will be no U.S. sales of food to Cuba. Canadian farmers can sell \nto Cuba. European farmers can sell to Cuba. Venezuelan farmers can sell \nto Cuba.\n\n  Seventy Members of the Senate said we ought to get rid of sanctions \non the shipment of food and medicine--yes, to all countries, including \nCuba. But now we have cobbled together a deal sometime early in the \nmorning by a group of people who are going to apparently put it on a \nsupplemental bill so we will have a circumstance where we don't solve \nthis problem. The proposal that fails to solve this problem was not \ndebated in the House. It was not debated in the Senate. But it was \nconcocted at 3 a.m. in the morning and apparently was stuck on a \nsupplemental appropriations bill. It is the wrong way to do it.\n  I just talked to a farm group that supports this. When I asked them a \nquestion about it, they admitted they had not read the language. They \nread the paper, I guess. The implication was that I was impeding the \nefforts to remove sanctions.\n  Another major farm group has just come out in opposition to it, \nsaying this doesn't solve the problem; let's fight to solve the \nproblem. The problem is that we include medicine and food as part of \nour sanctions.\n  The solution is that this country should not include food and \nmedicine in sanctions that we impose on these countries. We should not \nuse food as a weapon.\n  It is a very simple proposition. Seventy Senators have already \nweighed in in the Senate saying let's stop it. If they would allow a \nvote in the House, they would get 70 percent in the House of \nRepresentatives as well.\n  I hope we will not decide to cave in on this issue. Let's not make \nthe perfect the enemy of the good. But let us at least continue to \nfight. We have some more months in this legislative session. We have a \nprovision coming to the floor of the Senate in about 3 weeks that \nincludes a real effort to stop using food and medicine as part of our \nsanctions. Let's fight for that. Let's not let a couple of people who \nrun the other body decide for us at 3 a.m. in the morning what we were \ngoing to do in this circumstance.\n  Let's stand up and fight for family farmers, and let's fight for the \nmoral principles that this country ought to hold dear. We should not \nuse food and medicine as a weapon any longer. This is not about \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  Both administrations in recent years have used this approach, and \nthey were wrong.\n  The Senate was right last year with 70 votes that said let us stop \nit.\n  And what was put together over in the House is now billed as some \nsort of a compromise. It is not a compromise at all. It falls far short \nof what we ought to expect. Those of us who are clearheaded enough \nbelieve we should not use food and medicine as part of economic \nsanctions in this country.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I urge people to read the bill. Unfortunately, a lot of \npeople do not read the legislation. But if you read this legislation, \nsection 808 imposes a prohibition on financing U.S. assistance. One \npart of this says no more sanctions. Then it says no more sanctions, \nexcept--``Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this law, the export \nof agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices to the \ngovernment of a country''--as of June 1, 2000.\n  These are the countries that have been termed by the Secretary of \nState to be ``terrorist states.'' Those are the very countries. The \nonly countries that we have sanctions against are those countries. The \nvery countries we say we have sanctions against are these countries. If \nyou are on the list on June 1, 2000, none of this law applies.\n  Second, it says on financial assistance that you can't have any \nGovernment support for Libya, Iran, North\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nKorea, and Sudan. And then, on private financing, it says no financing \non the part of the U.S. Government, any State or local government, \nprivate person, or entity--including, I suspect, even foreign \nfinancing.\n  This says if sanctions are coming off, then we eliminate all means of \nfinancing it--both public and private--and we continue with the same \nlist that was in effect June 1, 2000, which lists only countries on \nwhom we have unilateral sanctions.\n  This is a bill that needs more work. The Senate Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee bill is vastly superior to this. It is a \nbipartisan bill that colleagues cosponsored, and it deserves the \nconsideration of this body.\n  For those reasons, I will strenuously object to the sanctions being \nincluded as part of a supplemental.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Daschle \namendment to prohibit genetic discrimination in employment. I commend \nthe Senator for his leadership in this area, and I thank him for \nbringing this amendment to the floor.\n  The issue of genetic discrimination is a timely debate in light of \nthe recent announcement that science has conquered the genetic code. \nThis is a major milestone that brings us closer to finding cure for \ncancer, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinsons, M.S., and a whole host of \nother tragic diseases.\n  The science is moving ahead rapidly, and our standards for the use of \nthat science must not lag behind. We must ensure that genetic \ninformation is not used in discriminatory ways. If we do not take a \nstand prohibiting discrimination based on one's genetic make up, we \ncould jeopardize the benefits offered by science. We must ensure that \nour genetic finger print is used only for good, and not as a tool to \ndiscriminate.\n  I've talked to many women in my state who are concerned about breast \ncancer. They know they should undergo genetic testing to find out if \nthey are predisposed to breast cancer, but they don't. They avoid \ngetting tested because they are afraid that the results could be used \nagainst them and could adversely affect their employment or insurance \ncoverage.\n  They are concerned that if they use the science, it will be used \nagainst them. Enacting a tough federal ban on genetic discrimination \nwill give these women, along with thousands of other people across the \ncountry, the peace of mind that they can take advantage of the latest \ntools of medicine without being taken advantage of in the process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment now. We have made a \nsignificant investment in genetic research. Let's make sure that we all \nbenefit from this investment. If we act now, we will ensure this \ninformation is used to treat patients and not to penalize them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Ashcroft, is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3689\n\n  (Purpose: To protect Social Security and Medicare surpluses through \n             strengthened budgetary enforcement mechanisms)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to address the amendment which I \nsent to the desk because for decades, in a business-as-usual context, \nWashington has constantly invaded various trust funds to spend for a \nvariety of purposes and programs. One of those trust funds was the \nSocial Security trust fund. We spent a lot of time and energy finding a \nway to protect the Social Security trust fund.\n  Having developed at least a budget rule to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund, I think it is important for us to look to the \nprotection of other trust funds that are important to the well-being of \nthe people of this country and to protect them as well.\n  One of the other trust funds which remarkably has been invaded over \nand over and over again as a source for spending money for a variety of \nGovernment programs has been the Medicare trust fund. For over 30 \nyears, working people have been contributing to the country's welfare \nby paying the taxes they owe, paying their debts, saving for the \nfuture. Those values were rejected inside the beltway when we went into \nthe trust funds in order to meet our spending desires.\n  Washington tried to impose its own rules and values on the rest of \nthe country. These misdirected rules--spending beyond our means, making \npromises we did not keep, misleading the American people about how \ntheir money is being spent--for too long these rules were allowed to \ncontinue. We have taken some very strong steps in the right direction.\n  Last year, this Congress took the first step toward stopping this \nraid on the Social Security trust fund by enacting the Social Security \nlockbox rule on the budget resolution. That creates a point of order \nagainst any budget for spending money out of what would be called the \nSocial Security surplus. The Social Security surplus is pretty easy to \nunderstand. It is defined in our accounting as the amount of money that \ncomes into Social Security because of Social Security taxes that aren't \nrequired in that year to meet the obligations in that year of Social \nSecurity.\n  Obviously, because we have a lot of young people working now, we have \nfar more money coming in than we have going out with the relatively \nsmall group of older Americans consuming. In the years ahead, though, \nwhen this bulge of young people now contributing to the fund become \nconsumers of the fund, we will need a lot of the money they are sending \nin. That money they are sending in is called the Social Security \nsurplus. For years we spent that. I worked very hard to stop that \nspending. I worked to get included in the budget resolution a measure \nthat would make it out of order for the Congress to spend money on \nother things that was sent in by taxpayers for Social Security \npurposes. That is the protection of the Social Security surplus.\n  In addition, last year Senator Domenici, Senator Abraham, and I tried \nseveral times to enact a law, not just a budget rule which we did get \nput in place, but a law which would protect Social Security proceeds as \na statutory measure. Obviously, the President would have to sign it for \nit to become a law. The President said he wanted a Social Security \nlockbox, but, unfortunately, despite all the words of support for \nsaving the Social Security surplus and locking away the surplus, the \nSenate was unable to end the filibuster by Members of the Senate who \nopposed us and their President on the issue.\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\n  Despite that opposition, Congress was able to change how business in \nWashington was done on the Social Security surplus. We are far better \noff as a result.\n  Last year, for the first time since 1957, not one penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus was spent. Again this year, we passed a budget \nresolution that will not touch the off-budget or Social Security \nsurplus, the Social Security trust fund. It will also provide tax \nrelief for married couples and dedicate over $40 billion over the next \n5 years to provide prescription drug coverage for needy, older \nAmericans who receive Medicare.\n\n  When I saw what we accomplished last year, I knew we could, as well, \nprotect Part A of the Medicare surplus. Part A of Medicare is the only \nMedicare provision of which there is a trust fund. It is not funded out \nof the general revenue. It is something people pay specifically their \ntaxes for, with an anticipation that those resources will be available.\n  On November 18 of last year, I introduced S. 1962, the Social \nSecurity and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act. I did this because Social \nSecurity is not the only trust fund that has been raised over the \nrecent years, over decades. Over the next 5 years, taxpayers will pay \nin an estimated $179 billion more into the Medicare Part A trust fund \nthan will be required to sustain the purpose of that trust fund, which \nis patient hospital care in Medicare.\n  The amendment I offer today will add the Social Security and Medicare \nSafe Deposit Box Act to this pending bill. The Social Security and \nMedicare Safe Deposit Box Act takes the Medicare Part A trust fund off \nbudget and creates a permanent 60-vote point of order in the Senate and \na majority point of order in the House against any budget resolution or \nsubsequent bill that uses Medicare Part A or Social Security surpluses \nto finance on-budget deficits. This amendment protects the Medicare \nPart A surplus in the same way we protect the Social Security surplus. \nIt says that Congress and the President cannot consider the Medicare \nsurplus as part of the on-budget surplus. They can't look to this fund \nfor ordinary spending. Therefore, Congress and the President should be \nunable to spend the Medicare surplus for additional spending or for \nadditional tax cuts.\n  This lockbox protects the Medicare trust fund from the raids of the \npast. This is a historic time. I hope this will be a historic day. In \nthis, an election year, we have an unusual bipartisan opportunity to \nsupport this measure. It is not surprising that this is the right \npolicy. It is the right thing to do. The House of Representatives has \nalready taken this step to protect the Medicare trust fund from \ninvasion of spending for other Government programs. Last week, the \nHouse passed their version, a little different version, of the Medicare \nlockbox legislation, by a vote of 420-2. The House bill was offered by \nRepresentative Wally Herger and opposed by only two House Members.\n  Now, there are a lot of Members of this body who will want to \nprotect, I believe, the Medicare trust fund sustaining the capacity of \nour Government to provide the hospitalization we have promised to \nindividuals who are eligible for Medicare. I am pleased there are \nMembers of this body who join me in cosponsoring this amendment, one of \nwhom is Senator Abraham from Michigan. He has been active in the \nlockbox movement to protect Social Security, to make sure that Social \nSecurity is not invaded for other spending, and much of the success we \nhave had in protecting every dime of Social Security in the trust fund \nthis year should flow to Senator Abraham of Michigan. I am pleased he \nhas endorsed this and is a cosponsor of this measure with me in the \nSenate.\n  It is just not several Senators who endorse this. Both the Vice \nPresident and the President of the United States have endorsed \nenactment of a Medicare lockbox such as the one I introduced last \nNovember. Earlier this month Vice President Gore announced his support \nfor this kind of proposal. On June 13, Gore announced he would ``place \nMedicare in a lockbox so its surpluses could only be used to pay down \nthe national debt and to strengthen Medicare, not for pork barrel \nspending or tax cuts.''\n  I am pleased that the Vice President has endorsed this Medicare \nlockbox. I welcome that support. Obviously, when he says ``so its \nsurpluses,'' he is referring to the kind of thing we are talking \nabout--dedicated tax resources designed to support the program that are \nin excess of the needs of the program in any current year.\n  As we have already recounted this morning, there are 175 billion of \nanticipated such surplus that would be directed toward the Medicare \ntrust fund for Medicare Part A, which is the only Medicare trust fund \nwe have. I am pleased he would endorse this concept. I think it is a \nconcept that is bipartisan that deserves our support.\n  Two days ago, the President of the United States called for \nprotecting Medicare Part A surpluses through a lockbox. Allow me to \nquote from the President's announcement. This is from a text provided \nby the administration:\n\n       President Clinton is proposing to take Medicare off budget. \n     This would mean that, like the Social Security surplus, the \n     projected $403 billion Medicare surplus would not count \n     toward on-budget surplus and therefore could no longer be \n     diverted for other purposes. Taking the Medicare surplus off-\n     budget would ensure that Medicare is protected for paying \n     down the debt to help strengthen the life of the Medicare \n     Program.\n\n  So the President has recognized there are funds specifically paid in, \nand that they are in surplus of what is needed immediately to be paid \nout. He has indicated that for those surpluses, we should be \nsafeguarding them with a Medicare lockbox.\n  Let me quote further from the White House release, because I believe \nthe President has described the Medicare lockbox proposal in my \namendment, which I proposed last November, in a very simple, \nunderstandable manner:\n  What taking Medicare off budget means, the administration, speaking \nof itself says, is:\n\n       The Administration projects that if current policies are \n     continued, Medicare Part A, which covers hospital expenses, \n     will run a surplus of $403 billion from [the year] 2001 \n     through [the year] 2010. This surplus is the excess of \n     Medicare income, principally from the 2.9 percent payroll \n     tax, combined employer and employee, over benefit payments \n     and administrative costs. The Medicare surplus has grown from \n     $4 billion in 1993 to $24 billion in the year 2000.\n\n  I am still quoting the President and the statement of the White House \nhere:\n\n       Under previous budget accounting conventions, this Medicare \n     surplus was treated as part of the total on-budget surplus \n     and was thus available for new spending on other programs or \n     tax cuts.\n       By taking Medicare Part A off budget, the President \n     proposes to make it unavailable for other spending or tax \n     cuts.\n\n  That is exactly what I proposed last November. I quote again from the \nWhite House:\n\n       Instead, the projected baseline Medicare surplus would be \n     used to pay down the debt.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might interrupt the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri for a moment?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will be happy to yield with the understanding that at \nthe conclusion of this interruption I continue to have the floor for my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania, without \nobjection.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. We \nwere conferring about the last amendment so I was unable to be on the \nfloor when this debate started. We are interested in a time agreement. \nI have just discussed the matter with the Senator from North Dakota, \nwho has the second-degree amendment. It would be in the managers' \ninterest to see if we could limit debate to 1 hour equally divided on \nthe first-degree and second-degree amendment, and then have votes on \nboth amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, I do not want to object, \nbut I want to clarify. How much time have I consumed already with my \nexplanation? Maybe I should ask, is the hour in addition to what I have \nalready used?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If it is acceptable to the Senator from North Dakota. I \nhadn't discussed that with him earlier.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. What I want to do is protect the right of my colleague, \nSenator Abraham from Michigan, to make remarks. I don't want to have \nconsumed all the time. That is what I am interested in doing. So if we \ncan work something out with that in mind, I am willing.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask the Senator from Missouri, would 15 additional \nminutes satisfy you on your side?\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Let's say we would take 20 additional minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suppose we then have 30 minutes. I discussed 1 hour \nequally divided with the Senator from North Dakota, so you would have \n30 minutes and 20 minutes on the other side?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That will be acceptable if the understanding is this is \n``on or in relation to,'' any votes ordered for that period?\n  Mr. SPECTER. We would have two votes then on the two competing \namendments: One on the Ashcroft amendment, and one on the Conrad \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be on or in relation?\n  Mr. SPECTER. On or in relation.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I object and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Conrad \namendment and the Ashcroft amendment each be considered amendments in \nthe first degree; that there be 30 minutes for Senator Conrad, 20 \nminutes for Senator Ashcroft, and that there be votes on both of their \namendments with no point of order being permitted, and that the time of \nthe votes be determined later in the day by agreement of the leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Conrad amendment will be voted on first.\n  Mr. REID. I was talking to Senator Conrad. I apologize.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The unanimous consent agreement provides that each \namendment, the Conrad amendment and the Ashcroft amendment, be \nconsidered as amendments in the first degree; that the Conrad amendment \nbe voted on first, that there be no points of order raised, that \nSenator Conrad will have 30 minutes, and Senator Ashcroft 20 minutes, \nand the time of the votes will be determined later in the day by \nagreement of the leaders.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow us to go into a \nquorum call for a minute, Senator Conrad and I have a couple of things \nabout which we want to talk. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so nobody will get nervous, I want to \ntalk about the schedule. I am working with Senator Reid on a couple \nunanimous consent requests that we may offer later. But I wanted to \ntalk about the progress being made and what our hopes are.\n  I realize this is a very big, very important bill--the Department of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. It \nis important we get it done, and it is important we have a few minutes \nto think through critical amendments that are offered. We are in that \nprocess. I thank the managers for what they have been doing. I urge \nthem to keep pushing forward. The number of amendments has been \nsubstantially reduced. The ones still pending are not easy amendments. \nBut I think if we can keep focused, we can complete this very important \nappropriations bill at a reasonable hour today.\n  I urge my colleagues, when they have an amendment, when there is an \namendment on both sides, that we find a way to accept them both or get \na vote on both of them and let the Senate speak its will and then move \non. I think that would be the best way to do it.\n  What I really want to comment on today about this bill, and others, \nis that there are Senators thinking we are going to finish tonight and \nthere won't be votes tomorrow. Senator Daschle and I have been \nindicating for quite some time now that that is not going to happen. We \nhave to complete this bill. I still would like to go to the Interior \nappropriations bill. But we also have a very important military \nconstruction appropriations bill with a title II that involves \nemergencies. That has to be completed and considered by the House Rules \nCommittee, the House has to vote, and then it comes over here. That \ncould be late this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow or later. If there \nare complications, it could take more time than that.\n  I assure everybody that we are going to be in session and voting \ntomorrow. I think that hoping we can wave a magic wand and miraculously \ncomplete this bill and the other measures by a reasonable time tonight \nis just not likely.\n  I wanted to say that now. Those who have planes booked for 10 o'clock \ntonight or 10 o'clock in the morning, you better start making other \narrangements, unless you are willing to miss votes. Quite often, some \nSenators think that if enough of us leave, there won't be votes. That \nis not going to be the case this time. This work is too important. I \nurge my colleagues to help us get this very important work done in this \ncritical week.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I say to my colleagues that I \nwas here last night about 7 o'clock when the majority leader came to \nthe floor. To say that he was upset is an understatement. I heard him \nclearly that there will be no more windows for the end of this session.\n  I also say to the leader that it would be a big help to those of us \non the floor if we could shorten the time of the votes. We wasted \ntremendous time yesterday. We wasted at least 2\\1/2\\ hours on votes \nwhen people weren't here. We waited 20, 30 minutes for Senators on both \nsides. I believe that if a vote is completed within 15 or 18 minutes, \nwe should go on to something else. If people miss a vote or two, \neverybody's record will be down a little bit, and it will be the same \nfor everybody.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Obviously, the Senator from Nevada is correct. We do allow \nthese votes to drag on too long, and we should be prepared to cut them \noff after the 15 minutes and the 5-minute overtime. On both sides we \ntry to be understanding, but the more we are understanding, the more it \nis abused by our colleagues. So, for today, I will work with Democrats \nand Republicans and be prepared to cut these votes off. It could save \nus a lot of time.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Nevada, we would not be making the \nprogress we have made on this and other bills without his diligence, \nhis presence on the floor, and the hard work he does. I appreciate \nthat. Last night, even though I was disturbed about the timing because \nof commitments that have been made, we worked that out and we got a lot \nof good work done last night.

I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate turn to the consideration of the NCAA \ngambling bill, S. 2340, and following the reporting of the bill by the \nclerk, the committee amendments be immediately agreed to.\n  I further ask consent that there be 4 hours of debate on the bill, to \nbe equally divided in the usual form, and only relevant amendments be \nin order during the pendency of the bill.\n  Finally, I ask consent that following the conclusion of the time and \nthe disposition of any amendments, the bill be advanced to third \nreading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or \ndebate.\n  I know Senator Reid will want to make some comments. This is an issue \nthat has been pending for some time. We have tried to find a way to \nhave it as an amendment on other bills. I know Senator Brownback has \nbeen diligent and also very much interested in this matter, as are \nother Senators, including Senator McCain.\n  Senator Reid has indicated he would like to work with us on it. But I \nwill let him speak for himself.\n  Part of what I am doing here is this: I made a commitment to the \nsponsors to try to find a way to consider this on some bill, or \nfreestanding at some\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\npoint. In order to complete work on the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, now that we have worked through the disclosure \nissue, this issue is one we also need to find a way to address. That is \nwhy I am asking for this consent.\n  Mr. President, I submit that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I know the \ndeepness of feeling of the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback. I have \nspoken to him personally. I understand how he feels about this issue. I \nalso feel very strongly about this issue.\n  I am willing to work with the Republican leadership and my leader to \ntry to work out some kind of freestanding bill so this matter can be \nfully debated. This is not an appropriate time to do it. I say \nrespectfully to the Senator from Kansas and the majority leader that we \nsimply can't do this now.\n  I have been here since Thursday on the Labor-HHS bill that is before \nus. I arrived home late last night, as everyone else did. We are trying \nto carve out amendments. This is just not an appropriate time to do it.\n  I say to my friend from Kansas that I respect how he feels about \nthis. There are strong feelings on this issue. This is an issue which \nshould be debated. At an appropriate time, we will do that. Therefore, \nI object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold his objection?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to withhold. I withdraw my objection.\n  I also say this: Seeing the Senator from Massachusetts here floods my \nmind with the work that needs to be done in this Chamber. We need to \nintroduce the minimum wage bill. We have the Patients' Bill of Rights \nand prescription drugs. We have things to do on education. In addition \nto my personal situation, I know the Senator from Massachusetts is \nconcerned about those bills.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for just a \nbrief observation, as I understand the request of the majority leader, \nthis does not include any request to bring back the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Did the Senator from Nevada \nhear that clearly? I did not hear that clearly.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is not to be included.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I did not include that. But I would be happy \nto work up an agreement where we could bring that back and have germane \namendments on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, have an \nagreed-to list of amendments that are germane, so we can deal with that \nimportant issue. I will be glad to work with Senator Kennedy or anybody \nelse to try to get that agreement.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if the majority leader will be willing \nto yield for a moment, I appreciate his offering this unanimous consent \nrequest. I note that we have considered a number of items on various \nbills--whether it has been items on prescription drugs or different \nitems that have come forward.\n  This is one that has cleared through the committee by a strong vote \nof 13-2 with wide bipartisan support. The bill itself has broad \nbipartisan support across the country. It is an important issue. We are \nhaving a lot of difficulty with regard to our student athletes being \ninvolved in gambling themselves and referees in sporting events being \ninvolved in gambling. The NCAA and many of the sporting groups are \nsaying this is a problem.\n  Bigger than all of that, the lead gateway for college students \ngetting into addictive gambling is through sports wagering. What we are \ntrying to deal with is the one place in the country where this remains \na problem and where it remains legal.\n  I think we need to have a bill up and a vote.\n  I ask my colleague from Nevada--he has been so persistent on a number \nof different issues to bring up to the floor--when can we get this one \nup so we can have a set timeframe for debate? If the Senator from \nNevada would like to have a long period of time, that is fine. I am \nwilling to go as short as an hour equally divided. But can we get some \nidea of when we could do this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the reservation, I will not reply to \nthe substance of the statement made by my friend from Kansas, but there \nare merits on both sides of this legislation. I would be happy to work \nwith leadership to find a time to bring this bill to the floor.\n  In the meantime, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6057-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6057-S6062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n            RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we are now prepared to go ahead \nwith the Ashcroft amendment and the Conrad amendment.\n  We propounded a unanimous consent before, but I will repeat it.\n  There will be two votes on amendments, each treated as a first-degree \namendment. The first vote will be on the Conrad amendment in regular \norder. The second vote will be on the Ashcroft amendment. There will be \nno points of order raised. Senator Ashcroft will have 20 minutes \nbecause he already had time to speak. Senator Conrad will have 30 \nminutes to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the only \naddition I would like is that the two votes occur at 2 o'clock. We \nwould be happy to have other amendments. Can we finish the debate on \nthis? I know Senator Lautenberg, our ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, wishes to speak. Senator Conrad wishes to speak on this \nmatter. There are other Members who want to speak. I think it would be \nappropriate to lock in the time on this.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might respond, we want to come back \nto the Daschle amendment with the second-degree amendment. We want to \ncome back to the Dorgan amendment. We have a Helms amendment. I urge \nthat we defer these votes until later when we can have 10-minute votes. \nPerhaps we can get the majority leader to crack the whip, and, as the \nSenator from Nevada suggested, stay on the floor and limit them to 10 \nminutes, if we are going to finish this bill by midafternoon.\n\n  Mr. REID. There is no problem with that. I hope we do not vote before \n2 o'clock on these matters.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We will not vote before 2 o'clock.\n  May we proceed, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nclarify: How much time will be available on the Ashcroft amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Twenty minutes is requested.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I would only indicate that I know Senator Domenici \nwishes to speak on this issue as well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator like 30 minutes?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I think at least that much time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We will take 30 minutes. It will save time in the long \nrun.\n  Mr. REID. Now we have others who wish to speak. How long does Senator \nConrad wish to speak?\n  Mr. CONRAD. As long as it takes to persuade my colleagues to vote for \nit.\n  Mr. REID. As articulate as the Senator is, that should only take 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I need about 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We should reserve 10 minutes for Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to be able to speak about 5 \nminutes, if possible.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Now we are up to 35 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the unanimous consent request is modified to 35 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Now we are up to 55.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We want equal time. I insist on equal time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have already had a considerable amount of time.\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield it back if we don't need it. I \nwant equal time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we proceed with \n45 minutes on each side to get this moving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I previously spent some substantial time in talking \nabout the need for a Medicare lockbox. I spent time indicating that as \nSocial Security is off budget, I think it would be good to protect \nMedicare with a lockbox. In addition to talking about the common sense \nof not taking trust funds and spending them for things other than that \nfor which they were paid into the trust fund, I indicated there were a \nbroad group of people who supported this concept, including the Vice \nPresident, who has endorsed the concept of a Medicare lockbox, and the \nPresident of the United States, who very recently has endorsed the \nconcept of a Medicare lockbox.\n  I was in the midst of reading an extensive set of points that had \nbeen made available by the White House supporting the concept. I \nbelieve the concept is worthy of our support.\n  I think it is important that we do it with integrity, that we don't \nleave any gaping holes or opportunities for the lockbox to be invaded \nor otherwise dispersed. It is important we not have a lockbox that \nappears to be a lockbox that doesn't satisfy the idea of a lockbox.\n  I hope Senators will join with me and with an almost unanimous House \nof Representatives and join the President and the Vice President of the \nUnited States, who have all voiced support for this concept of a \nMedicare lockbox.\n  When I came to Washington 5 years ago, people said it would be \nimpossible to balance the budget, but we did it. They said we could not \nand would not balance the budget without using the Social Security \ntrust fund. We have done it. And there are those who say we cannot and \nwill not balance the budget and protect Medicare Part A surpluses. But \nwe can and we will. We are more than halfway to this point. The House \nhas voted. The President has expressed himself in support of a lockbox, \nas has the Vice President. Now it is the Senate's turn.\n  I believe the Senate will sign a Medicare lockbox measure. That would \nsend a powerful message. A lockbox amendment also requires the \nPresident to protect Medicare and Social Security by submitting a \nbudget that does not spend either surplus. We make these changes. They \nare beneficial changes for the people. I call upon the Members of this \nbody to enact a Medicare lockbox that is durable and strong and real--\nnot one with loopholes but one that will protect Part A Medicare \nsurpluses for expenditure for their intended purpose.\n  It is with that in mind I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of the \namendment I proposed.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, and \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, be included as a cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3690\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a lockbox amendment \nwith Senator Lautenberg and Senator Reid designed to protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  This amendment is simple but important.\n  First, it says we must protect Social Security surpluses each and \nevery year. The budget has finally been balanced without counting \nSocial Security, and we must make sure it stays balanced without \ncounting Social Security and Medicare.\n  Second, my amendment takes the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund \nsurpluses off budget to prevent those surpluses from being raided for \nanything but Medicare.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, the Medicare trust \nfund will run a surplus of over $400 billion from the year 2001 to \n2010. Taking these surpluses off budget and locking them away will \nensure that they are used only for Medicare and to pay down the debt. \nTaking the Medicare trust fund off budget, as in Social Security off \nbudget, will ensure that these payroll taxes that workers pay will be \nused to meet the future demographic challenges Medicare and Social \nSecurity face.\n  We have reached a bipartisan agreement that Social Security belongs \noff budget and that its surpluses should be preserved solely for Social \nSecurity. For seniors, Medicare is just as critically important for \nfinancial independence in their golden years. It is now time to give \nthe same protection to Medicare that we already accord to Social \nSecurity, by taking Medicare off budget, too.\n  Medicare is absolutely critical to the health and economic well-being \nof nearly 40 million senior citizens. Before Medicare, many of our \nsenior citizens were one major medical event away from poverty. Today, \nour seniors enjoy the security of knowing Medicare is there for them. \nWe should not put at risk Medicare because of a failure to protect \nMedicare from raids for other purposes. We have been through this on \nSocial Security.\n  The amendment I am offering says we are going to treat Medicare the \nsame as we are treating Social Security. Unfortunately, the amendment \nof the Senator from Missouri fails to do that. It suggests it is a \nMedicare lockbox, but it really isn't. When we examine the amendment of \nthe Senator from Missouri, we find there is a fatal flaw. The fatal \nflaw is that the Senator from Missouri has no enforcement mechanism for \nits provision taking Medicare surpluses off budget. In fact, it does \nnot move Medicare off budget. It only removes Medicare surpluses off \nbudget.\n  The result is, under the Ashcroft amendment, no point of order would \napply against legislation that uses Medicare surpluses for other \nreasons. Under the Ashcroft amendment, the Medicare trust fund could be \ndepleted for any purpose, as long as the overall budget remained in \nbalance. Unfortunately, because of the way the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Missouri has been drafted, it is opening Medicare to raids for \nother purposes. That is a fatal flaw. That is what my amendment \ncorrects. My amendment takes Medicare trust fund surpluses off budget, \nprotecting them with points of order so there could not be a raid on \nMedicare.\n  Let me make my point as clearly as I can. If we look at the fiscal \nyear 2000, we have a unified surplus projection of $224 billion. Social \nSecurity is in surplus by $150 billion. We will not permit that to be \nraided.\n  Medicare is in surplus by $24 billion. We will not permit that to be \nraided under my amendment. But under the amendment of the Senator from \nMissouri, one could take every penny of the $24 billion in surplus in \nMedicare because the overall budget would still be in balance. That is \nthe fatal flaw of the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. The \nSenator does not protect these Medicare funds if the overall budget is \nin balance. I don't know if that was realized by the other side, but \nthat is a fatal flaw. That is why the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, my amendment, the amendment I am offering with Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Reid, is critically important; we would prevent \nany raid on Medicare funds.\n  Our lockbox is simply stronger. We establish points of order that \nprotect the integrity of the Medicare trust fund in each and every \nyear. Our plan was drafted to make the Medicare trust fund status \nexactly the same as Social Security. For some reason, the amendment of \nthe Senator from Missouri has been drafted differently. It does not \ngive the full protections to Medicare that we have given to Social \nSecurity. Why not?\n  If we look at the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and I direct my \ncolleagues to page 17, on the bottom of\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\nthat page are laid out the specific protections we provide for Social \nSecurity. We provide them for Medicare in the amendment that I am \noffering. The Senator from Missouri has failed to do so. He has left \nthem out. For some reason he is giving lesser protection to Medicare \nthan we give to Social Security. My amendment solves that fatal flaw \nthat is in the amendment of the Senator from Missouri.\n  In our plan, we treat Medicare similar to Social Security by \nexcluding all receipts and disbursements of the Federal Hospital \nInsurance trust fund from budget totals. We exclude the Medicare trust \nfund from sequestration procedures and create parallel Budget Act \npoints of order to protect the surplus in the Medicare trust fund in \neach and every year.\n  Our plan also creates a new point of order against legislation that \nwould cause or increase an on-budget deficit. So it protects the \nintegrity of the Medicare trust fund and the on-budget surplus for debt \nreduction. Our plan also strengthens existing protections for Social \nSecurity by enforcing points of order against reducing Social Security \nsurpluses in each and every year.\n  The Ashcroft amendment is silent on Social Security. It has verbiage \nthere, but there is no new protection for Social Security in the \namendment of the Senator from Missouri. Our amendment adds a point of \norder against violating the off-budget status of Social Security and \nrequires Social Security revenues and outlays to be set forth for every \nfiscal year in a budget resolution rather than for only the 5 years \nunder current law.\n  In addition, we strengthen existing points of order protecting Social \nSecurity by enforcing points of order against reducing the Social \nSecurity surplus in every year covered by the budget resolution rather \nthan only in the first year and the total of all years covered by the \nbudget resolution as current law provides.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senator Lautenberg and Senator Reid \nis very clear: We are protecting Social Security and Medicare in a \nlockbox that has real protections, and we treat them in the same way. \nUnfortunately, the proposal of the Senator from Missouri creates a \ndifference between the protection we provide Social Security and the \nprotection we provide Medicare. The Senator from Missouri provides much \nless protection for Medicare than we provide Social Security. It has a \nfatal flaw: no enforcement mechanism. The result is, under the Ashcroft \namendment, the Medicare trust fund could be depleted for any purpose as \nlong as the overall budget remained in balance. That is a profound \nmistake.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Missouri would allow the Medicare \ntrust fund surplus in the year 2000 to be raided of every penny. We \nshould not allow that. That is not a lockbox; that is a ``leakbox.'' We \nare trying to construct a lockbox here to protect Medicare, not a \nfigleaf that will make people believe we protected Medicare but really \nopen up a gigantic loophole that would allow for raids on Medicare as \nwe used to see on Social Security.\n  This is a defining vote. Those who care about protecting Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and are serious about it, will support our \namendment. Those who want a figleaf and a press release will be in \nopposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think the Senator from North Dakota \nis going to yield the time. How much time do the proponents of the \nsecond-degree amendment have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 34 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the second-degree \namendment, which I am pleased to be cosponsoring with Senator Conrad.\n  This amendment would establish a lockbox to protect both Social \nSecurity and Medicare surpluses from being raided to pay for other \nprograms or tax breaks. The amendment would take Medicare completely \noff-budget, and it would add iron-clad guarantees to ensure that \nneither Social Security nor Medicare surpluses can be used for any \nother purposes.\n  This amendment is based on a proposal first put forward last week by \nVice President Gore. And I want to commend the Vice President for his \nleadership in this area. As he has argued so forcefully, it is wrong \nfor Congress to use Social Security or Medicare surpluses as a piggy \nbank either for tax breaks or new spending. Instead, Social Security \nand Medicare should be taken off the table, and out of the Federal \nbudget.\n  Social Security already is officially off budget. That is the law. \nThere is a bipartisan consensus that we should not use Social Security \nsurpluses for any other purpose. We all agree on that.\n  But what we have not all agreed on is that Medicare surpluses should \nbe protected, as well.\n  Senate Democrats have long argued that Medicare must be included in \nany Social Security lockbox. That is why last year, when Republicans \nsought to move a lockbox that dealt only with Social Security, we held \nfirm and insisted on our right to offer at least one amendment. The \namendment we wanted to offer would have added Medicare to the GOP \nproposal.\n  But the Republicans were so opposed to that, they pulled the bill \nfrom the floor. In fact, this happened several times. Each time, we \nDemocrats insisted that Medicare be part of the equation. And, each \ntime, Republicans said: No.\n  I am hopeful that Republican opposition to protecting Medicare is \nsoftening, and I give Vice President Gore a lot of the credit for that. \nHe has taken the lead and put this issue at the forefront of the public \nagenda. With the spotlight now clearly on the Congress, I am optimistic \nthat we will respond.\n  We should not respond with half-hearted measures, like the bill \napproved in the House of Representatives or the pending Ashcroft \namendment. We should do ti right, and that means taking Medicare \ncompletely off-budget, with all the procedural protections now provided \nto Social Security.\n  That is what this amendment does.\n  It treats Medicare just as we are already treating Social Security. \nIt says: Medicare, like Social Security, will now be taken completely \noff of the Government's books. It will not be counted in the \nPresident's budget calculations. It will not be counted in the budget \nresolution, and it will not be used as a piggy bank for tax breaks, or \nfor any other Government programs.\n  The legislation also creates points of order against any legislation \nthat would deplete the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for any \nother purpose. Similar points of order already apply for Social \nSecurity. Medicare deserves the same protections.\n  In addition, the amendment would protect Medicare from across-the-\nboard cuts that could be triggered if Congress exceeds other budgetary \nlimits. Under current law--the so-called ``pay-as-you-go'' rules--if \nCongress raids surpluses either for tax breaks or mandatory spending, \nMedicare automatically gets cut. That is not right, and that will end \nunder this amendment.\n  In addition to taking Medicare off-budget, the amendment also \nstrengthens existing rules that protect Social Security. For example, \nthe amendment would establish a supermajority point of order against \nany measure that would put Social Security back on budget, or violate \nthe prohibition against including Social Security in a budget \nresolution.\n  Our amendment also strengthens existing law by requiring every budget \nresolution to include Social Security totals for each year covered in \nthe resolution, and then establishing a point of order to protect those \nfunds in each year. This is an improvement over current law, which \nprotects Social Security surpluses in the first year of a budget \nresolution, and for the entire period of the resolution, but not in \neach individual year. There is no similar provision in the pending \nAshcroft amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on the Ashcroft \namendment.\n  The Ashcroft amendment is described as taking Medicare offbudget, \nsomething deserving consideration. But the proposed amendment does not \nreally do it. It does not fully protect Medicare. And the public must \nknow why it is an inferior proposal to the second-degree amendment \nproposed by Senator Conrad and myself.\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\n  The Conrad-Lautenberg amendment calls for more than a surface \naccounting change. Yes, we take Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust \nFund off-budget, and that's important. But we are also insisting that \nwe include procedural protections against any budget resolution or \nlegislation that would use Medicare funds for other purposes, and \npermit undermining its solvency.\n  We do that by establishing a process that will protect Medicare by \nrequiring a 60-vote point of order against any legislation that would \ninvade the trust fund's solvency to be used for other purposes. Under \nour amendment, if you want to use Medicare funds to pay for tax breaks, \nor for anything else, you will need those 60 votes to do it.\n  That is not true of the prevailing amendment, however. The Ashcroft \namendment isn't really able to protect Medicare. It does establish a \npoint of order, a higher hurdle, that obstructs creation of a larger \nbudget deficit. And that's a good thing that will help promote debt \nreduction.\n  But preventing an on-budget deficit is not the same thing as \nprotecting the Medicare Trust Fund.\n  For example, if legislation was proposed that reduced revenues into \nMedicare's Trust Fund and increased the possibility of earlier Medicare \ninsolvency, that legislation would not be subject to a point of order \nunder the present Ashcroft amendment. That is because, again, the \nAshcroft amendment isn't really designed to protect the solvency of \nMedicare. It is only designed to prevent on-budget deficits. And that \njust doesn't go far enough.\n  The point of all this talk about Medicare is to ensure that the \nprogram will still be solvent and strong in the future, when the baby \nboomers retire. Well, if you don't protect Medicare's solvency, you are \nreally not accomplishing that goal.\n  That is why the Ashcroft amendment is grossly inadequate and why I \nurge my colleagues will instead support the Conrad-Lautenberg second \ndegree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself, initially, 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what we have before us is a genuine \nlockbox amendment by the Senator from North Dakota, and we have a \n``box'' amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. Now, notice I \nsaid ``lockbox.'' A lockbox is what has been offered by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota; no lockbox by the Senator from Missouri. That really \nis the difference.\n  What do I mean by ``lockbox''? What I mean is that we are trying to \ntreat Medicare as we treat Social Security; that we are going to say \nthat in the future, the Medicare trust fund should be off budget, \nshould not be counted in budget totals, that it should be off budget \nand should not in any way be able to be tapped into by this Congress or \nany succeeding Congress to pay for any deficit, to pay for any tax \ncuts, to pay for any other kind of spending in which this Congress or \nany future Congress wants to engage.\n  That is really what a lockbox is. You take funds and you set them \naside; you put them in a box and you lock it. That means you cannot tap \ninto it.\n  That is what the American people want us to do with Medicare and with \nSocial Security. This is money that they have paid into out of payroll \ntaxes. This is money that has been set aside for them for Medicare--and \nfor Social Security, if we are talking about Social Security. We are \nonly talking about Medicare here.\n  The American people believe very deeply about this; that no Congress \nought to be able to say: We want to give a tax cut to the wealthy, and \nwe are going to pay for it by taking it out of the surplus. And if the \nonly surplus we have is Medicare, we will take it out of there, or, if \nthe only surplus we have is Social Security, we will take it out of \nthere.\n  What we are saying on the Democratic side is, no, no deal. We are \ngoing to take Social Security and Medicare off budget, lock the money \naway, you cannot tap into it for tax cuts or spending or anything else.\n  The Senator from Missouri may think that is what he is doing. I heard \nhim describe his amendment as a lockbox, taking it out, but that is not \nwhat his amendment does. His amendment does not do that. It does not \nprotect the Medicare trust fund from procedures that might be used by a \nfuture Congress to pay for spending or tax cuts totally unrelated to \nMedicare.\n  I could get into the jargon used around here by talking about points \nof order and sequestration and stuff such as that. Who understands what \nall that means, unless it is just a few of us around here. And I am not \ncertain all of us understand it either.\n  But just to put it in simple lay terms that the American people can \nunderstand, the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri sort of \nputs the Medicare surplus in a box. It closes the lid. That looks \npretty good, but the next Congress or two Congresses from now may \ndecide: Hey, we have had a downturn in the economy. We might want to \ngive a tax cut to a group. We might want to do some spending. We don't \nhave enough of a surplus in our budget, but we do have a big surplus in \nthat box. In that box there is a big surplus. We will just go open the \nlid and scoop a little bit out. That is what the Ashcroft amendment \nallows. It allows a future Congress to open the lid on the box, put the \nscoop in there, and dig some money out for whatever that Congress \nwants.\n\n  What the Conrad amendment does is take the Medicare money our people \nhave paid out of their payroll taxes and puts it in a box, just as \nAshcroft does, closes the lid, locks it, and throws the key away. That \nis the difference between the Conrad amendment and the Ashcroft \namendment. What the Conrad amendment says to a future Congress is, if \nyou want a tax cut for the wealthy, if you want to spend on some \nprograms, go somewhere else to get the money. You can't pry open the \nbox in which we have Medicare and Social Security funds; that is to be \nused only for Medicare and only for Social Security. That is what the \nConrad amendment does.\n  Don't be misled that these two amendments are the same. They are not \nthe same. The American people should not be misled. If your goal is to \nset aside Medicare funds and put them in a box but if a future Congress \nwants it can go in and open the lid and scoop some money out, vote for \nAshcroft. Maybe some people think that is legitimate. Maybe some people \nsay: Well, we should not tie the hands of future Congresses. If they \nwant to take some of that Medicare surplus and use it for something, \nlet them open the lid on the box and take the money out.\n  Maybe some people here believe that. I don't believe that. Senator \nConrad does not believe that because it is his amendment. What he says \nis, we will put it in that box and lock it. The only thing you can use \nthat money for is Medicare, just as we should only use Social Security \nfor Social Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 7 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much more time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remain.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take 1 more minute.\n  If you want to secure Medicare funding and you want to lock it away, \nyou have to vote for the Conrad amendment. If, however, you want to \ntake Medicare funding and put it in a box and say that future \nCongresses can go in there, open the lid and take the money out for \nother things, then vote for Ashcroft. It is that simple.\n  I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nMichigan as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be brief because in many ways I am \nvery pleased with the direction of today's debate, particularly with \nthe fact that it actually will result in some votes. We have been on \nthe floor talking about trying to lock up Social Security on many \noccasions. I was seeking to get a final vote on a lockbox that I think \nreally does do the job of protecting Social Security. I think we did it \nfour times and couldn't get to a final vote.\n  Today, we are moving in the direction of getting final votes on both \na\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nform of Social Security lockbox and on the issue of locking up \nMedicare. I think that is an important step.\n  While I am happy to support almost any effort that makes it more \ndifficult to spend the Social Security surplus, I do not believe that \nthe forms offered today go as far as we should to ensure a permanent \noff-limits nature of the Social Security surplus. I hope the spirit \nwhich we have seen today, of working towards giving people options to \nvote, is one that we can build on, and that I will soon have an \nopportunity to have a vote on the Social Security lockbox proposal on \nwhich Senator Domenici, Senator Ashcroft, and I have been working.\n  I think it is a very productive debate to talk about treating the \nMedicare surplus, the Part A of the Medicare trust fund, in the same \nfashion. The disagreements over details are ones that ought to be \nsomething we can work out.\n  I do not think implications of intent with respect to the future \nspending of these dollars that are being made are on point with the \nintent of the draft Senator Ashcroft has offered. I think his goal is \nvery clearly to try to protect the surplus in Social Security from \nbeing spent, period. I think that is his motive. I will leave it to him \nto comment.\n  I think implications that there were any ulterior goals in his \nproposal are off the mark. In fact, I hope people will examine more \nclosely his longstanding position on this issue. While it may be now, \nin the middle of a Presidential campaign, that people are talking about \na Medicare lockbox, I remember Senator Ashcroft talking about a \nMedicare lockbox more than a year before the Presidential election and \ncertainly months before it was an issue in terms of the national \nPresidential debate. As a colleague, I appreciate the fact that he was \nahead of everybody else in trying to raise that issue on the Senate \nside. We have worked together to try to move both of these issues today \nand in the past.\n  I want to go on record in favor of having mechanisms in place that \nprotect these trust funds from seeing these dollars used for anything \nother than their purpose. One hopes that would be the outcome. If not \nin the context of this legislation, then let us be honest about it: The \nlikelihood that this type of amendment is going to be able to survive \nthe entire conference process may be questionable. I hope by going on \nrecord--as I suspect by the end of this afternoon every Member of the \nSenate will--in favor of locking up both of these surpluses, we will \ntake a step in the direction of ultimately achieving it. I certainly \nintend to come back to the Senate and, in the context of legislation \nthat can get to final passage inclusive of such lockboxes, give the \nSenate opportunities to support such an effort.\n  As I talk to constituents in my State, and from comments made by \npeople all over America, there is little doubt that one of the most \nfrustrating things to people, whether they are already Social Security \nrecipients or will be in the future, is the fact that they have watched \nas too many Social Security surplus dollars have been spent on other \nthings in order to make the deficit appear smaller. I think they are \ngoing to be very pleased this year when we end the fiscal year not only \nwith a balanced budget but also without spending one penny of Social \nSecurity on anything but Social Security or the reduction of debt. That \nis a sea change.\n  I don't think we should lose sight of the circumstances in which it \nhas come about. Senator Ashcroft, myself, Senator Domenici, and others \nin the budget process have worked to make sure there were in place the \nkinds of budget rules that precluded Social Security surpluses from \nbeing spent on other things. This year taxpayers who have been so \ndisappointed in the past that such moneys were used for other purposes \nare going to receive the good news that they were not and that they are \nnot going to be in the future. Indeed, this year's budget resolution, \nas last year's, incorporates the kinds of rules that will protect it. I \nam proud to have been involved in the drafting of those rules.\n  I am glad we are back on this topic. It may not resolve it fully, in \nthe context of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, but hopefully, after \ntoday, we have at least set the precedent that we will create these \nlockboxes, that we are not going to prevent votes from being taken on \nfinal passage of the various options that are out there, at least to \nget final votes on those options in some context.\n  I look forward to bringing back an even stronger Social Security \nlockbox and for a chance to get a vote on the version we have drafted. \nI would like to have that opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime will be charged equally against both sides.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for \n15 minutes out of order, without the time being charged to anyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I know \nthe Senator from West Virginia has some remarks he wants to make. We \nare about to get this tangle resolved. Does that side have any more \nspeakers?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend from \nGeorgia, if the senior Member of the Republican side wanted to come out \nand speak, we would drop everything no matter what we were doing. I \nthink we should give the Senator from West Virginia the same \nopportunity.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the question is, Is there time on your \nside that we might use?\n  Mr. CONRAD. On this side, we have 4 minutes remaining. Obviously, we \nwould like to reserve some of that time for the purpose of making a \nstatement at the end.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Thirty minutes. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of \nour time to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and do not \nobject to the additional 5 minutes that would bring him to his 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I \napologize for imposing myself at this moment. But I had noticed several \nquorums of considerable length, and I thought this might be a good time \nto have a statement made. I thank all Senators.\n\n                        ``The Search for Jesus''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I found disappointing Peter Jennings' ``The \nSearch for Jesus,'' which aired on ABC Monday night. The promotions for \nthe show promised a pilgrimage to the roots of Christianity, but I \nthink what we were actually given was more of a slide show.\n  All too often we are told by members of the media that they are \nconstrained by time. Broadcasters divvy up air time into 30 seconds, 60 \nseconds, an hour, 2 hours, and they are constrained by these blocks, \nwhich are further constrained by their ability to sell advertisements \nto support their use of time.\n  In case after case, including that of ``The Search for Jesus,'' too \nlittle time is devoted to providing a serious look at important issues. \nWhatever one's view of Jesus may be, it is hard to deny that few, if \nany, other lives have so affected our world and humanity as that of \nJesus Christ. Here is someone who literally split the centuries in two.\n  The questions and controversies surrounding His life on Earth \ncertainly deserve more than the 2 hours devoted to it by ABC. Two \nhours--in fact, much less than that when one subtracts the commercial \ntime, which was substantial--hardly scratches the surface.\n  The program presented many provocative ideas. A very limited number \nof theologians, historians, and ordinary folk had much to offer in the \nway of researched information, speculation, theory, heartfelt notions, \nand simple faith. But they were given only seconds here and there to \nprovide us with what may well have been valuable insight and \ninspirational ideas. If there is a topic that deserves plenty of time, \nthis is it. And, I daresay, as much as it may also cause what to many, \nincluding myself, is a distasteful commercialization of religion, this \nis a topic for which I assume the network easily sold loads of \nadvertising time--as apparently it did for the broadcast Monday night. \nIn this case, what actually aired was light on substance, but heavy on\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\nadvertising, giving the effort the appearance, at the very least, of a \nhigh-toned money grab.\n  I cannot be sure what motivated the show, ``The Search for Jesus.'' \nEvidently, Peter Jennings and staff spent months preparing for it, \nconducting interviews, researching, and traveling to Biblical sites. \nBut viewers were certainly done a disservice by the encapsulated \nversion that the network provided. As much as any journalist may try to \nlet others do the talking, to give the experts the floor, and to \npresent a rounded, unbiased view, when it comes right down to it, the \nfinished piece--except on very rare occasions--reflects the decisions, \ngood or bad, of producers and editors who must slice and trim to make \ntheir program fit into the time frame relegated to it by the network.\n  The show's conclusion--that Jesus was a man, that he existed--comes \nas no revelation to anyone who has lost someone dear and found solace \nonly in the Trinity. As the program noted, there were others before and \nduring His time who professed to be the messiah. They came and went, \nsometimes by execution, and their followers were either executed \nalongside their leaders or they found new ``messiahs'' in whom to place \ntheir faith. But, as the ABC show noted, Jesus was an exception. There \nwas something extraordinary--one might say miraculous--in the way that \nHis death promoted the proliferation of His teachings, and in the fact \nthat, nearly 2,000 years after His crucifixion, He continues to inspire \nfollowers around the world.\n  There is, indeed, no need to go to the Middle East to find Jesus. He \ncan be found in any West Virginia hamlet or hollow. He can be found in \nthe arid West, among towering urban buildings, and along peaceful ocean \nshores.\n  In the words of Job, that ancient man of Uz, ``Oh that my words were \nnow written! Oh that they were printed in a book! That they were graven \nwith an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! For I know that my \nRedeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the \nearth.''\n  I do not judge the intentions or the views of those who helped to put \ntogether ``The Search for Jesus'' program, but I know exactly where to \nplace my faith.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled \n``He's everywhere but here,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 2000]\n\n                        He's Everywhere But Here\n\n                            (By Tom Shales)\n\n       An essentially thankless task that proves also to be a \n     pointless one, ``The Search for Jesus'' is likely to anger \n     many of those who see it--and merely bore others. A two-hour \n     ABC News special, the documentary proceeds from a foolhardy \n     premise and, in the end, doesn't accomplish much more than a \n     dog chasing its tail.\n       And it's not much more illuminating to watch.\n       ``Peter Jennings Reporting: The Search for Jesus''--yes, \n     Jennings gets top billing over even the Messiah--supposedly \n     aims to discover what can be learned about ``Jesus, the \n     man,'' in historical rather than religious terms. But can \n     those two aspects of Jesus's life really be separated? The \n     danger is that what you'll end up with is an exercise in \n     myth-debunking potentially offensive to devout members of the \n     Christian faith. And that is precisely what happens.\n       The program, at 9 tonight on Channel 7, is peppered with \n     disingenuous disclaimers. ``We are very aware of our \n     limitations,'' Jennings says at one point, though much about \n     the program suggests journalistic arrogance and hauteur. He \n     concedes that it is difficult for a reporter ``to get the \n     story right'' in this case, but isn't it rather presumptuous \n     even to try? A little later, when Jennings says the question \n     of Jesus's divinity is ``a matter of taste,'' he sounds \n     ridiculously nonchalant about a topic of the deepest \n     spiritual profundity.\n       Devout Christians may not be the only ones taking umbrage. \n     Whenever Jennings parades into the Middle East, warning flags \n     are raised by American Jewish groups that have objected \n     several times to what they see as a pro-Palestinian, anti-\n     Israeli bias evident in some of the anchor's past work.\n       Thus one can only groan and shudder when Jennings, later in \n     the broadcast, opens the old can of worms about whether ``the \n     Jews'' or the Romans are more responsible for the crucifixion \n     of Christ. Oh how we don't need to get into that again. As it \n     turns out, the issue is rather diplomatically skirted by one \n     of several guest theologians who says, tiptoeing carefully, \n     that ``a very narrow circle of the ruling Jewish elite'' \n     probably did collaborate with the ruling Roman elite in \n     nailing Jesus to the cross.\n       As for the resurrection of Christ, upon which the entirety \n     of Christian faith rests, Jennings notes in his cavalier \n     style that there is ``a wide range of opinions'' about \n     whether it occurred. Come, now. You believe it or you \n     don't. That's the range of ``opinions.'' Anyone looking \n     for scientific or historical ``proof'' is flamboyantly \n     Missing the Point.\n       ``All but the most skeptical historians believe Jesus was a \n     real person,'' Jennings is willing to concede. But one by one \n     he sets about discrediting what Matthew, Mark, Luke and John \n     say about the miracles and divinity of Jesus, making a big \n     fuss, for one thing, over the fact that the four New \n     Testament books contain inconsistencies in their recountings \n     of the story.\n       Did a star in the east guide the Three Wise Men to the \n     manger where Jesus was born? ``I don't think there were Three \n     Wise Men,'' a biblical scholar huffs, and that's supposed to \n     dispel that detail. Jesus may not even have been born in \n     Jerusalem but rather in Nazareth, Jennings says; does it make \n     a particle of difference to the spiritual essence of the \n     matter?\n       Sometimes Jennings is content with ``analysis'' of the most \n     innocuous sort. Jesus ``must have been a controversial \n     figure'' in his own time, Jennings says. No kidding. But \n     mostly we get specious debunkery. Stories of Jesus performing \n     miracles were most likely ``invented'' by ``the gospel \n     writers,'' Jennings tells us. Even as relatively mundane a \n     detail as Jesus getting a hero's welcome when he entered \n     Jerusalem on Palm Sunday is dismissed: The crowd ``may have \n     been singing and shouting, but not necessarily for Jesus,'' \n     one of the ``experts'' opines.\n       It's also suggested, despite the daring Jennings \n     pronouncement that Jesus was ``controversial,'' that Jesus \n     may in fact have been ``a rather minor character'' in the \n     political turmoil of the era.\n       To the credit of producer Jeanmarie Condon, ``The Search \n     for Jesus'' does contain many visually arresting images, and \n     the program was for the most part beautifully shot by Ben \n     McCoy. There are such piquant ironies as a sign warning \n     ``Danger! Mines!'' near a spot where it is believed John the \n     Baptist and Jesus himself once preached. The first image on \n     the screen is striking: a silhouette of the Bethlehem skyline \n     today, a cross atop one building and a satellite dish atop \n     another.\n       Thus the program is handsomely produced yet stubbornly \n     wrongheaded and bogus, often seeming a gratuitous effort to \n     cast doubt on deeply and widely held beliefs. This isn't \n     really proper terrain for journalists to traverse. It was a \n     bad idea to do the show and it came out as flawed and muddled \n     as anyone might have dreaded.\n       Some of the padding in the two-hour time slot is filled \n     with modern, hip and usually dreadful recordings of hymns and \n     religious songs. A lot of territory, physically as well as \n     thematically, is covered, but for little purpose. At several \n     of the shrines in the Holy Land, we see tourists with video \n     cameras making their own personal documentaries about a visit \n     to the Middle East. Some viewers would be quite justified in \n     wishing they could look at those tapes rather than at ABC's \n     misbegotten and misguided ``Search.''\n       It is a search that leads nowhere. Slowly.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6062-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6062-S6103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION AND \n            RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 2001 --Resumed\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much. I hope I don't use all of the time \nand that I can yield Senator Brownback time because he started this \ngreat discussion with his amendment, on which I support and commend \nhim--the Ashcroft Medicare lockbox.\n  I have a pretty good suspicion that sometime soon it is going to be \nadopted by the Senate. The Senator can take great credit, being one who \nfrom the very beginning wanted to have a lockbox on Social Security--\nand even joined in the real lockbox bill, which, incidentally, was not \nthe lockbox we are considering for Social Security today. He has been \non the cutting edge of new ways to save both the Social Security trust \nfund and today on the Medicare HI part of the trust fund.\n  I rise to talk a little bit about the Social Security lockbox.\n  First of all, everybody should think for a minute. What kind of \nlockbox must the Democrats have when they have resisted a lockbox five \ntimes? That was a lockbox we came up with that the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, introduced with me and others. And \nfive times the Democrats have resisted it and have\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\nnot let us pass it. That ought to put up a little bit of a question: \nwhat is the difference between the two, since all of a sudden today on \nan appropriations bill--which probably means amendments are going to go \nnowhere other than to make a little racket here--we have two \ndistinguished and good colleagues of mine adopting a Democrat lockbox \nfor Social Security.\n  First, let me change that to six occasions when we have offered a \nlockbox we put together. Most people who check for a real lockbox, in \nthe sense of what that word means, say ours will do it and that others \nare questionable. Others are, in one degree or another, more easy to \nuse in terms of violating the lockbox and spending the money elsewhere.\n  The reason they are different is that ours is real. In the very sense \nof a lockbox written into law, ours is real.\n  Let me essentially tell you what we did. We calculated where the debt \nof the United States would be if all of the Social Security money were \nleft in, if we knew the numbers, and if we put in law and statute the \nlevel of debt each year for the foreseeable future. Then we said that \nstatute locks that money in, except in the case of war or the case of \neconomic emergency--we defined that as most economists do--and great \nnational disaster.\n\n  That is a lockbox. In order to spend it, we have to have a statute, a \nlaw that will change that level of debt that is related to Social \nSecurity.\n  My friend on the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, has for a long \ntime been a proponent of making sure we have the debt down, and I \ncommend the Senator. He has been concerned about Social Security, as \nhave many of us.\n  Essentially their lockbox is an invitation to waive the lockbox or, \nby a 60-vote majority, get rid of it. Thus, whatever you want you \nspend.\n  I urge, instead of the lockbox they have before the Senate, serious \nconsideration of accepting the lockbox that Senator Abraham, Senator \nDomenici, and Senator Ashcroft have tendered on six occasions. It is \ntruly what the senior citizens deserve when speaking about lockbox. We \nshould not be telling them it is a lockbox, but it can be waived simply \non the floor of the Senate.\n  How simple is it? We have just waived, for the two bills before the \nSenate, the Budget Act, which precluded doing what they were doing. We \ngot up and said: Let's waive it. We could reach the point where we want \nto spend Social Security and Members could come to the floor with a \nvital program and say, just as we waived the Budget Act in order to \ntake this off budget, let's waive it to spend it.\n  If you do the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft lockbox for Social Security, \nyou have to introduce a bill, say we want to change the debt limit as \nSocial Security impacts it. Frankly, I am very proud to have come up \nwith that idea. I think my friend from Michigan would acknowledge I \ncame up with it. I am very proud of him. For a long time, he has been \ntrying to get that voted on. He has told people what he was for, as \nSenator Ashcroft has. We have not had a vote.\n  We tried six times to get a lockbox vote, and we were denied it by \nthis institution, by our fellow Senators on the other side. Then all of \na sudden, on an appropriations bill, with a pretty positive chance that \nthe amendments aren't going anywhere because we cannot pass this kind \nof an amendment on an appropriations bill when it gets to the House--\nyou can take it out the door and send it to the House, but you are \npretty sure if it is not dropped before getting to the House, it is \nprobably dropped when you open the doors to the conference because it \ndoes not belong on this bill. I am not suggesting that either amendment \nis being offered knowing full well it is not going anywhere, but I am \nasking why doesn't the Senate vote on the real lockbox for Social \nSecurity.\n  We are going to have our vote today. I am wondering whether the \nSenator might give consideration to offering the real lockbox and see \nwhere we stand. I ask Senator Abraham what he thinks of that idea in \nterms of being a chief proponent.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I spoke on the floor a few minutes ago and raised many \nof the same inquiries the Senator has raised. I am disappointed, after \nso many efforts on our part to get a vote, that we couldn't.\n  On the other hand, I indicated I was heartened that today at least \nthere seems to be a willingness to begin to give people votes on issues \nrelating to the lockbox. I want to have the votes.\n\n  There is a clear distinction between the lockbox we have authored \ntogether and we want to have an opportunity for that stronger lockbox \nto be considered. I want it done soon. It ought to be done on a vehicle \nthat becomes a law.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One last point in reference to the Medicare lockbox \noff-budget proposal that my friends on the other side of the aisle have \noffered.\n  There is a giant loophole that we have never considered in the Social \nSecurity trust fund lockbox, nor is it considered in their lockbox on \nSocial Security. Current HI law permits all kinds of additions on the \nexpenditure side of Medicare.\n  If we leave that language in, we are opening that trust fund instead \nof closing it. When we take it off budget we open it to spend it, \nwhich, to me, seems almost inconsistent with why we are doing it.\n  I am not going to vote for either of the Democratic lockboxes because \nI think the Medicare does not work and the Social Security is not a \nreal lockbox.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleague and my friend from New Mexico, his \nlast reference is to a provision that says you can spend Medicare money \nfor Medicare programs. That is so we can have a BBA add-back, a \nbalanced budget add-back, for Medicare, as we did last year. There is \nnothing mysterious about that.\n  The Senator from New Mexico asked why we weren't supporting the \nlockbox proposal he made previously. There are two reasons: No. 1, we \ngot a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury saying that could \nthreaten default on the debt of the United States; No. 2, our analysts \nindicated that could threaten Social Security payments to those who are \neligible for Social Security. Those are the reasons we have not \naccepted that lockbox proposal.\n  I didn't just come here today proposing a lockbox. For 2 years, I \nhave proposed a Social Security and Medicare lockbox as a senior member \nof the Senate Budget Committee. Frankly, our friends on the other side \nof the aisle have resisted.\n  If the choice is between the lockbox proposal I have made today and \nthe lockbox proposal of the Senator from Missouri on the question of \nwhich is stronger, there is no question which is stronger. The \namendment I have offered is stronger. That is because there is a fatal \nflaw in the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. He provides no \nenforcement mechanism for the provision taking Medicare surpluses off \nbudget.\n  Under the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, no point of order \nwould apply against legislation that could use Medicare surpluses for \nother purposes. Under the Ashcroft amendment, the Medicare trust fund \ncould be depleted for any purpose as long as the overall budget \nremained in balance. That is the fact. That is the reality.\n\n  I notice the chairman of the Budget Committee never referenced the \namendment the Senator from Missouri has before the Senate today. Never \nreferenced it. He talked about a lockbox proposal they have had \npreviously--not about the lockbox proposal before us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Mexico 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For 10 years, we have had a written proposal with \nreference to the lockbox for Social Security and never have we put in \nlanguage that said what their Medicare lockbox amendment says, that the \nsurpluses can be used for spending related to the programs currently in \nHI. As a matter of fact, we have used the money for Social Security \nwith a lockbox, a ``verbal'' like theirs, that never included such \nlanguage, and we have spent the money on Social Security.\n  What I am saying is this is an invitation to expansion and spending, \nrather than an invitation to protecting it. We could be making HI less \nsolvent under this language rather than more solvent.\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Michigan so \nmuch time as he may consume up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to comment, in response to the \ncomments of the Senator from North Dakota, the following: The Senator \nfrom North Dakota has characterized the stance of those of us who have \nnot supported his proposal for a Medicare and Social Security lockbox \nas resisting his efforts for 2 years. Resisting his efforts is not, in \nmy judgment, a proper characterization. We have not supported those \nefforts. But what we have done today is provided the Senator from North \nDakota a chance to have a vote on a proposal he has worked on and for \nwhich he has sought support. I would like to distinguish that from what \nI consider to be the accurate definition of resistance, which is to not \neven give a vote to people who have a legitimate proposal to bring to \nthe floor of the Senate, and I consider the amendment Senators Domenici \nand Ashcroft and I drafted with respect to a Social Security lockbox to \nbe a legitimate piece of legislation that deserves the same \nconsideration that we will soon give the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota and his colleagues, I hope, in \nthe spirit with which a vote is being offered on the proposal that he \nhas today, we will get a straight up-or-down vote on the proposal we \nhave been offering because now that you have had this chance we will \nsee what happens, obviously, both here and in the conference that will \nfollow the passage of this legislation. I would like to have the \nopportunity to get a straight up-or-down vote on the legislation that \non five or six or whatever number it is separate occasions has been \nprevented from happening. That to me would be the difference between \nresistance and lack of support.\n  I do not ask the Senator from North Dakota to vote for my proposal. I \nhope he and his colleagues would at least give us an opportunity to let \nall of us cast our votes up or down on it. I hope we get that chance. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am running out of time. The Senator from \nMissouri informs me he has 20 minutes left. I have 2 minutes left. \nUnder the rules, if neither of us uses time right now, the remaining \ntime of each of us is used equally, which means I would run out of \ntime. He has indicated that is what he would do. If I do not take this \ntime for my final argument, we just lose the time. Those are the rules \nof the Senate. That is fair.\n  I say this. I am saying this for the benefit of colleagues on my side \nwho are wondering if there is additional time available. Clearly, there \nis not.\n  The Senator from Michigan and the Senator from New Mexico have again \nraised the question of the lockbox they offered previously; not the \nlockbox on which we are about to vote, but what they offered \npreviously. The reason our side resisted that lockbox approach is \nbecause we received a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury from \nwhich I quote:\n\n       Our analysis indicates that the provisions Senators \n     Domenici and Abraham and Ashcroft were previously offering \n     could preclude the United States from meeting its financial \n     obligations to repay maturing debt and to make Social \n     Security benefit payments, and could also worsen a future \n     economic downturn.\n\n  That is the reason we resisted those plans, because they were flawed. \nThat is the same reason I believe the amendment I have offered today, \nto have a Social Security and Medicare lockbox--something I have \nproposed for 2 years--is superior to the option we are actually voting \non today. The reason our proposal is superior, I believe, is because it \nprotects Medicare. It protects it in the same way we protect Social \nSecurity: by points of order to make certain that it is not raided.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from Missouri does not \nhave that level of protection. He has less protection for Medicare than \nfor Social Security. He does not have a point of order that can apply \nagainst legislation that would use Medicare surpluses for other \npurposes. The problem with that is under the Ashcroft amendment the \nMedicare trust fund could be raided, could be depleted for any purpose \nas long as the overall budget remained in balance.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time under the control of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has expired. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 17 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield to the Senator from Michigan as much time as he \nmay consume up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. I \ncannot resist responding to the closing remarks by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I have to say, I interpret his comments as saying he and \nhis colleagues, because they oppose or would vote against the lockbox \nproposal we have offered so many times, would not even let us have an \nup-or-down vote on it. I think that is unfortunate.\n  I think the way the Senate works, they certainly have an ability to \nprevent votes. But so do we. I hope we will not have to get to the \npoint where we have to engage both sides in those kinds of tactics. We \nhave certainly demonstrated today a willingness to have a vote on his \nSocial Security lockbox proposal. The concerns he raised in the letter \nthat was written by Secretary Rubin, the long-since departed Secretary \nof the Treasury, were in fact responded to by us in the modifications \nthat we brought in the most recent version of this lockbox.\n  Certainly I am not going to get into the merits of that at this \npoint, but the notion that because the Secretary of the Treasury argues \nthat something could cause problems should prevent us from having a \nchance to vote on an issue--there are plenty of issues we vote here \nwhere Cabinet members have raised the specter of problems if such votes \nor legislation were passed.\n  It is pretty clear to me that notwithstanding the seemingly positive \nsteps taken today to give the Senator from North Dakota an opportunity \nto have his Social Security lockbox voted on, we are still going to \nmeet impediments in the effort to get ours voted on. I would put the \nPresiding Officer and the Senate on notice, we are going to keep \ntrying. We, unfortunately, may have to go into the sorts of tactical \napproaches that cause a lot of time to be taken when it seems to me we \ncould accommodate both sides on this fairly easily. In any event, we \nwill keep pressing forward on it.\n  I close by complimenting the Senator from Missouri whose steadfast \nefforts on both the Social Security lockbox as well as the Medicare \nlockbox front predated the efforts of anyone else of whom I am aware, \ncertainly on the Medicaid issue. He has certainly demonstrated his \ncommitment to that. Certainly his efforts to bring these issues to the \nfloor deserve all our praise and thanks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nhis kind remarks and for his commitment to maintaining the integrity of \nour Social Security and Medicare trust fund. Frankly, I thank the \nSenator from North Dakota for coming to the floor to engage in the \ndebate about a very important issue, as well as the other Senators who \nhave come forward to indicate their support for discontinuing--or \nstopping--what has become a rather traditional exercise of this \nCongress: spending money out of the Medicare trust fund for other \npurposes.\n  It is time for us to cease that kind of expenditure. It is time for \nus to say the trust fund, which is made up of taxes specifically paid \nby working people--you have to work to pay the Medicare tax; it is a \nspecific tax paid by working people--should be off limits to other \nexpenditures.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I thank the Senator from \nMichigan. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I am grateful for the \nothers--the Senator from New Jersey and others--who have talked about \nthis issue. It is a major step forward.\n  There are a lot of folks who have come to the floor talking about how \nthey wanted this for a long time. Frankly, we have not had this kind of\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\ndebate on protecting the Medicare trust fund in my memory. When I filed \nthis legislation last November, I was not aware of any, and I still do \nnot know that there is, any other legislation similar to this that had \nbeen filed at that time. I am delighted we are making this progress. I \ncommend people on both sides of the aisle for this progress.\n  My amendment protects the Social Security surplus as well. Social \nSecurity is off budget already. My amendment prohibits on-budget \ndeficits.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is talking about how durably he \nprotects the Medicare trust fund with a point of order that takes 60 \nvotes in the Senate. I am pleased for him to embrace that and to talk \nabout it and say how good it is, in part because that is the budget \nrule which I proposed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for 30 seconds? If \nhe will yield for a couple of seconds, I want to yield 5 minutes of my \nleader time to the senior Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield the floor for 5 minutes of leader time for the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will not take 5 minutes at this point. I \nwant to make the point that I appreciate the Senator from Missouri. He \nis serious and sincere about an effort to provide a Social Security and \nMedicare lockbox, but when you look at the specifics of what he has \nproposed, it falls short. There is a fatal flaw.\n  Let's look at fiscal year 2000. There is projected a $150 billion \nSocial Security surplus. That is protected. There is a $24 billion \nprojected Medicare surplus. Under the proposal of the Senator from \nMissouri, every penny of the Medicare surplus could be taken for other \npurposes because the protection he provides is aimed at the overall \nbudget being in surplus, not at the Medicare component being in \nsurplus. So he has a lockbox that leaks. That is the problem.\n  The reason the amendment I have offered, along with Senator \nLautenberg, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, is superior is \nthat it solves that problem. We do not have a leak. We have a budget \npoint of order that prevails.\n  In addition, the Senator from Missouri does not have Social Security \nprotection. We do. We have additional points of order that apply to \nmake sure nobody raids Social Security.\n  Our colleagues are going to have a defining vote in just a few \nminutes: Do you want to have the strongest protection for Social \nSecurity and Medicare, or do you want a weak tea version? That is going \nto be the choice, and all of us are going to be held accountable for \nour votes. That is the point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to finish my remarks on this measure without further \ninterruption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I begin----\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I was talking with someone else. What was the \nrequest?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I could not hear the Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has the floor, but \nthe Chair will repeat the unanimous-consent request, which was, he be \nallowed to finish the remainder of his time uninterrupted.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I tried to accommodate the Senators on \nthe other side. When the leader from the other side asked for 5 \nadditional minutes, I interrupted my own remarks, and I thought it \nwould be fair for me to have an opportunity to spend my time without \nbeing interrupted. I will start over.\n  I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his concern and for \ncoming to the floor to debate this issue. I am delighted we have now \ncome to a place where we are debating ``hows'' instead of if we are \ngoing to do it--how we are going to do it. Both of these measures \nprovide a 60-vote point of order, which is a pretty high hurdle to \nclimb over, as a way of protecting Medicare. As a matter of fact, that \nis the mechanism that is used in the protection for Social Security.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has commended that as durable, strong, \nvigorous, robust protection. It happens to be the protection which I \nplaced in the law as a result of an amendment I offered in the budget \nprocess in previous budget years so that we would find ourselves \nincapable of infringing the Social Security surplus. When we adopted \nthat amendment and embraced it, we had tremendously good results.\n  This year, it looks as if there may be as many as $175 billion we \nwill save, not spend; that we will respect instead of invade in terms \nof the Social Security surplus. That is a big positive. Really, what \nboth sides of the aisle are talking about is getting the kind of \nrobust, strong protection for Medicare that we have for Social \nSecurity.\n  I have to say how much I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nNew Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who talked about the \nfact we need protection in the statute, not just in the budget rules. \nIt is lamentable that each time we have sought to upgrade that \nprotection from the budget rules to a statute, there has been a \nfilibuster on the other side.\n  They now say the reason they were filibustering--one time they said \nit is because of Medicare; another time they waved an opinion that came \nfrom the Secretary of the Treasury. One of the reasons the Secretary of \nthe Treasury indicated he would not want to support what we were \noffering was they might need to do additional spending in certain times \nin our economy. I understand there are those who believe wanting to \nspend more is a reason not to do this, but the real reason for wanting \nto do this is to spend less, especially to spend less of the money that \nis in the lockbox.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has raised issues regarding the \nsecurity of the lockbox which I have proposed. A good debate on these \nissues is important and appropriate. As a matter of fact, we want to \nhave the strongest lockbox we can. I would not come to this Chamber and \noffer lockbox legislation that is not durable and not strong. I do not \nthink the Senator from North Dakota would either. There are problems \nwith the proposal of the Senator from North Dakota. This particular \nphrase on the fifth page of his amendment beginning with the words:\n\n       This paragraph shall not apply to amounts to be expended \n     from the hospital insurance trust fund--\n\n  That is, Medicare trust fund----\n\n     for purposes relating to programs within part A of the \n     Medicare as provided in law on date of enactment of this \n     paragraph.\n\n  Frankly, they may have a durable lock on that box; they may have \nreinforced corners on the box; they may have a stout handle on the box; \nbut if there is a hole in the side of the box, we have problems.\n  I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico raising this issue about \npotential leakage from the box. What we should be about, though, is not \ntrying to find ways in which our proposals are inadequate or whether \nthere is a hole in his box or whether my supermajority point of order \nis as durable as his supermajority point of order. We should be about \nthe business of protecting the Social Security surplus and the Medicare \nsurplus and doing it in a durable way and a way which means this \nCongress will not relapse into habits that Congress engaged in for \ndecade after decade. It is time for us to respect the need for a \nlockbox.\n  I filed the measure last November. Last month, Vice President Gore \nendorsed the concept of a lockbox. This week, 2 days ago, the President \nof the United States said we ought to have a lockbox to secure the \nMedicare box so that it would not be available for spending. I do not \nknow what the Treasury said last year, but I know what the President \nsaid last week. And I agree with that.\n\n  So it is possible to quibble here or there about one aspect of this \nor the other. It is instructive for me to know that these amendments \nwere not proposed until I came to the floor to propose this.\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\n  I am delighted that for the first time in my memory we are debating a \nMedicare lockbox, in conjunction with a Social Security lockbox, that \nis durable.\n  May I inquire as to the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So with that in mind, I commend to the Members of the \nSenate, generally, the concept of a lockbox: a durable, secure, \nmechanism that keeps this Congress from reengaging in activities it has \nengaged in over time.\n  As this measure moves forward, let's do what we can to improve it in \nevery way possible. Let's talk about a lockbox for Social Security that \nis statutory.\n  I was delighted to be able to put it in the budget rules of the \nSenate so that it is out of order for someone to propose spending \nSocial Security income trust funds for non-Social Security purposes. \nBut I would like to see it enshrined into law.\n  We have talked about waiving budget points of order. Obviously, I \nwould like to have this be beyond a point of order. I would be very \npleased to have a law enshrined for the way in which we would enforce \nthese rules.\n  It is with that in mind that I express my appreciation to the Members \nof the Senate and say that our objective here is relatively uniform. \nFrom what I can tell from arguments made on the other side, to \narguments made on this side, we both want a lockbox. We both want a \nlockbox that is durable. We want one that does not leak. We want one \nthat is enforceable.\n  The lockbox--I think we are agreeing today--should be one that \nprotects not only Social Security but Medicare. When we get this close \nto this kind of agreement on an issue that is this important, I think \nit is time for us to work together.\n  I do not want to fight with my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. I want to work with them. If we are close to having a durable \nSocial Security lockbox and if we are close to having one that protects \nMedicare, I want to do it.\n  I have been working on this for over 2 years. Early in 1999, S. 502, \nthe Social Security Safe Deposit Act, was incorporated in the fiscal \nyear 2000 budget resolution, and again in the fiscal year 2001 budget \nresolution, with those kinds of rules. That is why we have the \ndurability of at least the rules.\n  Finally, the Conrad amendment does not offer stronger protection for \nSocial Security than the Ashcroft budget rule. It is the same thing. It \nis codified. I think we can even do better than that. I would like to \ndo better than that with a statute.\n  While both offer the same point of order protection for Medicare, my \namendment does not have the hole in the side of the box and, as a \nresult, I think it is stronger. But, very frankly, I want to work with \nfolks on the other side of the aisle who agree with me on this issue. I \nam not opposed to the idea of our working together to get it done.\n\n  So I announce to my colleagues in the Senate, I do not think it is a \ndifficult thing to vote for my amendment. I think it is a very good \namendment. I do not think it is a difficult thing to vote for the \namendment on the other side of the aisle.\n  I hope if we vote for these amendments, and they are enacted, that we \nwill be able to work together toward a solution that really helps the \nAmerican people, that protects senior citizens from having the Medicare \ntrust fund violated, and from having the trust fund for Social Security \nviolated as well.\n  I would like to see that done in statute as well as in the rules of \nthe Senate. It is with that in mind that I thank the Members of the \nopposition and those who have spoken on behalf of this amendment. I \nthink we can work together for a really important purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  All time on the Conrad amendment and the Ashcroft amendment has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I had 3 minutes of leader time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, I assure my colleague that my \namendment was not in response to his. I had filed for an amendment \nyesterday. I offered this amendment in the Finance Committee yesterday. \nI have offered a lockbox for Social Security and Medicare for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears--a different Medicare-Social Security lockbox than is advocated \nhere today by the Senator from Missouri because I believe there is a \nfatal flaw in the amendment of the Senator from Missouri.\n  That fatal flaw is that his protection does not work. It does not \nwork because, under the Ashcroft amendment, no point of order would \napply against legislation that would use Medicare surpluses for other \npurposes. The result of that is, under the Ashcroft amendment, the \nMedicare trust fund could be depleted for any purpose as long as the \noverall budget remained in balance. That is the problem with the \namendment of the Senator from Missouri.\n  That is the reason the amendment that I have offered is superior. It \nis stronger. It provides real protection for Medicare, by way of \nspecial points of order against a budget resolution that would violate \nthe off-budget status of Medicare Part A.\n  The fact is, the amendment of the Senator from Missouri does not \nprovide the same protection to Medicare that we provide to Social \nSecurity.\n\n  Now, why would we do that? If we are serious about protecting \nMedicare, wouldn't we have the same points of order apply to protect \nMedicare in the same way that we protect Social Security? I would hope \nso. Because if we do not, the hard reality is the amendment of the \nSenator from Missouri would permit us to go and raid every penny of the \nSocial Security surplus or every penny of the Medicare surplus this \nyear and use it for another purpose. That is a mistake.\n  In addition, the Ashcroft amendment is silent on Social Security, \nwhile the amendment that I have offered adds a point of order against \nviolating the off-budget status of Social Security.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for the Conrad-Lautenberg-Reid \namendment so we really protect Medicare in the same way we protect \nSocial Security. That is what we ought to do here today. That is the \nopportunity we have here today. We ought to take it. We ought to \nprotect Medicare and Social Security. We ought to adopt this lockbox \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold be added \nas a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  All time on the Conrad amendment and the Ashcroft amendment has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be ordered on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second \nvote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On the time of the votes that are about to occur, I \nremind my colleagues of what Senator Lott said earlier today in \nresponse to what the Senator from Nevada said, that Senators need to be \nprepared to have the time limits enforced.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 3690\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Jeffords \namendment be modified to be formatted as a first-degree amendment. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the minority leader, a vote occur in \nrelation to the Daschle amendment No. 3688, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Jeffords amendment, with no other amendments in order \nto either amendment prior to the votes.\n  I further ask consent that the time for debate prior to votes in \nrelation to the amendments be the following: Senator Jeffords, 25 \nminutes; Senator Daschle, 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask if the distinguished manager of the bill would \nmodify the request to allow for votes to take place immediately \nfollowing the disposition of the debate on the two amendments. The \nunanimous consent did call for that. I assume that is the understanding \nof the proponent of the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it would be my preference to stack these \nvotes at the end. We always run into delays. We have a number of \namendments. If we vote in between, it is going to add considerable time \nto the bill. We will have three or four votes. It will be my hope--it \nrequires the Senator's consent, of course--that we stack the votes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was asked to delay the consideration of \nthis amendment this morning. I said I would. I have been attempting to \naccommodate Senators all the way through. We have lost a couple of \nSenators already. I would be compelled to object to this unless we were \nable to get the two votes immediately following the debate on the two \namendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it appears it will be faster to accept \nSenator Daschle's recommendation, so I do so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object--I will not object--I ask \nif you could add 5 minutes for the Senator from New Mexico on this \ngeneral subject, your amendment. I ask 5 minutes be set aside for me.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Jeffords and I be \ngiven 30 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up my amendment, amendment No. \n3691, and ask unanimous consent Senators Frist and Snowe be added as \ncosponsors. I ask unanimous consent also Senator Ashcroft be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair as to the \namount of time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from South Dakota has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this week's announcement of the \ncompletion of the rough draft of the human genetic map is cause for \nboth celebration and concern.\n  One of the challenges that comes to mind immediately is that we must \nprotect Americans against genetic self-incrimination. What we are, \nshould not be used against us.\n  This vast new storehouse of knowledge must be used to advance, not \nretard, individuals' health and welfare.\n  In 1998, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee held a \nhearing on genetic information and health care which proved to be one \nof the most important of the 105th Congress.\n  Following the hearing, I and Senator Frist, with the other members of \nthe HELP Committee, together with Senator Mack and Senator Snowe, began \ndrafting legislation that builds on Senator Snowe's bill, S. 89, to \nensure that individuals would be able to control the use of their \npredictive genetic information.\n  After a lot of hard work, we agreed to a set of strong protections \nagainst the use of genetic information to discriminate in health care. \nThe results of these efforts are reflected in the genetic information \nprovisions of The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\n  As Dr. Francis Collins, director of the public genomic effort, \npointed out this week:\n\n       Most of the sequencing of the human genome by this \n     international consortium has been done in just the last \n     fifteen months.\n\n  The pace of change is rapid, and this issue has increased in \nimportance since our hearing two years ago.\n  Everyone in this Chamber and outside of it agrees we need to guard \ngenetic privacy and guard against genetic discrimination.\n  Citing a study that found that 46 percent of Americans thought that \nthe consequences of the Human Genome Project would be negative, Dr. \nCraig Venter said:\n\n       New laws to protect us from genetic discrimination are \n     critical in order to maximize the medical benefits from \n     genome discoveries.\n\n  That's why it's included in the Bill of Patients' Rights passed by \nthe Senate as our body of scientific knowledge about genetics \nincreases, so, too, do the concerns about how this information may be \nused.\n  There is no question that our understanding of genetics has brought \nus to a new future. Our challenge as a Congress is to enact legislation \nto help ensure that our society reaps the full health benefits of \ngenetic testing, and also to put to rest any concerns that the \ninformation will be used as a new tool to discriminate against specific \nethnic groups or individual Americans.\n  Our amendment which is already in the Patients' Bill of Rights, \naddresses the concerns that were raised at our hearing two years ago:\n  First, it prohibits group health plans and health insurance companies \nin all markets from adjusting premiums on the basis of predictive \ngenetic information;\n  Second, it prohibits group health plans and health insurance \ncompanies from requesting predictive genetic information as a condition \nof enrollment.\n  Finally, it bars health plans from requiring that an individual \ndisclose or authorize the collection of predictive genetic information \nfor diagnosis, treatment, or payment purposes. A plan or insurer may \nrequest such information, but if it does, it must provide individuals \nwith a description of the procedures in place to safeguard the \nconfidentiality of the information.\n  Our amendment is identical to the provision adopted by the Senate \nlast July. We should adopt it again today.\n  Technology and scientific developments, stimulated by the Human \nGenome Project, have led to remarkable progress in genetics and better \nunderstanding of alterations in genes that are associated with diseases \nin humans. We should witness extraordinary opportunities to diagnose, \ntreat, and prevent disease.\n  With the enactment of this amendment, we will be able to ensure that \nthese breakthroughs will be used to provide better health for all \nmembers of our society.\n  A second challenge that we face is the possibility that employers \nmight use genetic information to screen employees for various purposes, \ndiscriminating against one group or another based on genetic \ninformation. This, too, I think we should prevent.\n  I am not sure, and I do not think anyone in this Chamber can be sure, \nthat we do not already do so. It was my understanding that the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act already outlawed genetic discrimination \nin employment.\n  That was certainly Congress' intent when we enacted the ADA.\n  I am not alone in my belief. The Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission has interpreted the ADA as including genetic information \nrelating to illness, disease or other disorders and the Supreme Court \nissued a decision that provided further support for this position.\n  As recently as March of this year, EEOC Commissioner Paul Miller \nstated that the ADA does indeed cover genetic discrimination. However, \nif I am mistaken, then this just highlights the need for further \nexamination of the issue.\n  I am also concerned that Senator Daschle's amendment contains new \nstatutory language that is different from the ADA, which would result \nin treating genetics differently than other health care information.\n  More and more, I think this will be an increasingly difficult line to \ndraw.\n  If that is not confusing enough, there is yet another definition of \ngenetic information that is part of the rule being promulgated by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to protect individually \nidentifiable health information.\n  I want to guard against employment discrimination, but I want to do \nit right.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee will hold a \nhearing in the next month or two on genetic discrimination in the \nworkplace.\n  In the hearing, the committee will explore whether the ADA adequately \ncovers genetic discrimination in the workplace. If we find that the ADA \ndoes not provide adequate coverage for genetic discrimination in the \nworkplace then we will work to enact legislation that will provide \nadequate protection.\n  However, I think it is important that any law we enact is in parity \nwith the ADA and our other employment discrimination laws.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment has good intentions, but putting \nprovisions regarding genetic discrimination in employment into an \nappropriations bill, without studying the issue further, is \ninappropriate. This issue deserves and requires a thorough discussion \nin its own forum.\n  Again, I urge adoption of my amendment. It has already been agreed to \nby the Senate, and it is the product of two years of thought and hard \nwork.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we now know what this is all about. Some \nof our Republican colleagues are going to try to convince a majority in \nthis body that employment ought not be included when we consider \ndiscrimination based upon genetic character. I do not think employment \ndiscrimination should be treated differently from insurance \ndiscrimination. I do not think people who have experienced \ndiscrimination, as we have already seen in so many illustrations, ought \nto be told they have to be concerned about their job simply because of \nsome genetic defect.\n  That has already happened. We have already seen that happen in case \nafter case. I described a case this morning where Terri Seargent, who \nhad moved up the corporate ladder and was given promotion after \npromotion, was asked to resign when it was learned that she had the \ngenetic marker for ``Alpha 1''. No woman, no man, no person, no \nemployee, should be subjected to discrimination based upon genetic \ncharacteristics, and that is happening today.\n  ADA passed a long time ago. That law did not envision the challenges \nscience presents us today. We are simply proposing that we clarify that \nit should be unlawful to discriminate on the basis of genetic \ninformation.\n  The bottom line question is, when it comes down to these two \nproposals, whether we should prohibit both health insurers and \nemployers from using predictive genetic information in a discriminatory \nfashion? There is agreement, at least with regard to one issue: we \nshould prohibit health insurers from doing it, but our Republican \ncolleagues--at least the senior Senator from Vermont--are saying we \njust should not cover employers. We should not do it because he would \nlike to have us believe it is already being done. Tell that to Terri \nSeargent. Tell that to myriad other people who already have had \ndifficulty explaining their situation, in large measure because they \nhave found some genetic defect.\n\n  We agree that insurance companies should not discriminate. We agree \nthere should not be any tests for conditions of coverage. We simply \ndisagree at this moment about whether or not we ought to take what we \nhave already done for virtually every other form of discrimination in \nthis country and extend it to genetic information.\n  The senior Senator from Vermont says no, he does not want to do that. \nBut I cannot imagine that in this day, in this age, given what we are \ndoing with the genome project and our recognition of what it will mean, \nboth good and bad, for this country and for our people that now is not \nthe time to ensure that, regardless of circumstance, we will not allow \nthis to be used as a means of discrimination in the workplace.\n  Listen to what Francis Collins, one of the key people who headed the \ninternational research team that makes up\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\nthe human genome project, said about this very issue:\n\n       Genetic discrimination in insurance and the workplace is \n     wrong and it ought to be prevented by effective Federal \n     legislation.\n\n  This is from the head of the research unit. He does not have any \nquestion about whether or not ADA covers genetic discrimination. He has \nalready decided. He is the head of the research team. He said this \nought to be a wake-up call; let's ban it today. He did not say let's \nwait for more hearings. He did not say let's get out there and try to \nfigure out a way to do it through regulation. He said this ought to be \na wake-up call. That is not Tom Daschle; that is not Terri Seargent who \nhas been discriminated against; that is Francis Collins, the head of \nthe international research project calling upon the Senate today to ban \ndiscrimination based upon employment. It cannot be any clearer than \nthat, Mr. President.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Tennessee 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, earlier this week we received tremendously \nexciting news in that we essentially had completion of the mapping of \nthe human genome. It is tremendously exciting to me, both as a \npolicymaker but also as a physician, as someone who has spent his life \ntaking care of thousands of patients because it introduces a whole new \nway of thinking that in the history of mankind we just simply have not \nhad. Now there will be whole new ways of thinking.\n  I think we should salute both Craig Venter from Celera and Francis \nCollins for pioneering, for leading this great effort, which will \ntotally change the way we do such things as engineer drugs, the so-\ncalled gene drugs. Now and into the future, we can begin to think how \nwe use our own genes, our own proteins, our own metabolites in such a \nway that they become the pharmaceutical agent instead of a manufactured \ndrug.\n  It changes the way we will think about organ replacement. Before I \ncame to the Senate, I would make an incision, remove a diseased heart, \nand have to put in a new heart. Hopefully, 10 years from now, or 15 \nyears from now, when we transplant kidneys or a pancreas, or other \norgans, we will be able to engineer them based on what we have \nuncovered.\n  A third area which this human genome project opens up, as we look to \nthe future, is that of genetic testing. We have been talking about and \ndebating the issue of genetic testing over the last couple hours. That \nis where you can take a swab, and by rubbing that swap over an array, a \npattern of DNA that is lined up, you will be able to predict that a \nperson has a 75-percent chance of getting prostate cancer 10 years from \nnow or a 90-percent chance a person will have breast cancer.\n  The potential good is the change in behavior, the change in \nlifestyle, the change in the intervention that can come about to \npreempt, preclude, stop the progress of cancer.\n  Unfortunately, as has been laid out and debated today, there are \npotential dangers, potential harm, if that information is misused. \nShould policymakers address this potential abuse of genetic information \nin the workplace? There is no question; yes, we have a responsibility.\n  Technology has given us new tools which give us new ways to think \nabout gene therapy, organ replacement, genetic testing, and the \ntreatment of cancers and heart disease. We are obligated to make sure \nthe barriers are lowered to take the good in the development of science \nbut also minimize whatever harm there might potentially be.\n  But to do that, what is our responsibility? Not to have a knee-jerk \nreaction and accept a proposal which very few people in this body have \neven read, much less studied, discussed, and debated. But first, we \nshould focus on the issues that we have studied, that we have addressed \nin committee, that we have debated, including the input we have \nsolicited from doctors, physicians, scientists, and consumer groups, \nwith both sides of the aisle coming to certain agreements.\n  Let us start there and systematically address these ethical-type \nissues which have been introduced by this new science just 3 days ago. \nLet's not have a knee-jerk reaction until every Senator can ask the \nimportant questions.\n\n  I agree 100 percent that we should not discriminate in any way using \npredictive genetic information in the workplace. That needs to be put \nfirst. I think it is unfair for the other side to say we are for \ndiscrimination in the workplace by genetic testing. It is just unfair. \nIt is just unfair because we are against that.\n  But to address the policies, in looking at this amendment that has \nbeen offered today by Senator Daschle and his colleagues, there is a \nhealth insurance section. I have read most of that because I have had \nseveral hours to do that. I read a little of the employment section. \nThe genetic privacy is very complicated. I can tell you, we need to \ndiscuss that a lot more.\n  As to the various definitions of what a predictive genetic test is, I \nwould have to say, the genetic tests they are talking about, where they \nare actually talking about metabolites, I don't know, I will have to go \nout and talk to the real experts, but they may go too far.\n  So I do not want to pass a major reform bill that will potentially \ntotally underwrite or change the way we treat people in the workplace \nbased on definitions that I do not fully agree with now. But I do not \nknow enough about it until we can talk to people broadly.\n  This whole expansion of penalties in the fourth section of the bill, \nI do not know exactly what we are penalizing, if it is just that one \nstatement of penalizing people who use genetic information. First of \nall, it depends on what that definition is--which I do not agree with--\nbut if it goes beyond that--and I don't know whether it does--I need to \nknow that.\n  I say all that because this amendment Senator Daschle has offered \nsimply has not been vetted. It has not been discussed. I have been \ninvolved in the genetic debates with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle--some initial discussions--but I can tell you, we have not gone \ninto any sort of detail on this whole issue of expanding penalties in \nthis expanded, complicated field of genetic privacy and employment.\n  The one area that has been mentioned is that of health care quality \nand the use of genetic information in health care, in the health \ninsurance arena.\n  It is very clear that patients need to be free to undergo genetic \ntesting because that can influence, in a positive way, the outcome of \ntheir health care. If they receive information that there is an 80-\npercent chance they will develop breast cancer, that is likely to \nchange how many times they do self-exams a week, how often they go to \nthe doctor, how often they get a mammogram. That information should be \nused. There should be no chance that information will be used by an \ninsurance company to discriminate against them in denying them \ninsurance.\n  It can change lifestyle. If there is a test with an 80-percent chance \nthat you will develop lung cancer, you will want to know that. Why? \nBecause it can change lifestyle.\n  We have a bill we have debated extensively since 1996 which does just \nthat. Our bill, the Jeffords-Frist bill, prohibits health insurers from \nrequiring patients to undergo genetic testing and prohibits health \ninsurers from using genetic information to deny coverage or set rates \nfor currently healthy individuals who may be at risk for a future \ndisease.\n  Again, this issue has been vetted through the process, has been \nvetted through Chairman Jeffords' committee. Discussion has gone on. In \n1995, the debate in the markup of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was \nextensive in numerous areas.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to adopt the amendment Chairman \nJeffords has offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just respond to a few of the \narguments posed by the Senator from Tennessee.\n  First of all, with regard to the technicalities to which he made \nreference, I do not know what technicalities and what information could \nbe murky about what it is we are trying to do.\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\n  We simply say there should not be any employment discrimination based \non genetic information. That is it. He talked about these \ndiscrimination actions being subjected to a mysterious penalty. All we \nhave said in section 4 of the bill is that if you think you were \ndiscriminated against, you can go to court and have a court make some \ndecision with regard to whether there is discrimination or not. That is \nthe penalty. We do not prescribe any penalties. We prescribe some \ndegree of accountability. We simply say, if you think you were \ndiscriminated against, you get to sue, period. That is all.\n  On another point, let me say that the legislation proposed by our \nRepublican colleagues has already been analyzed in some detail as part \nof their Patients' Bill of Rights, as the Senator from Vermont has \nsaid.\n  On April 12, Senator Harkin received a letter from 59 health \norganizations that wrote with concern about the language propounded in \nthis amendment by the Senator from Vermont. Fifty-nine health \norganizations have already said: This is not the way we ought to do it.\n  They don't need more hearings. They don't need more information. They \nhave looked at the bill. They have come to the conclusion that if we \nare going to write public policy regarding genetic discrimination, this \nisn't it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and names of all 59 \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                   April 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: In the very near future, scientists \n     will have deciphered the entire human genetic code, providing \n     human beings with more information about our health than ever \n     before. Tests are already available that can detect genetic \n     traits associated with particular diseases, and the use of \n     such tests is expected to increase dramatically in coming \n     years.\n       Genetic testing will improve our lives by providing \n     information on how we can prevent future health problems, and \n     cope more effectively with unavoidable conditions. But the \n     ability to predict diseases through genetic testing and \n     family history opens troubling questions about \n     discrimination, particularly in employment and health care.\n       As you begin to consider the House and Senate versions of \n     managed care reform, we write to draw your attention to Title \n     III of S. 1344, the Senate bill. We commend the Senate for \n     including provisions intended to protect individuals from \n     discrimination in health insurance based on genetic \n     information. However, we believe that the provisions in the \n     Senate bill as currently crafted are inadequate to meet the \n     challenges raised by the extraordinary scientific advances of \n     our time.\n       Without comprehensive protections covering both employment \n     and health care, patients have reason to fear that their \n     genetic information could be used as a basis for \n     discrimination. Many health care professionals report that \n     because of these fears many patients are reluctant to \n     participate in important clinical studies that require \n     genetic testing, slowing medical and scientific progress.\n       The undersigned organizations, representing patients, \n     people with disabilities, consumers, women's and civil rights \n     organizations and many others, urge the conferees to retain \n     and improve Title III of the Senate Bill in the final \n     conference bill, by incorporating the following changes.\n       1. Add meaningful penalties and sanctions. As currently \n     drafted, the provision for punishing violators is \n     tremendously weak. Without meaningful mechanisms for holding \n     violators accountable, even the strongest genetic \n     discrimination protections become meaningless. Victims of \n     discrimination must have the ability to enforce their rights \n     in state or federal court and to receive appropriate legal \n     and equitable relief.\n       2. Add protections from discrimination in employment. As \n     currently drafted, the Senate bill bans discrimination by \n     group health plans and issuers, but provides no protection \n     against job-based discrimination. Thus, even if group health \n     plans and issuers are prevented from misusing genetic \n     information, the very same information could be used against \n     individuals in employment. Genetic information must not be \n     misused to deny people employment opportunities.\n       3. Prevent unauthorized disclosure of genetic information. \n     One of the best ways to protect people against discrimination \n     is to prevent the disclosure of information to those in a \n     position to misuse it. There is no federal law that prohibits \n     group health plans or issuers from disclosing people's \n     genetic information. We urge the committee to add strong \n     protections against disclosure of genetic information.\n       4. Clarify plans' limited ability to request predictive \n     genetic information. S. 1344 provides that a plan can request \n     (but not require) that an individual disclose predictive \n     genetic information for purposes of ``diagnosis, treatment, \n     or payment.'' We are concerned that this formulation makes it \n     possible for plans to obtain an individual's genetic \n     information in an overly broad set of circumstances. This \n     language should be rewritten to clarify that when plans are \n     seeking information related to payment for genetic services \n     received, they may only request such evidence as is minimally \n     necessary to verify that an individual received the services. \n     In such circumstances, only individuals within the plan or \n     insurance company who need access to the information for \n     purposes of that claim should have access to it.\n       5. Clarify definition of ``Predictive Genetic \n     Information.'' As currently drafted, S. 1344's definition of \n     predictive genetic information is potentially confusing. The \n     legislation states that ``predictive genetic information'' \n     means information ``in the absence of symptoms, clinical \n     signs, or a diagnosis of the condition related to such \n     information.'' This phrasing is potentially troubling, \n     because ``diagnosis'' is a fairly broad and imprecise term. \n     In fact, as doctors and scientists learn more about genetics, \n     it is possible that someday they will consider the presence \n     or absence of a particular genetic trait a ``diagnosis.'' \n     Thus, we suggest that this phrase be rewritten to read ``in \n     the absence of symptoms or clinical signs, and a diagnosis'', \n     in order to clarify that the presence or absence of a genetic \n     trait should not be considered a ``diagnosis'' if the \n     individual has no symptoms or clinical signs, and genetic \n     information would not be excluded from protection under those \n     circumstances.\n       The definition of predictive genetic information in S. 1344 \n     also specifically excludes information derived from \n     ``physical tests, such as the chemical, blood, or urine \n     analyses of the individual including cholesterol tests; and \n     information about physical exams of the individual.'' This \n     language should be clarified so that it is clear that genetic \n     information derived from either physical tests or physical \n     exams is considered protected information. This can be \n     accomplished by adding language such as ``unless the physical \n     test [or physical exam] reveals genetic information.''\n       We would like to discuss these issues with you further at \n     your convenience.

We have the director of the National Human Genome \nResearch Institute who has said we have to pass a bill immediately to \nbar discrimination in the workplace.

Fifty-nine health \norganizations, including the American Association of Occupational \nHealth Nurses, the Genetic Alliance, the CARE Foundation, the Oncology \nNursing Society have said: Please, do more than the legislation offered \nby the Senator from Vermont.\n  So it isn't just Dr. Collins, it isn't just Terri Seargent, it is a \nlist of health organizations, the likes of which you rarely see, who \nhave come together to say: We ought to do better than this.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from the State \nof Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts will withhold.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Isn't it the rule of the Senate that the first person \nseeking recognition gets recognition and the Senator does not have the \nauthority to yield to another Senator without unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. He had the floor and is in control of the time, and \nhe may yield time since he is on the floor and has recognition.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, does that ruling supersede the rule that \nthe first Senator seeking recognition gets it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was recognized and had the floor \nat the time that he yielded.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want the record to show that I was on \nmy feet seeking recognition at the time the Senator from South Dakota \nyielded the time.\n  I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to review what has \nhappened in terms of this policy issue in the Human Resource Committee \nso there is no confusion about it. We had a hearing on genetic \ndiscrimination in health insurance on 21 May 1998. That was a good \nhearing. That was in 1998.\n  Then, in May of 1998, a number of us asked the chairman of the \ncommittee to have a further hearing about discrimination in the \nworkplace. We have not received it. So I don't take kindly to those who \nsuggest that when we raise this issue on the Senate floor, we are \nsomehow acting out of order. Our committee, the committee of \njurisdiction, has tried to focus attention on the dangers of the \nutilization of genetic information toward possible discrimination for \nhealth insurance and employment, and we have been unable to do so. \nThankfully, with the Daschle amendment, we will have the opportunity to \ndo so this afternoon.\n  The Jeffords amendment pretends to be a half a loaf because it \naddresses insurance, but does not address employment. But it is not a \nhalf a loaf. It is no more than a thin crust or a thin slice. It will \nnot deal with the central problem of people failing to get needed \ngenetic tests because of unfair discrimination. That is the issue. As \nlong as they can lose their job and as long as their children can be \ndenied jobs, this protection is no protection at all. This program is \nas full of holes as Swiss cheese. They can still require genetic \ninformation. They can still disclose it, and there is still no \nmeaningful enforcement. An insurance company can still get the \ninformation to the employer. There is no prohibition on that in the \namendment of the Senator from Vermont. They can still do that.\n  The fact is, they are doing that. In a 1990 survey by the American \nManagement Association, 20 percent of employers collected family \nmedical history information on applicants, including genetic \ninformation. Five percent of the employers acknowledged using that \ninformation in hiring decisions. We already know that employers are \nusing genetic information to make employment decisions. We must ensure \nthat employees and applicants are not discouraged against getting those \nkinds of tests. That is what this is all about.\n  I ask for 1 more minute.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the Senator 1 more minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As Senator Daschle pointed out, there is a group of more \nthan 60 organizations that support the Daschle amendment. The National \nBreast Cancer Coalition is, once again, supporting the Daschle \namendment:\n\n       Passage of this amendment, and the protections it offers, \n     are essential not only for women with a genetic \n     predisposition to breast cancer, but also for women living \n     with breast cancer, their families, and the millions of women \n     who will be diagnosed with breast cancer. We strongly urge \n     you to support this legislation.\n\n  Let us stand with the patients. Let us stand with the victims. Let us \nnot stand only with the insurance companies.\n  That is what this issue is about. I hope the Jeffords amendment will \nbe defeated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter from the National Breast Cancer Coalition.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             National Breast Cancer Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2000.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n         (Minority), Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the National Breast \n     Cancer Coalition (NBCC), I am writing to urge you to support \n     Senators Daschle, Kennedy, Dodd and Harkin's Genetic \n     Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act, S. \n     1322, being offered today as an amendment to the Fiscal Year \n     2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     Departments appropriations bill.\n       NBCC is a grassroots advocacy organization made up of over \n     500 organizations and tens of thousands of individuals, their \n     families and friends. We are dedicated to the eradication of \n     the breast cancer epidemic through action and advocacy. \n     Addressing the complex privacy, insurance and employment \n     discrimination questions raised by evolving genetic \n     discoveries is one of our top priorities.\n       In light of the recent announcement by the White House \n     about the completion of initial sequencing of the human \n     genome, the National Breast Cancer Coalition is cautiously \n     optimistic about this important step in learning more about \n     disease, prevention, treatment and cure. However, while the \n     mapping of the ``genetic blueprint'' has potential for great \n     advancements in healthcare, there is also the potential for \n     great harm. NBCC is committed to working to ensure that \n     employers and health insurers do not use genetic information \n     to discriminate. Information learned from one's genetic \n     blueprint should only be used to cure and prevent various \n     genetic diseases and cancer.\n       Discrimination in health insurance and employment is a \n     serious problem. In addition to the risks of losing one's \n     insurance or job, the fear of potential discrimination \n     threatens both a woman's decision to use new genetic \n     technologies and seek the best medical care from her \n     physician. It also limits the ability to conduct the research \n     necessary to understand the cause and find a cure for breast \n     cancer.\n       The Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act (1996) \n     took some significant steps toward extending protection in \n     the area of genetic discrimination in health insurance. But \n     it did not go far enough. Moreover, since the enactment of \n     Kassebaum-Kennedy, there have been incredible discoveries at \n     a very rapid rate that offer fascinating insights in the \n     biology of breast cancer, but that may also expose \n     individuals to an increased risk of discrimination based on \n     their genetic information. For instance, because of the \n     discovery of BRCA1 and BRCA2, breast cancer susceptibility \n     genes, we now face the reality of a test that can detect the \n     risk of breast cancer. Genetic testing may well lead to the \n     promise of improved health as we better learn how genes work. \n     But if women are too fearful to get tested, they won't be \n     able to benefit from the knowledge genetic testing might \n     offer.\n       We commend the efforts of Senators Daschle, Kennedy, Dodd \n     and Harkin to go beyond Kassebaum-Kennedy toward ensuring \n     that all individuals--not just those in group health plans--\n     are guaranteed protection against discrimination in the \n     health insurance and employment arenas based on their genetic \n     information. S. 1322 would also guarantee individuals \n     important protections against rate hikes based on genetic \n     information, would prohibit insurers from demanding access to \n     genetic information contained in medical records or family \n     histories, and would restrict insurers' release of genetic \n     information.\n       Passage of this amendment, and the protections it offers, \n     are essential not only for\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\n     women with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer, but \n     also for women living with breast cancer, their families, and \n     the millions of women who will be diagnosed with breast \n     cancer. We strongly urge you to support this legislation.\n       Thank your for your support. Please do not hesitate to call \n     me or NBCC's Government Relations Manager, Jennifer Katz at \n     (202) 973-0595 if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fran Visco,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had sought a parliamentary inquiry a \nfew minutes ago. I am glad to wait 5 minutes until Senator Kennedy has \nfinished his comments. I have asked the Parliamentarian to review his \nrules.\n  There was a very heated exchange for more than an hour back in 1987, \nshortly after Senator Byrd had Senator Packwood arrested, as to the \npractice of having one Senator, the leader, yield time to other \nSenators. I believe the correct application of the rule is that the \nfirst Senator who seeks recognition is recognized and then the question \narises as to whether time will be yielded to him when there is a time \nagreement. That is the point I was making. I have no concern about \nwaiting 5 minutes or longer for another Senator. I do have a concern \nabout the propriety of a Senator being recognized who first seeks \nrecognition.\n  I have sought recognition to comment briefly about this legislation. \nI believe the Jeffords amendment is a solid amendment. His committee \nhas looked into this issue very extensively with respect to eliminating \ndiscrimination based upon genes and medical information and research \nwith respect to health care.\n  I do think the objectives of the Daschle amendment are sound, in \nseeking to avoid discrimination in employment as well as in health \ncare. I have had an opportunity to review the Daschle amendment very \nbriefly. From the review which I have made and which staff has made, I \nhave some grave concerns about some of the provisions which are very \ncomplicated and which have not been subjected to hearings.\n  Again, I think its objectives are laudable. I think the American \npeople do expect protection and confidentiality on these issues on \nemployment as well as on health care.\n  I express my concern about our ability to handle this matter in \nconference on this state of the record. I think it is more than a \nmatter of people's rights and obligations and objectives and what we \nought to have. We need to have a bill which sticks together, which \nmakes sense, and which will stand the kind of scrutiny and examination \nand analysis to which it will be subjected.\n  One of the grave problems our legislation has, when subjected to \njudicial review, is that it is hard to figure out sometimes, especially \nwhen there are no hearings, no markups, and no analysis. I have \ndiscussed with the Senator from Vermont the possibility of his \ncommittee having hearings in July. He may have a problem with that. My \nsubcommittee will have hearings on this subject so that if the Daschle \namendment passes and we have in conference its consideration, we will \ntry to work through the complexities of this legislation.\n  Again, I think the objectives of what Senator Daschle looks to are \nexactly right. I do think those people who vote against the Daschle \namendment are going to be questioned for not having concerns about \nprivacy on a very important matter.\n  Last week we had a motion to recommit this bill for prescription \ndrugs. If that motion had passed, I, frankly, don't know what my \nsubcommittee would have done on prescription drugs. Our subcommittee is \na very competent subcommittee, but I don't know that our competence \nextends to legislating on prescription drugs, taking that into account \nand working that through, which is really a matter for the Finance \nCommittee. I have been questioned about why I was unwilling to have the \nrecommitment. I have said, because I have the responsibility for \ndealing with it as the manager of the bill.\n\n  So there is a lot to recommend the Daschle amendment in terms of \nobjectives and moving along, but I caution my colleagues about where we \nend up in terms of this bill without the hearings, without the \nrefinement, without the analysis. I am not making any critique or \ncriticism of the author of the bill. Any bill which is constructed \nwithout hearings and without markup and without that kind of rigorous \nanalysis has natural problems. Even with hearings and with markup, \nthere are still problems that have to be worked out.\n  I express my agreement with the Senator from Vermont on his \nlegislation, express my agreement with the objectives of the \nlegislation of the Senator from South Dakota, and say that if we have \nit in conference, we will do our best to try to work through the kinds \nof problems and deal with this very important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have immense respect for the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and consider him a very able legislator. I am \ndisappointed that he will be opposing my amendment when we have our \nvote.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield, I ask him what makes him \nthink I am going to oppose his legislation?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thought he announced he intended to oppose it because \nwe didn't have hearings. If there is still an opportunity to gain his \nsupport, I will give him all the time he needs to further discuss the \nissue.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am very much inclined to support the \nDaschle legislation, but I recognize the job ahead of trying to work it \nthrough for the reasons I have said. I think the objectives are \nadmirable. I am not committed yet. I want to hear the balance of his \nargument. I have not stated an intention to oppose it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarification. I am \ndelighted to hear that there is still some hope I can persuade him with \nthe merits of our legislation.\n  To ensure that everybody understands--I think it is pretty basic--\nthree-fourths of the people in this country obtain their health \ninsurance through their employer. Whether or not employers may \ndiscriminate against employees and potential employees on the basis of \ngenetic information, in large measure, will be determined by whether or \nnot we write into law a pretty simple concept. It doesn't take any \ncomplex legalism to say, look, you should not discriminate based upon \ngenetic information, period. If you think you are discriminated \nagainst, you ought to have recourse in a court of law. That is all we \nare saying.\n  Now, the Jeffords amendment provides no protection against employment \ndiscrimination. That is clear. It does not prohibit insurers from \ndisclosing the results of genetic tests without consent. That is clear. \nIt does not prohibit the use of predictive genetic information for \nhiring, advancement, salary, or other workplace rights and privileges. \nThat is clear. It doesn't provide persons who have suffered genetic \ndiscrimination in either arena with the right to seek redress through a \nlegal action. That is clear.\n  It is no wonder that 59 health organizations have said: We have \nlooked at what Senator Jeffords is proposing and we think you can do \nbetter. That is no accident. They are asking us not to support this \nlegislation because there is no meaningful protection in the Jeffords \namendment.\n  I am all for more hearings, but it is ironic--how many times has the \nmajority bypassed a committee to go straight to the floor without \nhearings on bills of great import? We are going to do that as soon as \nwe come back from the Fourth of July recess. We are going to vote on an \nestate tax provision that will cost, in the full 10-year period, three \nquarters of $1 trillion; we are going to vote on it without one \nhearing, without one committee markup. I will bet you we are not going \nto hear the argument by the other side that we ought to have hearings \non that. This is pretty simple. This is basic math. If you don't want \ndiscrimination in the workplace, vote for the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am supporting the amendment of the \nSenator from South Dakota because I have been involved in this issue \nfor a long time. In 1989, when I was chairman of the subcommittee that \nmy good friend, Senator Specter, chairs now, we started funding for the \nHuman Genome Center at NIH. So I have been involved in this effort for \na long time and am very supportive of it.\n  I could not have been happier with the announcement that came out \nthis week that we have now completed the map, and they will be \ncompleting the sequencing of the human genome. With that, we are going \nto have a very powerful diagnostic tool that will allow medical \npractitioners to more accurately assess the health of an individual and \ntheir proclivity to come down with an illness or a disease, or to be \nmore predictive of what kind of illnesses to which a person might be \nsubject.\n  Well, that is a very powerful diagnostic tool, and it is going to do \na lot to help millions of people all over this world. There may be \nother spinoffs in terms of gene therapy, and things such as that, but I \nwish to focus on the diagnostic tool that will help people get better \ncontrol over their health care. That is the upside.\n  The downside is that in the hands of the wrong person this \ninformation could then be used to discriminate against a person who may \nhave a genetic predisposition toward a certain illness. As I understand \nit, both of the amendments we have before us--the one by the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the one by the Senator from South Dakota--prohibit \ndiscrimination when it comes to insurance. Well, that is all well and \ngood, but that is only a part of it.\n  Why the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota is the one we need \nto adopt is that it also prohibits discrimination in the workplace. Why \nis that important? I understand that earlier my friend from Vermont \nsaid we didn't have to be too concerned about this because the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act covered the workplace. Well, as the \nchief sponsor of the Americans With Disabilities Act, and one who has \nlived with it since its inception back in the 1980s, I say to my friend \nfrom Vermont that some lower courts have ruled, for example, that \nbreast cancer is not a disability, so the ADA really does not cover the \nworkplace when you come to genetic discrimination. Some lower courts \nhave held that breast cancer is not a disability and not covered by the \nADA. If they rule that, are they then going to rule that the gene for \nbreast cancer is covered? Hardly.\n  So that is why I wanted to take this time to make it clear that \ngenetic predispositions and disorders should be covered in employment, \nbecause of some of these lower court rulings regarding the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act. So that is why it is so important that we have \nit in the workplace.\n  Secondly, we need to have better enforcement. The penalties that are \nin the amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont are toothless--\n$100 a day. Well, a large business concern can factor that into their \ncost of doing business. That is not really a stiff enough penalty.\n  It seems to me that if I am discriminated against, under the law, I \nought to have a private right of action; I ought to be able to go to \ncourt and say, wait a minute, my rights are being abused, my civil \nrights are being abused. And if we have this law that says you can't \ndiscriminate against someone because of their genetic predisposition, \nthat person ought to have a right of action. That person ought to be \nable to go to court and seek redress. So that is why I say the Daschle \namendment is the only one that really protects people both in the \nworkplace and in insurance.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Although many of us came into today's debate believing that the ADA \ndid in fact cover genetic discrimination in the workplace, we certainly \nunderstand the importance of this issue and of the need to hold a \nhearing on this issue. However, I would like to emphasize that as \nrecently as a few months ago experts in employment law and, in \nparticular, EEOC Commissioner Paul Miller is quoted as stating that\n\n       * * * discrimination against an employee on the basis of \n     diagnosted genetic predispositions toward an asymptomatic \n     condition or illness is covered under the ADA's ``regarded as \n     disabled'' prong.\n\n  So it is not as if we approached this debate believing that employees \nshould not be protected against genetic discrimination in the \nworkplace. We simply thought that they already were covered.\n  I want to reassure my colleagues that the HELP Committee will hold a \nhearing in the near future on this issue and that if we find that the \nADA is not providing protection to workers we will develop and pass \nlegislation to ensure that genetic information is properly protected. I \nyield 4 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with the Senator from Vermont, chairman \nof the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The matter of \ngenetic discrimination in employment has taken on new relevance given a \nnumber of recent events. Most notably, the Human Genome Project \nannounced this week that the ``rough draft'' of the map of some 3 \nbillion human genes has just been completed. This just became a sexy \nissue. While there are months, if not years, of research still required \nto realize the potential of this information, we must be responsive to \nthe range of pros and cons regarding its use.\n  The committee has spent a lot of time developing a bill to address \nwhere there do appear to be gaps in preventing discrimination. Those \ngaps are most apparent in health insurance, where a person's health \ninformation, as well as his family's health history, are a determinant \nin their access to coverage. This is an immediate concern that requires \nour immediate response. That is why I strongly support the amendment \nbeing offered by Senator Frist, which would prohibit insurance \ncompanies from discriminating based on a person's genetic makeup.\n  The amendment Senator Daschle has offered also attempts to address \ngenetic discrimination in employment. Unfortunately, this issue is not \nnearly as clear cut. Until very recently, the prevailing opinion among \nemployment discrimination experts was that genetic discrimination was \nalready captured under the Americans with Disabilities Act (or \n``ADA''). In fact, it is still not clear that the ADA does not cover \ngenetic discrimination. Even as recently as March 24 of this year, the \nCommissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Paul \nMiller, told the American Bar Association genetic discrimination was \ncovered under title I of the ADA. Specifically, Commissioner Miller \nsaid protect against genetic discrimination was provided by the prong \nof the act which prevents discrimination against people who are \nregarded as disabled.\n  However, because no court has ever ruled definitively on this issue \nand because of some related--but not controlling--recent Supreme Court \ncases, I understand that there may now be some insecurity about whether \ngenetic discrimination is covered by the ADA. And understandably, this \ninsecurity is being increased by the recent announcement of the Human \nGenome Project.\n  We are sympathetic to this insecurity, and I think we can all agree \nthat employers should not be permitted to discriminate against \nemployees based on genetic information in the same manner that \nemployers may not discriminate based on disability, gender, race, age, \nand other characteristics. I believe our committee needs to evaluate \nthe conflicting evidence as to whether or not genetic discrimination is \nalready covered under current law, particularly in light of the \nrecent scientific developments. I support holding a hearing on this \nissue as soon as possible and I understand my colleague Senator \nJeffords has scheduled a hearing on this issue for July 11. We should \nexamine not only the question of whether the ADA captures genetic \ndiscrimination, but also what the implications are for the numerous \nworkplace and work force issues that will\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\narise based on the availability of genetics. Safety concerns and \nprivacy concerns being the most important. Also, I believe we should \nconsider genetic discrimination in employment in the broader context of \nthe cultural implications and evaluate the historical experience with \ngenetic information. Researching this issue has been a 10-year priority \nof the Human Genome Project's Ethical, Legal and Social Implications \n(ELSI) program. I welcome my colleagues to join the hearing process in \na bipartisan effort to address this matter.\n\n  Given the complexity of this issue, I believe it is critical that we \nnot rush to accept Senator Daschle's amendment without resolving all of \nthese important issues. We may determine that new legislation is \nnecessary to protect against genetic discrimination--and if it is \nnecessary, we will work hard to pass it. But Senator Daschle's \namendment simply goes too far. We must be certain that any new \nlegislation is comparable to existing discrimination legislation. \nSenator Daschle's amendment is not comparable, it is much broader.\n  For example, Senator Daschle's amendment would permit unlimited \ndamages for genetic discrimination. It would also permit parties to \ncompletely bypass the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission--the \nfederal body set up to deal with employment discrimination disputes--\nand go straight to federal court. This is significantly more extensive \nthan the ADA, the ADEA and title VII discrimination protections. This \njust makes no sense at all. Under Senator Daschle's amendment, an \nindividual with a genetic marker showing he may at some future point \ndevelop a genetic disease or condition would have more protection than \na paraplegic. Again I say this makes no sense at all. And it will \novertax federal courts and juries with highly complex genetic issues \nand give opportunistic trial lawyers a jackpot.\n  If Senator Daschle has a valid reason why genetics should have such \nsubstantial additional protections, I welcome him to come to our \ncommittee hearing and explain them, but we should be very careful not \nto rush into such significant legislation and treat genetic information \ndifferently than existing diseases, disorders, and illnesses. If we \naccept Senator Daschle's amendment, we are simply not doing our job. \nAgain, I think we can all agree that genetic discrimination should not \nbe permitted, but I think we should also be able to agree not to pass \nlegislation on such a significant and important issue without having \nall the proper information before us. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst Senator Daschle's amendment so that we can examine this issue \nthrough the proper procedural channels and pass responsible, reasonable \nlegislation if such legislation is necessary.\n  There isn't anybody here who wants to have any discrimination done on \na genetic basis, or any other basis, in the workplace or in health \ncare. We are being lead to believe that this is a very simple bill, and \nthat we ought to accept it. ``Simple'' is not 50 pages. Simple is the \nstatement that the Senator from South Dakota made. But 50 pages to \nexplain that means it is a lot more complicated than the explanation we \nare being given. We don't want discrimination. Quite frankly, I think \none of the reasons we are being presented with this is a good example \nof why you don't legislate on appropriations bills and avoid the entire \nprocess. It is a handy way to do it. If I had a bill, that is how I \nmight try to do it too. But it isn't the right way to do it.\n  I hope we will step back a minute and go through the procedure for \ndoing a 50-page bill that covers something as important to people as \ndiscrimination in the workplace, or discrimination in any other place.\n  If this bill passes, a person who can find and accidentally disclose \na genetic marker will have greater protection in the workplace than a \nparaplegic would. Not only that--this allows people to bypass the legal \nsystem. You can go immediately to court.\n  This will become a turnstile for trial attorneys. This becomes a \njackpot proposition. This will clog the courts, if it passes. It will \nbe a heyday. Every single trial attorney will have their own slot \nmachine. That is not what we are trying to do.\n  This isn't an area that just comes under the workplace safety and \ntraining subcommittee that I chair. It also comes under the health \ncommittee that Senator Frist chairs.\n  It is a topic that our entire committee needs to address and will \naddress. But it has to be done through a hearing process so we don't \nwind up with some of the unintended consequences that I have just \nmentioned.\n  As far as the Americans With Disabilities Act, on March 24 of this \nyear, the commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, \nPaul Miller, told the American Bar Association that genetic \ndiscrimination was covered under title I of the ADA. I guess that is \nwhy this 50-page ``simple'' bill bypasses the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission. We shouldn't bypass that group. That is a bill \nfor protection and for having a hearing process for individuals. The \ncommissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says it is \ncovered under title I of the ADA. Maybe there have been some decisions \nthat have come out since.\n  We can't just be doing knee-jerk legislation on an appropriations \nbill. This is an issue that deserves time and consideration, and a \nhearing that will produce the kind of bill of which we can be proud--\nthe kind of bill that has some opportunity for amendment.\n  I know if we were trying to pass a bill of that magnitude and \nprecluded the minority from having any say-so, or any amendment, they \nwould raise a little bit of a fuss, as they have on other occasions, \nand as we do on occasion.\n  I don't believe there should be legislation on appropriations bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have great admiration for the Senator \nfrom Wyoming. I have worked with him on many issues. I never find it \neasy to disagree with a colleague, but let me say with regard to his \nargument that this is going to be a turnstile to more lawsuits; that is \nthe same argument used on so many occasions and that was used against \nthe ADA.\n  I was on the floor. I remember those debates so well. I participated \nin them. They said this was going to cause a flurry of lawsuits.\n  Who today would vote to repeal the ADA? I daresay not one Senator--\nRepublican or Democrat.\n  He made reference to the EEOC's position on whether the ADA covers \ngenetic discrimination. I hope they are right. But what is wrong with \nmaking absolutely sure they are right? That is what this bill does. \nThis bill isn't complicated. I know some of our colleagues would like \nto point to the volume of this amendment and say that bulk is clear \nevidence of complication.\n  We are simply saying, as simply as we can, that you shouldn't \ndiscriminate in the workplace; and, if you do, you ought to have some \nopportunity to redress that problem.\n  I have a real concern as well about what inaction means for research. \nDr. Craig Venter was on the Hill on several occasions and has made \nseveral public statements. His concern about discrimination is one that \nwe ought to be truly appreciative of as well. Dr. Venter, president of \nCelera Genomics, said:\n\n       The biggest concern I have is genetic discrimination. This \n     would be the biggest barrier against having a real medical \n     revolution based on this tremendous new scientific \n     information.\n\n  Dr. Venter is worried, if we see discrimination, that automatically \nand almost immediately it is going to bottle up his opportunity to \ncontinue the research.\n  I go to the next chart, and look at what others have said. Dr. \nCollins, somebody I have quoted on several occasions, says:\n\n       Genetic information and genetic technology can be used in \n     ways that are fundamentally unjust . . . Already, people have \n     lost their jobs, lost their health insurance, and lost their \n     economic well-being because of the misuse of genetic \n     information.\n\n  It doesn't get any clearer than that. First, you have the top \nresearcher saying they are concerned about the ramifications of a lack \nof congressional action, not only for job discrimination, but for \nresearch. Then you have Dr. Collins who says we have already seen cases \nwhere people have lost their jobs and lost their health insurance as a \nresult of this.\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\n  The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing was equally as \nconcerned in their public statement. Keep in mind that this isn't some \nDemocratic advocate; this is the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing. \nThis is a quote:\n\n       Federal legislation should be enacted to prohibit \n     discrimination in employment and health insurance based on \n     genetic information. . ..Without these protections, \n     individuals will be reluctant to participate in research on, \n     or the application of, genetic testing.\n\n  How much more information do we need? How many more hearings do we \nhave to have when you have the most credible experts anywhere to be \nfound, here or anywhere else, who are pleading with the Congress to do \nsomething before it gets even worse, before more people lose their jobs \nand their health insurance, and before we see some real ramifications \nwith regard to medical testing?\n  That is what we are doing. That is what this amendment does. That is \nwhy it needs to be passed this afternoon.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMack be added as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment being offered by Senators Jeffords and Frist on genetic \nnondiscrimination in health insurance. This amendment, based on \nlanguage I authored with Senator Jeffords and Senator Frist, provides \nstrong protection to all Americans against the unfair and improper use \nof genetic information for insurance purposes.\n\n       This amendment will:\n       Prohibit insurers from collecting genetic information\n       Prohibit insurers from using predictive genetic \n     information, such as family background or the results of a \n     genetic test, to deny coverage or to set premiums and rates, \n     and\n       Require insurers to inform patients of their health plan's \n     confidentiality practices and safeguards.\n\n  The need for this legislation is clear. As Senators Daschle and Dodd \npointed out this morning the announcement this week that scientists \nhave completed their mapping of the human gene is a remarkable and \nhistoric event. It opens the door to new scientific breakthroughs that \nmay well help lead us one day to the cause and the cure for cancer, for \nParkinson's and for Alzheimer's disease.\n  This remarkable new tool has the potential, unfortunately, to become \na dangerous tool. Because knowledge is power--Mr. President--and an \ninsurance company could use genetic information to deny insurance to an \nindividual because they know that the person is predisposed to a \nparticular disease or health problem.\n  Consider a letter that I received from a constituent, Bonnie Lee \nTucker, of Hampden, Maine, who wrote:\n\n       I'm a third generation [breast cancer] survivor and as of \n     last October I have nine immediate women in my family that \n     have been diagnosed with breast cancer . . . I want my \n     daughter to be able to live a normal life and not worry about \n     breast cancer. I want to have the BRCA test [for breast \n     cancer] done but because of the insurance risk for my \n     daughters future I don't dare.\n\n  Another of my constituents, Dr. Tracy Weisberg, Medical Director of \nthe Breast Cancer at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute, told \nme that while she has offered screening for the breast cancer gene to \napproximately 35 women in 1997, only two opted for the test. She said \nthat many of these women did not undergo testing because of their fear \nof discrimination in health insurance.\n  Dr. Weisberg emphasized the need for legislation to protect patients \nfrom this type of discrimination, so that they could make genetic \ntesting decisions based on what they believe is best for their health, \nand not based on fear.\n  As a legislator who has worked for many years on the issue of breast \ncancer, and as a woman with a history of breast cancer in her family, I \nam delighted with the possibilities for further treatment advances \nbased on the discoveries of two genes related to breast cancer--BRCA 1 \nand BRCA2. Women who inherit mutated forms of either gene have an 85 \npercent risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime, and a 50 \npercent risk of developing ovarian cancer.\n  Although there is no known treatment to ensure that women who carry \nthe mutated gene do not develop breast cancer, genetic testing makes it \npossible for carriers of these mutated genes to take extra \nprecautions--such as mammograms and self-examinations--in order to \ndetect cancer at its earliest states. This discovery is truly a \nmomentous breakthrough.\n  But the tremendous promise of genetic testing is being significantly \nthreatened by insurance companies that use the results of genetic \ntesting to deny or limit coverage to consumers. Unfortunately, this \npractice is not uncommon. In fact, one survey of individuals with a \nknown genetic condition in their family revealed that 22 percent had \nbeen denied health insurance coverage because of genetic information.\n  And consider that people may be unwilling to participate in \npotentially ground-breaking research trials because they do not want to \nreveal information about their genetic status. At NIH, 32 percent of \nwomen eligible for genetic testing for the breast cancer gene declined \nto undergo testing--the majority of those who declined cited privacy \nissues and a fear of discrimination as their reason.\n  Mr. President, this is simply unacceptable. The Jeffords, Frist, \nSnowe amendment before us today will go a long way toward putting a \nhalt to the unfair practice of discriminating on the basis of genetic \ninformation, and to ensure that safeguards are in place to protect the \nprivacy of genetic information. Now it's up to us to act by passing \nthis amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing just that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Mexico. \nI believe he has 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I point out that is all of my time. So the Senator from \nAlabama will have to ask for additional time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He and I are going to share a little time.\n  Before I do that, I say to Senator Daschle, believe it or not, I was \nthe first Senator involved in genome. Whether people know it or not, it \nwas not the National Institutes of Health that started this program. It \nwas the Department of Energy. In fact, the National Institutes of \nHealth did not want the program, and a very distinguished doctor left \nthem and went to DOE. They came to me. The first bill was introduced \nand Senator Lawton Chiles funded it. That is the origin, which I am \ngoing to talk with my friend, Senator Sessions, about in a minute.\n  Let me suggest that I don't know what is in the Senator's amendment. \nBut I do know from the very beginning that there has been concern about \nthe effect of discrimination. I don't believe we should go from being \nconcerned about the effects of discrimination to a 30- or 40-page bill \nthat we--how big is it? Ten. Frankly, we need to make sure that what we \nare not doing is putting genome research into a vulnerable position \nwhere it is not stable and people do not know precisely what they can \ndo on it.\n  That is all I have to say about the amendment.\n  I yield to Senator Sessions for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator has been involved in this. I am \nexcited so many others are involved with the possibility that we can \nhave a detailed map of the human genome through the identification of \nthe 3 billion nucleotide basis that make up the human genome, helping \nto cure diseases.\n  It is an exciting time. This Congress has played an important role. I \nknow Dr. Charles DeLisi has played a key role. I know Senator Domenici, \nperhaps more than any other official in government, saw the \npossibilities of this several years ago, and used the power and \nleverage he had to make it a governmental project of the highest \npriority. I know he cares about it.\n  Would the Senator share with the Senate his insight as to where we \nare in the human genome at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But whether it is Congress or the President, someone \nshould recognize formally a Ph.D. named Dr. Charles DeLisi, the dean of \nengineering at Boston University. In the year 1986, he left the \nNational Institutes of Health in protest over their unwillingness to \nproceed with a genome project of national significance.\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\n He went to the Department of Energy. He said there were a lot of big \nbrains in the Department of Energy, and maybe they would listen and \ncome to the same conclusion.\n  They were researching genetic projects because they were charged with \ndeciding the extent of radiation incapacity generationally as a result \nof the two bombs that were dropped in Japan. The Department has all the \nscientists. He went there. They put together a team in DOE. I am very \nfortunate because they came to see me. They said: Why don't we do this \nsince the National Institutes of Health doesn't want to? Why don't \nyou start it?\n\n  I got a little tiny bit of a bill through, saying the DOE will run \nthe program. That was the beginning for the National Institutes of \nHealth. As soon as they saw the bill introduced saying DOE would do it, \nthey came running to me saying: We told Lawton Chiles we would like to \nget in on it. Of course, then we passed legislation that said both DOE \nand the National Institutes of Health would run this program.\n  Since then, it has been a scientific marvel. The entire chromosome \nsystem of human beings is mapped. Pretty soon it will be available for \nscientists investigating grave diseases. They will have them at their \nfingertips in terms of transmutation.\n  Perhaps we have just laid before the public and the people of the \nworld the greatest wellness potential in the history of mankind. We may \nfind locked up genetically the secret to most diseases. The scientists \nmay pick it up and find solutions in the next 25 or 30 years that \nnobody thought possible.\n  Sooner or later I will have somebody recognize Dr. Charles DeLisi. I \nhave spoken to him. He is a marvelous educator at a great university. \nPresident Clinton is now aware of this and very interested. I am very \nhopeful he will be recognized. It is important people understand.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I compliment the Senator from New Mexico. He truly has \nbeen one of those leaders in the field. In fact, I have before me S. \n422 which he introduced in the 105th Congress. Title IV of his bill, \ndiscrimination by employers or potential employers, is almost exactly \nwhat is in the Daschle amendment this afternoon.\n  He was one of the first to be out there. I give him great credit for \nwhat he has already done with his leadership on this issue. He has \ngiven some history this afternoon about how this started. He was here \nin the last Congress advocating that this body oppose discrimination in \nthe workplace.\n  So that everyone knows prior to the time they vote what it is we are \ntalking about, the Jeffords amendment does not prohibit insurers from \ndiscriminating on the basis of genetic information in the workplace. \nThe Jeffords amendment does not prohibit the disclosure of test results \nwithout consent. It does not prohibit the use of predictive genetic \ninformation for hiring. It does not ensure that those who suffer from \ngenetic discrimination have the right to seek redress through legal \naction. It fails on a basic level with regards to what we ought to do \nwith respect to genetic discrimination.\n  It is on that basis I remind my colleagues that 59 organizations have \ncome forward to urge Members to say no to legislation that fails to \nregulate the workplace. Don't listen to me. Listen to those \norganizations. Listen to Craig Venter of the Clera Genomics. Listen to \nFrancis Collins, the director of the National Human Genome Research \nInstitute. Listen to the editorial writers from papers across this \ncountry who have said, again and again, we must pass legislation \nquickly before it is too late.\n\n  This is a no-brainer. This is our opportunity today to say yes to \nCraig Venter, to say yes to Dr. Collins, to say yes to the \norganizations, and to say yes to Terri Seargent, who has already been \nvictimized as a result of this. This is our opportunity to say no to \ndiscrimination in the workplace, to say the Senate will go on record \nfor the first time that we will not allow any genetic discrimination \nregardless of circumstances.\n  I hope on a bipartisan basis our colleagues will join in support of \nthis legislation. The time has come. It was introduced in the last \nCongress. It is now being offered in this Congress with every \nexpectation and hope that we can send the clearest message possible \nthat we will not tolerate discrimination. We will allow the research to \ngo forward without any question that the information can be protected. \nThat is what we want. That is what the health organizations want. That \nis what Terri Seargent wants. That is what we all should want in the \nSenate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record editorials from \naround the country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Phoenix Gazette, Dec. 17, 1996]\n\n                  DNA Dilemma: Gene Tests Can Cost You\n\n       Imagine the scene: A middle-age patient, visiting her \n     doctor for her yearly physical, reminds him that her mother \n     and aunt had breast cancer. With the patient's consent, her \n     well-meaning physician decides to conduct a new test that \n     will reveal whether she carries genetic mutations that could \n     radically increase her chances of developing breast cancer.\n       The doctor submits a claim for the test to the woman's \n     insurer. Before the results are back, the insurer, seeing \n     what the test is for, triples the price of her coverage.\n       An impossible chain of events? Think again. Several \n     companies have begun marketing tests that will tell women \n     whether they have the recently discovered gene mutations that \n     markedly increase their risks for breast and ovarian cancer.\n       A Utah biotechnology company, Myriad Genetics Laboratories, \n     sent 100,000 cancer specialists a glossy ``resource kit,'' \n     boasting of its new ``gold standard'' testing for the gene \n     mutations. The company warns doctors about the risks of \n     insurance and job discrimination.\n       But the promotional kit also tells doctors that the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission ``has in included language \n     in the Americans with Disabilities Act making it unlawful to \n     discriminate'' base on the results of genetic tests.\n       Peggy Mastroianni, the associate legal counsel for the \n     commission, dismissed this claim, saying that it merely \n     issued an opinion, which has yet to be tested in the courts.\n       Some scientists and medical ethicists say that Myriad and \n     other companies are overselling these tests. Should a woman \n     test positive for a gene mutation, there is still no way of \n     knowing whether she will develop cancer. Even if that \n     information was available, there is no sure-fire preventive \n     treatment.\n       The Food and Drug Administration could regulate genetic \n     tests, as it regulates new drugs. But so far the agency has \n     declined to become involved. And where discrimination is \n     concerned, many women would have little recourse if their \n     health insurance skyrocketed in cost or they lost their jobs \n     on the basis of a genetic test.\n       More than a dozen states have enacted limits on insurance \n     or employment discrimination related to genetic testing. But \n     even in New Jersey, where Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed \n     the country's most comprehensive law last month, almost half \n     of the insured aren't protected, because they belong to self-\n     financed plans, which aren't subject to stringent state \n     regulations.\n       At the federal level, the new Kennedy-Kassebaum law, among \n     other things, protects people moving between jobs from being \n     dropped by health insurers because of their genetic \n     information. But the law doesn't protect those with \n     individual health insurance from seeing their premiums raised \n     if they happen to carry an unlucky genetic fingerprint. It \n     also does not protect against job bias.\n       Women are not the only ones affected by this problem. \n     Genetic tests for other diseases have been developed. Others \n     are on the way. Last month, scientists announced that they \n     were zeroing in on the mutant gene in hereditary prostate \n     cancer.\n       In the last Congress, a dozen bills would have guarded \n     against genetic discrimination and protected medical privacy. \n     But even those with some bipartisan support fell victim to a \n     crammed legislative calendar and insurance industry \n     resistance.\n       The 105th Congress has a chance to pass comprehensive laws \n     protecting medical privacy and barring insurers and employers \n     from discriminating on the basis of genetic information. For \n     its part, the FDA should regulator genetic tests. Those \n     charged with protecting the public welfare have to move \n     quickly.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 12, 2000]\n\n                            Genetic Privacy\n\n       President Clinton has issued an executive order limiting \n     the use of genetic test results in deciding whether to hire, \n     promote or extend particular benefits to federal employees. \n     For now, the order will have limited significance, since \n     genetic testing is not yet as common as it is likely to \n     become. But it sets the right example; in a not-yet-settled \n     area of medical ethics and privacy, it's a pioneering step. \n     The order includes a plug for a bill by Senate Minority \n     Leader Tom Daschle and Rep. Louise Slaughter that would \n     impose the same restraints on employers nationwide as well.\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\n       The problem is that people fear--and, it has been shown, \n     avoid--being tested for a predisposition to a genetic disease \n     because they think employers or other authorities might \n     penalize them for the results even if they never develop the \n     disease. This specific concern is symptomatic of a larger \n     one: the danger that people may become less open with their \n     own doctors--or avoid treatment altogether--for lack of \n     confidence that information about their health is any longer \n     veiled in the traditional confidentiality.\n       Federal rules to protect patients' privacy when they give \n     sensitive information to their doctors are finally nearing \n     completion; the public comment period ends this month. These, \n     too, are only a start, though an energetic one. They give \n     patients a right to see and correct their medical records, \n     oblige all health care providers and insurers to follow \n     confidentiality safeguards and set civil and criminal \n     penalties for violations. There are holes that Congress ought \n     to fill: The rules cover only electronic transactions, and \n     allow a formidable array of exceptions where information may \n     be shared without a patient's consent.\n       Lawmakers have been slow to recognize the broad political \n     appeal of strengthening medical privacy, partly because of \n     the many conflicting interests that are represented in the \n     fight over medical records. But polls show privacy concerns \n     rank high, and a bipartisan Congressional Privacy Caucus and \n     a Democratic privacy task force both declared their existence \n     Wednesday. There's plenty for these privacy advocates to do.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Houston Chronicle, Feb. 15, 2000]\n\n      Gene Secrets; Clinton Right To Oppose Genetic Discrimination\n\n       From the moment of conception, the lives and medical \n     futures of human beings are greatly determined by the genes \n     received from their mothers and fathers.\n       For the genes not only determine physical traits such as \n     the color of a person's eyes and hair, but also a person's \n     predisposition toward certain medical ailments, ranging from \n     heart trouble and diabetes to cancer and Alzheimer's disease.\n       As the result of a national research effort, doctors are \n     within a few years of completing a map of all the genes that \n     make up human beings, carefully identifying which gene does \n     what. The overall aim, of course, is that one day doctors \n     will be able to use genetic information to treat people and \n     make them healthier.\n       That's all well and good, as they say. Suffering from \n     diabetes? Well, the doctors will just give you an injection \n     of anti-diabetes genes, and you will soon become as healthy \n     as a horse.\n       But this fascinating research, with all of its fine \n     promise, has a terrible negative side if misused. Such \n     genetic information on John and Jane Q. Citizen--information \n     that they are likely to suffer from heart disease in their \n     40s or colon cancer in their 50s--could be used by employers, \n     insurance companies or others to discriminate against them.\n       Employers might not hire or promote Jane or John Q. Citizen \n     because of the potential displayed by their genes that some \n     future medical condition might cost them lost time and higher \n     insurance expenditures, as an example. Insurance companies, \n     with a person's gene map in their hands, might refuse to sell \n     that person insurance because of health risks.\n       President Clinton is acting correctly in signing an \n     executive order barring federal agencies from discriminating \n     against employees based on genetic testing. And he is also \n     correct in urging Congress to pass legislation that would ban \n     genetic discrimination in the private sector. Congress should \n     attend to this matter as soon as possible and also to the \n     problem of protecting individual gene maps.\n       Discrimination in the workplace is wrong, whether it is \n     based on a person's personal genetic code or the color of his \n     skin.\n       Genetic discrimination is un-American.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Feb. 14, 2000]\n\n                     Discrimination Goes High-Tech\n\n\n                              CIVIL RIGHTS\n\n       The frightened middle-aged woman was relieved she would not \n     have to give her name. She handed over several $100 bills, \n     counting them out with trembling hands. She had never done \n     anyuthing like this before. She rolled up her sleeve and \n     looked away, awaiting the needle.\n       It was not a street corner drug deal, although it felt like \n     it. She was in a major teaching hospital undergoing genetic \n     testing to see if she had an increased risk of contracting a \n     life-threatening disease. Along with her fears that this \n     glass tube identified by number might render a deadly warning \n     in every unseen strand of her DNA, she also was afraid of \n     other threats unseen: that the test alone might prevent her, \n     or a family member, from getting health or life insurance, a \n     job, a promotion, custody of her children, an organ \n     transplant; or perhaps even something as simple as a home \n     loan.\n       As technology soars forward in the Human Genome Project and \n     computer science, we will know more about ourselves than ever \n     before, and be less capable of keeping it to ourselves. \n     Medical science already has hundreds of genetic tests that \n     detect mutations putting a person at increased risk for such \n     ailments as ovarian, breast, colon and prostate cancers, \n     Alzheimer's and other, rarer diseases. The potential for good \n     abounds in areas of prevention, early detection, treatment \n     and, most spectacularly, cures.\n       But there is also tremendous potential for abuse. In \n     California, a government laboratory had for years genetically \n     tested government employees for diseases, including sickle \n     cell anemia, without their knowledge following pre-employment \n     physicals. Even though genetic testing does not render a \n     diagnosis, only indicators of increased risk, it has been \n     used to deny medical insurance and charge higher rates. Such \n     cases led Congress to pass legislation in 1996 outlawing \n     genetic discrimination in group health insurance plans \n     serving 50 or more employees.\n       But according to a Senior White House official, many people \n     who could benefit from genetic testing still are deciding not \n     to have it, solely because they are afraid the results will \n     be used against them by employers and insurers.\n       Last week President Bill Clinton took an important step, \n     issuing an executive order that forbids federal agencies \n     genetic testing in any decision to hire, promote or dismiss \n     workers. The order protects 2.8 milllion federal employees.\n       There is much left to be done. Genetic information that can \n     be gleaned from testing will only increase, through \n     innovations like the biochip, which one day may be able to \n     map from one strand of hair a person's entire identity, from \n     hair color to inquisitiveness. Mr. Clinton challenged private \n     sector employers to adopt similar non-discriminatory \n     policies. Even better is his endorsement of Congressional \n     legislation sponsored by Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Rep. \n     Louise M. Slaughter, D-N.Y., that would make it illegal for \n     employers to discriminate on the basis of genetic testing.\n       All of us are predisposed to some illness. No one should be \n     penalized for discovering what that illness might be.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 27, 1996]\n\n                     Ground Rules for DNA Sampling\n\n       Two Marine corporals were court-martialed in Hawaii \n     recently and convicted of disobeying orders to give tissue \n     samples for a Defense Department DNA registry.\n       The idea behind the registry is that should they become \n     casualties in a future conflict, there would be a foolproof \n     way of identifying their bodies. This is no frivolous \n     concern, as the recent exhumation of an allegedly \n     misidentified Vietnam War casualty in Ft. Wayne, Ind., \n     demonstrated.\n       Despite their convictions, the two Marines got light \n     penalties: seven days of restriction each, letters of \n     reprimand and no dishonorable discharges.\n       This leniency may have stemmed from the fact that their \n     concerns also were not frivolous: They feared that, somewhere \n     down the line, the DNA samples could be used to their \n     detriment. And the Defense Department, like the rest of \n     American society, is only gradually evolving answers to such \n     concerns.\n       Almost daily, it seems, scientists announce that they've \n     found a new gene that causes or predisposes a person to some \n     disease or trait. Almost as rapidly, biotechnology companies \n     are developing tests to screen for those genes.\n       What those two Marines feared is what many Americans in \n     many other walks of life fear: that samples given for one \n     ostensibly benign purpose, or the data gleaned from such \n     samples, may be put to other uses, not all necessarily \n     benign.\n       Earlier this month, for example, researchers at Harvard and \n     Stanford universities released a study citing more than 200 \n     cases of ``genetic discrimination.'' Prominent among these \n     were cases in which insurance coverage was denied because a \n     member of a family had a gene-based disorder. Employment \n     discrimination is another common fear, along with social \n     ostracism.\n       What happens when DNA screenings become readily and \n     routinely available for a whole range of diseases or \n     conditions? Will insurers be able to demand that would-be \n     customers submit to such screenings? Will they be free to \n     grant or deny coverage on the basis of the results? (The \n     essence of insurance is, after all, assessing and balancing \n     risks.) What about employers--what will they be able to \n     demand?\n       By comparison with civilian society, the military has it \n     easy. The Pentagon can simply promulgate rules for its DNA \n     repository, and it recently did. Among other things, those \n     rules allow a service member to request that his or her DNA \n     sample be destroyed immediately upon final separation from \n     the military and require that the request be fulfilled within \n     180 days.\n       Civilian society must work the issue through the process of \n     public discussion, legislative debate and legal enforcement. \n     Laws will have to provide tough anti-discrimination \n     strictures and confidentiality requirements, with severe \n     penalties for anyone who violates either. Congress should get \n     to work on such laws quickly, because science is not standing \n     still.\n\n  I yield the floor and I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What I would like to say for the record is that we hope \nto have a unanimous consent agreement here--we are not ready to \npropound it--where the Dorgan amendment and the Nickles amendment, \nwhich would be ordinarily a second-degree amendment, would be treated \nas first-degree amendments and try to seek a time limit of 45 minutes \non each. But we understand that we are not in a position to do that \nbecause there has not been an adequate opportunity to review the \nNickles amendment. I wanted to make that statement.\n  If the Senator from North Dakota wants to lay his amendment down, \nthat is entirely appropriate. We just hope that when we have another \namendment ready to go, either the Helms amendment or Wellstone \namendment, we could set aside the Dorgan amendment and proceed with \nargument on something we can close debate on, and then come back at the \nearliest moment to the Dorgan amendment, just as a management matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Any Act that is designed to protect patients \n     against the abuses of managed care that is enacted after June \n     27, 2000, shall, at a minimum--\n       (1) provide a floor of Federal protection that is \n     applicable to all individuals enrolled in private health \n     plans or private health insurance coverage, including--\n       (A) individuals enrolled in self-insured and insured health \n     plans that are regulated under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974;\n       (B) individuals enrolled in health insurance coverage \n     purchased in the individual market; and\n       (C) individuals enrolled in health plans offered to State \n     and local government employees;\n       (2) provide that States may provide patient protections \n     that are equal to or greater than the protections provided \n     under such Act; and\n       (3) provide the Federal Government with the authority to \n     ensure that the Federal floor referred to in paragraph (1) is \n     being guaranteed and enforced with respect to all individuals \n     described in such paragraph, including determining whether \n     protections provided under State law meet the standards of \n     such Act.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Nickles \namendment be modified to be formatted as a first-degree amendment and \nthat a vote occur on the Nickles amendment, to be followed by a vote on \nthe Dorgan amendment, with no amendments in order to the amendments \nprior to the votes. I further ask unanimous consent that the debate \nprior to the vote be 45 minutes for Senator Nickles and 45 minutes for \nSenator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are all \noperating in good faith and wanting to move ahead. I ask if our floor \nstaff has seen this. I would like to, with all due respect, reserve a \nminute until our floor staff has an opportunity to see it.\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I amend the request to 55 minutes on each \nside.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry: Is that on or in relation? Do I \nunderstand that it is their intention to have an up-or-down vote on \nboth of these?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Up or down on both.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No points of order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If I may respond to my colleague, I have no objection \npersonally. I understand the chairman of the Budget Committee doesn't \nwant that waived. But it is not my intention to raise a point of order \non the Senator's amendment, nor on our amendment. I think the Senator \nfrom New Mexico has a standing objection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If it is the understanding that we treat both of them \nthe same way, is it agreeable with the floor manager that the point of \norder be on both so they are both treated the same way?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I renew the request, and, as previously \nstated, I ask unanimous consent that there be 55 minutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin by describing this amendment \nand why I have offered it to this bill.\n  Let me also say that the amendment is not subject to a point of \norder. This amendment deals with the Patients' Bill of Rights. Quite \nsimply, it says that when this Congress enacts patient protection \nlegislation, we should protect all 161 million Americans enrolled in \nprivate health insurance plans.\n  Many of us have been attempting to get this Congress to pass a \nmeaningful Patients' Bill of Rights, and so far, we have not been \nsuccessful in doing so.\n  As most Americans know at this point, more and more of the American \npeople are being herded into HMOs and managed care organizations which \nhas jeopardized the quality of health care they receive. Too often \nthese days, decisions about their health care are being made not by \ndoctors but by some accountant in an HMO or in a managed care \norganization 1,000 miles away.\n  We have all heard stories on the floor of this Senate about the \nproblems patients experience when their health care is viewed as a \nfunction of someone's profit and loss, not of his or her health care \nneeds.\n\n  We proposed a Patients' Bill of Rights to address these problems. It \nis rather simple legislation. It says that:\n  Patients should have the right to know all of their medical options--\nnot just the cheapest medical options. That ought to be a fundamental \nright.\n  Patients ought to have the right to choose the doctor they want for \nthe care they need, including specialty care when they need it. That \nought to be a right of patients who believe they are covered with a \nhealth care policy.\n  Patients ought to have the right to emergency room treatment and \nemergency room care wherever and whenever they need it.\n  Patients ought to have a right to a fair and speedy process to \nresolve disputes with their health care plan. And they ought to be able \nto hold their health care plan accountable if its decision results in \ninjury or death.\n  The Senate passed a piece of legislation last year that was called \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. Some of us called it a patients' bill of \ngoods because it was a relatively empty shell.\n  The House passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that is a good bill. It \nis a bipartisan bill sponsored by Republican Congressman Norwood and \nDemocratic Congressman Dingell. It passed by a 275-151 vote.\n  Since that time, the Senate appointed a set of conferees on October \n15, and the House appointed its conferees on November 3. It wasn't \nuntil the end of February that there was a meeting of the conference \ncommittee. As I said previously, the conference committee isn't making \nmuch progress.\n  In this amendment, we deal with only one aspect of the Patients' Bill \nof Rights and that is the question of the number of Americans that a \nbill of rights should cover. If a Patients' Bill of Rights is enacted \nby this Congress, we propose with this amendment that Congress will \ncover all of the American people with private health insurance, rather \nthan just the 48 million Americans proposed to be covered in the \nRepublican Patients' Bill of Rights. We believe the Patients' Bill of \nRights should cover all 161 million Americans in private health \ninsurance plans, including the 75 million people whose employers \nprovide coverage through an HMO or private insurance. Unfortunately, \nthese folks are not covered in the Republican plan. The 15 million \npeople with individual policies are not covered in the majority party's \nplan. The 23 million State and local government employees are not \ncovered in the majority party's plan.\n  We propose that when and if Congress passes a Patients' Bill of \nRights, that all 161 million Americans are covered by those provisions. \nVery simple.\n  We understand from the previous vote held a couple of weeks ago that \nthe majority in the Senate do not want to pass our Patients' Bill of \nRights. We understand that. They voted against it. But how about at \nleast passing a part of our Patients' Bill of Rights, the part that \nsays everybody ought to be covered? That is what I offer today as an \namendment.\n  Senator Reid and I held a hearing in his home state of Nevada on the \nissue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. At the hearing we had a mother \ncome, the mother of Christopher Thomas Roe. She stood up and told us \nabout her son. He died October 12 of last year. It was his 16th \nbirthday. The official cause of Christopher's death was leukemia, but \nthe real reason he died is because he was denied the kind of \nopportunity for patient care that he needed to give him a chance to \nlive. He was diagnosed with leukemia, but he had to fight cancer and \nhis HMO at the same time. It is one thing to tell a kid you have to \nfight a dreaded disease, you have to battle cancer. It is quite another \nthing to tell that young child and his family: Take on cancer and, by \nthe way, take on your insurance company as well. That is not a fair \nfight. That is never a fair fight.\n  The Roe family was told that the kind of treatment he needed to send \nhis cancer into remission was experimental. The family immediately \nappealed the health plan's decision. The review, which was supposed to \ntake 48 hours during a very critical period of this young boy's life, \ntook 10 days. As the appeal dragged on, Christopher's condition \nworsened. And as Chris's doctor had known, the traditional chemotherapy \ndid not work.\n  At the hearing, Chris's mother, Susan, held up a very large picture \nof Christopher, about the size of this chart. It was a picture of a \nstrapping, bright-eyed, 16-year-old boy. Susan told Senator Reid and I, \nwith tears in her eyes, how Chris turned to her one day not long before \nhe died and said: Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this \nto a kid.\n  This is a 16-year-old boy who died who wanted that extra chance to be \ncured but whose insurance company said no, no, no. And he died.\n  We all know the stories. There is the woman who fell off a 40-foot \ncliff in the Shenandoah Mountains. She was hauled into an emergency \nroom unconscious with broken bones and all kinds of physical problems. \nShe survived and was later told by her insurance plan: We will not \ncover your treatment because you didn't have prior approval to get \nemergency room care.\n  Or how about this young child, born with a horrible cleft lip? It is \nhard to look at. Dr. Greg Ganske, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives in the Republican Party who supports this legislation, \nsays in his practice that it is often not considered a ``medical \nnecessity'' to fix this kind of problem. Let me show you how a child \nwith this condition looks when he receives proper medical intervention \nby a skilled surgeon. Is there a difference? How can anyone look at \nthese two pictures and say fixing this condition is not a ``medical \nnecessity''?\n\n  The point we are making with this amendment is very simple. Managed \ncare organizations hold the future of too many patients in the palm of \ntheir\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nhands. Decisions are not being made by doctors in doctor's offices. Too \noften, they are made in accountants' offices 500 or 1,000 miles away. \nWe are saying that it is wrong to make medical decisions a function of \nprofit and loss. This country can do better than that. This ought to be \na slam dunk. The legislation that provides real protection, a \nmeaningful Patients' Bill of Rights, ought to get 100 votes in the \nSenate. But we can't get any movement on this at all from the \nconference committee charged with working out the differences between \nthe House and Senate bills.\n  I know a few of the conferees and the chairman of the conference \ncommittee were saying we have made great progress. I describe that \nprogress in glacial terms. At least glaciers move an inch or two a \nyear. It is hard to see that this conference moves at all.\n  We are only asking today to say with this amendment that if we are \ngoing to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, let's not create a hollow \nvessel. Let's create a Patients' Bill of Rights that provides real \nprotection for 161 million Americans, not inadequate protection for 48 \nmillion Americans. If we are going to do this, let's do it right.\n  That is the amendment. We will have a chance to vote on it. We \nunderstand that the majority of the Senate decided they didn't want a \nreal Patients' Bill of Rights. They wouldn't vote for the entire \npackage, the one that provides protection for young kids such as \nChristopher, who are fighting leukemia, or for young people born with \nthis severe cleft lip deformity. So all we ask is that whatever we are \ngoing to do with respect to patients' rights that we apply it to all \nAmericans. Everyone ought to have the right and the opportunity to \nexpect decent health care coverage if they have an insurance policy. \nWhat about a Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans?\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the issue of providing protection for \nAmerican families has been before the Senate for the past 3 years, but \nwe have been unable to pass legislation that will guarantee to the \nfamilies of this country that medical decisions that are going to \naffect them and the treatment of the family are going to be made on the \nbasis of sound medical reasons rather than for the interests of the \nHMOs. That is what this issue is all about.\n  This chart indicates very clearly what has been happening. The \nSenate, in July 1999, about a year ago, passed legislation, the \nRepublican bill, 53-47. This 47 was basically the Norwood-Dingell bill, \nvirtually identical to the Norwood-Dingell bill, which is a party-line \nvote. The House passed the Norwood-Dingell bill 275-151 in October, \n1999. Then the House and the Senate conferees appointed. Now 8 months \nhave passed. We have nothing that has come out of that conference.\n  We are going to have something now before the Senate, offered as an \nalternative to the Dorgan proposal, that evidently has been drafted \nsolely by Republicans. Whether it includes Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives or not is something we will have to wait and see. I \ndoubt it very much.\n  Why? Because just this afternoon Congressman Norwood, who was the \nprincipal sponsor of the Norwood-Dingell bill, said in a press \nconference: What is significant about today is that all 21 Republican \nsponsors of the Norwood-Dingell bill are standing behind me and each of \nus has declared that we will not support any bill that does not allow \npatients to choose their own doctor, that does not protect all \nAmericans, and that does not hold the insurance industry accountable \nfor its decisions. It doesn't matter what the Senate does today. The 25 \nus will vote against any bill that does not guarantee patients the \nprotections they deserve. If the Senate passes anything less, they are \nkilling the bill.\n  That isn't a statement made by Democrats; that was made by \nRepublicans.\n  So let's understand it. Here are the leaders in the House of \nRepresentatives, in a bipartisan effort that got a third of the \nRepublican Party to pass an effective bill that we should pass, and it \nfailed by one vote only 2 weeks ago. We are being denied, week after \nweek after week, from being able to protect American families from \nbeing harmed.\n  That statement is made by the Republican Congressman. The legislation \nwe on this side of the aisle support is supported by 300 organizations, \nincluding every medical organization, every doctor organization, every \npatient organization, every organization that represents women, every \norganization that represents children, every organization that cares \nabout cancer--you name it, they support our proposal.\n  Do you know who supports the other side? The insurance industry. They \nsupported them before and they are supporting them tonight. So you will \nhave a chance to show, on the floor of the Senate, whether you are \ngoing to cast your vote with those who have been dedicated to \nprotecting the lives and well-being of the families in this country, or \nprotecting the profits of the HMOs. That is the issue as plain and \nsimple as can be stated.\n  That is why Congressman Norwood, I think, has been so courageous, \nbecause he understands it. He was there when the Senate considered 2 \nweeks ago the Norwood-Dingell bill that failed by one vote. He was \nsupporting our efforts, as was the American Medical Association.\n  The particular amendment that Senator Dorgan has proposed is a very \nbasic and fundamental amendment that affects the Patients' Bill of \nRights. It is the question of scope. Are we going to cover 161 million \nAmericans, or are we going to cover only a third of those, as was \ncovered in the Senate Republican bill before and I daresay will be in \nthe Republican bill tonight--although they have not shared that with \nus, only with the staff for a few minutes. I daresay that will be the \nfact.\n  Here it is. They cover 48 million--self-funded proposals. They do not \ncover those fully insured; those who are represented by Blue Cross or \nby Kaiser. They don't cover those 75 million.\n  They don't cover the individual markets, the self-employed, the \nfarmers, child care providers, the truckers.\n  They don't cover the teachers and the firefighters and the police \nofficers.\n  We cover all 161 million. They cover 48 million. Here is a picture of \nFrank Raffa, Vietnam veteran, decorated war hero, 21 years in the fire \ndepartment of Worchester, MA. He has two children. Do you think he is \ncovered? No, not covered under the Republican plan. Why should Frank \nRaffa not be covered? Why should his family not be covered, his wife \nand his children? He has dedicated his life to the people of \nWorchester, MA, as a firefighter and to this country in Vietnam. But, \noh, no, the Republicans say we are not going to cover State and county \nofficials.\n  No. 2, here we have Dave Morgan, with two of his 63 employees. He is \na pharmacist in Boston. Tonya Harris right here, she is a pharmacy \ntechnician, a single mother of two, and Rhonda Hines, another of Dave's \nemployees. She is married and has three children. Do you think working \nfor a business they are going to be covered? Absolutely not. He is a \ncommunity pharmacist. He worked hard building a business employing 63 \nmembers of the community. Some are in training, some are getting \nadvanced degrees--are they covered? Absolutely not. Why not? Why do you \nexclude those? Norwood-Dingell did not exclude them, why should we?\n  Finally, Leslie Sullivan, a family nurse practitioner in the Quincy \nMental Health Center, a Massachusetts employee. She is not covered \nunder the Republican plan. She has worked hard all her life.\n  I want to hear a justification from Senator Nickles tonight why these \npeople are being excluded. They can't get it. We have insisted, in that \nconference, on three basic things: One, you are going to have coverage \nand cover all Americans; No. 2, you are going to have accountability; \nNo. 3, you are going to have a definition of medical necessity that is \ngoing to protect American consumers.\n  At the end of 3 months of hearings, 3 months of meetings in the \nNickles office--as much as I like and respect Don Nickles and consider \nhim a friend, the fact is, of the 22 differences, only 2 had been \nagreed to.\n  I will just take 3 more minutes. Here are the guarantees under the \nlegislation that the Democrats support: 22\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\ndifferent protections here. I would like to hear from the other side: \nWhich ones don't you want to guarantee to the American consumers? You \ndon't want to protect all of them? You don't want to guarantee the \nspecialists? You don't want to guarantee that women that are going to \nbe able to go to an OB-GYN without first going to a general \npractitioner? You don't want to guarantee prescription drugs? You don't \nwant to guarantee the emergency room? These are our guarantees. This is \nwhat we stand for. If the Republican bill embraces those without the \nloopholes, we will support it. But if it does not, it ought to get \ndefeated. That vote ought to be no, and we ought to continue to fight \nin this Congress to make sure we get a good Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I regret our colleagues on the Democrat \nside of the aisle have decided to once again try to turn an issue, an \nimportant issue, Patients' Bill of Rights, into a political theater and \nnot legislate, not come up with reasonable compromise. Instead, they \nwant votes. They want to try to score points. I find that to be \nunfortunate because we are working very hard to try to come up with a \nresponsible product.\n  A compromise in the conference committee is not easy on this issue \nbecause the differences between the House bill and the Senate bill are \nsignificant. They are significantly different in cost and scope and \nliability. We are trying to bridge those differences. It takes time, it \ntakes compromise, it takes both sides working together.\n  We made a lot of progress with our colleagues on the Democrat side, \nin spite of what my good friend from Massachusetts says, a lot more \nprogress than 2 out of 20 items. We agreed on an appeals process. Maybe \nnot on every single last letter, but by and large we agreed on the \nappeals process. We invited the press in; we came to an agreement. It \ntook about 2 months. I thought it should have taken a week. The reason \nwhy it took 2 months is because our friends on the Democrat side always \nkept wanting a little bit more. That is tough negotiating. I am not \nfaulting them for that. But they are the reason why it took 2 months to \ncome up with an appeals process. We basically agreed with it.\n  I just have to make a mention on scope. When they say: Wait a minute, \ntheir bill only applies to 50 million and our applies to 161 million; \nit should apply to everybody--our plan applies to everybody covered by \nERISA. That is the plan we are amending, every employer-sponsored plan.\n  I know the Senator wants to overrule the State of Massachusetts State \nemployee plan, he wants to regulate State individual plans--he wants \nnational health care. I compliment him. He is being consistent. He \nalways thought the Federal Government could do it better than States, \nand he always wanted the Federal Government to do it instead of States. \nI disagree with that. We have a disagreement. That is one of the items \nwe were wrestling with in conference.\n  Now we have an amendment.\n  We tried to do this in a big fashion last year. They had their \namendments. We had a lot of votes on amendments last year. Senator \nKennedy lost. We had an amendment on scope. We debated that last year. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts lost. The majority of the Senate said: \nNo, we don't want the Federal Government to take over State regulation \nof insurance. We don't think HCFA is very good at administering the \ninsurance. They have a hard enough time in Medicare. Do we really want \nthem to regulate State insurance? The Senate said no. The House said \nyes. We were negotiating that.\n  Incidentally, that is one of the things we are negotiating as we \nspeak. But my colleagues on the Democrat side didn't wait for the \nconference. Two weeks ago they said: Let's ignore the conference. Let's \njust adopt the House position. In spite of the fact we have reached a \nbicameral agreement on a lot of patient protections, including the \nappeals process which, for my colleagues' information, is the backbone \nof the bill. It is the most important thing in the bill because if you \ndo a good job in the appeals process, you don't have to go to the \ncourthouse.\n  The patients who need care, whether it is the cleft palate that my \ncolleague continues to show in the picture--they are going to have an \nappeal under the bill that we have. They are going to get care. It is \ngoing to be decided by a medical expert totally independent of the \nplan. That is going to be a binding decision. The person who is denied \nhealth care is going to have an appeal and is going to get the health \ncare they need when they need it; not just go to court.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I will not yield. I have a lot of comments to make. \nMaybe I will yield at a later time.\n  Instead of waiting for the conference to work, my colleague from \nMassachusetts put the Patients' Bill of Rights on either the Department \nof Defense authorization bill or the Defense appropriations bill.\n  There is no way in the world that bill is ever going to come out of \nconference. It was nothing but political theater. It disrupted the \nconference. I told him and my colleagues and I planned on having a \nconference that day with my Democratic colleagues. No, they engaged in \npolitical theater because maybe some people wanted to have a headline \nthat said: ``Senate defeated Patients' Bill of Rights.'' We moved to \ntable the amendment. The vote was 51-48. It accomplished nothing but \nheadlines for my colleagues.\n  Two weeks after the vote, we have another Patients' Bill of Rights. \nMaybe we will have several and do them piecemeal. Maybe we will do one \non scope and one on patient protections.\n  I tell my colleagues, this is not the way to legislate. We are on the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill. Everyone knows this bill is not going to \ncome back--maybe it will; maybe we will pass patient protections and \nput it on Labor-HHS. My colleagues put minimum wage on bankruptcy. \nFrankly, it is a complicated effort for both bills. Minimum wage did \nnot belong on bankruptcy and patient protections does not belong on \nLabor-HHS.\n  Are they seriously legislating? No. Did they come up with a serious \nlegislative proposal? They have a two-page proposal on scope. What is \nthe amendment offered by my friend from North Dakota? He has an \namendment which deals with scope.\n  My colleague talked about all these patient protections. Guess what. \nThey are not in his amendment. His amendment basically says: We want \nthe Federal Government to set standards, and, oh, States, you have to \nmeet these standards. If not, the Federal Government is going to take \nover.\n  This little amendment, which looks innocuous and is like a thematic \nstatement, says we are going to have the Federal Government design, \nmandate, and dictate benefits, and, States, if you do not meet these \ndictates, we are going to have the Federal Government take over; HCFA \nwill take over; you will have to follow the HCFA standard.\n  This is the GAO report: Implementation of HCFA. The headline says: \n``Progress slow in enforcing Federal standards in nonconforming \nStates.'' We have a lot of States not conforming with existing laws \nwhere HCFA is supposed to have control--ask any of your doctors. Some \npeople profess they want to be helpful to doctors. Ask the doctors. If \nwe adopt the Dorgan amendment, we are asking HCFA to take over State \nregulation of health care. That would be a disaster. That would not \nimprove quality health care. That would duplicate State regulation, \nconfuse State regulation, and have Federal regulators who do not have \nthe wherewithal or the talent--they say so themselves. They say in this \nreport they do not have the talent; they cannot do it. They are not \ndoing it in existing law.\n  They have three areas in existing law they are supposed to enforce, \nand they are not doing it. This is the GAO report saying this, not Don \nNickles. It is fact. And we are going to give them regulation over \nState health care? That is absurd. I know some people want national \nhealth care. They want the Federal Government to regulate health care \nin the States. I do not. I think it would be a serious mistake.\n  What about scope?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to continue before I lose my train of thought.\n  What about scope? The scope proposal in our bill applies to every \nsingle ERISA-covered plan. Every employer-\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\nsponsored plan would have an external appeal because that is ERISA. It \nhas Federal remedies.\n  We also included in this proposal a cause of action, a cause of \naction liability. In case the external appeal overturns the HMO and \nthey do not pay, we say you can sue the HMO. We did not have that in \nthe bill before. We did not have liability. We compromised.\n  Some say the conference has not done anything. We made a concession. \nWe have liability in our proposal so patients can sue HMOs. It turns \nout that a lot of our colleagues want to sue more, on every case. They \nwant to turn this into an invitation for litigation. We do not.\n  We do have cause of action. We have remedies allowing patients to go \nafter the HMO, and, frankly, the employer, if acting as the HMO, if \nthey are the final decisionmaker, if they are the ones denying health \ncare, if they are the ones causing injury, harm, damage, or death, \nbecause of their decision to deny health care, they can be held liable. \nMy point being: We have moved forward in the conference. We have made \ncompromises. We have been working.\n  This is not the way to legislate: We will put, at 5 o'clock on a \nThursday afternoon, on the Labor-HHS bill and say we are going to do \npart of patient protections, we are going to pick out a piece of it, a \nvery significant piece. Maybe we will do another piece tomorrow.\n  That is not the way we are going to do it. We offered a significant \ncomprehensive proposal, one that deals with scope, liability, patient \nprotections, one that has an appeals process that will apply to every \nsingle employer-sponsored plan in America. We are going to give \neverybody a chance.\n  You will not be voting on a real patient protections bill, not the \none Senator Dorgan offered as a two-page amendment. We have an \namendment pending that is 250 pages that has real patient protections \nand one we have been working on for over a year.\n  Frankly, over half that language--maybe over 70 percent of that \nlanguage--has been negotiated with our colleagues on the Democratic \nside of the aisle. It had tentatively been signed off by Democrats and \nRepublicans, House and Senate. It has patient protections. It has an \nappeals process. We have a significant proposal. We do not have two \npages. We have a Patients' Bill of Rights. We have remedies and cause \nof action where someone can sue an HMO or sue a final decisionmaker if \nthey are denied health care. We have a good proposal, and I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for it and against the Dorgan proposal.\n  We will have up-and-down votes on both proposals, on a bill on which \nneither one belongs. That is not my choice. I told my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side that I will agree to a time certain and a vote on both \nof these proposals sometime--July, September. I am happy to do that. \nNo, they want to score points. They want press conferences. They are \nnot interested in patient protections. They are interested in press \nconferences and political theater.\n  They are not interested in helping patients. If they were interested \nin helping patients, they would be working with us to resolve and \ncompromise in conference. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Maybe \nthey will have theater, but we are going to give people substance on \nwhich to vote.\n  Last time, when my colleague from Massachusetts offered basically the \nHouse-passed bill--let's adopt the House position--we said no, and we \ntabled it. We saw the headlines: ``Republicans Defeat Patients' Bill of \nRights.'' Guess what. Today we are going to pass a Patients' Bill of \nRights. We are going to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights and give every \nsingle patient in America who happens to be in an employer-sponsored \nplan an appeal. If they are denied health care by an HMO, they will \nhave an appeal, done by a medical professional, an expert, using the \nbest medical evidence available. It is a binding decision.\n  If for some reason that appeal is not adhered to nor complied with, \nthey will have a right to sue. They can sue their HMO, they can sue the \nfinal decisionmaker, if it is a self-funded, self-insured employer, if \nthey make a decision to deny health care. They can sue them in those \ncircumstances. We are offering real patient protections.\n\n  Time and again I have heard: We have to have patient protections \nwhere there is remedy against HMOs denying health care. We do that in \nthis bill. We do not want people going to court; we want them to settle \nit in the appeals process so they get health care when they need it, \nnot through the court system when it is too late. We want to resolve \nthose cases. We want people to get health care.\n  On the patient protections--about which my colleague says the Senate \ndoes not do anything for the firefighter in Massachusetts, we want \npatient protections--we just do not think we are protecting patients by \ncoming up with some facade that the Federal Government is going to take \ncare of them when we know it cannot, and have the Federal Government \nbasically preempt State law with national health insurance.\n  Look at the countries with national health care. Do they have the \nquality of health care that we do in this country? The answer is no; \nabsolutely not. People think we can draft these patient protections in \nWashington, DC, and do a better job than the States. I happen to \ndisagree. I will give some examples.\n  The States have done a lot with patient protections. We should not \nignore that. We should encourage it and compliment it. We should \nencourage them to do more. It would be presumptive.\n  We negotiated access to emergency room care; direct access to \npediatricians; provider nondiscrimination; direct access to \nspecialists; continued care from a physician; timely binding appeals to \nan independent physician; agreement on direct access to OB/GYNs; \nagreement to improve plan information; agreement on access to out-of-\nnetwork physicians; agreement on open discussion on treatment options \nwith physicians; agreement on access to prescription drugs; and \nagreement on access to cancer clinical trials.\n  We have made a lot of progress. My colleagues say we have not done \nthat. Are we going to say the language we drafted is so much better \nthan anything the States can do and so we have to supersede their \nlanguage? Some people think we are the font of all wisdom. I do not \nagree with that. It is absurd for us to say that.\n  States have been issuing patient protections. Forty-three States have \nalready passed patient protection bills way ahead of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I think it would be presumptuous of us to say: We are going to draft \nsomething. We know it is better. And States, you must comply. If you \ndon't comply, the Federal Government is going to come in to regulate.\n  That is a serious mistake. I do not want to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the proposal that I have \nsubmitted on behalf of myself and several others who have worked for \nover a year and a half to put together. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of that. And I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Dorgan-\nKennedy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for one question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield on your time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 minutes for that purpose.\n  What is the scope of and coverage in the Senator's proposal, not what \nwill apply in terms of internal-external appeals, but what is the total \ncoverage?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The total coverage is, on scope, every single employer-\nsponsored plan in America would have the right to internal-external \nappeals.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In terms of numbers, what are we talking about in the \nNickles proposal? The initial proposal, the first proposal, was 48 \nmillion. We are talking about 161 million in the Dorgan proposal. Does \nthe Nickles proposal include 161 million American families?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To answer my colleague's question, on the appeals \nprocess, it applies to 131 million Americans. We do not say we should \ndesign plans written by the States for State employees or for city \nemployees or individuals. Those have always been regulated by the \nFederal Government. They have never been regulated by ERISA, and they \naren't regulated by them in our bill, either.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me answer the question of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. The Senator from Oklahoma took a long while to say \nno.\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\n Their proposal does not cover the 161 million Americans. It is \nessentially the same proposal we have seen previously. It falls far \nshort of covering the majority of the American people who our proposal \nwould cover.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nGraham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the issue before us today is whether we \nare going to give the American people what I believe they expect and \nwhat they have a right to receive which is uniform, consistent coverage \nof their fundamental rights as beneficiaries of an HMO contract and as \npatients in a health care facility as it relates to the \nresponsibilities of that health maintenance organization.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has indicated he is going to submit to us a \ncounterproposal to the provision that has been offered by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, which focuses on one of the most fundamental issues \nand that is, who is going to be covered.\n  It is a little difficult for us to respond to the Senator from \nOklahoma since at least none of us on this side of the aisle has had an \nopportunity to see the version of the amendment that will be offered. \nIt is similar to seeing a biplane fly by with a long sign dragging \nbehind its tail. That is what we see--a long, fluttering sign that says \nPatients' Bill of Rights. But we can't see any of the detail that \nsupports that title of a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The question raised by the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota \nis whether we should have a nationwide standard or whether we should \nhave 50 standards.\n  We have already answered that question as it relates to the 39 \nmillion Americans who are covered by Medicare. We have a national \nstandard for all of those 39 million Americans.\n  We have answered that question for the 20 to 25 million Americans who \nget their health care through the Medicaid program. All of those people \nare covered by a national standard.\n  The question is whether we are going to provide for those people who \nget their insurance through private HMO companies rather than through \none of these governmental programs to also be granted the right to have \na national standard.\n  The amendment Senator Dorgan has proposed would cover all 161 million \nAmericans with private insurance. They will receive the same full array \nof protections. The proposal that I anticipate from the Senator from \nOklahoma will only fund one type of insurance: self-funded employer \nplans, which cover only 48 million Americans. The others will be left \nout.\n  I take second place to no Member of this body in terms of my support \nfor federalism. I basically believe in the principle that, where \npossible, decisions should be made at the community and State level. So \nI consider it incumbent upon myself to answer the question: Aren't you \nbeing inconsistent by now supporting a national standard of patients' \nrights? Why not leave it up to the 50 States to decide for the 113 \nmillion Americans who have private insurance rather than self-funded \nemployer plans? Why shouldn't those 113 million Americans be covered by \na State's Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  I would like to answer that question in the context of one of the \nprovisions within this bill, and that is how you will be treated if you \ngo to an emergency room. I think it is an appropriate provision to use \nas an example of the larger question of whether this should be \ndetermined 50 times by the 50 States or should there be a national \nconsistent standard.\n  The emergency room happens to be the site of the largest number of \ncomplaints by patients against their HMO's treatment. There are more \ncomplaints as to access, as to standard of care, and as to care after \nthe initial critical services are provided, there are more complaints \nby patients in that setting than any other aspect of patient-HMO \nrelationships.\n\n  The emergency room is also a setting which is heavy with urgency and \nemotion. That is not just watching ``ER'' on television; it is the \nemergency room in reality.\n  I have a practice of taking a different job every month. In February \nof this year, my job was working at the emergency room in one of the \nlargest hospitals in Florida, St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa. In that \nsetting, I had an opportunity, firsthand, to see some of the issues \nthat an emergency room poses for an HMO patient, such as the question \nof the patient arriving and asking the question: Am I going to be \ncovered for the services that I will secure from this emergency room?\n  Am I entitled to access to the emergency room?\n  It is the question of: Have I come to the right emergency room? \nShould I have gone to the emergency room that is part of the plan of my \nHMO or can I go to this emergency room because it is a half hour \ncloser?\n  It is the question of: What is going to happen after they stop the \nhemorrhaging and have moved into the poststabilization period? What \nkind of services can I receive, and what types of authorization do I \nhave to get from my HMO to be certain that those services are going to \nbe paid for?\n  Those are very fundamental, tangible questions that a family who is \ntaking a loved one to an emergency room will want to have answered.\n  I suggest it would be preferable to all of the parties involved in \nthis urgent transaction in an emergency room if there were a standard \nset of answers, whether you were in Tampa or Topeka or Tacoma, WA; that \nyou would get the same answer. It would be beneficial to the \nbeneficiary, to the patient, to know that there would be a consistent \nset of standards, that he would know, for instance, that he would be \njudged by the standard of ``the reasonable layperson'' in terms of \naccess, that he would not be judged, as happens to be the case in my \nown State of Florida, not by the reasonable layperson standard, which \nis the rule in Medicare and Medicaid and most States but, rather, as he \nis in Florida, by the standard of an appropriate health care provider \nmaking a determination after the fact as to whether the patient should \nor should not have considered his or her condition requiring emergency \nroom treatment.\n\n  It also avoids confusion by the provider because the provider will \nknow that they can render services to all the people who come into the \nemergency room based on a single set of standards in terms of what is \nin that individual's best interest.\n  Talking about emergency rooms specifically, as I understand it, in \nthe provision of the Senator from Oklahoma, rather than using the norm, \nwhich is a 1-hour period in which the HMO can decide whether they will \nassume responsibility for the patient in the emergency room or allow \nthe hospital of the emergency room to render poststabilization care, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma is going to propose that that 1-hour \nstandard, which is the standard for Medicare, for Medicaid, for most \nplans, is now going to be ballooned up to 3 hours. So for a person who \nhas been in a serious automobile wreck, who has had bleeding, \nhemorrhaging, who is in very serious circumstances and has been \nstabilized but not yet cured or not yet cared for, we are going to have \na 3-hour period for that individual to wait for the HMO to decide \nwhether it is OK for the hospital where the injured patient is located \nto provide the care there, or is the patient going to have to be put in \nan ambulance and carried to one of their network hospitals. I don't \nthink that confusion as to standard is good medical policy for the \nproviders. It is even not good policy for the insurance companies that \nhave to deal with 50 different State standards as to authorization, \nlength of poststabilization care, the other issues that arise in an \nemergency room.\n  Mr. President, as a self-declared Jeffersonian Federalist, this is a \ncase in which we need to have a national standard because it is for the \nbenefit of the good health of the American people. I urge adoption of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am assuming we have an informal \nagreement to go back and forth and to try to keep the time fairly \nequally divided. I might ask of the Parliamentarian what the division \nof time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Oklahoma has 40 \nminutes remaining, and the Senator from North Dakota has 24 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 7 minutes to my colleague from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nickles bill a \nlittle bit hesitantly--not my support--because of a conference which is \nunderway which pulls together bills passed by the House of \nRepresentatives and by the Senate wherein progress is being made so \nthat we can assure the American people of a real Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  This process seems to be interrupted time and time again, if not with \nbills brought to the floor, with press conferences day after day. You \nhaven't seen that from this side. You have seen us working on a very \naggressive, daily basis, in a bipartisan, bicameral way to put together \na Patients' Bill of Rights--a real challenge because of the number of \ninterests, the number of patient protection issues such as scope and \nliability. We are making progress.\n  Because of the political theater that seems to be the name of the \nplay put forth on the other side, we have our response tonight. I am \nvery excited about it. I am very excited because we are putting on the \ntable a real Patients' Bill of Rights which has the objectives of \nreturning decisionmaking back to that doctor-patient relationship, of \ngetting HMOs out of the business of practicing medicine but not having \nthe unnecessary mandates which needlessly drive the cost of health \ninsurance so high that people lose their health insurance.\n  The alternative bill on the other side of the aisle--one that was \ndefeated last year, a very similar bill defeated 2 weeks ago--we know \nwould drive about 1.8 million people to the ranks of the uninsured.\n  I can tell the Senate, as a physician, as a policymaker, somebody who \nhas now spent more than 2 years on this bill, we are obligated to the \nAmerican people to present a bill which is a Patients' Bill of Rights \nthat does not unnecessarily drive people to the ranks of the uninsured \nby driving up cost. That process is underway. It is interrupted once \nagain tonight.\n  Tonight, for the first time, we are going to be able to put a new \nbill that reflects this bicameral, bipartisan work of the conference on \nthe table. I would like to concentrate a few minutes on the actual ten \nor so patient protections that are in the bill that Senator Nickles has \nput forward.\n  We heard a little bit from the Senator from Florida on a Florida \nPatients' Bill of Rights and patient protections. We will come back and \ntalk about the scope of the bills a little bit more, but in Florida \nthere are a total of 44 mandates that have already been passed by the \nlegislature and are law in Florida today. The simple question is, Why \ndo we in this body think we can do a better job when the State has \njurisdiction already in putting forth mandates?\n  For example, in 1997, the State of Florida passed a comprehensive \nbill of rights, now 3 years ago. For ER services, emergency room \nservices, 4 years ago they passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. They \npassed consumer grievance procedures; breast reconstruction in 1997; \ndirect access to OB/GYNs passed in 1998 in Florida; direct access to \ndermatologists, 1997; external appeals, 1997.\n  It comes down to the basic premise that we believe we should write a \nbill in terms of scope, in terms of the ten patient protections that \napply to those people under Federal jurisdiction, and not come in and \nsay we know better than the Governor of the Assembly of Florida or \nTennessee or Arkansas.\n  Very briefly, I will talk about the patient protections.\n  No. 1, emergency care: Under the Nickles bill, plans must allow \naccess to emergency service. This provision guarantees that an \nindividual can go to the nearest emergency room regardless of whether \nthe emergency room is in the network, in the plan or outside of the \nplan. It is the nearest emergency room. So these press conferences \nwhere you see pictures of people skipping to different emergency rooms, \nit is not in the bill. In this bill you go to the nearest emergency \nroom.\n  No. 2, point of service: In this bill all beneficiaries covered by a \nself-insured employer of 50 or more employees must have a point of \nservice option regardless of how many different closed panel options an \nemployer offers.\n  No. 3, access: Specialists such as an obstetrician/gynecologist, \nunder the Nickles bill, patients receive a new right for direct access \nto a physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecological care for \nall obstetrical and gynecological care.\n  No. 4, access to pediatricians: Under our plan, a pediatrician may be \ndesignated as the child's primary care provider; that is, if a plan \nrequires the designation of a primary care provider for a child.\n  No. 5, continuity of care: Under the Nickles bill, when a provider is \nterminated from the plan network, patients currently receiving \ninstitutional care, if they are terminally ill, may continue that \ntreatment with the provider for a period of up to 90 days.\n  No. 6, access to medication, a real issue for physicians and for \npatients, this whole idea of a formulary: under the Nickles bill, \nhealth plans that provide prescription drugs through a formulary are \nrequired to ensure the participation of physicians and pharmacists in \ndesigning the initial formulary and in reviewing that formulary.\n  If there are exceptions from that formulary and a nonformulary \nalternative is available, then the patient has access to that \nnonformulary alternative.\n  No. 7, access to specialists: As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, \nthis is something I believe is absolutely critical and very important \nto have in the Patients' Bill of Rights. With the Nickles bill, \npatients will receive timely access to specialists when needed.\n  No. 8, gag rules: Under the Nickles bill, plans are prohibited from \nincluding gag rules in providers' contracts or restricting providers \nfrom communicating with patients about treatment options.\n  No. 9, access to approved cancer clinical trials: Again, this is very \nimportant. We have heard a lot about the human genome project today and \nthe great advances. That is good because it gives you the ``phone \nbook.'' We have to figure out what it means. In the same way, if you \nhave new pharmaceutical agents, or treatments for cancer, you have to \nfigure out whether or not they work; therefore, access to approved \ncancer clinical trials. The Nickles bill provides coverage of routine \npatient costs associated with participation in approved cancer clinical \ntrials sponsored by the NIH, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the \nFood and Drug Administration, and the Department of Defense.\n  No. 10, provider nondiscrimination: Under the Nickles bill, plans may \nnot exclude providers based solely on their license or certification \nfrom providing services.\n  No. 11, after breast surgery, mastectomy length of stay, and coverage \nof second opinions: Plans are required, under the Nickles bill, to \nensure inpatient coverage for the surgical treatment of breast cancer \nfor a time determined by the physician, in consultation with the \npatient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that has \nbeen cleared now on both sides of the aisle, if I may interrupt \nmomentarily.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the motion to waive the Budget Act for \nconsideration of the Gramm point of order be withdrawn.\n  I further ask consent that the Gramm point of order be temporarily \nlaid aside, to be recalled by the Senator from Texas, after \nconsultation with the majority leader and the minority leader, and the \nChair rule on the point of order immediately, without any intervening \naction, motion, or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Dorgan's \nproposal. It is very straightforward, simple, and it states \ncategorically that all Americans covered by health insurance should \nhave the protections of the Patients' Bill of Rights. Nothing could be \nclearer or more effective and efficient in providing protections to the \nAmerican people, to which we all, by and large, agree.\n  We have seen this proposal in the Democratic legislation that was \nsubmitted to this Chamber. It is included\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\nwithin the Norwood-Dingell legislation in the other body. It is \nconsistent, it is appropriate and, frankly, it seems so common \nsensical. Why should an American citizen be denied protections and \npractices and benefits because he or she is in an ERISA plan rather \nthan a non-ERISA plan? ERISA is a time and security income program \ncreated to protect the solvency of retirement funds and the financial \naspects of these plans. It was never intended to be a health care plan \nor to define the coverage for health care plans in the United States. \nSo on that point alone, it seems to be an inappropriate way to \ndiscriminate against those Americans who have access to the protections \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I have been listening to the proposals by the Senator from Oklahoma \nand the description of the Senator from Tennessee and trying to \nunderstand their proposals. My understanding is this: They have--and \nSenator Frist has announced a long list of protections and rights, and \nthey only apply to ERISA plans--48 million Americans. The appeals \nprocess, however, would be expanded to apply to 131 million Americans.\n  Now, it appears to be inconsistent, but I think the rationale and the \nlogic is pretty clear. If you don't have rights, it doesn't matter \nwhether or not you have an appeals process. If you don't have the \nrights outlined by the Senator from Tennessee, then you could have the \nappeals process, but what are you appealing? You are appealing nothing. \nIt comes back to the point that Senator Dorgan has made so well. This \nissue is about scope, so that not only do you have the right to \nappeal--all Americans--but you actually have valid rights that you can \ninsist upon in an appeals process. That is included within the \nDemocratic proposal, the Norwood-Dingell bill, and it is significantly \nabsent from the Republican proposal we are hearing today.\n  Now, the justification, of course, for this approach--the Republican \napproach--is we can't disrupt State regulations, or the sanctity of \nState regulations. However, step back and look again. Under the \npressure of Norwood-Dingell, the pressure of Senator Dorgan's proposal, \nand the pressure building up month after month of trying to bring this \nPatients' Bill of Rights to the floor for final passage--something \nsolid and substantive--the appeals process has been expanded. When it \ncomes to appeals, we are saying we don't care about State regulations \nanymore. That argument falls out. If we don't care about the appeals \nprocess with respect to the sanctity of State regulations, why do we \ncare when it comes down to fundamental rights? Or why do you care about \nit in this, I think, inappropriate, illogical, and irrelevant \ndistinction between ERISA plans and non-ERISA plans? The answer is, \nthis ERISA distinction is a convenient dodge to avoid providing rights \nfor all Americans in this health care bill.\n  Now, also, they talk about the fact that the cost of these patient \nprotections will go up dramatically. Yet the Senator from Tennessee \njust announced a long list of protections that apply to ERISA plans. \nWhy, if these are so onerous and costly, would we allow them to be \napplied to ERISA plans and not to other plans? The answer, I think, \nalso should be obvious. It is that, in fact, these proposals are not \nonly necessary but appropriate, and that the costs will not \nunnecessarily drive people away from insurance protection.\n  So what we have in the Republican proposal is based upon illogical \npremises, distinctions that should not be in place with respect to \nERISA or non-ERISA, and also would create a complexity that is one of \nthe banes of our health care system today. On this side, and also on \nthe bipartisan measure adopted by the House of Representatives, you \nhave a very simple, direct proposal that will cover every American--not \njust in the appeals process but in the basic rights they have. I think, \nin comparison, it is clear that we should support the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if we are going to talk about improving \npatient care, we should talk about improving quality of care. We \nbelieve that every patient is entitled to the best medicine available. \nReducing medical errors is an important part of improving quality. In \nfact, it is a critical issue.\n  The Institute of Medicine released a report late last year, which I \nrequested. It focused our attention on the need to reduce medical \nerrors to improve patient safety. The IOM report said that more people \nin this country die of medical errors than die of breast cancer, AIDS, \nor motor vehicle accidents--the one statistic we cannot ignore. In \nresponse to this report, the HELP Committee held four hearings. On June \n15, Senator Frist, Senator Enzi, and I introduced S. 2738, the Patient \nSafety and Errors Reduction Act.\n  This amendment, which is based on our legislation, will attack the \nproblem of medical errors in several ways. First, it will provide a \nframework of support for the numerous efforts that are underway in the \npublic and private sectors. Second, it will establish a center for \nquality improvement and patient safety within the agency for health \ncare research and quality. Finally, it will provide needed \nconfidentiality protections for voluntary medical error reporting \nsystems. These provisions are consistent with the Institute of \nMedicine's recommendations.\n  The IOM report calls on Congress to establish a center for quality \nimprovement and patient safety at the agency of health care research \nand quality.\n  This Center will take the lead on patient safety research and \nknowledge dissemination so that what is learned about reducing medical \nerrors can be communicated across the country as quickly as possible.\n  The Institute of Medicine's report also calls on Congress to provide \nconfidentiality protections for information that is collected for the \npurposes of quality improvement and patient study. This is the only way \nto get doctors and nurses to begin to voluntarily report their errors. \nThese protections apply only to medical error reporting systems and do \nnot diminish the current rights of injured patients. They will still \nhave access to their medical records and they will still have the same \nright to sue as they do now.\n  We heard loud and clear at our four hearings that we need to \nencourage the reporting of close calls. A close call is a situation in \nwhich a mistake is made, but it does not result in injury to the \npatient. No harm is done, but the potential for harm is there.\n  Many times these ``close calls'' or ``near misses'' are the result of \nproblems with the system. The nurse calculates the dose incorrectly \nbecause the medication name ordered was folinic acid and she is \naccustomed to giving folic acid. The doctor orders an inappropriate \nmedication because he has no way to know that another doctor has given \nhis patient a medicine that will interact.\n  Studies show that mandatory systems may actually suppress rather than \nencourage reporting. Punishment of individuals who make mistakes is not \nonly ineffective, it is not the goal. The goal is patient safety.\n  It is time that we include our health care industry in the list of \nindustries that have adopted continuously quality improvement and have \ntaken significant steps to reduce human errors. Good people make \nmistakes. We need to do everything we can to put the systems in place \nto ensure that health care mistakes are very hard to make.\n  Neither the Institute of Medicine nor Congress discovered this \nmedical error problem. Health care professionals have been at work for \nsome time in trying to address medical errors. I hope that by becoming \na partner in this process, the federal government can accelerate the \npace of reform and provide the most effective structure possible.\n  I am pleased that this confidential, voluntary, non-punitive approach \nto addressing medical errors has the support of both the provider \ncommunity and their oversight agencies.\n  We cannot afford to wait on this issue. The Nickles amendment will \nraise the quality of health care delivered by decreasing medical errors \nand increasing patient safety.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 19 minutes, \nand the Senator from Oklahoma has 27 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Wyoming 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I, too, am distressed that we are debating the scope at this point. \nWe had the opportunity to discuss this in a bipartisan way and to come \nup with good solutions. We were making good progress. We have been \nmaking good progress. Unfortunately, the opposition has decided that a \nnational health care plan is the only way to go. A national health care \nplan has been defeated around here a lot of times. I can tell you that \nthere are a lot of people who do not want a national health care plan. \nThey do not understand a national health care plan. If I even \nconsidered one, folks wouldn't send me back again--not the ones from \nWyoming. We have a little different atmosphere in Wyoming than they do \nmaybe in Massachusetts or New York or Florida. But the people there \nwant health care as bad as anywhere else. They don't want to be driven \nout of the market by rising costs for regulations that do not really \neven affect them. We don't have HMOs in Wyoming, except one small one \nowned by doctors.\n  The regulations that will work for other States in this country will \nnot work for Wyoming. We have an insurance commissioner. His name is \nJohn McBride. The nice thing about Wyoming is if you have an insurance \nproblem you call the insurance commissioner. You can talk to him or to \none of the people who work for him. You can call them by their first \nnames. I don't have to call them ``Mr. Commissioner.'' And they will \nhelp you get your problems straightened out. They will help out a lot \nfaster than using a national health care plan that results in a chart \nsuch as this.\n  Can you picture me telling the folks in Wyoming that the insurance \ncommissioner can't help them anymore, and to just pick the phone up and \ncall HIPAA? I don't know the thousands and thousands of employees who \nwork there. I especially don't know any of the thousands and thousands \nwho they will have to hire to do the kind of job that the scope is \ncalling for by our opponent.\n  A reasonable scope that handles the rest of the people who are not \ncovered by States where they can call the people and get the same \nperson every time so they don't have to explain again their problem \nevery single day is the kind of service people expect. It is the kind \nof service they can get, but not if we take away States rights.\n  Guess what. It looks even worse for consumers under the HCFA's \n``protection,'' according to a release by the GAO on March 31 of this \nyear.\n  The model the Democrats are supporting for implementing the Patients' \nBill of Rights is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \nAct, affectionately known as HIPAA. I quote from the report:\n\n       Nearly only four years after HIPAA's enactment, HCFA \n     continues to be in the early stages of fully identifying \n     where enforcement will be required.\n\n  There are all kinds of stories about the Washington bureaucracy. \nUnder their scope, they want us to give up the State plans in favor of \nthis group that is still trying to figure out where they are going. Is \nthat responsible? No.\n  There are other things that need to be negotiated out in this bill. \nBut that is not an option we are being given when they start piecemeal. \nEvery piece of a Patients' Bill of Rights interacts with the other \npart. When you jerk out one part of the scope and try to do that \nwithout talking about all of the other parts of it that interacts with \nthe scope you wind up with nothing but a mess. To try to do that in a \nlittle two-page bill makes it look easy. We have gone from hard on an \nearlier one to a really easy one now. And neither of them will do it \nand protect the people in my State. I suggest that it will also not \nprotect people in other States.\n  I am becoming less surprised that after walking away from the \nconference for the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Democrats are hurling \naccusations about others not wanting to get a bill done and enacted. \nThat's an incredibly counter-productive reaction to giant steps on our \npart toward compromise. This conference has been long and time-\nconsuming, but it has been working. There is not a single reason why we \nshould abandon a process that is working. Yet, politics has been \ninvited in, and I think the majority of us here to highlight why that's \nsuch a terrible mistake. Choosing this path is a vote to abandon \npatients in favor of a political issue.\n  Among the handful of principles that are fundamental to any true \nprotection for health care consumers, probably the most important is \nallowing states to continue in their role as the primary regulator of \nhealth insurance.\n  This is a principle which has been recognized--and respected--for \nmore than 50 years. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \na clear acknowledgment by the federal government that states are indeed \nthe most appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was \nacknowledged that states are better able to understand their consumers' \nneeds and concerns. It was determined that states are more responsive, \nmore effective enforcers of consumer protections.\n  As recently as last year, this fact was re-affirmed by the General \nAccounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, saying, ``In brief, we found that many states \nhave responded to managed care consumers' concerns about access to \nhealth care and information disclosure. However, they often differ in \ntheir specific approaches, in scope and in form.''\n  Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. \nEvery state does. For example, despite our elevation, we don't need the \nmandate regarding skin cancer that Florida has on the books. My \nfavorite illustration of just how crazy a nationalized system of health \ncare mandates would be comes from my own time in the Wyoming \nlegislature. It's about a mandate that I voted for and still support \ntoday. You see, unlike in Massachusetts or California, for example, in \nWyoming we have few health care providers; and their numbers virtually \ndry up as you head out of town. So, we passed an any willing provider \nlaw that requires health plans to contract with any provider in Wyoming \nwho's willing to do so. While that idea may sound strange to my ears in \nany other context, it was the right thing to do for Wyoming. But I know \nit's not the right thing to do for Massachusetts or California, so I \nwouldn't dream of asking them to shoulder that kind of mandate for our \nsake when we can simply, responsibly, apply it within our borders. \nWhat's even more alarming to me is that Wyoming has opted not to enact \nhealth care laws that specifically relate to HMOs, because there are, \nostensibly, no HMOs in the state! There is one, which is very small and \nis operated by a group of doctors who live in town, not a nameless, \nfaceless insurance company. Yet, under the proposal the Democrats \ninsist is ``what's best for everybody,'' the state of Wyoming would \nhave to enact and actively enforce at least fifteen new laws to \nregulate a style of health insurance that doesn't even exist in the \nstate!\n  As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected \nofficials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our \nhealth care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country.\n  It is being suggested that all of our local needs will be magically \nmet by stomping on the good work of the states through the imposition \nof an expanded, unenforceable federal bureaucracy. It is being \nsuggested that the American consumer would prefer to dial a 1-800-\nnumber to nowhere versus calling their State Insurance Commissioner, a \nreal person whom they're likely to see in the grocery store after \nchurch on Sundays.\n  As for the uninsured population in this country, carelessly slapping \ndown a massive new bureaucracy that supercedes our states does nothing \nmore than squelch their efforts to create innovative and flexible ways \nto get more people insured. We should be doing everything we can to \nencourage and support these efforts by states. We certainly shouldn't \nbe throwing up roadblocks.\n  And how about enforcement of the minority's proposal?\n  Well, almost one year ago this body adopted an amendment that stated, \n``It would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards \nthat not only duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State \ninsurance departments but\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nthat also would have to be enforced by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) if a State fails to enact the standard.''\n\n  Yet here we are one year later where, not only is it being suggested \nthat we trample the traditional, overwhelmingly appropriate authority \nof the states with a three-fold expansion of the federal reach into our \nnation's health care, they still insist on having HCFA be in charge. \nHCFA, the agency that leaves patients screaming, has doctors quitting \nMedicare, and, lest we not forget, the agency in charge as the Medicare \nprogram plunges towards bankruptcy.\n  And guess what, it looks even worse for consumers under HCFA's \n``protection,'' according to a new report released by GAO on March 31 \nof this year. The model the Democrats are supporting for implementing \nthe Patient's Bill of Rights is the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act, affectionately known as HIPAA. I quote from the \nreport: ``Nearly four years after HIPAA's enactment, HCFA continues to \nbe in the early stages of fully identifying where federal enforcement \nwill be required.'' Regarding HCFA's role in also enforcing additional \nfederal benefits mandates that Congress has amended to HIPAA, the GAO \nstates, ``HCFA is responsible for directly enforcing HIPAA and related \nstandards for carriers in states that do not. In this role, HCFA must \nassume many of the responsibilities undertaken by state insurance \nregulators, such as responding to consumers' inquiries and complaints, \nreviewing carriers' policy forms and practices, and imposing civil \npenalties on noncomplying carriers.'' And then, the GAO report reveals \nthat HCFA has finally managed to take a baby step: ``HCFA has assumed \ndirect regulatory functions, such as policy reviews, in only the three \nstates that voluntarily notified HCFA of their failure to pass HIPAA-\nconforming legislation more than 2 years ago.''\n  Is this supposed to give consumers comfort? First we should usurp \ntheir local electoral rights or their ability to influence the \nappointment of their state insurance commissioner and then offer up \nthis agency as an alternative? I'm sure I could find a single \nWyomingite to clap me on the back for this kind of public service.\n  I could go on at length about the very real dangers of empowering \nHCFA to swoop into the private market, with its embarrassing record of \npatient protection and enforcement of quality standards. Such as how it \ntook ten years for HCFA to implement a 1987 law establishing new \nnursing home standards intended to improve the quality of care for some \nof our most vulnerable patients. But I think the case has already been \ncrystallized in the minds of many constituents: ``enable us to access \nquality health care, but don't cripple us in the process.''\n  The next, equally important issue is that of exposing employers to a \nnew cause of action under a Patients' Bill of Rights. Employers \nvoluntarily provide coverage for 133 million people in this country. \nThat will no longer be the case if we authorize lawsuits against them \nfor providing such coverage. This is basic math. If you add 133 million \nmore people to the 46 million people already uninsured, I'd say we have \na crisis on our hands. In my mind, a simpler decision doesn't exist. We \nshould not be suing employers.\n  Let me close by saying that the conference has worked in incredible \ngood faith. We have come to conceptual agreement on a bipartisan, \nbicameral basis on more than half of the common patient protections. We \nhave come to bipartisan, bicameral conceptual agreement on the crown \njewel of both bills--the independent, external medical review process. \nMost dramatically, the bicameral Republicans offered a compromise on \nliability and scope, to which the Democrats responded with only \nrhetoric and political jabs in the press. It is absolutely bad faith to \nhave done so. I think it would be regrettable if these continued public \nrelations moves torpedo what, so far, has produced almost everything we \nneed for a far-reaching, substantive conference product.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to take the high road and support \nthe legislative process our forefathers had in mind, versus a public \nrelations circus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have listened to this discussion, and it is pretty interesting. It \nseems to me that if you don't want to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights--\nperhaps for the reason the Senator from Wyoming suggested, which is \nthat the Federal Government ought not to have any involvement in this \nissue--then just say so. Don't come out here and describe an \nalternative as if it is doing something that it is not really doing.\n  According to my colleague, we have a 258-page amendment. It kind of \nreminds me of the ``Honey, I shrunk the plan'' approach, this \nsuggestion that what we should go back to covering 48 million people \nrather than 161 million people.\n  The Senator from Tennessee talked earlier about emergency room care \nand a number of the patient protections we have proposed. I hope he \nwill respond to my inquiry. Is it not the case that the emergency room \ncare provisions in the Senator from Oklahoma's amendment applies only \nto about 48 million people. Isn't it so that two out of three people \nwill not be covered with the kind of protection the Senator suggested \nwas covered in their proposal? It seems to me it would be a much better \napproach to simply say we don't support a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will yield for about 15 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, emergency room provisions are a good case \nin point. It comes up all the time. It is important that people have \nthe right to go to emergency rooms. Emergency room provisions are \nimportant. The Senator is exactly right. For the 51 million people who \nthe Federal Government regulates, we have a responsibility to put \nemergency room provisions in there. That is what the Nickles bill does \nfor the States.\n  The other people the Senator is talking about--does he know how many \npeople already have specific emergency room provisions legislated for \nmanaged care? We do. It is not 10 States or 20 States or 30 States or \n40 States. I don't have the exact number. I know more than 43 States \nhave taken care of the emergency room provisions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand the Senator's answer, which is that the \nsubstitute offered by Senator Nickles provides coverage for only about \n48 million Americans. It is the same approach they have used \npreviously.\n  One can suggest that all of these protections I am proposing are \ncovered elsewhere. If that is the case, why does the Senator object?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma seems irritated we have raised this issue \nagain. Let me tell you what Congressman Norwood, a Republican serving \nin the House who is a sponsor of the House legislation, said on May 25, \nand I quote: I am here to say the time's up on the conference \ncommittee. We have waited 8 months for this conference committee to \napprove a compromise bill. Senate Republicans have yet to even offer a \ncompromise liability proposal. They have only demanded that the House \nconferees abandon their position.\n  This is a Republican saying the time is up on the conference \ncommittee.\n  Let me also point out that the Senate passed, in my judgment, a poor \npiece of legislation. It has the right title but it doesn't include the \nright provisions. The House passed a good piece of legislation, but the \nHouse leadership appointed conferees to the conference that voted \nagainst the House bill. Their conferees voted against the House bill. \nSo the conference isn't even on the level.\n  If month after month after month goes by and you don't want to have a \nPatients' Bill of Rights because you don't believe the Federal \nGovernment ought to be involved in this, just tell the patients that. \nSay to the patients: We don't believe Congress ought to do this. You \nshould go ahead and fight cancer and fight your HMO at the same time. \nGo ahead and do that.\n  The fact is, we can do better. The proposal we are offering today is \nvery simple. We believe that a Patients' Bill of Rights establishing \nbasic rights that patients ought to be able to expect in dealing with \ntheir insurance company is a proposal that ought to get 100 votes in \nthis Congress.\n  There are some who say, when asked the question, Whose side are you \non?\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\n Let us stand with the insurance companies.\n  We believe Members ought to stand with the patients. There is a \ngenuine and serious problem in this country with patients not getting \nthe treatment they expect, need, or deserve. Patients find themselves \nhaving to fight cancer and their insurance company. That is not fair.\n  The question is whether this Congress will do something about it. The \nquestion is not whether this Congress will pass a national health care \nplan. That is nonsense. That is not what is being debated. I see more \nshuffle and tap dances going on around here on this debate. The fact \nis, if you want to pass a good Patients' Bill of Rights, do what the \nHouse did. Understand that Dr. Norwood, a Republican Congressman, knows \nwhat he is talking about. This conference hasn't moved. This conference \nisn't accomplishing anything. That is why we have offered this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to a couple of comments, my colleague read \nfrom a Norwood letter that said the Republican conferees are not \naddressing liability. We have liability on the floor of the Senate. Mr. \nNorwood is not a conferee. Maybe he didn't know what he was talking \nabout. We have liability on the proposal. Granted, there was not \nliability in the Senate bill we passed. There is on the bill we have \nbefore the Senate.\n  When we talk about scope, we have scope that applies to 131 million \nAmericans in the appeals process and liability that they can sue their \nHMO.\n  To read a letter by a Congressman that says the conference is not \ndoing anything, they don't have liability, and we have liability is a \nlittle misleading.\n\n  When my colleague from North Dakota says our proposal doesn't have a \nFederal takeover of insurance, you might read the amendment. The \namendment on page 2 says:\n\n       (3) provide the Federal Government with the authority to \n     ensure the Federal floor referred to in paragraph (1) is \n     being guaranteed and enforced with respect to all individuals \n     described in such paragraph, including determining whether \n     protections under State law meet the standards of such Act.\n\n  In other words, the Federal Government will run State insurance, \nperiod. The Federal Government is going to take over. It is in his \namendment.\n  I think that needed to be pointed out.\n  I yield 10 minutes to my colleague and conferee on this bill, the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank Senator Nickles, whose leadership on this issue I \nthink is without equal on any issue on which I have worked since I have \nbeen in the Senate. I know the people of Oklahoma, who Senator Nickles \nrepresents, watch this on television at home. They wonder, what is this \nall about? You did, you didn't; you did, you didn't. This has to be \nconfusing.\n  In the limited time I have, I want to set this debate in historical \nperspective so everybody knows what this is about. When Bill Clinton \nwas elected President, he had a goal of having the Government take over \nand run the health care system. In fact, I have before me the Clinton \nhealth care bill. This would have mandated one giant, national HMO run \nby the Government; HMOs would set up health care collectives, and of \ncourse the right people would be chosen to decide what health care we \nall needed.\n  If you went to your doctor, he would have dictated, under the Clinton \nplan, the kind of treatment he could give. If he violated their \nguidelines because he thought you needed it, he would be fined $50,000.\n  If, under the Clinton health care bill, you went to a doctor and \nsaid, I don't think all these experts are right and my baby is sick, my \nbaby could be dying, I will pay you to treat my baby, if the doctor did \nit, he could go to prison for 5 years.\n  That is the health care system my Democrat colleagues are for. The \nMembers who were here voted for it and supported it. They know what \nthey want. They want the Government to take over and run the health \ncare system. They want to herd Americans into health care purchasing \ncooperatives, or collectives, as they call them, and you have to be a \nmember or else you don't get health care in America. That is what they \nwant. That is where this debate started.\n  Now, we are trying to give patients rights in dealing with HMOs. We \nwant internal and external review. We want the external review to be \nindependent. We want to guarantee them rights. But there is one \nfundamental difference between the Democrats and us. We think this is a \ndelicate balance, because we don't want to drive up health care \ninsurance costs so much that millions of people lose their health care.\n  Senator Kennedy's bill was scored as driving up the cost of every \nperson's health care in America by over 4 percent and costing 1.2 \nmillion American families their health insurance. What patient right is \nmore basic than having health insurance? They give you lots of rights, \nbut if you lose your health insurance, how do you pay for your health \ncare? There is the difference between them and us. We have to be \nconcerned about 1.2 million people losing their health care; they \ndon't.\n  When Clinton said, let us take over and run the health care system \nand put everybody into these health care collectives, what did he say \nthe problem was? The problem was that we had too many people without \nhealth insurance. So if their bill passed and millions of people lost \ntheir health insurance, what do you think they would say? They would \nsay: We have a solution; the solution is a government takeover of \nhealth care.\n\n  This job is easier for them than it is for us because they don't care \nif the baby dies, because they want to replace it. It reminds me of \nthat story in the Bible. Some of you may remember it. Two ladies had \ngone to bed, and during the night one of them's baby had died and the \nother one had taken the baby. They come before Solomon. Solomon, in his \nwisdom, after listening to their arguments, says let's just cut the \nbaby in half. That is what they are saying--cut the baby in half. Then \none lady said: OK, cut the baby in half; and the other said: No, let \nher have the baby. Then Solomon knew whose baby it was.\n  This is our baby. We love freedom. We love the right of people to \nchoose. We love the greatest health care system the world has ever \nknown. We are not going to let the Government take over and run the \nhealth care system. That is what this debate is about. That is what our \nDemocrat colleagues want. They are willing to destroy the greatest \nhealth care system the world has ever known because they want the \nhealth care system where the Government runs it. They think it would \nwork better. We don't. Neither did America in 1993 and 1994, which is \nwhy we have a Republican majority today.\n  The second issue is scope. What does that mean? For those watching \nthis on television, what does ``scope'' mean? What it means is, what \nshould this Federal law do as it relates to the State in which you \nlive?\n  Our Democrat colleagues believe with all their heart--they are as \nsincere as they can be--that there is only one place in the world where \npeople have really any sense: Washington, DC. They think people in city \ngovernments and county governments and State governments are ignorant \nand uncaring. They believe Washington is brilliant, all-knowing, and \nall-caring. So what they want to do is write one bill in Washington and \nimpose it on every living person in America.\n  We do not agree. We do not believe that just coming to Washington all \nof a sudden makes you brilliant. In fact, it is a long way from \nWashington to Wyoming. It is a long way from Washington to Texas. We \njoined the Union in Texas because we wanted freedom. We didn't join the \nUnion to give it up.\n  What is the difference between the two bills? Their bill says we are \ngoing to write things the way we want them, and you are going to do it \nthat way or we are going to come to your State, we are going to cut off \nyour money, we are going to cut off your health care, and in some cases \nwe are going to put you in jail. That is their way of doing it. You \nremember, in their bill if you went to this doctor, got down on your \nknees and begged that he take your money and treat your child, he went \nto prison for it; That was in their bill, the Clinton health care bill.\n  What we say is: Look, we will write a basic standard for patient \nprotections.\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\n But what if the people in Wyoming decide, since they don't have any \nHMOs--and this bill is about dealing with HMOs--that they should not \nhave to come under the Federal Government to deal with a problem they \ndon't have? They don't think they should. I don't they should either.\n  People in Tennessee and Texas were protecting patients before we got \ninto this business. They passed comprehensive bills. All we are saying \nis our bill applies to those not already covered. But if people in \nTexas, through their government, through their elected Representatives, \ndecide they appreciate our help, they appreciate our caring, they know \nwe love them, they kind of figure we know everything--but just in case \nwe are wrong, they would rather implement their own program for their \nown jurisdiction, our Democrat colleagues say: No, they don't care \nenough, they don't know enough, they are ignorant.\n  We do not agree. We want people in Wyoming to be able to say: Look we \nreally appreciate the bill, we know you guys want to help us, but we \ndon't have any HMOs; we say they ought to have the right to opt out.\n  If Tennessee says: Look, we set up TennCare because we adopted the \nClinton health care bill in Tennessee--they wish they hadn't done it, \nbut they did--if they say we would rather do it our way than your way, \nour Democrat colleagues say: What do you know? What do you know in \nTennessee? You people in Tennessee don't know and don't care about \npeople. We want to do it for you. We are going to tell you how to do \nit.\n  What we say is: Look, we have written a good bill. We want everybody \nto look at it very closely. In those areas where only Federal law \napplies, the bill applies. You can't get out from under it because \nthere are no other protections. But if Tennessee decides in areas where \nthey have already passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that they would \nrather do it their way than our way, we say if their elected \nRepresentatives, their Governor, decides to do it that way, they have \nthe right to do it.\n  Is that an extreme view? Is that somehow denying people protection? \nIs freedom a denial of protection? Is keeping the right to choose \ndenying people a basic health right? I don't think so. I think it \nenhances rights. And that is what this debate is about.\n  Our Democrat colleagues with all their hearts believe that the \nGovernment ought to take over the health care system and they think \neverything should be done in Washington.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is always interesting to listen to my \nfriend and colleague from Texas. But I still am trying to find out why \nhe is opposed to the protections which are included in our Patients' \nBill of Rights. There was a lovely, wonderful statement about his \nreservations and about the importance of freedom to HMOs: If we give \ntotal freedom to HMOs, the public be damned. That is what has happened \ntoo often. What we are talking about is the protections that are \nguaranteed in a Patients' Bill of Rights, which is, interestingly, all \nthe kinds of protections he has in his health insurance under the \nFederal employees program.\n  There is not a Member of the Senate who has not accepted the Federal \nemployees program, and it guarantees virtually every one of these \nprotections we are talking about tonight with the exception of the \nright to sue.\n  The question before the Senate tonight is this: Are we going to \ninsist that whatever protections we are going to pass in a Patients' \nBill of Rights are going to be available and accessible to all \nAmericans? That is the Norwood-Dingell bill, the bill we on our side of \nthe aisle favor. Whatever protections we are going to put in ought to \ninclude the 161 million Americans with private health insurance. That \nis our principle, that is what we stand for.\n  All you have to do is read the Nickles bill and you will find out \nthat it covers exactly what was in the Senate Republican bill--only the \n48 million Americans who are self-insured. Whatever protections they \nare talking about cover only those 48 million.\n  Look at the Nickles access to pediatric provision: ``If a group \nhealth plan''--that would be 123 million people;--``other than a fully \ninsured group plan.'' Other than; that knocks out the fully insured. It \nknocks all of them out. So the guarantees on pediatric care apply to \nonly 48 million out of 161 million.\n  Go through the rest of the Nickles bill. Go through coverage of \nemergency services. It says, again, ``If a group health plan''--they \nare covering 123 million. The next sentence, ``other than a fully \ninsured group health plan.'' Other than fully insured--75 million. How \nmany are left out? Forty-eight million. They cover the same number of \npeople they covered 7 months ago. That is the reality. Here it is in \ntheir bill. Every one of these guarantees: If a group plan, other than \na fully insured group plan. You go for the 48 million in the \nlegislation that is rejected by Dr. Norwood, who is the principal \nhealth spokesman for Republicans on health matters over in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There it is. Their own language. They cover 48 million. The Dorgan \nproposal said: Whatever we are going to do, in terms of protecting \nconsumers, let's protect them all--161 million.\n  We are one vote away in the Senate from passing an effective \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The conference is a failure. The amendment \noffered by the Senator from Oklahoma does not even have the support of \nthe House Republicans. And only one of the House Republican conferees \nwas a supporter of the Norwood-Dingell bill.\n  There is no agreement on covering all Americans. There is no \nagreement on external appeals. There is no agreement on holding health \nplans accountable. There is no agreement on access to specialists, to \nclinical trials, or a host of other patient protections. There was no \nagreement.\n  This vote today is a chance for the Senate to make a statement. A \nvote for the Dorgan amendment is a vote for the proposition that every \npatient in America is entitled to protection. Establishment of that \nprinciple is a giant step towards the day the Senate will pass a true \npatients protection program. A vote for the Nickles amendment is a vote \nagainst patients and for insurance companies. It is a vote for covering \nless than a third of all Americans. It is a vote for the same limited \ncoverage originally passed by the Senate. It is a vote for a review \nprocess that is not truly independent. It is a vote against meaningful \naccountability. It is a vote against access to specialists outside a \nplan, even if the specialist is the only one able to treat that \ncondition. It is a vote against access to clinical trials for heart \npatients. It is a vote for a bill that is so inadequate it will never \npass the House, and it will never be signed by the President. It will \nnot protect the thousands of patients who are injured every day.\n  It is up to the Senate. We should vote for the principle that \neveryone be covered. We should vote against a plan rejected by every \ngroup of patients and doctors, and by House Republicans. And we should \ncome back after the recess and pass a real patients' rights bill, of \nwhich we can all be proud, whether we are Republicans or Democrats. \nLet's protect patients, not HMOs. I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Let's protect patients, not HMOs. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 10 minutes, and \nthe Senator from North Dakota has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all of our \ncolleagues, it is my expectation we will have a vote about 7:20 p.m. I \nsay to the majority leader, all time will expire by about 7:20 p.m. We \nare happy to vote on both proposals. So colleagues should be on notice \nto expect two rollcall votes beginning at 7:20 p.m.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague, a conferee on the bill, the \nSenator from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I compliment and commend the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, for the\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\nhard work he has done and the months of labor he has put into this \nconference. Anybody who has followed the reports of what has come out \nof this conference cannot honestly say it has been glacial movement. \nEnormous progress has been made. Concessions have been made on the part \nof the House conferees as well as the Senate conferees.\n  This is no way to legislate and no way to provide patient protections \nthe way Senator Kennedy and Senator Dorgan have done in parceling out a \nlittle piece here and there. Tonight we are going to do scope. That is \nnot the way to legislate. This is truly the triumph of politics over \npolicy.\n  I was writing as various Senators on the Democratic side made \nspeeches. They spoke of a national standard, of universal coverage, and \nof a national health system. To this Senator's mind, they could be \nsynonymous with a national health care system. We had that debate. We \nhad it in 1993. It was called ``Clinton care.'' Senator Gramm piled it \nup over here, and it was about 2 feet tall.\n  The American people made a judgment on ``Clinton care.'' We do not \nwant a national health care system, nor is that in the best interest of \nAmericans.\n  The real debate tonight centers around not whether we want \nprotections for all Americans or whether we believe we are the only \nones who can provide that protection or whether the States have a \nlegitimate role in providing protections for their citizens. How many \nStates have patient protection laws? Forty-three States have already \nenacted patient protection laws.\n  Do we not believe they have the best interests of their  citizens in \nmind? What we are doing in our legislation is providing protection \nwhere States cannot do it where Federal jurisdiction is legitimate. \nUnder ERISA and self-funded plans, we do that, as we should.\n\n  I listened to my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. In \nhis State, in 1996, they had a ban on gag clauses. They passed a \ngrievance procedure. They, in fact, have 26 State mandates. Does the \nSenator not believe they care about their citizens?\n  I heard my colleague and good friend from Florida speak of the need \nfor a national system. The State of Florida passed a comprehensive bill \nof rights in 1997, emergency room services in 1996. They have 44 State \nmandates. Do they not care? They care as much as we care, and they know \ntheir State better than we do.\n  I heard my colleague from the State of Rhode Island speak about the \nneed for a national health care system. Rhode Island passed a \ncomprehensive consumer rights bill in 1996. They have passed 27 \nmandates in Rhode Island. I can go on and on. Forty-three States \nalready have a bill of rights. It is not our place to usurp their \nauthority. It is not our place to take over insurance that has \ntraditionally and historically been regulated at the State level. It is \nwrong for us to do that.\n  To my colleagues I say we have a conference in progress. It is \nprogress. It is working hard. It is making progress. That is the way we \nshould provide patient protections, not through an amendment on an \nappropriations bill.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Nickles, for the hard work he has done \nand all the conferees and look forward to when we will have a \nmeaningful patients' rights bill passed into law.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, has the Senator from Oklahoma completed \nhis debate? It is my intention to close debate on my amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to let my colleague close. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 5 minutes, and \nthe Senator from North Dakota has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing forward \nthis extremely positive proposal in the area of patient protections. \nThis bill has a lot of initiatives, many of which have been outlined \nvery well by my colleagues. One that has not been highlighted as \ncompletely as I would like because of time--and I want to touch on it \nquickly--is the issue of liability.\n  When our bill initially passed the Senate, we did not include an \nopportunity to sue, but we have changed that policy. Under the bill as \nit is proposed today, first there is a tremendously positive appeals \nprocess. If a patient believes they have been aggrieved by their HMO, \nthey have the right to an internal appeal and an external appeal which \nis set up with an independent group of physicians who will review the \ncase and who are knowledgeable on that subject. More importantly, if a \npatient thinks they have been aggrieved, under certain circumstances, \nthey will be able to sue that HMO. What they will not be able to do is \nhave an open season on the employer.\n  If one looks at the proposal that has been put forward by the other \nside, they are suggesting we have an open season on employers. The \nwhole exercise in the Patients' Bill of Rights is not to have open \nseason on employers. It is to address inequities occurring to people as \nthey deal with their insurers, specifically with health maintenance \norganizations.\n  If we allow this open season on employers, we will simply drive \npeople out of insurance. Instead of improving insurance for individuals \nacross the country, individuals across this country will walk into work \none morning and their employers will say: I did not give you this \nhealth care policy which happens to be a very expensive event in my day \nin trying to make an effective workplace; I did not give it to you so \nlawyers could use it as a game area to bring suits against me.\n  Employers across this Nation are going to simply drop their health \ncare insurance. They will give their employees a certificate to buy \ntheir own health insurance or some other type of vehicle to allow them \nto compete in the marketplace. Because employers are able to get a \nbetter price and are able to tailor their insurance policies more \neffectively to the needs of their employees in different regions of \nthis country, the practical effect will be employees get significantly \nmuch less health care under the proposal coming from the other side \nbecause employer after employer will simply drop their employees' \nhealth insurance programs and will allow the marketplace to compete for \ntheir employees. Unfortunately, the result will be the employees will \nbe left with the short stick.\n  I think that is the actual goal of the other side. I think their real \ngoal is to drive up the number of uninsured across this country. If one \nlooks at the pattern of activity on the other side of the aisle, it has \nbeen to annually increase the number of uninsured by raising the price \nof insurance in this country.\n  Since this administration has been in office, the number of uninsured \nhas gone up by 8 million people because the price of insurance has gone \nup and up as the other side has tried to drive up the price of that \ninsurance.\n  What is the ultimate goal? ``Hillary care.'' If they put enough \npeople on the street, if they create enough uninsured, inevitably they \nwill have to claim: I am sorry, everybody is uninsured so we have to \nnationalize the system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think that is a good place to stop. I reserve the \nremainder of the time on our side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to Senator Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator from New \nHampshire. He argues there is a new provision in the Republican plan \nthat provides for liability. That provision is a sham. There are three \npoints I want to make in response.\n  First is the argument that we are creating an open season on \nemployers. It is simply false. Not true. A letter from the American \nMedical Association of June 23 states clearly:\n\n       The insurance industry--\n\n  And the Republican plan in this case--\n\n     is flat wrong, and to imply otherwise is frankly deceptive. \n     The fact is, the bipartisan House-passed bill would actually \n     protect employers.\n\n  Under our bill, an employer cannot be held responsible under specific \nlanguage unless they actively intervene in the decision of the \ninsurance carrier, which never occurs.  There is to reason\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\nfor it to occur. It in fact never occurs. It is a false argument that \nemployers can be held liable under our proposal. They cannot.\n\n  Second, the argument that they are providing for liability is simply \nnot true. Under their plan, an insurance company can never be held \nresponsible for their initial decision to deny coverage. So if somebody \ngoes to their doctor with an emergency situation--they need care--and \nthe insurance company says no, and, as a result, they suffer a lifelong \ninjury, a debilitating injury, or death, the insurance company cannot \nbe held accountable. They can only be held accountable, can only be \nheld responsible, if they have exhausted the internal review process \nand the insurance company acted in bad faith or if they failed to \nfollow the decision from the external review board.\n  The bottom line is, it creates an incentive for the insurance company \nto deny coverage in the first instance because under no circumstances \ncan they be held responsible, and under no circumstances can they be \nheld accountable. For those reasons, this provision for HMO insurance \ncarrier liability is not real; it is a sham.\n  Our proposal provides real and meaningful accountability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Tennessee--how \nmuch time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator 1 minute.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very quickly, a vote for the Nickles \namendment is a vote for patient protection, emergency room access to \nobstetricians, pediatricians, specialists, and clinical trials.\n  A vote for the Nickles amendment is a vote for a strong internal \nappeals process. If the HMO rejects the appeal of the doctor, you can \ngo internally. If it is rejected again, you go to an external appeal \nprocess. The decision made by the external appeals process is made by \nan independent physician not bound by how the plan may define ``medical \nnecessity.'' If the external appeal overrules the plan, and the plan \ndoes not comply, you go to court. This new ability to go to court, \nwhich is what many people believe is so important, is a new right to \nsue in Federal court.\n  Lastly, the access provisions have not been mentioned.\n  In closing, all of these mandates are going to drive up the cost of \nhealth care.\n  Access provisions in the bill include an above-the-line deduction for \nhealth insurance expenses, a 100-percent self-employed health insurance \ndeduction, expansion of medical savings accounts, and deductions for \nlong-term care.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am please to be a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by Senator Daschle to the FY 2001 Labor HHS \nAppropriations bill which will protect people from having their \npersonal, genetic information used against them by their employers or \ntheir health insurance companies. The provision is identical to the \nlegislation that Senator Daschle introduced earlier this year and which \nI have also cosponsored.\n  If adopted, the Daschle amendment will bar insurance companies from \nraising premiums or denying patients health care coverage based on \ngenetic information. Employers will also be prohibited from using \ngenetic information in hiring practices. Because a right without a \nremedy is not right at all, these measures also provide an individual \nwho has suffered genetic discrimination with the right to take legal \naction. This is an essential protection to ensure that discrimination \ndoes not occur.\n  With the latest breakthrough earlier this week of the Human Genome \nProject in mapping human genetic make-up, protecting Americans from \ngenetic discrimination--an issue that was already important--has become \ncritical. We must support the advancement of science and discovery \nthrough research. But while we are embracing these new discoveries, we \nmust also provide safeguards to ensure the protection of this new and \npotentially very sensitive and personal information. In order to help \nAmericans embrace scientific discoveries we must ensure these \ndiscoveries will not cause personal harm.\n  This February, in recognition of the need to prevent abuse and misuse \nof genetic information, President Clinton signed an Executive Order \nthat prevents federal agencies from discriminating against workers if \nthey discover through genetic testing that they have a predisposition \nto a disease or some other conditions. President Clinton expressed his \nsupport for legislation to prevent genetic discrimination which will \nextend beyond the reach of the Executive Order. The Genetic \nNondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act and today's \namendment will allow Vermonters--and all Americans--to undergo genetic \ntesting without being afraid that their employer or their insurance \ncompany will use this information to discriminate against them.\n  No one wants to find out they may be predisposed to a certain disease \nand then have to worry about losing their job. These important measures \nwould give them the assurance and protection that their personal \ninformation will be protected and will not be used against them.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Are we finished? Will I close at this point? I have 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I have 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to close debate on my amendment, if the \nSenator would like to proceed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to close on ours. You have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are debating my amendment, I guess. I \nhave the right to close debate on my amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no right to do such.\n  Mr. DORGAN. All right, Mr. President. Let me take the 5 minutes at \nthis point and close debate.\n  Mr. President, this has been an interesting discussion, but it has \nnot been about what is on the floor today. We have had now a debate \nabout the 1993 Clinton health plan. We have also had a discussion about \n``Hillary care.'' If you have the interest in debating that, hire a \nhall, get your own audience, speak until you are exhausted, and have a \ngood time. But those are not the subjects on the floor today. We are \ndebating the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Some people do not want to debate that. They certainly do not want to \ntalk about the facts, but this is what we are talking about: The \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  Dr. Greg Ganske, a Republican Congressman from Iowa, was just on the \nfloor of the Senate and he indicated that the 258-page missive that is \nnow offered as a substitute will in fact weaken HMO laws in the \nfollowing States: California, Texas, Georgia, Washington, Louisiana, \nOklahoma, Arizona, and Missouri. That is not from me; it is from Dr. \nGanske, a Republican Congressman.\n  By the way, let me read something Dr. Ganske said some time ago in a \ndiscussion about all of these issues. He said:\n\n       Let me give my colleagues one example out of many of a \n     health plan's definition of medically necessary services. \n     This is from the contractual language of one of the HMOs that \n     some of you probably belong to: ``Medical necessity means the \n     shortest, least expensive or least intense level of \n     treatment, care or service rendered or supply provided, as \n     determined by us.''\n       Contracts like this demonstrate that some health plans are \n     manipulating the definition of medical necessity to deny \n     appropriate patient care by arbitrarily linking it to saving \n     money, not to the patients' medical needs.\n\n  Some of my colleagues say we are playing politics with this issue? \nWhy don't you tell that to some of these kids.\n  Dr. Ganske described this child I show you a picture of, a child born \nwith a severe cleft lip. Fifty percent of the medical professionals in \nDr. Ganske's field report that they have been told that correcting this \nkind of condition is not a medical necessity.\n  So tell that to the kids. Tell it to this young child, that it is not \na medical necessity to correct this condition.\n  Dr. Ganske also shared with us what a young child looks like who was \nborn with this deformity--but who has it corrected by the right kind of \nsurgery. Let me show you another picture of this child with the \ncondition corrected. Does anybody want to tell this child it was not \nworth it?\n  Or maybe you want to talk to Ethan Bedrick. Tell Ethan that this is \njust\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\npolitics. Ethan was born during a complicated delivery that resulted in \nsevere cerebral palsy and impaired motor function in his limbs. When he \nwas 14 months old, Ethan's insurance company abruptly curtailed his \nphysical therapy, citing the fact that he had only a 50-percent chance \nof being able to walk by age 5.\n  So talk to Ethan about this. You think this is politics? Talk to \nEthan. A 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5 was deemed, \nquote, ``insignificant,'' and therefore you don't get the medical help \nyou need. And some people say: Well, it doesn't matter. Apparently, you \ndon't deserve it.\n\n  That is not the way health care ought to be delivered in this \ncountry. People ought to have basic rights. That is why we call this a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  The question, at the end of the day, is: With whom do you stand?\n  Do you stand with the managed care companies that have developed \ncontracts such as this, that say, ``Medical necessity means the \nshortest, least expensive, or least intensive level of treatment, care, \nor service as determined by us,'' which means that this young child is \ntold: Tough luck?\n  Or do you stand with the patients and decide that maybe we ought to \ndo something, as a country, that responds to real problems and pass a \nreal Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  A fellow once told me, in my little hometown: You never ought to buy \nsomething from somebody who is out of breath. There is a breathless \nquality to some of the discussion I have heard tonight. We raise the \nissue of a Patients' Bill of Rights, and instead we hear a discussion \nabout the 1993 health care plan. Then we have a substitute that is 258 \npages that kills a lot of trees for nothing. You don't need to take up \n258 pages to offer an empty plan. Offer one page, and say: We don't \nsupport a Patients' Bill of Rights. Just be honest about it. But do not \ntry to fool the American people any longer.\n  It is true we have had a few votes on this. It is also true that \nthere is a conference committee that is supposed to be working. But it \nis also true, as Dr. Norwood and other Republican Congressmen said, \nthat the time is up and the conference committee has not done a thing.\n  No one ever accuses the Congress of speeding. I understand that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will give my colleague an additional minute.\n  Let me say, I know he holds up a lot of photographs. I think that is \na crummy way to legislate. But I will say that every single example he \nmentioned would be covered by external appeal. Those decisions would be \nmade by medical experts. We even put in language that they would not be \nbound by the plan's definition of ``medical necessity.'' They would be \ncovered.\n  Pass the bill. If you want those kinds of examples to be covered, \npass the bill. We are going to give you a chance to vote on it tonight. \nI might mention, my colleague from Tennessee says: We have a bill that \nis a Patients' Bill of Rights-plus because we provide a lot of things \nfor people who cannot afford it. We provide an above-the-line deduction \nto buy health care, so more people can buy health care. The Democrats' \nproposal is going to uninsure millions of Americans.\n  We should not do anything that is going to dramatically increase the \nprice of health care and uninsure millions of Americans, as their \nproposal would do. We also don't think HCFA, that glorious Federal \nagency they are trying to empower, should be regulating all health care \nin the States.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleagues have said we are one vote \nshort. We are not one vote short. Unless somebody changes the rules of \nthe Senate, the Norwood-Dingell bill is going to need a lot more votes. \nIt will never pass this session of Congress.\n  I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I am announcing \nthat there will be no further votes this evening after these two votes. \nI will shortly ask unanimous consent that the debate and votes in \nrelation to the following remaining amendments be postponed to occur in \na stacked sequence beginning at 9:15 a.m. on tomorrow, Friday, with 2 \nminutes prior to each vote for explanation. Also in the request is a \nconsent that no second-degree amendments be in order to the amendments \nprior to the votes just outlined.\n  The amendments are as follows: Wellstone No. 3674, Helms amendment \nregarding school facilities, and we have just added the Harkin \namendment regarding IDEA.\n  I will also ask unanimous consent that following those votes and the \ndisposition of the managers' amendment, the bill be advanced to third \nreading and passage occur, all without any intervening action and \ndebate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent the Senate insist on its amendments \nand request a conference with the House and the Chair appoint the \nentire subcommittee, including the chairman and the ranking member, as \nconferees.\n  I hope all of our colleagues will agree to this consent. If not, the \nSenate will be in session late into the day tomorrow concluding this \nbill and beginning the appropriations bill on Interior.\n  With that, I now propound the unanimous consent just outlined.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could ask my friend to add one phrase, \n``any amendments that may not be cleared as part of the managers' \npackage.''\n  Mr. SPECTER. I make that addition.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, parliamentary inquiry, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as I read this unanimous consent request, \nthe phrase ``without intervening business'' suggests to me that \npossibly the point of order that has been set aside against the bill \ncould not be raised. I would like to ask if that is the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's interpretation is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request be \nrevised to allow me to raise the point of order. I think that was \nalways the intention, but I would like to be sure that is the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The unanimous consent request is as amended by the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we just got a call in the Cloakroom. \nSomebody has a problem with this. We will try to take care of it as \nsoon as we can. Should we go ahead with the vote?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let us proceed with the vote, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania withdraws his \nunanimous consent request.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3694. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouoye and \nthe Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 166 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n\n[[Page S6093]]\n\n\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Inouye\n     Leahy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3694) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate voted on yet another \nproposal for providing patient protections to Americans enrolled in \nHMOs. Unfortunately, this proposal did not provide the strong \nsafeguards and protections that I believe each and every American \ndeserves to have.\n  This amendment failed on the three key areas for meaningful patient \nprotections--fair legal accountability for denied care, the right of \nevery American to choose their doctor, and basic patient rights for \nevery American not just a limited few.\n  Under this amendment only a limited number of Americans would be \nprovided with basic patient protections including the right for a woman \nto go directly to an OB/GYN and a parent to take their child directly \nto receive care from a pediatrician. Every American should be protected \nfrom having their doctors being ``gagged'' by HMO and prevented from \nsharing all health care information with them.\n  Another disturbing provision contained in this proposal was the lack \nof legal redress available to an individual if they did not complete \nthe internal review process. Under this proposal if a patient died \nduring the internal review process--which could take up to 14 days--\nthen their surviving family would have no legal recourse against the \nHMO that denied or caused harm to the deceased individual. This is \nsimply wrong and indefensible.\n  While I was disappointed in this proposal there were a few provisions \nthat were applaudable and made an important step towards providing \nstronger protections to patients. I appreciated the efforts that were \nmade to make the external review process more fair, unbiased and \naccessible. In addition I applaud the attempts made to provide patients \nwith the right to sue including a cap on non-economic damages and no \npunitive damages. Both of these are items that I have consistently \nfought for inclusion in a HMO reform bill. People must be provided the \nright to sue for damages once all means have been exhausted but it must \nbe done in a manner that does not cause excessive lawsuits and cause \nhealth care costs to exorbitantly rise.\n  I am disappointed that this proposal did not go far enough but I am \nhopeful that a strong patient protection bill can still be passed prior \nto Congress adjourning in the fall. It is the least we can do for \nAmerica's patients.\n  Congress still has an excellent opportunity to show the American \npeople that it can and will rise above partisan politics and find the \nconsensus that serves the national interest and puts the health care \nneeds of patients first. This is too important an issue to allow the \ninfluence of special interests to prevent us from doing what is right \nfor all Americans and I am confident that the leaders in both the House \nand Senate will continue working with the conferees to ensure that an \nagreement is reached.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3693\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The question is on agreeing to the \nDorgan amendment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Senator from North Carolina yield so we can get an \nagreement on how to proceed for the remainder of the night?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Carolina yield?\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President I want to take a few moments to go over the \nschedule for the remainder of the night and the morning and get a final \nagreement on a unanimous consent request.\n  These were the last two votes of the night. We want to complete the \noffering and debating of the remaining amendments that have been \nrequested tonight, and then we will have those votes stacked beginning \nat 9:30 a.m., which is a little different from the time earlier \nmentioned. We had discussed 9:15 a.m. and there was a request we do \nthat at 9:30 a.m.\n  I renew the unanimous consent request regarding the Labor-HHS bill \nwhich now includes possible votes tomorrow, Friday morning, beginning \nat the amended time, 9:30 a.m., relative to the following issues: a \nWellstone amendment regarding drug pricing; a Helms amendment regarding \nschool facilities; a Harkin amendment regarding IDEA; a Baucus \namendment regarding impact aid; any amendment that is not cleared \nwithin the managers' package; disposition of the point of order; and \nfinal passage of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \ncooperation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I address my leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Two things, Mr. President. The distinguished ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee and I have a package of about a \ndozen amendments which we can clear tonight. They are agreed upon. We \nneed to call up the bill.\n  Second, we want to discuss with our leadership the possibility of a \nUC which might help move our bill along. Can we give the general \noutline?\n  Mr. LOTT. That will be fine.\n  Mr. WARNER. It will take but a minute. I ask my distinguished \ncolleague to generally outline what we\n\n[[Page S6094]]\n\nhad in mind. I ask him to articulate it if he can.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The idea would be, after this package of cleared \namendments is adopted, we would offer a unanimous consent agreement to \nlimit the bill to relevant amendments on the list, which would include \nSenator Byrd's amendment on bilateral trade because that probably is \nrelevant under any circumstances.\n  Mr. WARNER. We think that is relevant, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendments will have to be on file no later than \nadjournment tomorrow for the recess. Second-degree amendments that are \nrelevant would be in order even if they are not filed. This is just \npreliminary. Since the Senator from Virginia asked, I offer this at \nleast as a suggestion preliminarily. This is what we are talking about.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. May I add, Senator Dodd has an amendment in there which \nhas been cleared.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond to the comments, first, I \nwant to make very clear I feel strongly we should try to find a way to \npass this very important Department of Defense authorization bill. It \nhas a lot of provisions in it, changes in the law we have to get done. \nWe need to do this for our national security and for our men and women \nwho serve in our military.\n  Senator Daschle and I have talked about the fact we want to work \ntogether to move it forward. That is one of the many reasons we tried \nto find a way to conclude the disclosure requirements of the section \n527 issue. We have achieved that. That is why I have been working with \nSenator Brownback to find a way to deal with an issue that is very \nimportant to him, NCAA gaming. We want to get it done.\n  What I had in mind was for the managers to continue to work and clear \nas many amendments as they can, and the week we come back--again, I \nhave not discussed the details of this with Senator Daschle, so I will \nnot agree to anything without us both having a chance to check on both \nsides and clear it. But I was thinking in terms of asking the managers, \nwho have done yeoman's work, to be prepared to work on Monday night, \nTuesday night, or Wednesday night while we do other issues during the \nday. I am hoping one night will do the job but work a couple or three \nnights and complete this bill the week we come back. We are glad to \nwork with them toward that goal. We want to get this bill in \nconference. I think Senator Daschle wants to help with that effort.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can add my thoughts, I share the \nview expressed just now by the majority leader. We really want to help \nthe managers finish their work on this bill. They have been working on \nit now for weeks. We have come a long way.\n  The majority leader has also indicated to colleagues who have \nconcerns about nonrelevant amendments that we will have an opportunity \nto consider other vehicles immediately following the completion of the \nDefense authorization bill so we will be able to continue this \nprocedure of a dual track to allow the consideration of other issues.\n  With that understanding, we want to work with the managers to rid \nourselves of nonrelevant amendments, stick to those amendments which \nare relevant in an effort to, as the leader suggested, finish the bill \nin a matter of a night or two. I commend the managers for the effort \nthey have made thus far. We will work with them to see we finish it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our respected leaders very much. I told my leader \nand Senator Levin, we will work nights, we will go right straight \nthrough the evenings and stack such votes that we feel are necessary. \nWe will achieve that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for yielding \nfurther. I ask his indulgence for a moment so the Senator from Kansas \ncan respond.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader \nmentioning trying to work out the issue on NCAA gaming. I hope we can \nget that worked out and come to a resolution and move the issue \nforward. I want to make sure we get that one taken care of as well.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can add one other thought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not bring up \nalso the understanding the leader and I have about further confirmation \nof judges. Obviously, when we come back, that is going to continue to \nbe an important matter. The leader has certainly indicated a \nwillingness to work with us on that.\n  It is also with that understanding that Senator Levin has some very \nimportant matters, Senator Reid, and others. I appreciate very much the \nmajority leader's commitment to work with us on that as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if Senator Helms will yield one second more, \nwe are going to confirm some nominations tonight. I do note it is our \nintent after we complete Labor-HHS and the MILCON conference report to \nproceed to the Interior appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3697\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the expenditure of certain appropriated funds for \n the distribution or provision of, or the provision of a prescription \n                for, postcoital emergency contraception)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3697.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) None of the funds appropriated under this \n     Act to carry out section 330 or title X of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b, 300 et seq.), title V or XIX of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 701 et seq., 1396 et \n     seq.), or any other provision of law, shall be used for the \n     distribution or provision of postcoital emergency \n     contraception, or the provision of a prescription for \n     postcoital emergency contraception, to an unemancipated \n     minor, on the premises or in the facilities of any elementary \n     school or secondary school.\n       (b) This section takes effect 1 day after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) In this section:\n       (1) The terms ``elementary school'' and ``secondary \n     school'' have the meanings given the terms in section 14101 \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 8801).\n       (2) The term ``unemancipated minor'' means an unmarried \n     individual who is 17 years of age or younger and is a \n     dependent, as defined in section 152(a) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that it be \nin order for me to deliver my remarks at my seat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, Americans who follow international news, will recall \nthat the French Government recently created an uproar when it \nauthorized its public schools to distribute the post-conception \n``morning-after-pill'' to girl students as young as 12 years old.\n  I wish parents in our country could be assured that such an \ninitiative will never see the light of day in the United States, but no \nsuch assurance can be made under existing circumstances.\n  In fact, when the French Government announced that it would be \ndistributing the ``morning-after pill'' in French schools, the Alan \nGuttmacher Institute--the research arm of Planned Parenthood--\nrecommended almost immediately that the United States duplicate the \nWestern European's approach in handing out contraceptions to teenage \ngirls.\n  So, isn't it clear that attempts to distribute the ``morning-after \npill'' in U.S. public schools are indeed underway in planning boards of \nPlanned Parenthood?\n\n[[Page S6095]]\n\n  Moreover, Americans will be alarmed to learn that Federal law \ncurrently gives schools the authorization to distribute these \n``morning-after pills'' to schoolchildren.\n  In fact, the Congressional Research Service confirmed to me that \nFederal law does, indeed, permit the distribution of the ``morning-\nafter pill'' at school-based health clinics receiving Federal funds \ndesignated for family planning services.\n  Simply put, this means that any school receiving Federal family \nplanning money is prohibited by Federal law to place any sort of \nrestriction on contraception. Even parental consent requirements.\n  In a handful of cases, the Federal courts have struck down parental \nconsent laws, ruling that any Federal family planning program trumps a \nState or county parental consent statute because Federal law prohibits \nparental consent requirements--even though Federal law says recipients \nof Federal family planning money should ``encourage family \nparticipation.'' I make this point because so many who oppose placing \nrestrictions on contraception--like parental consent requirements--run \nfor cover under this language ``encourage family participation'' when \nthey know good and well that it means absolutely nothing in a court of \nlaw.\n  Let me reiterate a warning: There is nothing in Federal law to \nprevent the post-conception ``morning-after pill'' from being \ndistributed on school grounds by clinics receiving Federal funding--\nregardless of whether a parental consent State statute exists.\n  That is why I asked the Congressional Research Service to look into \nwhether or not school clinics are distributing the ``morning-after \npill.'' What CRS found is that there is some discrepancy to the \nresponse to this question.\n  For example, according to CRS, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures spokesman said there was no knowledge that any school had \ndistributed the ``morning-after-pill.'' Yet, the National Assembly on \nSchool-Based Health Care--an organization which works closely with \nHHS--told Congressional Research Service that their group has recently \nconducted a national survey of their members, and that the resulting \ndata reflected that out of 1,200 schools, 15 percent offer \ncontraceptives, including the ``morning-after pill.''\n  So, you see, it is not clear as to exactly what is being provided to \nschoolchildren these days. But it is clear that we are not just talking \nabout condoms.\n  Simply put, Planned Parenthood and its cronies have been given free \nreign to distribute to American schoolchildren whatever they so \nplease--to the point where schoolchildren are now being provided \nextremely controversial forms of contraception. And, in my judgment, \nthis has gone on far too long.\n  That is why I am offering an amendment today that would forbid \nschools from using Federal funds from the Labor, HHS, Education \nappropriations bill to distribute the lawfully given ``morning-after \npill'' in school.\n  But before the guardian angels of Planned Parenthood get themselves \nin a tizzy, let me make clear precisely what this amendment will and \nwill not do.\n  Under the proposed measure, elementary and secondary schools will be \nforbidden to use funds from the Labor, HHS and Education appropriations \nbill to distribute to school children the ``morning-after pill''--which \nis widely considered to be an abortifacient. In fact, many pharmacists \nnationwide have refused to fill prescriptions for the ``morning-after \npill'' because they, too, see it as an abortifacient.\n  This amendment will apply only to school clinics on school property.\n  Clearly, Congress simply must not ignore the fact that our \nschoolchildren deserve to be protected.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two memoranda prepared by \nthe Congressional Research Service be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2000.\n     To: Senator Jesse Helms\n     From: Kenneth R. Thomas, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division\n     Subject: Application of Parental Consent Requirements to \n         Distribution of Emergency Contraceptives in School-Based \n         Clinics Receiving Federal Funds\n\n       This revised memorandum is in response to your rush request \n     to determine whether state parental notification statutes \n     would apply to the distribution of emergency contraceptives \n     at a school-based clinic which receives federal funds. \n     Specifically, you requested an evaluation of whether state \n     parental notification statutes, regulations or policies which \n     applied to federally funded clinics distributing \n     contraceptives would be preempted.\n       In a series of cases in the mid-1980's, various federal \n     courts reviewed the application of parental notification \n     requirements to federally funded programs which distributed \n     contraception. In general, the courts found that the \n     application of parental notification statutes to federally \n     funded programs to provide contraception resulted in the \n     frustration of the federal purpose of the statutes, and \n     consequently the courts invalidated such restrictions.\n       There is currently no federal prohibition on the \n     distribution of emergency contraceptives at school-based \n     clinics.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please contact me at 7-\n     5863.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2000.\n\n     To: Honorable Jesse Helms.\n     From: Technical Information Specialist, Domestic Social \n         Policy Division.\n     Subject: School-Based Clinics.\n       Your office requested a memorandum describing policies of \n     school-based clinics for distributing emergency \n     contraceptives (more commonly known as the ``morning-after \n     pill''), including the number of schools estimated to be \n     offering emergency contraception, and any existing federal \n     prohibitions.\n       We contacted three different groups for this information:\n       (1) The National Assembly on School-Based Health Care \n     informed us that their group has recently conducted a \n     national survey of their members and that data reflected that \n     out of 1200 schools, 77% do not offer contraceptives, 15% \n     offer contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, and \n     the remaining 8% offer contraceptives, but not emergency \n     contraceptives. The schools offering contraceptives are \n     middle schools and high schools. The information is not yet \n     available for publication.\n       (2) The National Conference of State Legislatures informed \n     us that they currently have no knowledge of any schools \n     distributing emergency contraceptives through school-based \n     health clinics.\n       (3) The Healthy Schools/Healthy Communities (HSHC) Program, \n     Health Resources and Services Administration, Department of \n     Health and Human Services informed us that HSHC does not \n     provide direct dollars for specialized services, such as \n     emergency contraceptives, but does support school-based \n     programs that provide full and comprehensive health services. \n     HSHC is administered as a discretionary program under the \n     Health Centers program, Section 330 of the Public Health \n     Service Act. Section 330 allows the provision of voluntary \n     family planning services at health centers.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from North Carolina, is he \nfinished with his prepared remarks on his amendment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, I am.\n  Has the Chair ruled on the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. They have been ordered.\n  Mr. President, I am advised I should ask unanimous consent that this \namendment of mine be laid aside and the vote be put in regular order \ntomorrow morning. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3698\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a limitation on the use of funds for certain \n      agreements involving the conveyance or licensing of a drug)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 3698.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6096]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 92, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) Limitation on Use of Funds for Certain \n     Agreements.--Except as provided in subsection (b), none of \n     the funds made available under this Act may be used by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into--\n       (1) an agreement on the conveyance or licensing of a patent \n     for a drug, or on another exclusive right to a drug;\n       (2) an agreement on the use of information derived from \n     animal tests or human clinical trials that are conducted by \n     the Department of Health and Human Services with respect to a \n     drug, including an agreement under which such information is \n     provided by the Department to another Federal agency on an \n     exclusive basis; or\n       (3) a cooperative research and development agreement under \n     section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act \n     of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 3710a) pertaining to a drug, excluding \n     cooperative research and development agreements between the \n     Department of Health and Human Services and a college or \n     university.\n       (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to an \n     agreement where--\n       (1) the sale of the drug involved is subject to a price \n     agreement that is reasonable (as defined by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services); or\n       (2) a reasonable price agreement with respect to the sale \n     of the drug involved is not required by the public interest \n     (as defined by such Secretary).\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to apply to any agreement entered into by a college \n     or university and any entity other than the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services or an entity within the Department \n     of Health and Human Services.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Johnson from South Dakota.\n  I am just going to take 1 minute to summarize this amendment, I say \nto my colleagues, and then Senator Johnson will proceed, and then I \nwill come back to the amendment.\n  Mr. President, if you just look right here at this chart, it is very \ninteresting. Tamoxifen and Prozac are two widely used drugs. Look at \nthe difference between what the United States citizens pay for a vial \nversus what people in Canada pay.\n  In our country, a United States citizen pays $241 for tamoxifen; $34 \nin Canada. For Prozac, in this country it is $105; in Canada, it is \n$43.\n  What this amendment says--and I want to go back to Bernadette Healy's \nleadership at NIH. What this amendment says is that what Ms. Healy did \nis the right thing to do, which is to say to the pharmaceutical \ncompanies, when the NIH does the research, and then the patent is \nhanded over to a pharmaceutical company, that pharmaceutical company--\nsince we put the taxpayer dollars into the research--should at least \nagree to provide citizens in this country with a decent, affordable \ncharge; that the pharmaceutical company should agree to an affordable \nprice or a reasonable price which is defined specifically by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Again, this amendment says that pharmaceutical companies that \nnegotiate an agreement with NIH--NIH is doing the research, helping \nout, the drug is then developed, the pharmaceutical company now has the \npatent--must sign an agreement to sell the drug at a reasonable price.\n  I do not think it is unreasonable from the point of view of your \nconstituents and my constituents, people in this country who pay the \ntaxes and support our Government, who feel just a little bit ripped off \nby the prices today, that if we are going to put our taxpayer dollars \ninto the research and into the support and then the pharmaceutical \ncompanies are going to get a patent, at the very minimum they ought to \nbe willing to sell the drug to people in our country at a reasonable \nprice defined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  This amendment is all about corporate welfare at its worst. It is \nabout being there for consumers. It is about assuring people that their \ntaxpayer dollars are contributing toward some research that will in \nturn contribute toward affordable drugs for themselves and their \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Johnson of South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMinnesota, extending strong support for his amendment.\n  Very simply, this amendment would require that when companies receive \nfederally funded drug research or a federally owned drug, the benefits \nof that research or drug be made available to the public on reasonable \nterms through what is called a ``reasonable pricing clause.''\n  This issue first surfaced during the Bush administration, in fact, \nwhen the NIH insisted that cooperative research agreements contain a \nreasonable pricing clause that would protect consumers from exorbitant \nprices of products developed from federally funded research.\n  Two weeks ago, during floor debate in the other body on the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill, a very \nsimilar amendment to this one was offered and overwhelmingly accepted \nby nearly three-quarters of the House of Representatives in a \nbipartisan vote.\n  The circumstances we face today are extraordinary. As an example, \nbetween 1955 and 1992, 92 percent of drugs approved by the FDA to treat \ncancer were researched and developed by the taxpayers through the NIH. \nToday many of the most widely used drugs in this country dealing with a \nvariety of critical illnesses such as AIDS, breast cancer, and \ndepression were developed through the use of taxpayer-funded NIH \nresearch. The Federal Government funds about 36 percent of all medical \nresearch.\n  The unfortunate scenario for American taxpayers is that oftentimes \nthis drug research, done at their expense, is frequently used then by \nthe pharmaceutical industry with no assurance that American consumers \nwill not be charged outrageously high prescription drug prices.\n  Take the drug Taxol, for instance. The NIH spent 15 years and $32 \nmillion of our money, taxpayer money, to develop Taxol, which is a \npopular cancer drug used for breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. \nFollowing the development of Taxol, the drug manufacturer was awarded \nexclusive marketing rights on the drug, and Taxol is now priced at \nroughly 20 times what Taxol costs the manufacturer to produce. So a \ncancer patient on Taxol will pay $10,000 a year while it only costs the \ndrug company $500.\n  As reported by Fortune 500 magazine earlier this year, the \npharmaceutical companies once again represent the most profitable \nsector of the American economy. On top of that, we are seeing drug \nprices soaring at unimaginable rates year after year. In the United \nStates, drug spending is growing at more than twice the rate of all \nother health care expenditures. Furthermore, Americans are paying far \nmore for prescription drugs than do the people in any other Western \nindustrialized Nation--many of these drugs manufactured in the United \nStates and the research having been conducted through American taxpayer \ndollars.\n  As an example, tamoxifen, a widely prescribed drug for breast cancer, \nrecently received federally funded research and numerous NIH-sponsored \nclinical trials. Yet today the pharmaceutical industry charges women in \nthis Nation 10 times more than they charge women in Canada for a drug \nwidely developed with U.S. taxpayer support.\n  The evidence has shown that the pharmaceutical companies are charging \nenormously high rates for drugs developed with the help of taxpayer \nmoney. Americans then are forced to pay twice for lifesaving drugs: \nfirst as taxpayers to develop the drug, and then as a consumer to \nbolster pharmaceutical profits. Once again, who is hurt most by this? \nAs one would expect, these costs fall hardest on those most vulnerable \nand least able to bear the burden, such as cancer patients, AIDS \npatients, and the elderly.\n\n  We have to put an end to the giveaway of billions of taxpayer dollars \nto finance drug research that goes on without any assurance whatsoever \nthat the American taxpayers will not see a reasonable return on their \ninvestment in terms of affordable prescription drug prices.\n  I appreciate that this amendment may not be the silver bullet that \nsolves all of the problems of assuring the American public they are \nreceiving the return on their investment that they deserve. But it does \nserve as an important message that this Congress is here to protect the \nmillions of American consumers who have invested their\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\nmoney in research to develop drugs that they now cannot afford to buy. \nFurthermore, it shows we are here to fight for affordable prescription \ndrugs for every American in this Nation.\n  This is one part of an overall strategy that this Congress needs to \nenact to assure that we have equity, to assure that we have tax \nfairness, and to assure that we maximize the number of people in \nAmerica who can afford their prescriptions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this critically important \namendment tomorrow when the vote is taken on this amendment. I commend \nand applaud my colleague from Minnesota for his work in crafting this \namendment and bringing it before the body.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota. \nAgain, the amendment says that when the pharmaceutical companies \nnegotiate an agreement with the NIH to develop and market a drug based \non taxpayer-financed research, there must be an agreement signed by the \npharmaceutical companies that they will sell the drug at a reasonable \nprice.\n  This is an eminently reasonable amendment. This amendment does not \ncover extramural NIH research grants, such as grants to universities. \nIt does not cover grants to universities. It does not establish a \nhealth care price control scheme.\n  This amendment will reinstate the Bush administration's reasonable \npricing clause which was in effect from 1989 to 1995. This amendment \ndirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine what is \na reasonable price. This amendment gives the Secretary flexibility to \nwaive the pricing clause if it is in the public interest to do so.\n  As my colleague from South Dakota pointed out, a similar amendment, \nwhich was introduced by Congressmen Sanders, Rohrabacher, DeFazio, and \nothers passed the House of Representatives by a 3-to-1 margin, 313 to \n109. It is because people in the country feel ripped off by this \nindustry. People in the country believe that the prices should be more \nreasonable. Certainly our constituents believe that if we are going to \nbe funding some of the research and these companies are going to \nbenefit from our taxpayer dollars, then there ought to be an agreement \nthat these companies are going to be willing to charge us a reasonable \nprice. That is not too much to ask.\n  This amendment is supported by Families U.S.A., the National Council \nof Senior Citizens, and the Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Families USA,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Senator Paul Wellstone,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: We applaud your amendment that \n     would require that a price agreement be part of agreements \n     between NIH and companies who do research on new drugs.\n       Currently, once NIH has successfully developed a new drug \n     it signs over the commercial rights to pharmaceutical \n     companies that charge American consumers as much as they \n     want. Americans are forced to pay twice for lifesaving drugs, \n     first as taxpayers to develop the drug and then as consumers \n     to the drug companies for the product. These costs fall \n     hardest on those least able to bear the burden such as \n     seniors and the uninsured, although all consumers wind up \n     paying more than they should have to.\n       Your amendment would help correct this burdensome \n     situation. Please let us know how we can help make this \n     amendment in law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F.

The Federal government has \n     for too long sold its most precious research findings for a \n     mess of pottage to the pharmaceutical cartels. The drug \n     companies, in turn, sell these findings back to the American \n     people at unconscionably high retail prices. Pharmaceutical \n     retail price reform must start at the source--where public \n     drug research and development investment has borne fruit.\n       Your bill defines the public interest as requiring hard \n     bargaining by the N.I.H. in behalf of the public when selling \n     patents to drug companies. We also note that your amendment \n     only covers intramural N.I.H. research. We call on your \n     colleagues to support this needed amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Schulder,\n     Director, Legislation & Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2000.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: It has come to our attention that \n     the Senate is likely to consider H.R. 4577, an amendment to \n     the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \n     appropriations bill. The amendment would require drug \n     companies to sell drugs at a reasonable price if the drugs \n     were developed based on intramural research done by the \n     National Institute of Health. On behalf of the members and \n     supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, I strongly support your proposed \n     amendment.\n       When pharmaceutical companies build on NIH research they \n     are using taxpayer money. A Congressional Joint Economic \n     Committee report revealed that seven out of the top 21 most \n     important drugs introduced between 1965 and 1992 were \n     developed with federally funded research. Taxpayers deserve \n     some return on their investment in terms of lower prices. \n     This amendment will help to ensure that.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will quote from Ron Pollack, executive director of \nFamilies U.S.A.:\n\n       Currently, once NIH has successfully developed a new drug \n     it signs over the commercial rights to pharmaceutical \n     companies that charge American consumers as much as they \n     want. Americans are forced to pay twice for lifesaving drugs, \n     first as taxpayers to develop the drug and then as consumers \n     to the drug companies for the product. These costs fall \n     hardest on those least able to bear the burden such as senior \n     citizens and the uninsured, although all consumers wind up \n     paying more than they should have to.\n\n  I want to simply quote from a piece in the New York Times from April \n23, which challenged the drug industry's contention that R cost \njustify the prices they charge the American consumer. That is what we \nkeep hearing, that it is the R cost. That is why they have to charge \nso much. I quote from the New York Times piece of April 23:\n\n       The industry's reliance on taxpayer-supported research--\n     characterized as a ``subsidy'' by the very same economists \n     whose work the industry relies on--is commonplace, the \n     examination also found. So commonplace, in fact, that one \n     industry expert is now raising questions about the companies' \n     arguments.\n       The expert, Dr. Nelson Levy, a former head of research and \n     development at Abbott Laboratories, who now works as a \n     consultant for industry and the Federal Government on drug \n     development, bluntly challenged the industry's oft-repeated \n     cost of developing the drug. ``That it costs $500 million to \n     develop a drug,'' Dr. Levy said in a recent interview, ``is a \n     lot of bull.''\n\n  Finally, the examination found that Federal officials have abandoned \nor ignored policies that could have led to lower prices for medicines \ndeveloped with taxpayer dollars. That is partly because the Government \nhas lost track of what drugs have been invented with its money, and \npartly, officials say, because the industry has resisted any Government \neffort to insist that they charge people--our constituents--a \nreasonable price. As Dr. Bernadine Healy, a former Director of the NIH, \nsaid in a recent interview, ``We sold away Government research so \ncheap.''\n  Again, it is not a new issue. During the Bush administration, the \nNIH, from 1989 to 1995, insisted there be some reasonable pricing \nclause. There was heavy pressure from the pharmaceutical industry. They \nabandoned this practice. We are saying that we ought to be going back \nto it.\n  There are multiple factors contributing to the prescription drug cost \ncrisis in our country today. I realize that this reasonable pricing \nclause is not a panacea for these egregiously high drug costs for \nAmerica's seniors--and, for that matter, for families in our country--\nbut this amendment makes it clear the Congress will not allow taxpayers \nto spend all of the money for this kind of research and then not get \nany kind of break in return.\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\n  For the most part, most of the drugs that are developed with taxpayer \nmoney are then given over to the pharmaceutical industry with no \nassurance whatsoever that Americans will not be charged outrageously \nhigh prices--in fact, no assurance that they won't be charged the \nhighest prices in the world. Tamoxifen is a very important drug to \nwomen struggling with breast cancer. This is what a prescription costs \nthat is getting filled. In Canada, it is $34. In the United States, it \nis $241. Prozac is $43 in Canada, and in the U.S. it is $105.\n  Here is the next chart. This amendment will ensure that we get some \nfair return on our investment and that we don't get the highest prices \nfor medications in the world. Let me restate that. I don't think it \nensures that, but it can only help. I have given some examples up here. \nLet me simply point out to colleagues that the cost of prescription \ndrugs has skyrocketed. Our people in this country this past year paid \n17 percent more.\n  Let me also point out that we are paying the highest costs for \npharmaceutical drugs of any people anywhere in the world-- exorbitant \nprices. I have this chart--The Fleecing of America--just to look at \nsome of the profits of companies. Let me give some examples: \nentertainment companies, $4.2 billion; airline companies, $4.7 billion; \noil companies are doing pretty well right now at $13.6 billion; auto \ncompanies, $15.4 billion; the drug companies, $20 billion.\n  As the Fortune 500 magazine said, this past year has been a \n``Viagra'' kind of year for these drug companies. But do you know what. \nIt is the consumers who paid the price. We are charged the highest \nprices of any country in the world, and I think it is time to say to \nthe pharmaceutical companies that enough is enough.\n  This industry has opposed every measure that has been introduced in \nthis Congress to try to lower prices and to provide a decent \nprescription drug benefit to senior citizens. Frankly, I hate talking \nabout it in terms of senior citizens because there are a lot of working \nfamilies being hurt by this.\n  I think the amendment we have introduced tonight is a small step, but \nI think it is a step in the right direction. It is not unreasonable to \nsay to these companies that if we are going to finance the research, if \nNIH is going to do the research, if you are going to get valuable data \nand information from NIH to use to develop your drugs, and you are \ngoing to get the patent, at the very least you have to agree to charge \na reasonable price.\n\n  That is all this amendment says. This is what we did under Dr. \nHealy's leadership. The pharmaceutical companies hated it. They were \nable to knock it out sometime around 1995. But do you know what. A lot \nhas changed, I say to Democrats and Republicans alike, since 1995. \nPeople in our States are absolutely furious about the prices they are \nbeing charged by the pharmaceutical industry. This industry has \nbasically become a cartel. I wish there were a lot of free enterprise. \nI wish there were a lot of competition. But that is not so. They \nbasically have administered prices; they basically have price gouged; \nand they have made an immense amount of profit--an exorbitant amount of \nprofit--based upon the sickness and misery and illness of people. That, \nin and of itself, is an obscene proposition.\n  This amendment goes after the worst of corporate welfare. This \namendment is eminently reasonable, and I hope that my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  Again, I point out the support of Families U.S.A. I think I will read \nfrom the letter of the National Council of Senior Citizens:\n\n       The National Council of Senior Citizens fully supports your \n     amendment to the FY2001 Labor HHS appropriations bill to \n     require that the Federal government negotiate a reasonable \n     and fairer price for all drugs developed with public funds.\n\n  Ask the people back home. Do any of our constituents think it is \nunreasonable for us to ask these companies that benefit from our \ntaxpayer dollars and benefit from Government research to charge our \ncitizens, our constituents, a reasonable price?\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The Federal Government has for too long sold its most \n     precious research findings for a mess of pottage to the \n     pharmaceutical cartels. The drug companies, in turn, sell the \n     findings back to the American people at unconscionably high \n     retail prices. Pharmaceutical retail price reform must start \n     at the source--where public drug research and development \n     investment has borne fruit.\n\n  Finally, from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare:\n\n       On behalf of the members and supporters of the National \n     Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, I \n     strongly support your proposed amendment.\n       When pharmaceutical companies build on NIH research they \n     are using taxpayer money. A Congressional Joint Economic \n     Committee report revealed that seven out of the top 21 most \n     important drugs introduced between 1965 and 1992 were \n     developed with federally funded research. Taxpayers deserve \n     some return on their investment in terms of lower prices. \n     This amendment would help to ensure that.\n\n  This amendment would help to ensure that, and I don't know why the \nSenate tomorrow morning cannot go on record saying that when we, a \nGovernment agency supported by taxpayer dollars, by our constituents, \ndo the research, provide the data, provide the information to these \ncompanies, which in turn get a patent for the drug, those companies \nwill sign an agreement that they will charge the citizens in this \ncountry a reasonable price.\n  They make all the arguments about how they need all of these \nexorbitant profits for their research. But there is not a shred of \nevidence to support that. Their profits are so exorbitant that it goes \nway beyond any cost of research. We all know that. That is what is \nbehind the record profits they make.\n  They make these arguments that I cannot believe--that if NIH is going \nto force us to sign an agreement, since we benefit from your research \nand the taxpayer money, we will charge people a reasonable price, then \nwe may not even be willing to do this research. That is blackmail, or \nwhite mail, or whatever you want to call it. It is outrageous. These \ncompanies dare to say to the NIH--or dare to say to the Government, or \nto our constituents--if the Government says to the pharmaceutical \ncompanies that get the research dollars, do the work and research and \nget the patent, that they should charge a reasonable price, we might \nnot do the research at all, enough is enough.\n  My final point: I think this is a reform issue as well. I think \nSenators vote their own way. But, honest to God, I think, at least \nspeaking as a Senator from Minnesota, I am just tired of the way in \nwhich--if Fanny Lou Hammer were on the floor she would say ``sick and \ntired''--this industry pours the dollars in, makes these huge \ncontributions, has all of these lobbyists, has all of this political \npower, and is so well represented to the point where they believe they \nrun the Congress. They do not.\n  This amendment with very similar language passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a huge margin. Very similar language, the same \nproposition, and the same subject matter passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a huge margin.\n  I hope tomorrow on the floor of the Senate there will be a strong \nvote for this amendment that I bring to the floor with Senator Johnson \nof South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is just simply wrong that Americans are \nforced to pay extraordinarily high prices for prescription drugs and \nthen have to cross the border to Canada and Mexico to buy those drugs \nmanufactured in the United States at far lower prices. It is simply \nwrong. But it is doubly wrong when the U.S. taxpayers have paid for \npart of the research that produced those very same prescription drugs.\n  Many of us have constituents who go to Canada just for this purpose; \nthey are unable to afford prescription drugs here in the United States. \nSometimes they go great distances to cross the border to Canada or to \nMexico in order to buy prescription drugs at prices they can afford.\n  We did a survey of a number of prescription drugs. These are seven of \nthe most popular prescription drugs. We took a look at those seven \ndrugs and then did a survey of the cost of those prescription drugs in \nMichigan and in Ontario across the border. Premarin, $23.24 in \nMichigan, $10.04 in Ontario; Synthroid, $13 compared to $8; Prozac, $82 \ncompared to $43; Prilosec, $111 compared to $48; Zithromax, $48 \ncompared\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\nto $28; Lipitor, $63 compared to $42; Norvasc, $76 compared to $41.\n  When particularly seniors--sometimes by the busload--gather together, \ndrive to a border point, and cross the border to get a 30- or 60-day \nsupply of prescriptions, and then come back into Michigan or other \nStates with prescription drugs that they cannot afford to buy in their \nown hometown, something is fundamentally wrong with that system.\n  These are the percentages of those top seven drugs. The U.S. prices \nare above the Canadian prices based on that survey. That was a survey \nof prices in Detroit compared to Ontario across the border.\n  For the first one, Premarin, the U.S. price is 131 percent higher \nthan the Canadian price; Synthroid is 63 percent higher than for \nOntario purchasers; Prozac is 878 percent higher for Americans than for \nCanadians; Prilosec is 132 percent higher; for Zithromax, Americans are \npaying 674 percent more than Canadians; Lipitor is 51 percent more than \nfor Canadians; and Norvasc is 783 percent more than for Canadians.\n  That is unconscionable. It is wrong. It is infuriating. It is costly. \nWe have to do something to change the system that allows this to \nhappen. But it is doubly wrong when U.S. taxpayers have paid for part \nof the research that produced those very same prescription drugs.\n  I don't know which of these particular prescription drugs were \nproduced with U.S. taxpayer dollars or partly with U.S. taxpayer \ndollars. I don't have that data. But that is not the point of the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota. For the drugs produced with \nU.S. taxpayer dollars, there should be an agreement that the \nmanufacturer will charge a fair price as determined by the Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  That is a very reasonable approach, it seems to me. There are other \napproaches which have been suggested to address this issue. I think \nthere are other approaches also worthy of consideration. But the \napproach before us today is an approach which I believe is eminently \nfair, which simply says if you want to use taxpayer dollars in your \nresearch, that you make sure your pricing system is fair to Americans \nwho helped to fund that very research.\n  I hope we will adopt the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. I \nthink it is a fair approach. It is based on the contribution Americans \nhave made to the creation of the very prescription drugs which too many \nAmericans find they cannot afford.\n\n  We want pharmaceutical companies to be profitable. We want \npharmaceutical companies to engage in robust research and development. \nBut we do not and should not, as Americans, pay the share of research \nand development that consumers in other countries should be \nshouldering. We can't afford to subsidize other countries, and it is \nparticularly wrong where we have originally done some of the subsidy of \nthe very research and development which produced the drug which is now \nsold for so much less in those other countries.\n  I commend the Senator from Minnesota. I support his amendment. I hope \nwe will adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nhis remarks. I am very proud to have his support.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3699\n\n                     (Purpose: To fully fund IDEA)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk on the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is laid aside. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 3699.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 60, line 16, strike ``$7,357,341,000'' and insert \n     ``$15,800,000,000''.\n       On page 60, line 19, strike ``$4,624,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$13,071,659,000''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It is \nvery straightforward. It does not include a lot of pages of text. All \nit does is fully fund the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. \nBy passing this amendment, we meet our goal of paying 40 percent of the \naverage per pupil expenditure.\n  For years, many on both sides of the aisle have agreed that the \nFederal Government should increase our support for States' efforts to \nprovide children with disabilities a free and appropriate public \neducation. With this amendment we can do just that.\n  Congress enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, \nwhich is now known as IDEA, for two reasons. To establish a consistent \npolicy of what constitutes compliance with the equal protection clause \nof the 14th amendment with respect to the education of kids with \ndisabilities, and to help States meet their constitutional obligations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Wellstone as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there has been a lot of misperception \nabout IDEA. That misperception is amplified in statement after \nstatement until it almost becomes a state of fact that IDEA is a \nFederal mandate on the States. I hear it all the time: a Federal \nmandate that is not fully funded.\n  IDEA is not a mandate of the Federal Government on the States. The \nfact that the Federal courts have said if a State provides a free and \nappropriate public education to its children--and States don't have to \ndo that--but if a State provides a free and appropriate public \neducation for all of its kids, it cannot discriminate on the basis of \nrace, it cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, or national origin, \nand in two court cases the court said it cannot discriminate on the \nbasis of disability.\n  Simply because a child has a disability doesn't relieve the State of \nits obligation under the equal protection clause to provide that child \na free and appropriate public education.\n  In 1975, the Congress said because this would be such a burden on the \nStates, we will pass national legislation to help the States meet their \nconstitutional obligation to educate kids with disabilities. That is \nwhat IDEA is. The Federal Government said, OK, if you meet these \ncertain requirements, you will be eligible for IDEA for this money. If \nwe had no legislation at all, if there were no Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act, the States would still have to fund the \neducation of kids with disabilities--not because the Federal Government \nsays so, but because the Constitution of the United States says so. As \nlong as a State is providing a free public education to other kids, \nthey have to provide it to kids with disabilities. It is not a Federal \nmandate. It is a constitutional mandate.\n  We have said in the Federal Government, when we passed IDEA, we will \nhelp. Furthermore, we said in the authorizing legislation, that it \nwould be a goal of the Federal Government to provide for 40 percent of \nthe cost of the average per pupil expenditure for all other kids. We \nhave never reached that 40 percent. It was a goal then. It is still a \ngoal. Senators on both sides of the aisle talked about meeting this \ngoal. Now we have the opportunity to do so.\n  My amendment is a win-win situation for everyone. We are able to \nfully fund both the IDEA and our general education priorities so that \nall kids, with and without disabilities, get the education they deserve \nand they are guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.\n  Over the past 5 years, I have worked hard with my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee to more than double the appropriation for Part \nB of IDEA. This year we have included an additional $1.3 billion. \nSenator Specter and I, in a bipartisan fashion, worked very hard to get \nthis increase. Because of the amendment offered by Senator Jeffords \nyesterday and the statements made on the floor, it became clear to me \nthat there is a strong will on both sides of the aisle to fully fund \nIDEA to meet that 40-percent obligation.\n  Now we can step up to the plate and do it. This week the OMB informed \nus\n\n[[Page S6100]]\n\nthat the non-Social Security surplus will reach up to $1.9 trillion \nover the next 10 years. I believe we ought to use these good economic \ntimes to prepare for the future.\n  So, Mr. President, as I said, OMB has informed us we are going to \nhave $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years in non-Social Security \nsurplus. That means we can use some of this for a lot of different \nthings: Pay down the national debt, shore up Social Security, Medicare, \nand make appropriate investments in education. One of the most \nappropriate investments we can make is to fully fund the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. But there are a lot of other ways we \ncan help pay for this. For example, we could save dollars by cracking \ndown on Medicare waste fraud and abuse. The HHS Inspector General said \nlast year, Medicare made $13.5 billion in inappropriate payments. \nEliminating that waste alone would more than pay for the entire IDEA \nexpenditure. Yet the House-passed Labor-HHS bill actually cuts the \nfunding for detecting waste, fraud and abuse. I hope we can take care \nof that in conference. My point is we have a lot of waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Medicare we can cut out to help pay for this.\n  We have a lot of other things we can do also: Cutting out Radio \nMarti, and TV Marti; spending by Government agencies on travel, \nprinting and supplies and other items could be frozen. This could save \n$2.8 billion this year, about $12 billion over 5 years. Pentagon \nspending could be tied to the rate of inflation. This would force the \nPentagon to reduce duplication and other inefficiencies. This change \nwould save taxpayers $9.2 billion this year alone; $69 billion over 5 \nyears. Enhancing the Government's ability to collect student loan \ndefaults would be $1 billion over 5 years.\n  The reason I cite these examples is to show there is a lot of waste \nand a lot of spending we can tighten down on to help pay for IDEA. We \nhave the surplus, however. All this money that we found out there--as \nwe go through this year, you wait and see, transportation will take a \nlittle bit of that money; housing will take a little bit of that money; \ndefense will take a big chunk of that; the Finance Committee will have \ntax provisions--they want to do away with all the estate taxes now. \nThat will take away a big chunk. I hope we don't pass it but I assume \nsomething will come through.\n  There is a big surplus out there and bit by bit special interests are \ngoing to come and take some of it away. Now is our time to get in there \nand say we are going to take enough to fully fund the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. We can do it. We have the money to do it. \nAnd, if I listened correctly to my friends on both sides of the aisle, \nwe seem to have the will to do it.\n  I just point out a range of organizations fully support full funding. \nIt is one of the National Governors' Association top priorities. The \nEducation Task Force of the Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities \nadvocates full funding. The National School Boards Association just \nsent me a letter last week requesting an increase in funding for IDEA.\n  In January of 1997 the majority leader, Senator Lott, announced that \nfully funding IDEA was a major component of the Republican agenda. \nLater, Senator Gorton said that failure to fully fund IDEA is \nfundamentally wrong--Congressional Record, May 13, 1997.\n  In January of 1998 the majority leader and other Republican Senators \nheld a major press conference to announce they were going to introduce \na bill, S. 1590, that would, among other things, fully fund IDEA.\n  Senator Coverdell said the resolution of the issues in that bill \nwere:\n\n       As important a battle as the country has ever dealt with.\n\n  On his Web site, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, who has always \nbeen a proponent of fully funding IDEA said that:\n\n       He will continue to lead the fight to have the Federal \n     Government meet its commitment to fund 40 percent of the \n     special education costs.\n  On his Web site, Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania supports full \nfunding for IDEA.\n  Last night, Senator Voinovich of Ohio said it is about time we paid \nfor 40 percent of IDEA. That was last night.\n  And last night Senator Jeffords, with whom I have worked many years \non this issue, said:\n\n       This body has gone on record in vote after vote that we \n     should fully fund IDEA.\n\n  Senator Jeffords also said:\n\n       If we can't fully fund IDEA now with budget surpluses and \n     the economy we have, when will we do it? I do not believe \n     that anyone can rationally argue that this is not the time to \n     fulfill that promise.\n\n  The reason I opposed the Jeffords amendment last night, and I said so \nopenly last night in debate, is because his amendment would have taken \nmoney out of class-size reduction and out of funding for school \nmodernization and construction to fund IDEA. I said we should not be \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul. We need to reduce class sizes. We need \nschool construction money.\n  In fact, some of the biggest beneficiaries of school construction and \nmodernization are kids with disabilities.\n  Now we have an opportunity to fully fund IDEA because we have these \nbig surpluses, as I said, $1.5 trillion on-budget surpluses over the \nnext 10 years, not counting Social Security. To fully fund IDEA would \namount to less than 6 percent of that over the next 10 years. And, like \nI said before, we wouldn't have to touch the surplus if we just \nimplemented one of my proposals to close up special interest tax \nloopholes, eliminate wasteful government spending, including Pentagon \nwaste, or deal with Medicare waste, fraud and abuse. If you want to \ngive a gift to the States this year, if you really want to help our \nlocal school districts, this is the amendment with which to do it, to \nfully fund IDEA once and for all.\n  I yield for any comments or suggestions my colleague from Minnesota \nmight have.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief. Staff is \nhere, and it is late. It has been a long week. I can do this in a \ncouple of minutes. I wanted to stay with Senator Harkin because I think \nthis amendment goes right to the heart of what we are about. It is a \nwin-win-win-win amendment. I do not know how many times I said ``win.'' \nIt is a win for us because we should match our budgets and our votes \nwith the words we speak. Just about everybody on the floor of the \nSenate said they are for the Federal Government meeting this commitment \nof 40 percent funding of IDEA. It is also a win for children with \nspecial needs. It is about children. We ought to do well for all of our \nchildren.\n  Maybe it is because I am getting a little older and have six \ngrandchildren, but I think all children are beautiful and all children \nhave potential and all children can make contributions. We should do \neverything we can to nurture and support them. That is what this \nprogram has been about.\n  The Senator from Iowa has been, if not the leader, one of the great \nfew leaders from early time on for kids with special needs. It is also \na win because I do think our States and school districts, if we can do \nbetter by way of our investments, I say to Senator Harkin, will not \nonly be able to live up to this commitment but will have more resources \nto invest in other priority areas. One of the things that has troubled \nme is, the Senator talked about the surplus. What is it over 10 years, \n$1.9 trillion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, $1.5 trillion, non-Social Security.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is $1.5 trillion non-Social Security over the next \n10 years. Some of what has been discussed is a zero-sum gain, whether \nwe are faced with the choice of do you support low-income kids with \ntitle I or do you support IDEA or do you support a lower class size or \ndo you support trying to get more teachers into our schools, or do you \nsupport rebuilding crumbling schools. I believe we have a chance right \nnow with the surplus, with these additional resources, to make these \ndecisive investments. I cannot think of anything more important than \nmaking this investment in children and education.\n\n  My last point is, all of us--and I will even make this bipartisan, \nseeing Senator Chafee presiding, whom I think cares deeply about \nchildren and education, just like his dad did, and I mean that \nsincerely--we are all going to have to make some decisions about \nconsistency.\n  It is like the old Yiddish proverb: You can't dance at two weddings \nat the\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\nsame time. We cannot do everything. Some people want to put yet more \ninto tax cuts, including Democrats, more here and more there. \nUltimately, we have to decide what is most important. We have this \nsurplus and we have the opportunity. We have had all the debate and \ndiscussion, and now we have an opportunity, with this amendment--of \nwhich I am proud to be a cosponsor--to match our votes with our \nrhetoric. We should do that. I hope there is a strong vote for this \nfrom Democrats and Republicans. I am proud to be a cosponsor. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his words of \nsupport, not only tonight but for all the time I have known him and all \nthe years he has been in the Senate for making kids and education, \nespecially special needs kids, one of his top priorities.\n  I could not help but think when I was listening to the Senator speak, \nthis vote on this amendment--I do not mean to puff it up bigger than it \nis. We are going to be faced the remainder of this year with vote after \nvote on what to do with that surplus. We may disagree on whether it is \nthe estate tax cut or marriage penalty--whatever it might be. There \nmight be other things coming down the pike, and we will have our \ndebates and disagreement, but it seems to me that before we get into \nall that, we ought to do something for our kids with disabilities and \nwe ought to do something that is right and is supported broadly, in a \nbipartisan way, and supported by our States.\n  I can honestly say to my friend from Minnesota, if every Senator \nvoted for this amendment, they would not get one letter, one phone call \ntaking them to task for their vote in support of this amendment. I \nbelieve I can say that without any fear that I would ever be wrong; \nthat no Senator, whoever votes for this amendment, would ever get one \nletter or one phone call from anyone saying they voted wrong. I believe \nthat because it is so widely supported.\n  Then we can go on with our other debates on tax cuts and other issues \nwith the surplus and how we will deal with it.\n  At this point in time, let us say we are going to take this little \nbit and invest it in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act \nand, once and for all, meet that 40-percent goal, and we will not have \nto be talking about it anymore.\n  As I said, this is a very simple and very straightforward amendment, \nbut I will admit, for the record, it is going to take 60 votes. I \nunderstand that. It will take 60 votes, but I believe if Senators will \njust think about what they have said about IDEA and fully funding it \nand think about that big surplus we have and all of the demands that \nwill be made on that surplus in the future, they just might think: Yes, \nwe ought to carve out a little bit right now and put it into IDEA. It \nwould help our States and our schools and, most of all, help our \nfamilies who have special needs children who may not have all of the \neconomic wherewithal to give their kids the best education.\n  As I understand it, this is the first vote up or down vote on fully \nfunding IDEA ever. Let's make it our last.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his support. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to commend Chairman Stevens, \nChairman Roth, and Chairman Specter for their commitment to working in \nconference to restore funding to the Social Services Block Grant (Title \nXX), the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program and for \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). These programs \nprovide a vital safety net for our most vulnerable citizens.\n  The Social Services Block Grant program provides critical services \nfor abused children, low-income seniors, and other families in need of \nassistance. For example, my own State of Vermont uses 80 percent of its \nTitle XX funds to help abused and neglected children. Much of this \nmoney goes to assist the roughly 300 children in foster care in our \nState. This block grant was created under the Reagan Administration to \nprovide States with a source of flexible funding to meet a variety of \nhuman service needs. It was the success of the Social Services Block \nGrant that paved the way for welfare reform.\n  When welfare reform was passed, Congress made several agreements with \nthe states. One such agreement was that funds for the Social Services \nBlock Grant would be reduced to $2.38 billion with States permitted to \ntransfer up to 10 percent of allocated TANF funds into the block grant \nto ``make up the difference.''\n  Since making that agreement in 1996, Congress and the Administration \nhave repeatedly cut the funds appropriated for the Block Grant to its \ncurrent year funding level of $1.775 billion. I am grateful that there \nis a strong commitment to maintain this year's funding level in \nconference. However, the reduction of the amount of TANF funds that \nStates can transfer also must be addressed. Vermont is one of several \nStates which transfer the entire 10 percent that is allowable under \nTANF. Unfortunately, even with full use of the transferability, many \nstates are no longer able to make up for the repeated reductions in \nSocial Service Block Grant funds.\n  I believe that the amount of TANF funds that States are permitted to \ntransfer should not be cut in half, as current law requires, but should \nbe increased to help mitigate the loss of Title XX funds that States \nhave experienced since the 1996 agreement. The commitment to restore \nSocial Services Block Grant funds to the current level is a good first \nstep, but we should keep in mind that it is just a first step.\n  In creating the TANF program, the Federal Government limited the \namount of welfare funds that would be provided to States in exchange \nfor giving States more flexibility in the use of those funds. The \nbooming economy combined with successful State efforts to move more \npeople from welfare to work have allowed States to reduce the costs of \nwelfare. Congress urged States to save a portion of their TANF grants \nfor the inevitable ``rainy day'' when additional funds would be needed. \nMany States did save part of their TANF allocation, and Congress has \nthreatened to reduce the TANF allocations promised to the States, \nbecause the funds have not been fully expended. I thank Senators \nStevens, Roth, and Specter for their commitment to uphold the promises \nwe made in 1996 during conference negotiations on the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill.\n  My home State of Vermont has an unparalleled track record in \nextending health insurance coverage to children and families, and the \nS-CHIP has played a key part in contributing to this success. While \nVermont has achieved its enrollment goals for this program to date, it \ncontinues to reach out to enroll eligible children. Restoration of the \nS-CHIP funding is essential for Vermont and other States in order for \nthem to continue enrolling children in this program. It is essential \nfor Congress to keep its commitment to the S-CHIP program, otherwise \nStates are not likely to continue their aggressive outreach and \nenrollment efforts and children may be left without health care.\n  I believe strongly that it is important for Congress to keep its \nagreements with the States---particularly regarding the Social Services \nBlock Grant, TANF, and S-CHIP. The success of States in implementing \nthese programs and the extent to which Congress and the administration \nmaintain promised funding levels for these critical programs will help \ndetermine the future of State block grants.\n  How can we expect States and advocates to agree to flexible block \ngrant initiatives, if Congress cannot fulfill its promise to maintain \nadequate funding?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to make a statement \nconcerning the Federally funded research that is conducted at the \nvarious Centers for Disease Control (CDC) around the country.\n  February of this year I met with the Director of the CDC, Jeffrey \nKoplan. CDC was highlighted in newspaper articles concerning the misuse \nof research funds targeted for hantavirus disease. Because of the \npresence of this disease in our state, as with other neighboring \nstates, I am very concerned at the lack of accountability from the CDC.\n  I expressed my concern for the correct utilization of funding for the \ndisease research programs that are mandated by Congress. I stressed the \nimportance of CDC's accountability and obligation to carry out the \nletter of our laws. Mr. Koplan assured me that they have taken measures \nto complete a full audit of the misdirected funds\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\nand that they will follow the intent of Congress in the future.\n  Being a member of Congress, I for one can fully understand that the \nprocess of appropriating funds for research is complicated at best. \nAlthough Congress designates specific funds for certain diseases, there \nare several levels of bureaucracy through which the dollars must pass \nbefore they are received by the appropriate agency. This still does not \naccount for an agency's lack of dedication in meeting congressional \ndirection that is law. Part of my responsibility as a U.S. Senator is \nthe oversight of various agencies and their accountability to Congress \nto carry out the language of our laws.\n  Hantavirus outbreaks have rapidly affected the U.S., reaching as far \nas Vermont. Most recently, a 12-year-old girl who lives in Loveland--my \nhometown--was diagnosed with the disease. Doctor's believe she may have \ncontracted the disease while visiting a ranch in Arizona last April. \nOnce hantavirus is contracted it can be anywhere from one week to as \nlittle as one day before symptoms appear. Once symptoms are prevalent, \nit rapidly progresses to respiratory distress as the lungs fill with \nfluid.\n  Colorado has had 23 cases of hantavirus since 1998--with three cases \nalready this year. It is time to act with no further delay by the CDC \nlaboratory.\n  I hope that the CDC has worked out it's problems and will carry out \nwhat Congress expects of an agency.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to describe why I opposed \nthe amendment offered by the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, \nto this legislation on the issue of schools and libraries blocking \nchildren's access to certain materials on the Internet, and supported \nthe alternative amendment on this topic offered by Senator Santorum.\n  The McCain amendment prohibits schools and libraries from receiving \nfederal funds under the E-Rate program if they do not install software \nto block children's access to two specific kinds of information: \nmaterials that are obscene and materials that constitute child \npornography. The Santorum amendment contains a similar prohibition on \nfunding, but gives the local community the flexibility to decide what \nmaterials are inappropriate for children's viewing and to implement a \ncomprehensive policy on minors' Internet use if they want to continue \nto receive the E-Rate. I feel that local communities, not the federal \ngovernment, should decide what materials are suitable for children's \nviewing. Wisconsin communities may want to address or restrict whether \nchildren have access to adult chat rooms even though the chat may not \nbe about child pornography or may not contain technically obscene \ntopics of conversation. They also may want to restrict whether they \npost identifying information or photographs of students on school \nsponsored web sites. I simply feel that these decisions are best made \nlocally.\n  Second, I am concerned that the McCain amendment imposes an \nadditional cost to obtain filtering software upon schools and libraries \nwithout adequate input from those institutions. The McCain amendment \nrelies upon the technical fix of filtering and imposes filtering \nsoftware on all computers in a facility. The Santorum amendment allows \na school or library to determine which computers are available for \nstudent access and then install blocking software upon those computers. \nSoftware licensing costs are not inexpensive, and requiring that \nsoftware be installed on every machine may be financially difficult for \nsmall communities.\n  Finally, though I am concerned about protecting children on the \nInternet, I am also concerned about the constitutionality of blocking \nmaterial on the Internet for adult computer users. The Santorum \namendment allows communities to develop common sense solutions to \nprotect the rights of adults to access information over the Internet in \na place like a public library. A Wisconsin community could decide, \nunder the Santorum amendment, for example, that it wanted to have a \nlocked room in its public library with computers in it that only adults \ncould use to access the Internet and not install blocking software on \nthose machines. There are ways to block children's access to computers \nthat are structural, Mr. President, like a locked door, that would \nstill protect the First Amendment right of adults. These options are \nnot available under the McCain amendment.\n  I appreciate the Senate's interest in protecting children from \ninappropriate material on the Internet, but I feel that the McCain \namendment does not go far enough to ensure that local governments, \nlibraries, schools, and individuals rights are protected.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Specter and ranking \nmember, Senator Harkin, for working with me to see that funding is \nincreased for the Perkins Loan Cancellation Program. I filed an \namendment that would have increased the level of the Perkins Loan \nCancellation Program by $30 million to $90 million. I am very \nappreciative that the committee increased funds for this valuable \nprogram by $30 million--especially given the terrible budget \nconstraints on this bill. I am especially thankful that the Managers of \nthis bill have agreed to raise the appropriation by another $15 \nmillion. This will get the government half way to where it needs to be \nto reimburse Perkins Revolving Funds for what they have lost to the \nLoan Cancellation Program. It is an important step.\n  The reason I asked for more is simple. If we give the extra $30 \nmillion, the federal government can pay back what it owes to the \nuniversities and colleges for the loans that have been canceled. This \namendment would simply fulfill its IOUs to the Perkins program. Mr. \nPresident, we have a $1.9 trillion surplus, it is ironic and probably \nan oversight that we are still in debt to America's colleges and \nuniversities that provide loans to low income students, but it is a \ndebt that I think we can and should repay. That is why I am thankful \nfor the Managers' efforts, and that is why I will continue to push for \nthe full $90 million in the future.\n  Both the cancellation program and the Perkins Loan Program are \nseriously undermined if the government does not fulfill its debt \nobligations to the universities and colleges that choose to administer \nit.\n  The Perkins Loan Program (formerly called the National Defense \nStudent Loan Program) provides long-term, low-interest (5% per year) \nloans to the poorest undergraduate and graduate students. 25 percent of \nthe loans go to students with family incomes of $18,000 or less, and \n83% of the loans go to students with family incomes of $30,000 or less. \nSince its inception, 11 million students received $15 billion in loans \nthrough the Federal Perkins Loan Program. In the academic year 1997/98, \n698,000 students received Perkins loans.\n  Perkins is exceptional because it is a public/private partnership \nthat leverages taxpayers' dollars with private sector funding. The \nyearly Federal contribution to Perkins Loans revolving funds leverages \nmore than $1 billion in student loans. This is because Perkins Loans \nare made from revolving funds, so the largest source of funding for \nPerkins Loans is from the repayment of prior-year loans.\n  The Perkins Loan Cancellation Program entitles any student who has \nreceived a Perkins loan who enters teaching, nursing and other medical \nservices, law enforcement or volunteering to cancel their loans. This \npast year, more than 45,000 low income students who chose to enter \nthese important professions were able to have their loans canceled. \nLast year, 26,000 teachers, 10,500 nurses and medical technicians, \n4,000 people who work with high-risk children and families, 4,000 law \nenforcement and 700 volunteers had their loans canceled under this \nprogram.\n  This year, thanks to the efforts of Senator Durbin and others, it \nlooks like we may be able to expand the professions eligible for \ncancellation to include public defenders.\n  The value of Perkins loans is enormous. Since 1980 to 1998, the cost \nof higher education has almost tripled, leading to a decline in the \npurchasing power of federal grant programs. The maximum Pell grant this \nyear is worth only 86% of what it was worth in 1980, making the Perkins \nprogram, and all loan programs, a more important part of low income \nstudents' financial aid packages.\n  The value of the cancellation program is also enormous. It provides \nthe lowest income people who want to\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\nenter public service a small break from the crushing debts they incur \nattending higher education. Offering loan cancellation also highlights \nthe need for well-trained people to enter public service and honors \nthose who choose to enter public service. This is the kind of incentive \nand reward we should be doing more of and I thank the Senate for \naccepting my amendment earlier that would provide Stafford loan \nforgiveness for child care workers.\n  Mr. President, I am here today because the future of both of these \nprograms is in great jeopardy because we are unable to repay the \nuniversities' revolving funds what they are owed for the cancellation \nprogram. There are colleges that receive only 47% of what they are owed \nby the government. They are given the rest on an IOU.\n  Because Perkins loans are funded through revolving loans, the people \nwho end up paying the price for this IOU are low income students who \nare eligible for Perkins loans in the future. As loans are canceled, \nand the government is unable to reimburse the revolving funds, there is \nless and less money available in the funds to generate new loans. It is \nestimated that 40,000 fewer students will be eligible for Perkins loans \nbecause of the declining money available in the revolving fund.\n  When you combine the pressure from the unfulfilled government \nobligations with recent cuts to the Perkins program in general, I \nbelieve that both these key programs are at risk. Congress has cut the \nyearly Federal contributions to the Perkins Loans revolving funds by \n$58 million since fiscal year 1997. Since 1980, the Federal \nGovernment's contributions have declined by almost 80%. 900 colleges \nand universities around the country have cut their Perkins programs at \nleast in part because they were not economically viable. In MN, \ncolleges such as Metro State University have ended this valuable \nprogram in large part because they cannot afford to keep it going.\n\n  This means one thing and one thing only. There are less and less \nloans available for the lowest income students. The $15 million the \nmanager's package will provide will go far to reverse this situation.\n  Reducing the number of loans available is not the direction we want \nto be going given what we know about the rising importance of college \neducation and the increasing need for financial aid.\n  A study from Minnesota indicates that for every $1 that is invested \nin higher education, $5.75 is returned to Minnesota's economy. A 1999 \nDepartment of Education study indicates that the real rate of return on \ninvestment in higher education is 12% based on earnings alone. This \ndoes not include savings on health care and other factors. Further, a \nrecent poll found that 91% of the American Public agree that financial \naid is an investment in America's future (Student Aid Alliance, 1999).\n  The numbers indicate that this is true. In 1998, men who had earned a \nbachelors degree earned 150% more than men who had received only a high \nschool diploma. Women earned twice as much. (NCES, ``Condition of \nEducation, 2000,'' 2000). College graduates earn on average $600,000 \nmore in their lifetime than people with only a high school diploma. (US \nDepartment of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1994.\n  Despite the obvious benefits of investments in higher education, \nfunding is declining. Since 1980 to 1998, the cost of higher education \nhas almost tripled, leading to a decline in the purchasing power of \nfederal grant programs. The maximum Pell grant this year is worth only \n86% of what it was worth in 1980, making the Perkins program a more \nimportant part of low income students' financial aid package. Yet, the \nnumbers of institutes of higher education offering the Perkins Loan \nProgram has declined by 80% over the past 20 years. During the last \ndecade, student aid funding has lagged behind inflation, yet in the \nnext ten years, more than 14 million undergraduate students will be \nenrolled in the nation's colleges and universities, an increase of 11 \npercent. One-fifth of these students are from families below the \npoverty line. Many of them are the first in their families to go to \ncollege.\n  The effect of the decline in funding has a disproportionate impact on \nlow income students--the very students that Perkins is designed to \nhelp. Studies show that an increase in tuition of $100 lowers the \nenrollment of low income students by 1%. (McPherson and Shapiro, 1998). \nIn Minnesota, students from families that make $50,000 per year or more \nare three times as likely to attend a four year college as students \nfrom families who make $30,000 per year or less (and I remind my \ncolleagues that 83% of Perkins loans would go directly to these \nstudents with incomes less than $30,000.) Further, more than 1/3 of \nstudents who enter college drop out. Often this is because they cannot \nafford to continue.\n  The Perkins Loan Program is vital to helping these low income \nstudents enter and stay in college. It would be a shame if the program \nfailed because the government failed to pay universities back the money \nit owes this valuable program. By increasing the appropriation for the \ncancellation program, the managers have taken a strong step toward \ngetting the government out of debt. I am also committed to seeing that \nthis program is fully funded in the future. We have on-budget surpluses \nof $1.9 trillion. We should use this appropriation to ensure that we \nare not in debt to the 40,000 fewer students who will not receive the \nPerkins loans they once could have because the federal government did \nnot meet its obligation to pay for its own cancellation program.\n  These are America's poorest students who are simply trying to afford \na college education. With a $1.9 trillion surplus, we owe it to them to \npay it back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6103-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, before the Senate are the appropriations \nbills which provide the funding for education, health, and training \nprograms. As I have mentioned over the past few days, I respect the \nwork by Senator Specter and Senator Harkin in trying to shape that \nproposal. We have some differences, even within the limited budget \nfigures that were allocated, in areas we feel were shortchanged. We \ntried to bring some of those matters to the floor yesterday.\n  On the issues of making sure we will reach out in the areas of \nrecruiting teachers, providing professional development for teachers, \nand mentoring for teachers, we received a majority of the Members of \nthe Senate. I believe it was 51 votes. A majority of the Members felt \nthat should be a higher priority than designated. Even in the majority \nparty, there is a clear indication, particularly against the backdrop \nof the announcements made in the past 2 days with these enormous \nsurpluses, that one of the priorities of the American people is \ninvesting the surpluses in the children of this country.\n  I think that is something that needs to be done. We are going to \nproceed during the course of this day on amendments which I think are \nvery important. The next one, which will be offered by Senator Daschle \nto deal with issues of genetic discrimination and employment \ndiscrimination, is very important. We will go on, as has been agreed to \nby the leaders.\n  But as we are going through this debate, I cannot remain silent on \nthe allocating of resources. We are hopeful, as a result of the action \nof the President of the United States, there will be a different form \nand shape of this appropriations bill by the time it comes back from \nthe conference, or by the time it is actually enacted in the fall. We \nare not giving the priorities in the areas of education, and I must say \neven in the health area, that I think the American people want and \ndeserve. The principal reason for that is there is an assumption within \nthe Republican leadership that there will be a tax break of some $792 \nbillion. So if you are going to write that into the budget, or parts of \nthat into the budget, you are\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\ngoing to squeeze other programs. That is really what has happened.\n  I daresay that at a time when we are gaining increased awareness and \nunderstanding about what actually helps children expand their academic \nachievement and their accomplishments, as a result of some dramatic \nreports, which I find compelling--and actually self-evident--we find we \nare really not taking the benefits of those reports and using them in \nways that can benefit the greatest number of children in this country.\n  I think again of the excellent presentations of the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray, when she spoke time and time again about the \nimportance of smaller class sizes. She referred again and again to the \nexcellent studies done in Tennessee with thousands of children, going \nback to 1985, that resulted in smaller class sizes, and we find that \nchildren have made very significant progress.\n  I remember Senator Murray mentioning the SAGE Program in Wisconsin, \nwhich has been enacted in recent years. I myself met these past weeks \nwith members of the school board, parents and teachers out in Warsaw, \nWI, who participated in that program and commented about the importance \nof investing in children with smaller class sizes. So we know this is \nsomething that works. If we are going to have scarce resources, we \nought to give focus and attention to something that works, as Senator \nMurray has pointed out. I think she brings credibility to this issue \nbecause she is a former school board member and a former first grade \nteacher herself. She has been in the classroom and knows what works. We \nhave been very fortunate to have her presentation on this issue and her \nenthusiasm for it.\n  We also know, looking over the recent history, that we have actually \nhad bipartisan support for smaller class sizes. We saw yesterday her \namendment was not successful, but it was very closely fought in a \ndivided Senate, and I am hopeful, with the strong support of the \nSenate, we can finally persuade Congress, as we have in the past, to \nmove ahead in that direction.\n  We have to understand this legislation is going to go to the House of \nRepresentatives, which has seen a very sizable reduction in its \ncommitment to the funding of these various programs. Whatever we do \nhere is going to be knocked back significantly. That is why many of us \nwere very hopeful we could go ahead and add some additional resources \nso at least coming out of the conference we would have something worthy \nof the children of this country. But we have been unable to do that. We \nhave to look back over the years and see what has happened, ultimately, \nin allocating funding resources in the area of education when have had \nRepublican leadership. We hear a great deal about the importance of \ninvesting in children, but the tragic fact is that it is not reflected \nin the requests by the Republicans either in the House or the Senate in \nrecent years.\n  I remember very clearly the 1995 rescission because I remember the \ndebate in 1994, when we had a rather significant enhancement in our \ninvestment in children. The ink was hardly dry, the results were in, \nand the results of 1994 and 1995 were that we had a very vigorous \ndebate on rescinding money that had already been appropriated and \nsigned by the President. After the extraordinary efforts made by the \nRepublican leadership to actually rescind those funds, we had those \nrescissions in 1995.\n  Then the House bill in 1996 was $3.9 billion below what was actually \nenacted in 1995. Then in 1997, the Senate bill was $3.1 billion below \nthe President's request; the House and Senate bill in 1998 was also \nbelow the President's request. This was a time when the Republicans \nwere trying to abolish the Department of Education.\n  I think most parents feel it is important to have a Cabinet Member \nsitting in the Cabinet room so that every time the President of the \nUnited States meets with the Cabinet to make decisions on priorities, \nthere will be someone in there to say, ``What are we going to do on \neducation, and particularly education that is going to affect the \nelementary and secondary schoolchildren of this country, particularly \nat a time when we have exploding numbers of children who are going into \nour classrooms?''\n  Nonetheless, what we continue to see, in 1999, is the House was $2 \nbillion below the President's request; in 2000, $2.8 billion below the \nPresident's request; and in 2001, $2.9 billion below the President's \nrequest. This is what has happened.\n  Members ask: ``Why do the Democrats try to force these issues? Why \ndon't we just go ahead and accept what these appropriations committees \nhave done?'' They try to defend their positions with all these facts \nabout what is really happening out there in education, but when you add \nthem all up, this is what you are finding: The Federal share of \neducation funding has declined. If you look at higher education, from \n1980 to 1999, the federal share declined from 15.4 percent to 10.7 \npercent.\n  If you look at elementary-secondary education, from 1980 to 1999, we \nsee a decline from 11.9 percent to 7.7 percent. Only 7.7 percent of \nevery dollar spent locally is Federal money, and this is perhaps the \nlowest figure we have had in elementary-secondary education. In terms \nof the amount of our budget, which is $1.8 trillion, this is less than \none percent. It is less than one penny per dollar. If you combine the \nelementary and higher education, you may be getting close to two \npennies. That, I think, is what concerns many of us, particularly at a \ntime when we are finding out the total number of children is \nincreasing.\n  We recognize there should be a partnership among the Federal, State, \nand local governments in enhancing academic achievement. We have \nlearned important lessons: Smaller class sizes work and better trained \nteachers work. Take the two States that have invested in teachers: \nNorth Carolina and Connecticut. They are seeing dramatic results in \nacademic achievement.\n  We have been fighting to provide the resources to do that. That is \nwhat the debate is about. We have, I think, demonstrated to this body \nand, hopefully, the American people the seriousness of our purpose in \nallocating resources to what the American families want, and they want \nto invest in children and education. We believe that is quite \npreferable to the large tax breaks which have been included in the \noverall budget. We will continue this battle.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6104-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6104-S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE RURAL RECOVERY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Rural Recovery \nAct of 2000 to help address the economic malaise that has gripped \ncertain rural areas of our country. The legislation will authorize the \nDepartment of Agriculture to provide grants to rural communities \nsuffering from out-migration and low per-capita income.\n  Rural areas of our nation continue to experience an erosion in their \neconomic well-being. Statistics bear out the decline in rural economic \nactivity, but they fail to fully capture the human suffering that lies \njust beyond the numbers. Economic downturns lead to the migration away \nfrom farm-dependent, rural communities, further stifling economic \nopportunities for those left behind. The 1990 Census highlighted these \nmigratory trends, and I anticipate that similar trends will be captured \nby the 2000 Census, as well.\n  In short, the prosperity from which many Americans have benefited \nfrom during the past decade has left many rural areas standing by the \nwayside. If this trend continues, more and more young people will be \nforced to leave the towns they grew up in for opportunities in urban \nareas. In towns like Webster, Eureka, and Martin, South Dakota, we are \nseeing farm families broken up, populations decline, and main street \nbusinesses close their doors. While there is no doubt that economic \ngrowth in our urban areas has benefited our nation, the disparity of \neconomic development between our rural and urban areas cannot be \nignored. If nothing is done to address the economic challenges facing \nthese areas, we will jeopardize the future of rural America.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation to provide the nation's \nrural areas with the resources necessary to make critical investments \nin their future and, by doing so, to create economic opportunities that \nwill help them sustain a valuable and important way of life. It also \nwill help rural areas provide basic services at times when they are \nlosing a significant part of\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\ntheir tax base. While federal agencies, such as the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture's Office of Rural Development and the \nEconomic Development Administration, provide assistance for rural \ndevelopment purposes, there are no federal programs that provide a \nsteady source of funding for rural areas most affected by severe out-\nmigration and low per-capita income. For these areas, the process of \neconomic development is often most arduous. This legislation will \nprovide the basic, long-term assistance necessary to aid the \ncoordination efforts of local community leaders as they begin economic \nrecovery efforts and struggle to provide basic public services.\n  County and tribal governments will be able to use this federal \nfunding to improve their industrial parks, purchase land for \ndevelopment, build affordable housing and create economic recovery \nstrategies according to their needs. All of these important steps will \nhelp rural communities address their economic problems and plan for \nlong-term growth and development.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation holds great potential for \nrevitalizing many of our nation's most neglected and vulnerable areas. \nI urge my colleagues to support its enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6105-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING SENATOR DANIEL INOUYE: RECIPIENT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL \n                             MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join my fellow Senators \nin honoring Senator Daniel Inouye with the Congressional Medal of \nHonor. This man is a representative of our nation who has persevered \nthrough war, debate, and many had fought campaigns. I have had the \npleasure of working with Senator Inouye and applaud my colleagues for \nbestowing this great honor upon him.\n  Senator Daniel Inouye is a Veteran of World War II and was a captain \nin the Army with a Distinguished Service Cross (the second highest \naward for military valor), a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart with cluster, \nand several other medals and citations. Serving in the Senate almost 40 \nyears, Senator Inouye is also the first Congressman from the state of \nHawaii. His courage in combat is a testament to the Senator's true \ncommitment to his country and to freedom. Serving on the Defense \nAppropriations Committee, I know how much Senator Inouye cares about \nthe protection of our country and his professionalism and dedication to \nfinding a balance for defensive spending. His diligence and dedication \nspeak for themselves and I am proud to serve our Armed Forces with a \nman of this caliber near the helm.\n  I have also had the pleasure of working with Senator Inouye on the \nIndian Affairs Committee for over 20 years and know first hand that his \nbravery did not cease on the battlefield, but still continues today. \nWhen he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator \nInouye was highly regarded among tribal leaders for his efforts to re-\nestablish their sovereignty over their own people and their own \naffairs. Tribal leaders consider Senator Inouye to be a true leader and \nfriend to the Indian people to this day. I thank Senator Inouye for his \nleadership and dedication to service to our country, and I thank him \nfor his friendship and example.\n  Mr. President, inscribed on the medal is the word ``Valor.'' Senator \nInouye is one of the most valiant men I know. I praise the Members of \nCongress for honoring him and hope that our young people may see that \nit takes courage, bravery, and valor to enjoy the freedom which so many \nmen like Senator Inouye fought to protect. Thank you, once again, to \nSenator Inouye for your example, and thank you to all of the veterans \nwho have served to protect liberty and justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6105-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, this statement is part of my continuing \neffort to bring clarity to the facts underlying the oversight \ninvestigations on campaign finance being pursued by Senator Specter \nwithin the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. \nStaying focused on the facts becomes even more important as the volume \nof the political rhetoric continues to increase.\n  Although oversight is an important function, there are obvious \ndangers of conducting oversight of pending matters. Applying, or \nseeming to apply, political pressure to pending matters has real \nconsequences, which we are now seeing first-hand. Recently, the \nJudiciary Committee received requests for information from the defense \nattorney for Wen Ho Lee, a criminal defendant facing charges of \nimproperly downloading classified information from computers at Los \nAlamos Nuclear Laboratory. Mr. Lee's defense attorney wants the \nRepublican report on this matter, as well as other documents gathered \nduring oversight, presumably to aid his defense or at least to get \npotential impeachment materials for prospective government witnesses.\n  Just today we learned that the Committee has now also been dragged \ninto the pending case of Maria Hsia, a criminal defendant who was \nrecently convicted of campaign finance violations and is awaiting \nsentencing. Ms. Hsia's attorney apparently found the questioning of the \nJustice Department prosecutor in charge of her case at last week's \nhearing so offensive that it is now the basis for a claim that Ms. \nHsia's sentencing should be delayed because to set a sentencing date \nnow would only serve political purposes.\n  Indeed, at a hearing of the Specter investigation on June 21, 2000, a \nRepublican member of the Judiciary Committee queried Robert Conrad, the \ncurrent head of the Justice Department Campaign Financing Task Force \nabout the Hsia sentencing, despite Conrad's statements that he could \nnot properly discuss pending matters. The Republican member stated that \nhe expected Conrad to pursue Hsia's sentencing vigorously, and asked \nwhether the government had filed a sentencing memorandum. After Conrad \nexplained that the sentencing submissions had not yet been made, the \nRepublican member stated: ``I would expect that you would pursue \nvigorously the sentencing phase\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\nof that case and that you personally would oversee it . . . I have seen \nsome cases previously involving these very matters in which I believe \nthe Department of Justice was not sufficiently aggressive toward \nsentencing.'' He then expounded his view that the ``only way'' a person \nconvicted at trial could get a downward departure at sentencing is to \ncooperate fully and stated ``I would expect that you would treat this \nlike any other case, that unless the defendant was prepared to testify \nfully and completely and provide information that you can verify, \nthat you would not accept a recommendation of any downward departure.'' \nThese comments clearly conveyed the Republican member's view that Maria \nHsia should be treated harshly at sentencing,\n\n  The Specter investigation has broken long-standing precedent and \nroutinely demanded documents and testimony involving ongoing criminal \nmatters. I have warned repeatedly that such interference risks that \nprosecutions may be compromised, more work will be generated for \nprosecutors, and political agendas will appear to take precedence over \neffective and fair law enforcement. Nevertheless, at Senator Specter's \nrequest, the majority on the Judiciary Committee has approved subpoenas \nin a number of ongoing criminal cases, including Wen Ho Lee, Peter Lee, \nwho remains on probation and under court supervision, multiple campaign \nfinance cases and investigations, and the Loral/Hughes matter.\n  With respect to the Loral/Hughes matter, the Judiciary Committee \napproved issuance of a subpoena on May 11, 2000, to the Justice \nDepartment for ``any and all'' Loral and Hughes documents, over the \nobjection of Wilma Lewis, the United States Attorney in D.C., which is \nconducting the investigation. Ms. Lewis explained that the United \nStates Attorney's Office has ``an open active investigation'' into \nallegations of the unlicensed export of defense services and that \nthousands of documents in the possession of her office could be \nresponsive to the pending requests from this Committee. Ms. Lewis \nexplained that her office is at an ``important point'' in the \ninvestigation and will be making ``critical prosecutorial decisions and \nrecommendations'' in the near future. She noted that if this Committee \nwere to subpoena responsive documents from her office, not only would \nwe adversely affect the investigation from a litigation standpoint, we \nalso would be diverting the attention of the key prosecutors in that \ncase. Instead of working diligently to conclude their investigation, \nthese prosecutors would now be required to sift through thousands of \ndocuments and to redact those documents to protect grand jury material. \nThe majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee refused to honor the \nU.S. Attorney's request and approved the subpoena.\n  The subject of the Vice President's attendance at coffees was the \nfocus of inquiry at the Judiciary Committee's recent hearing with the \nAttorney General this week. In summary, the Vice President indicated in \nresponse to general questions during an interview with Justice \nDepartment prosecutors on April 18, 2000, that he had no concrete \nrecollection of attending the coffees though may have attended one \nbriefly. He fully acknowledged the fact that coffees took place and \nexplained his understanding of their purpose.\n  Two days after the interview, on April 20th, the Vice President's \nattorney, James Neal, sent a letter to Conrad clarifying the Vice \nPresident's recollection since he had not been advised before the \ninterview that this subject matter would come up. Neal explained that \nthe Vice President ``understood your questions about Coffees to concern \nthe Coffees hosted by the President in the White House.'' Based upon a \nrecord review, the Vice President ``was designated to attend four White \nHouse Coffees. The Vice President hosted approximately twenty-one \nCoffees in the Old Executive Office Building. He did not understand \nyour questions to include the OEOB Coffees.'' Indeed, Conrad refers \nrepeatedly in his questions on this subject to ``White House coffees'' \nor ``White House hosted . . . coffees''.\n  There is absolutely nothing unusual about witnesses in depositions or \neven in testimony at Congressional hearings supplementing or clarifying \nthe record after the completion of their testimony. In fact, this \ncommon practice is embodied in Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, which grants deponent thirty days after the transcript is \navailable to review the transcript and recite any changes in the \ntestimony given. The same rules apply to depositions taken in criminal \nmatters, under Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n  At the June 27th Judiciary Committee hearing, one Republican member \nasserted that ``there is a question of the coffees,'' without \nidentifying the question. To the extent this implies that there is \nsomething wrong with clarifying a record with a letter shortly after \nproviding testimony, this can be summed up as just more partisan haze.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6106-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6106-S6107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GUN TRAFFICKING REPORT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms (ATF) released a new report about the illegal firearms \nmarket. The ATF's report documents 1,530 criminal investigations \ninvolving firearms traffickers for the time period between July 1996 \nand December 1998. These trafficking investigations led to the recovery \nof more than 84,000 illegal firearms and the prosecution of more than \n1,700 defendants.\n  The ATF report provides significant insight in to the gun trafficking \ntrade. The investigation reveals that too many loopholes in our \nnational framework for firearms distribution permits traffickers to \ndivert legal guns to the illegal marketplace. The vulnerabilities in \nour law, identified by the ATF, are a result of corrupt federal \nfirearms licensees, who were associated with only 10 percent of the \ninvestigations in the report but accounted for nearly half of the \nfirearms involved, a staggering 40,000 guns; gun shows, which supplied \nchannels for 26,000 guns, the second highest number of illegally \ntrafficked firearms in the investigation; straw purchasers, who bought \nand transferred firearms to unlicensed sellers or prohibited users; \nunlicensed sellers, who were not required to conduct Brady background \nchecks or maintain records of their sales; and firearms theft.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer afford to ignore the deficiencies in \nour federal firearm laws. Gun trafficking gives criminal users and \nyoung people access to tens of thousands of illegal guns. If Congress \nwants to reduce firearm trafficking, then first and foremost, we must \nclose the gun show loophole. Secretary Lawrence Summers, who oversees \nthe ATF explained ``This report . . . shows that we must do more to \nclose every trafficking channel, starting with closing the gun show \nloophole . . .'' Furthermore, we must increase criminal penalties for \ntraffickers and crack down on corrupt federal firearms licensees, straw \npurchasers, and unlicensed sellers. I urge Congress to pay attention to \nthis report and pass sensible gun measures that will end the deadly \nflow of firearms to the illegal marketplace.\n  I request an article be printed in the Record entitled ``The \nBiography of a Gun,'' which explains how a single gun makes the \ntransition from legal to illegal commerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 9, 2000]\n\n                   The Nation--The Biography of a Gun\n\n                  (By Jayson Blair and Sarah Weissman)\n\n       In America, more than 200,000 guns are traced by law \n     enforcement each year. This is the story of one of those \n     weapons--named after its serial number--No. 997126, a 12-\n     shot, 9 millimeter Jennings semi-automatic.\n       The gun, made mostly of plastic, was manufactured in 1995, \n     at a factory near John Wayne International Airport in Costa \n     Mesa, Calif. It is now wrapped in plastic, locked in a police \n     property clerk's office near the New York State Supreme Court \n     building in downtown Brooklyn. In between, the gun is \n     believed to have been used in at least 13 crimes--including \n     the murder of 2 people and the wounding of at least 3 others \n     in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.\n       The dead were a 16-year-old boy who was sitting on top of a \n     mailbox and a 48-year-old shopkeeper who was the father of 4 \n     children. The injured were a man who got in the way during a \n     robbery, a Jehovah's Witness from Chicago who had moved to \n     Brooklyn to do volunteer work, and a rookie New York City \n     police officer.\n       In New York, about 6 in 10 murder victims are killed with \n     firearms.\n       No. 997126 is 6 inches long and weighs 16 ounces. It was \n     made at the Bryco Arms plant, where more than 200,000 \n     inexpensive handguns are manufactured each year.\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\n       Byrco is owned by Janice Jennings, the former daughter-in-\n     law of George Jennings, who founded the first in what became \n     a cluster of Southern California gun manufacturers known \n     collectively as the Ring of Fire.\n       From Byrco, the gun was shipped to B.L. Jennings, Inc., a \n     Carson City, Nev., distributor owned by George Jennings's son \n     and Janice's ex-husband, Bruce. No. 997126 was bought by Acua \n     Sport Corporation, a federally licensed wholesaler in \n     Bellefontaine, Ohio. Acua sold it, for about $90, to Classic \n     Pawn and Jewelry, Inc. in Chickamauga, Ga.\n       In August 1998, Classic resold the gun to a Georgia woman \n     for about $150. Investigators believe that the woman was \n     buying the 9 millimeter gun as a straw purchaser on behalf of \n     Charles Chapman. He was prohibited by federal law, because of \n     a previous felony conviction, from purchasing firearms. \n     Investigators say they believe Mr. Chapman drove the firearm \n     to New York, where it was sold to a member of the Bloods \n     gang. And that is how, investigators say, the gun got to \n     Demeris Tolbert.\n       The police say No. 997126 was recovered when Mr. Tolbert \n     was arrested on the roof of the Howard Houses after the \n     shooting of a New York police officer, Tanagiot Benekos, who \n     was looking for suspects in the killing of a pawnbroker \n     earlier that afternoon.\n       Mr. Tolbert had been paroled the previous January after \n     serving three years of a nine year sentence for drug \n     possession. Prosecutors say that after the New York City \n     Police Department's ballistics laboratory linked the gun to \n     slugs recovered from the earlier shootings, Mr. Tolbert, 32, \n     of Brownville confessed.\n       Investigators say he also took responsibility for a 1990 \n     shooting of a clerk at an East New York bodega, the 1991 \n     killing of a Crown Heights security guard, four other \n     shootings and an attempted murder.\n       The Brooklyn District Attorney's office has charged him \n     with murder, attempted murder and attempted murder of a \n     police officer.\n       The ballistic information and serial number were matched \n     against a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms database, \n     which prompted a federal gun-smuggling investigation. Special \n     Agent Edgar A. Domenech, who oversees the bureau's New York \n     and New Jersey division, said the A.T.F. traced the weapon \n     and 30 others to Charles Chapman. He is being held, along \n     with alleged accomplices, on charges of gun trafficking and \n     conspiracy to illegally purchase firearms and transport them \n     for sale to criminals in New York, where more stringent laws \n     bar the sort of wholesale purchases permitted in Georgia.\n       Howard Safir, the New York City police commissioner, has \n     proposed tighter, uniform national licensing regulations, and \n     the annual registration of firearms to hold owners \n     accountable for the illegal sales of weapons they purchase.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6107-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6107-S6108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wanted to draw the attention of the \nSenate to an important funding issue that is pending in the Senate \nversion of the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill. The funding level for \nSocial Security administrative expenses doesn't receive much attention, \nbut it is critical to the effective delivery of Social Security \nbenefits to those who are entitled to them.\n  Social Security administrative expenses are actually partially funded \nfrom the Social Security trust funds, and they ensure that the programs \nadministered by the Social Security Administration are delivered to the \nAmerican public in an efficient, timely, and professional manner. In \naddition, SSA maintains records of the yearly earnings of over 140 \nmillion U.S. workers and provides them with annual estimates of their \nfuture benefits. The agency will also administer the Ticket to Work \nProgram, and the administrative workload associated with the Retirement \nEarnings Test.\n  I am concerned that the level of funding contained in the Labor/HHS \nAppropriations bill is not sufficient, and does not recognize the \nadministrative challenges Social Security will be facing in the near \nfuture. Last year the Social Security Administration provided service \nto 48 million people. In 2010 SSA will be providing services to 62 \nmillion people, due to the retirement of many baby boomers. During this \nsame period, the SSA will lose nearly half of its staff to retirement, \nincluding many individuals who staff the offices located in our states \nand who work directly with the public.\n  In North Dakota, there have been large staff reductions in some of my \nstate's main SSA offices. These shortages have affected timely \ncompletion of continuing disability reviews, and service delivery has \nbeen difficult to maintain for those who live in rural areas.\n  The Social Security Advisory Board--a bipartisan Congressionally \nmandated Board--recently issued a report on ``How the Social Security \nAdministration Can Improve Its Service to the Public,'' which stated \nthat ``there is a serious administrative deficit now in that there is a \nsignificant gap between the level of services the public needs and that \nwhich the agency is providing. Moreover, this gap could grow to far \nlarger proportions in the long term if it is not adequately \naddressed.''\n  The Senate Labor/HHS bill includes a funding level that is $123 \nmillion below the President's request. I hope that as the \nappropriations process moves forward, the Congress will work to ensure \nan adequate level of funding for SSA administrative expenses.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate National Dairy \nMonth, and the wonderful history of our nation's dairy industry. During \nJune Dairy Month we in Wisconsin take a special opportunity to \ncelebrate Wisconsin dairy's proud tradition and heritage of quality. \nThis month provides an opportunity for all Wisconsinites--both those on \nand off the farm--a special time to reflect on the historical \nimportance, and future of America's dairy industry.\n  This month is especially important to my home state of Wisconsin, \nAmerica's Dairyland. What many of my colleagues may not know is that \nWisconsin became a leader in the dairy industry well before the 1930's \nwhen it was officially nicknamed America's Dairyland. It was soon after \nthe first dairy cow came to Wisconsin in the 1800's that we began to \ntake the dairy industry by storm.\n  In fact, before Wisconsin was even a state, Ms. Anne Pickett \nestablished Wisconsin's first cheese factory when she combined milk \nfrom her cows with milk from her neighbor's cows and made it into \ncheese.\n  Over the past month, Wisconsinites have recognized this proud \ntradition by holding over 100 dairy celebrations across our state, \nincluding dairy breakfasts, ice cream socials, cooking demonstrations, \nfestivals and other events.\n  These functions help to reinforce the consumer's awareness of the \nquality variety and great taste of Wisconsin's dairy products and to \nhonor the producers who make it possible.\n  Unfortunately, the picture for producers has not been that bright. \nDairy prices for this year's National Dairy Month, along with most of \nthe first half of this year, have reached all times lows.\n  Low milk prices--the lowest since 1978--are wreaking havoc on \nWisconsin's rural communities. In addition to these low prices, dairy \nfarmers are also facing month to month price fluctuations of up to 40 \npercent.\n  What is so troublesome is that farmers are experiencing these low \nprices while the retail price continues to increase. In fact, thanks to \na 20 percent jump last year in the retail price, the farm retail price \nspread for dairy products has more than doubled since the early 1980s.\n  Because of this concern, earlier this year, Senator Leahy and I asked \nthe General Accounting Office to conduct a thorough investigation into \nthe increasing disparity between the prices dairy farmers receive for \ntheir milk, and the price retail stores charge for milk.\n  In the study, GAO will focus its attention on the impact of market \nconcentration in the retail, milk processing, procurement and handling \nindustries and describe the potential risks of any such concentration \nfor dairy farmers and federal nutrition programs.\n  Specifically, we asked the GAO to identify the factors that are \ndepressing the price farmers receive for their milk, and why this trend \nhas persisted while retail prices continue to rise. After all, this \ntrend defies economic expectations, and frustrates the aspirations of \nhardworking farmers, with no apparent benefit to consumers.\n  During June Dairy Month, the dairy industry also called for mandatory \nprice reporting for manufactured products. In early June, the sudden \ndiscovery of 24 million pounds of butter shined the spotlight on the \nneed for an effective reporting system for storable dairy products .\n  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which tracks domestic butter \nstocks, discovered a new warehouse\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\nthat hadn't been reporting its butter inventory. When this huge \nquantity of butter was finally reported, prices went down sharply, and \nso did the dairy industry's faith in the reporting system for storable \ndairy products.\n  Wall Street would never put up with this kind of reporting errors in \nits markets, and neither should the agriculture industry.\n  Regardless of where the dairy industry chooses to get its \ninformation, through the National Agricultural Statistics Service or \nthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, that information must be accurate. \nThese costly mistakes happen because the current reporting system is \nvoluntary, leaving room for serious errors.\n  To address this growing concern, Senator Craig and I introduced the \nDairy Market Enhancement Act of 2000, which takes the next step toward \nfair and accurate reporting. It would mandate reporting by dairy \nproduct manufacturing plants, would subject that reporting to \nindependent verification, and would require the USDA to ensure \ncompliance with the mandatory reporting and verification requirements.\n  Our bill also would direct the Commodities Futures Trading Commission \nto conduct a study on the reporting practices at the CME and report its \nfindings to Congress.\n  We must also ensure that America's dairy farmers are put on a level \nplaying field in the world economy. As I travel to each county in \nWisconsin, I hear a growing concern over efforts to change the natural \ncheese standard to allow dry ultra-filtered milk in natural cheese.\n  Our dairy farmers have invested heavily in processes that make the \nbest quality cheese ingredients, and I am concerned about recent \nefforts to change the law that would penalize them for those efforts by \nallowing lower quality ingredients to flood the U.S. market.\n  Senator Jeffords and I introduced the Quality Cheese Act of 2000 to \nrespond to the call of our nation's dairy farmers.\n  Our legislation would disallow the use of so called ``dry'' ultra-\nfiltered milk--milk protein concentrate and casein--in natural cheese \nproducts, and require USDA to consider the impact on the producer \nbefore any other changes may be made to the natural cheese standard.\n  I recognize that these efforts are only a step in the right \ndirection.\n  In addition to addressing the increased market concentration, \nenacting mandatary price reporting, and protecting the natural cheese \nstandard, Congress must also provide America's dairy farmers with a \nfair and truly national dairy policy and one that puts them all on a \nlevel playing field, from coast to coast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6108-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6108-S6109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TESTIMONY BY THE SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this week the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration held an oversight hearing on the Smithsonian Institution \nand received testimony from the new Secretary, Lawrence M. Small. \nAlthough he has only served in this capacity for a short 6 months, it \nis already clear that Secretary Small's vision for the Smithsonian will \nhave a lasting impact on this uniquely American institution.\n  Secretary Small envisions the Smithsonian as ``. . . the most \nextensive provider, anywhere in the world, of authoritative experiences \nthat connect the American people to their history and to their cultural \nand scientific heritage.'' In other words, the Smithsonian documents \nwho and what we are as Americans. And not surprisingly, over 90 percent \nof all visitors to the Smithsonian come from the United States.\n  Who are these visitors and what makes the Smithsonian such a draw? \nThey are families who come to see the relics of our history, such as \nthe Wright brothers' flyer or the Star Spangled Banner which moved \nFrancis Scott Key to pen our national anthem. They are school children \nwho are learning about the ancient inhabitants of this land, whether \ndinosaurs or insects. They are young parents retracing the pilgrimage \nto our nation's Capitol that they made as children. They are new \nimmigrants and Americans of all ages who come to see the treasures that \nare housed in America's attic.\n  There are nearly 141 million objects in the Smithsonian's \ncollections, fewer than 2 million of which can be displayed at any \ngiven time in the 16 museums that make up the Smithsonian. On average, \nthere are nearly 39 million visitors a year to the Smithsonian's \nmuseums and the national zoo. The fact is, 3 of the most visited \nmuseums in the world are right here on the mall.\n  They are the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, the Natural History \nMuseum and the Museum of American History. And yet even with those \namazing numbers, Secretary Small advised the Rules Committee this week \nthat he believes the Smithsonian can do even better in making the \nSmithsonian accessible to the public, both in terms of the quality and \nquantity of the exhibits and the condition of the physical space.\n  But all of this popularity comes at a price, and that price is the \nphysical wear and tear on the Smithsonian's buildings and exhibits. The \nbuildings of the Smithsonian are in and of themselves historic \nmonuments and landmarks within our nation's capital. The Smithsonian \nCastle, a fixture on the mall since the cornerstone was laid in 1847, \nreceives nearly 2 million visitors a year, even though it houses no \nmuseum.\n  The oldest building, the Patent Office Building, houses the National \nPortrait Gallery and the National Museum of American Art. Construction \nof this Washington landmark was begun in 1836 and was the third great \npublic building constructed in Washington, following the Capitol and \nThe White House.\n  The National Museum of Natural History, home to the Hope Diamond and \nthe Smithsonian elephant, opened its doors in 1910. This year, nearly \n1.3 million visitors toured this museum in the month of April alone. \nThe popularity of these grand and historic buildings is taking its \ntoll, and they are quite simply in need of significant renovation and \nrepair.\n  Secretary Small is committed to preserving not only the aging \nbuildings of the Smithsonian, but to upgrading the exhibits as well to \nensure that they provide a continuing educational experience. He is in \nthe process of developing a 10-year plan to facilitate the necessary \nrestorations and renovation.\n  These buildings are part of the historic fabric of this capital city, \nand it would be very short-sighted of Congress not to provide for their \nadequate maintenance and repair. I commend Secretary Small for his \nvision in this regard and believe that Congress should act on his \nrecommendations when they are received. An op-ed piece by Secretary \nSmall appeared in Monday's Washington Post in which he described his \nvision of the Smithsonian and the need to preserve these historic \nlandmarks.\n  I urge my colleagues to acquaint themselves with the needs of this \ngreat American institution as it faces the opportunities and challenges \nof the 21st century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article by Secretary Small be \nincluded in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 26, 2000]\n\n                  America's Icons Deserve a Good Home\n\n                         (By Lawrence M. Small)\n\n       A recent report from the General Accounting Office \n     identified 903 federal buildings around the country that are \n     in need of some $4 billion in repairs and renovations. The \n     buildings are feeling the effects of age. It's a feeling we \n     know all too well at the Smithsonian.\n       Construction on the Patent Office Building, the \n     Smithsonian's oldest, began in 1836. The cornerstone of the \n     original Smithsonian Castle on the National Mall was laid in \n     1847; the National Museum building adjacent to it was \n     completed in 1881, and the National Museum of Natural History \n     opened in 1910.\n       The age of these four buildings would be reason enough for \n     concern, but there's a significant additional stress on them. \n     The Smithsonian's museum buildings are open to the world. \n     They exist to be visited and to be used--and they've been \n     spectacularly successful at attracting the public.\n       Attendance in recent months at the Natural History Museum \n     has made it the most-visited museum in the world, a title \n     held previously by our National Air and Space Museum. In the \n     years ahead, the Smithsonian will be working to open its \n     doors wider still\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\n     and to attract even more visitors. So, what time doesn't do \n     to our buildings, popularity will--and thank goodness for \n     that.\n       More than 90 percent of Smithsonian visitors are Americans, \n     many traveling great distances on a pilgrimage to the \n     nation's secular shrines--the Capitol, the White House, the \n     Library of Congress, the many memorials to brave Americans. \n     The history of the nation is built into such structures. \n     They're the physical manifestation of our shared sense of \n     national identity.\n       Smithsonian Institution buildings belong in the company of \n     those other monuments, because the Smithsonian is the center \n     of our cultural heritage--the repository of the creativity, \n     the courage, the aspirations and the ingenuity of the \n     American people. Its collections hold a vast portion of the \n     material record of democratic America.\n       The most sophisticated virtual representation on a screen \n     cannot match the experience of standing just a few feet from \n     the star-spangled banner, or the lap-top desk on which Thomas \n     Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, or the hat \n     Lincoln wore the night he was shot, or the Wright brothers' \n     Flyer and the Spirit of St. Louis. All those icons of \n     America's history, and countless others of comparable \n     significance, are at the Smithsonian.\n       And yet the experience of viewing them is compromised by \n     the physical deterioration of the Smithsonian's buildings, \n     which are becoming unworthy of the treasures they contain. \n     The family on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Washington and the \n     Smithsonian should not have to make allowances--to overlook \n     peeling paint, leak-stained ceilings and ill-lit exhibition \n     spaces.\n       We can try to hide the problems behind curtains and plastic \n     sheeting. But the reality cannot be concealed: The buildings \n     are too shabby. In the nation's museum--to which Americans \n     have contributed more than 12 billion of their tax dollars \n     over the years--this embarrassment is not acceptable. It's no \n     way to represent America.\n       The Smithsonian has hesitated in the past to put before \n     Congress the full scale of its repair and renovation needs. \n     It has tried instead to make do. But it will be undone by \n     making do, and the American people will be the losers.\n       So we intend to face the problem and to transform the \n     physical environment of the Smithsonian during the coming \n     decade. The United States is in a period of immense public \n     and private prosperity, and we should take every opportunity \n     to turn that wealth to the long-term well-being and \n     enhancement of the nation. Restoring the museums of the \n     Smithsonian to a condition that befits the high place of our \n     nation in the world will be a splendid legacy from this \n     generation to future generations of Americans.\n       In January the nation will swear in the new century's first \n     Congress and inaugurate its first president. They must be \n     committed to preserving the nation's heritage. At the same \n     time, we as private citizens must do our part to meet this \n     critical need.\n       Americans should not have to wonder why their treasures are \n     housed in buildings that seem to be falling apart. Instead \n     they should marvel at the grandeur of the spaces and at the \n     objects that are the icons of our history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6109-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHINA PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few moments \ntalking about the issue of PNTR, Permanent Normal Trade Relations, with \nChina. Last month, the House passed H.R. 4444. That bill authorizes \nPNTR for China once the multilateral protocol negotiations are \ncompleted and the WTO General Council approves China's accession. The \nbill includes a solid package of provisions that establishes a \nframework for monitoring progress and developments in China in the \nhuman rights area. It also provides for enhanced monitoring of China's \ncompliance with its trade commitments.\n  Now, it is our turn in the Senate to act. We have two challenges. \nFirst, we need to debate the bill now, not later. And, second, we need \nto pass the bill without amendment. I call on the Majority Leader to \nset a date certain in July to start this process.\n  Extending permanent normal trade relations status to China. \nRegularizing our economic and trade relationship with China. Bringing \nChina into the global trade community. Helping the development of a \nmiddle class in China. Developing an environment between our two \ncountries where we can productively engage China in significant \nsecurity, regional, and global discussions. These are not Democratic \nissues. These are not Republican issues. These are national issues. \nPassage of PNTR is a first step, and it is critical to America's \nnational economic and security interests.\n  Support in the Senate is strong. I believe there will be an \noverwhelming vote in favor of final passage. Republicans and Democrats. \nSmall states and large. East and West. North and South. Conservative \nand liberal. Most of us recognize how important this is to our country, \nto the region, and to the world.\n  That is why I will continue to urge the Majority Leader to set a firm \ndate to bring the PNTR bill to the floor so we can move this \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues, Republican, as well as Democrat, to \njoin me in delivering that message to the Majority Leader.\n  Once it comes to the floor, there will likely be a plethora of \namendments, some germane and others non-germane. The Senate has its own \nrights and prerogatives. I will always defend the right of Senators to \noffer amendments to a bill. But, I am concerned that amendments in the \nSenate, which would force the bill into a conference with the House, \nwould lead to delaying, and perhaps jeopardizing, final passage of this \nlandmark legislation. We cannot afford such a development.\n  H.R. 4444 is a very balanced bill. It deals with the major concerns \nrelative to China's entry into the global trading system. Therefore, \nalong with many of my colleagues, I have made a commitment to oppose \nany amendment to H.R. 4444, no matter how meritorious the amendment \nmight be on its own terms. Prompt passage and enactment of this bill \nshould be a top bipartisan priority. I urge all my colleagues to join \nme in making the commitment to oppose any attempt to amend this \nlegislation.\n  H.R. 4444 ensures that future U.S. administrations will closely \nmonitor China's compliance with its WTO obligations and with other \ntrade agreements made with the United States. It will make the \nadministration in the future act promptly in the case of damaging \nimport surges. It provides for a vigorous monitoring of human rights, \nworker rights, and the import of goods produced by forced or prison \nlabor. H.R. 4444 also provides for technical assistance to help develop \nthe rule of law in China. It enhances the ability of U.S. government \nradios to broadcast into China. And it states the sense of Congress \nregarding Taiwan's prompt admission to the WTO.\n  To repeat, extending PNTR to China is vitally important to America's \neconomic and strategic interests. Our top priority should be a bill \napproved by the Senate identical to H.R. 4444 so that it can \nimmediately be sent to the President for signature. I hope we complete \naction rapidly in July.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6109-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

I rise today to comment briefly on an extremely \nthought-provoking opinion piece by Josef Joffe in the June 20th edition \nof the New York Times. The article was entitled ``A Warning from Putin \nand Schroeder.'' It describes how the current global predominance of \nthe United States is being countered by constellations of countries, \nwhich include allies and less-friendly powers alike, and how American \nbehavior is aiding and abetting this development.\n  Mr. Joffe is the co-editor of the prestigious German weekly Die Zeit. \nHe received his university education in the United States and is well \nknown and respected in American foreign policy\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\ncircles. In short, his thoughts are advice from a friend, not hostile \ncriticism from an embittered or jealous antagonist.\n  The take-off point of the article, from which its headline is \nderived, was the recent summit meeting in Berlin between German \nChancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Russian President Vladimir Putin \nduring which Putin employed the classic Muscovite tactic of wooing \nEurope's key country in an effort to have it join Russia as a \ncounterweight to us.\n  Fair enough, Joffe says. Whenever the international system has been \ndominated by one power, a natural movement to restore the balance has \narisen. With regard to the United States, this is nothing new--the \nChinese, as well as the Russians, have been decrying a ``unipolar \nworld'' and ``hegemonism'' for years.\n  But Germany--the country the United States practically reinvented \nfrom the ashes of World War II, ushered back into the civilized family \nof nations, and then stood out as the only champion of re-unification \nonly a decade ago? No matter how gushy a host he wished to be, how \ncould the Chancellor of this Germany suddenly be calling for a \n``strategic partnership'' with Russia?\n  One answer, according to Joffe, is the obvious and passionate \nhostility to the U.S. national missile defense project, known popularly \nas NMD, which the Russians and our German allies--for that matter, all \nof our European allies--share.\n  A second reason can be traced to the obvious shock at the \noverwhelming American military superiority shown in last year's \nYugoslav air campaign. The manifest European military impotence \nimpelled the European Union to launch its own security and defense \npolicy, which NATO is now struggling to integrate into the alliance.\n  To some extent, then, the very fact of our current power--military, \neconomic, and cultural--makes attempts at creating a countervailing \nforce nearly inevitable.\n  But there is more. It is not only the policy that spawned NMD that \nirritates our European allies. What also irks them is the cavalier way \nin which we neglected to consult with them in our rush to formulate \nthat policy. As Joffe trenchantly puts it, ``America is so far ahead of \nthe crowd that it has forgotten to look back.''\n  In this, the second half of his explanation, I fear that Joffe is on \nto something: a new kind of American hubris. Again, his use of English \nis enviable. He describes the behavior of Congress these days as \n``obliviousness with a dollop of yahooism'' (I assume he isn't talking \nabout the search engine).\n  Mr. President, no one loves and respects this body more than I do. I \nbelieve that the American people is exceedingly well served by the one \nhundred Senators, all of whom are intelligent and hard-working.\n  Nevertheless, I note with dismay an increasing tendency in this \nchamber--I will leave judgments of the House of Representatives to \nothers--for Members to advocate aspects of foreign policy with a \nconscious disregard, occasionally even disdain, for the opinions of our \nallies and the impact our policies have on them.\n  This kind of unilateralism was exhibited in the floor debate last \nfall on ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by one of my \ncolleagues who, in responding to an article jointly authored by British \nPrime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, and German \nChancellor Schroeder, declared: ``I don't care about our allies. I care \nabout our enemies.''\n  No one, Mr. President, is advocating abandoning or compromising the \nnational interest of the United States simply because our allies oppose \nthis or that aspect of our foreign and security policy.\n  But power--in the current context, our unparalleled power--must be \naccompanied by a sense of responsibility.\n  Mr. Joffe alludes to this power-and-responsibility duality in \nrecalling the golden age of bipartisan American foreign policy in the \nyears immediately following the Second World War, when Republican \nSenator Arthur Vandenberg and Democratic President Harry S. Truman \ncollaborated on halting the spread of communism and on helping create \nthe international institutions that remain the cornerstones of our \nworld more than half a century later. As he puts it ``responsibility \nmust defy short-term self-interest or the domestic fixation of the \nday.''\n  Mr. President, one does not have to agree with all of Joffe's \narguments to admit that his assertions at least merit our serious \nconsideration. For if we do not begin to realize that even the United \nStates of America needs to factor in the opinions of its friends when \nformulating foreign policy, it may not have many friends to worry about \nin the future.\n  And if that development occurs, we will almost certainly no longer \nretain the sole superpower status that we now enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6110-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6110-S6111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MANCHESTER, VERMONT\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to note the 100th \nanniversary of the Charter of Manchester Village.\n  Manchester Village lies in the valley of the Battenkill River nestled \nbetween the Green Mountains to the east and the Taconic Mountains to \nthe west. Due to its geography and topography, Manchester Village has \nbeen at the crossroads of the earliest trails and roads in Vermont. The \nslopes of Mount Equinox, which rise 3,800 feet above the village, \nprovide numerous fresh water streams and natural springs for the \nenjoyment of the resident and visiting populations.\n  From its earliest days to the period of the Civil War, Manchester was \nvery much frontier country with numerous inns and taverns at its \ncrossroads. In 1781, according to the town history detailed in the 1998 \nVillage Plan, ``there were no churches, but there were four taverns, a \njail, a pillory and a whipping post.'' But by 1840, Vermont was the \nslowest growing state in the Union, as much of the natural resources of \nthe state had been depleted, and wool imports from Australia had \nbrought an end to a brief boom of sheep raising in Manchester and other \nparts of the state.\n  Beginning just prior to the Civil War, however, tourists began to \ndiscover Manchester. In 1853, the Equinox Hotel was opened by Franklin \nOrvis, who converted an inn that had begun in 1770. In 1863, when Mrs. \nAbraham Lincoln and her son, Robert Todd, stepped off the ten o'clock \ntrain, Manchester's reputation was made. Later, Presidents Ulysses S. \nGrant, William Howard Taft, Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt, and \nVice-President James S. Sherman would follow as visitors to Manchester \nVillage.\n  Today, the Equinox remains as one of Vermont's grandest \nestablishments. The Village is also home to Hildene, the summer home of \nRobert Todd Lincoln and now operated as a house museum. The Southern \nVermont Art Center, the Mark Skinner Library, Burr and Burton Academy, \nand two world class golf courses can be found in Manchester Village, \nalong with numerous delightful inns and hotels, charming churches, \nexquisite restaurants, engaging museums, enchanting galleries and \nunique shops.\n  Manchester Village thrives today in large part due to careful \nplanning and the guardianship of an impressive streetscape \ncharacterized by marble sidewalks, deep front lawns, large, historic \nbuildings, and an absence of fences. Village residents have faced the \nchallenge of responsible and active stewardship since the tourist boom \nof the second half of the 19th century, and the Village Charter is an \nimportant part of that history.\n  For some details of the genesis of the incorporation of Manchester \nVillage 100 years ago, I turn to ``The Manchester Village Charter,'' \nwritten by Mary Hard Bort and reprinted here by permission of the \nManchester Journal. Congratulations to the Village of Manchester on the \nevent of its 100th birthday. I ask that that be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                     The Manchester Village Charter\n\n                          (By Mary Hard Bart)\n\n       By 1900 a building boom was flourishing in Manchester \n     Village,. It was nearly impossible to hire a carpenter and \n     the ``summer people'' who intended to build ``cottages'' that \n     year often found it necessary to hire labor from out of town.\n       Some twenty years earlier in 1880 Village boundaries had \n     been laid out by the town's selectmen and approved by the \n     Vermont Legislature for the purpose of providing fire \n     protection in Fire District #2 (the Village).\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\n       In 1894 John Marsden came to Manchester from Utica, NY and \n     contracted to purchase the springs on Equinox Mountain from \n     the Fire District and rights of way for a water system. Prior \n     to this time water for fighting fires was stored in huge \n     barrels strategically placed throughout the Village and \n     individual households were supplied by wells, or springs, or \n     cisterns.\n       Pipes were laid, a reservoir built and The Manchester Water \n     Company was formed in October 1894. The company had purchased \n     all the water contracts, springs, rights of way and conduits \n     from the Marsden family. Officers of the corporation included \n     Mr. Marsden, Mason Colburn of Manchester Center, J.W. Fowler \n     of Manchester Depot and E.C. Orvis of the Village. The \n     Marsden family continued to manage the water company until it \n     was purchased by the Town of Manchester in 1980.\n       With a water system in place, the need for a sewage system \n     was pressing. The inadequacy of the open trench installed by \n     Franklin Orvis in 1882 was apparent and, in the spring of \n     1900, public spirited Village residents borrowed enough \n     capital to build proper sewer lines through District #2. Many \n     householders put in bathrooms at this time and eschewed the \n     outhouses that had served their modest needs up til then. \n     These sewer lines emptied directly into the Bauerkill and it \n     was not until 1935 that a modern sewage treatment plant was \n     built with federal funds, appropriated Village funds and \n     private contributions.\n       Back in 1858 citizens of the Village had petitioned the \n     Legislature for authority to create a charter and had \n     received permission to do so but no action had ever been \n     taken. Now, at the end of the century, an entity with the \n     authority to purchase and construct a sewer, to provide \n     street lights, to regulate the width and grade of roads and \n     sidewalks, to prohibit certain activities, regulate others \n     and to protect property was clearly in order.\n       The desire on the part of Village leaders to develop \n     Manchester as a fine summer resort with all the amenities \n     city people expected proved to be a strong incentive for \n     action. These men whose vision of a thriving summer resort \n     led to the building of elegant summer cottages, a golf course \n     and the opening of new streets were not satisfied with the \n     progress being made by the town in providing services they \n     deemed essential.\n       Village voters were called to a series of meetings at the \n     Courthouse where the need for a charter was explained and by \n     October a bill was presented by Edward C. Orvis. He was the \n     son of Franklin Orvis and the current operator of the Equinox \n     House, a selectman for eight years and a representative and, \n     later, senator in the Vermont Legislature. Also on the \n     committee were William B. Edgerton, well-known realtor and \n     creator of several spacious summer estates, and Charles F. \n     Orvis, now elderly but with a wisdom greatly valued and \n     respected in the village. He was the proprietor of the Orvis \n     Inn as well as the manufacturer of fishing equipment.\n       On November 11, 1900 the Bill of Incorporation for the \n     Village of Manchester, Vermont passed in the House of \n     Representatives and was signed by the governor.\n       On December 3, 1900 the voters of Fire District #2 met at \n     the Courthouse and following an explanation of the provisions \n     of the charter, adopted the Village Charter, unanimously. The \n     Charter compels the Village to assume the obligations and \n     duties of Fire District #2, which ceased to exist with the \n     adoption of the charter. Also incumbent upon it is care of \n     its highways, bridges and sidewalks. Permitted are \n     improvements to public grounds, sidewalks and parks and \n     ordinances compelling property owners to remove ice, snow and \n     garbage from their property. Also allowed are street lights \n     provided by the Village and the purchase or construction of \n     sewers as well as the regulation of the width and grade of \n     streets and sidewalks.\n       Elected to serve this new Village of Manchester were: \n     Edward C. Orvis, as president, D.K. Simonds, clerk, George \n     Towsley, treasurer and Trustee; C.F. Orvis, Hiram Eggleston, \n     M.J. Covey and Charles H. Hawley. Promptly on January 10, \n     1901, according to provisions in the Charter, the Village of \n     Manchester purchased from private investors, the sewer that \n     served it.\n       Quickly following on the heels of incorporation, the \n     Manchester Development Association was formed in 1901 to \n     promote tourism in the area. This group, made up of full-time \n     and summer residents, underwrote the printing of 15,000 \n     promotional booklets extolling the virtues of Manchester-in-\n     the-Mountains as a summer resort. Its newly opened golf \n     course (the Ekwanok), its pure spring water, its \n     ``salubious'' climate were sure to bring people here.\n       In 1912 the Village hired a special police officer for the \n     summer to control the traffic. The mix of automobiles and \n     horses had created some dangerous situations and some \n     automobile drivers were accused of driving too fast for \n     conditions.\n       In 1921, the year after women secured the vote, Mrs. George \n     Orvis, who had taken over the Equinox Hotel after her \n     husband's death, was elected president of the Village.\n       Assaults on the integrity of the Village as a separate \n     entity have been vigorously repelled. In 1956 a measure to \n     consolidate the Village with the Town was soundly defeated \n     and, though fire protection and police protection are \n     provided by the Town of Manchester, the Village retains its \n     own planning and zoning boards and its own road department \n     and the privilege of hiring additional police officers if it \n     deems that necessary.\n       Numerous amendments had been made to the charter over time. \n     As estates bloomed land was added to the Village, other \n     amendments brought the charter up to date as time went on. A \n     new document was written to bring the charter up to date in \n     language and in provision and it was approved by the Town of \n     Manchester and by Village voters and by the Legislature in \n     1943.\n       For one hundred years Manchester Village has existed as a \n     recognized legal entity with the rights, privileges and \n     obligations that follow. Its officers today guard its \n     integrity with as much vigor as did their predecessors.\n       July 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6111-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM DUNBAR\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine group \nof Americans who have performed a remarkable service to this country \nand to our global community. The Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue \nTeam were honored on June 27, 2000 in a ceremony held at The Pentagon \nfor their extraordinary efforts over the past 14 years. The following \nremarks were delivered on this occasion by Secretary of Defense William \nCohen:\n\n       Senators Warner and Robb, Congressmen Moran and Davis, \n     thank you all for joining us here today and for your tireless \n     efforts on behalf of our men and women in uniform. Deputy \n     Secretary DeLeon; Assistant Chief of Fairfax County Urban \n     Fire and Rescue Team, Mark Wheatly; members of the Fairfax \n     County Urban Search and Rescue Team and your families and \n     friends; distinguished guests--including our canine friends; \n     ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure to welcome all of our \n     guests, whether they arrived on two legs or on four.\n       Two years ago, I received a call in the middle of the \n     night. It was the tragic news of the embassy bombings in \n     Kenya and Tanzania. And I think all Americans--indeed, people \n     the world over--were simply stunned by the unspeakable \n     cruelty and inhumanity of that act, the lives of 267 innocent \n     men and women snuffed out in a single instant of \n     indiscriminate violence.\n       Such moments force us to pause and reflect on the thinness \n     of the membrane that separates this life from the next, on \n     how quickly our hearts can be stopped and our voices can be \n     silenced. And there is the futile wish that we all experience \n     in grief: the wish to turn back the hand of time, to reverse \n     what fate has just dictated. Of course, we cannot. But what \n     we can do is renew our appreciation of the precarious and \n     precious nature of our lives, resolve to use our time and \n     energy to preserve and protect the sanctity of life and \n     freedom, and rededicate ourselves to those principles of \n     humaneness and generosity.\n       Today, we are here to honor and express our thanks to a \n     group of men and women who have taken that ideal to its \n     highest expression, who have made that ideal both a career \n     and a calling. Time after time over the past 14 years, those \n     of you in the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team \n     have responded to some of the worst disasters of our time: \n     Mexico City, Armenia, Oklahoma City, Turkey, the Philippines, \n     and Taiwan. You have gone into cities whose devastation could \n     vie with Dante's vision of hell. And upon your arrival, there \n     has been no food, no water, no electricity. On every block, \n     horrific scenes of carnage. On every face, confusion, \n     fatigue, and grief. But in every case, you have used your \n     energy, innovation, and skill to make a tangible difference \n     in the lives of disaster victims.\n       Sometimes it has been risky and harrowing, such as in the \n     Philippines, where your team worked more than 9 hours in a \n     collapsed hotel to free a trapped man while ground tremors \n     from the earthquake continued.\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\n       Sometimes it has been a combination of thoughtful planning \n     and sheer luck, such as when a special camera was able to \n     locate an 8-year-old boy, who had practically been buried \n     alive when his bunk bed collapsed under the weight of a \n     crushed building in Turkey.\n       Sometimes it has been grim and bittersweet, such as when \n     you were able to save an elderly woman in Armenia who was the \n     sole survivor from her building.\n       The rest of us can only imagine the physical and \n     psychological toll that these types of missions take on each \n     of you: day upon day of work without sleep, the chaos of the \n     circumstances, the calls for help and relief that far \n     outnumber your resources and manpower.\n       So we wanted, on behalf of the Department of Defense, to \n     pay tribute to your efforts and say thank you; in particular, \n     for the aid that you provided during our response to the \n     tragedy in Kenya and Tanzania; but more broadly, for your \n     sacrifices and those of your families and friends, who have \n     provided so much support during your deployments.\n       We want to commend you for the message of friendship that \n     you have sent to the people of other nations on behalf of the \n     United States. When you go to a foreign country and raise \n     your tents, with those American flags sewn on top, and use \n     your skill, patience, courage, and compassion to help other \n     people, that sends a powerful message of goodwill to other \n     nations.\n       That is precisely the type of positive example that we in \n     the Department of Defense encourage in our soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen when they are abroad. \n     Because it is a very eloquent and enduring statement about \n     what America stands for.\n       I cannot tell you how many times my counterparts abroad \n     have expressed to me their gratitude--to the United States \n     and the American people--for some type of assistance or aid. \n     That type of relationship--including the trust, respect, and \n     appreciation that you earn--is indispensable to diplomacy, \n     stability, and peace. And so we thank you.\n       Finally, I want to congratulate you for the example that \n     you have set for cooperation between the military community \n     and the civilian community. Several of you have already \n     participated in our Domestic Preparedness Program, and your \n     efforts are going to be even more important in the future as \n     terrorism and weapons of mass destruction become greater \n     threats here in the United States. Every time we work with \n     you to get your gear and trucks onto an air transport or fly \n     you to a distant location, our partnership becomes more \n     valuable for you and for us. Ultimately, when the sirens \n     sound the next time, that experience will allow even more \n     lives to be saved.\n       Just across the hall from my office here in the Pentagon \n     there is a painting of a soldier in prayer. It is graced with \n     an inscription taken from the Book of Isaiah. In the passage, \n     God asks: ``Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?'' And \n     Isaiah answers: ``Here I am. Send me.''\n       Today it is my pleasure to honor an extraordinary group of \n     Americans who, in the dark and decisive hours after \n     tragedies, have always been willing to say, ``Here I am. Send \n     me.'' You proudly represent not only Fairfax County and the \n     state of Virginia, you represent the best of America and the \n     better angels of our nature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6112-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6112-S6113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LUCY CALAUTTI\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nwoman who has dedicated her career to public service and is a good \nfriend, Lucy Calautti.\n  I have known Lucy Calautti for twenty years, since she was the Chief \nof Staff for then Congressman Dorgan, even before becoming his chief of \nstaff in the U.S. Senate. Throughout the years I have been inspired by \nher intelligence and political skills in the service of the United \nStates Congress.\n  Many people on the Hill know about Lucy's professional \naccomplishments, but few of them know about the incredible service she \nhas rendered our nation before she can to Washington. Lucy Calautti's \nextensive and varied career in the interest of the public, includes \nservice in the United States Navy as an aerial photographer during the \nVietnam War. After that her inspiration to serve the American people \nnever faded--in fact it was enhanced--as she photographed protesters \noutside the 1968 Democratic convention. Her experience in Chicago at \nthe convention of the social turmoil in our country at that them were \nsome of the experiences that has made Lucy the dynamic and sensitive \nperson she is.\n  Lucy headed west to North Dakota from her birthplace in Queens, New \nYork. She fell in love with the people and land of North Dakota as much \nas the people and land of North Dakota fell in love with her. She \nadmired North Dakotans' independence, their hard work, and their \nidealism. It wasn't long after Lucy arrived in North Dakota that she \nbegan working with now Senator Dorgan when he became the elected State \nTax Commissioner. Theirs was a unique working partnership--one that has \nlasted more than a quarter of a century.\n  In her lifetime, Lucy has also been a champion for the rights of \nwomen, children, and working families. Some may not know how tirelessly \nLucy Calautti has fought for women's rights throughout her career. Lucy \nbegan her dedication to the rights of women when she participated in \nlandmark anti-discrimination litigation. As a female GI, she was a \ncourageous pioneer who realized first-hand that the benefits extended \nto women paled in comparison to the benefits extended to her male \ncolleagues. Lucy took up the cause, and made sure that, for the first \ntime, full GI benefits were provided to women serving in the military. \nLucy continued her career in grassroots organizing on behalf of the \nWomen's Democratic Caucus in North Dakota. In fact, The Hill newspaper \nwould later anoint Lucy the ``best political organizer the state of \nNorth Dakota has ever seen.'' And while so many people would have \nstopped with just these accomplishments, Lucy continued to establish \nthe first public child care center in North Dakota, extending the most \nnecessary service to women who juggle work, family, and far too often, \npoverty.\n  Lucy's career in public service has also included one of the most \nimportant positions in American society today--teaching. Lucy shaped \nthe minds of our future leaders through her years as a high school and \ncollege-level teacher. To this day, Lucy continues her commitment to \nour nation's children, reading to DC-area children every week. Truly, \nan inspiration.\n  Lucy has, literally, shifted the political landscape in North Dakota \nand the U.S. Senate. As campaign manager Lucy  Calautti engineered a \ncome-from-behind victory for Kent Conrad in the 1986 U.S. Senate race \nagainst a seated Republican, marking the first time since 1944 that an \nincumbent North Dakota Senator lost a reelection bid. Her knowledge of \nthe people of North Dakota coupled with her superior grassroots \norganizing skills and her media savvy resulted in a campaign that is so \nrespected, it was the subject of a book entitled ``When Incumbency \nFails.''\n\n  Contemporaries know Lucy most for her leadership in the office of \nSenator Dorgan, as she has served as Chief of Staff to Senator Dorgan \nfor more than twenty years. During this time, Lucy performed a key role \nin shepherding key legislation through the United States Senate. It \nwasn't too long ago that Lucy played an instrumental role with the \nDemocratic party, staving off the Republican push for a Balanced Budget \nAmendment, and worked to push an amendment that would not harm Social \nSecurity. In those tense days, Lucy was the calm inside the storm, as \nshe quickly worked for a common-sense approach to the issue at the same \ntime she helped bring the state of North Dakota into the limelight. For \nher skills in politics and legislation, Lucy has been praised \nuniversally by her peers. A former aide to the late Senator Quentin \nBurdick lauded Lucy Calautti as ``incredibly astute about politics and \nhuman nature, and absolutely brilliant at running a campaign.'' Former \ncoworkers reserve the highest accolades for Lucy, including one, who \npraised Lucy as ``smart, analytical, meticulous, loyal, and a hard \nworker.'' The Hill newspaper even crowned Lucy Calautti with the title \nof ``most powerful woman in the nation's capital.''\n  Now, we are losing Lucy to one of her lifetime loves--baseball. I \nsuppose it is only natural that Lucy return to one of her first and \nmost ardent interests. Growing up in Queens, Lucy lived not too far \nfrom Shea Stadium where she began her love of our nation's favorite \npastime. Last week, her father passed away. He instilled in her a love \nof the game of baseball, among so many other attributes. She walks in \nher father's footsteps, and I'm sure he's the proudest Dad in the \nworld. It is with a great deal of respect that I pay tribute to Lucy \nCalautti today. Soon, Lucy will join the Major League Baseball \nOrganization as Director of Government Relations. She'll still be \nplaying ball with us, and it's be fun.\n  Thank you, Lucy, for the time we have been able to enjoy your \nmagnificent intellect and skills in the United States Senate. I thank \nyou for your hard work, your dedication, your idealism, and your \nservice to our country\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\nand most of all for you and Kent being the good friends you have been \nto Landra and to me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6113-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO R. GENE SMITH\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy good friend and philanthropist, R. Gene Smith.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Gene for many years, and have \nalways been able to witness his compassion for others on numerous \noccasions. Gene has a kind heart and a giving spirit, and constantly \nthinks of ways to help those less fortunate than himself. Eight years \nago, he offered another of his generous gifts to a fourth grade class \nin Louisville. In a spectacular show of kindness, Gene promised an all-\nexpense paid college education to 58 students at Jefferson County's \npoorest school, Engelhard Elementary. The students' part of the deal \nentailed completing high school and gaining acceptance to a post-\nsecondary college or university. As fourth graders, these children \nprobably couldn't grasp the incredible opportunity they were offered \nthen, but they certainly understand it now.\n  As Gene often does, he went the extra mile on his promise and \ncommitted to helping each of the 58 students graduate from high school. \nHe created the R. Gene Smith Foundation to meet the academic, social, \nand emotional needs of each child. Over the students' eight-year \njourney to graduation, the Foundation served as a haven for the \nchildren and facilitated learning and personal growth opportunities. In \nspite of numerous obstacles, Gene and his students exceeded \nexpectations and recently celebrated the graduation of 31 of the \noriginal 58 students.\n  Gene gave an amazing gift. Not only did Gene provided a free college \neducation, but he provided each of the students and their parents with \ncompassion, motivation, and peace of mind over the last eight years. He \nprevented 31 sets of parents from having to worry about whether they \nwould have the money to pay for their child's education. He provided 31 \nstudents with hope for a bright and successful future.\n  Although this latest act of compassion is extraordinary, it is only \none example of Gene's generosity. Gene chaired fund-raising efforts for \nNeighborhood House, a community center in a poverty-stricken area of \nPortland, Kentucky. He supports a preschool program for underprivileged \nchildren in Kentucky, called Jump Start. Additionally, he donated $1 \nmillion towards redevelopment of the Louisville waterfront. Gene also \nlends his support to such civic groups as the Speed Art Museum, the \nCathedral Heritage Foundation, the University of Louisville Hospital \nFoundation, and Greater Louisville, Inc.\n  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I \noffer heartfelt thanks to Gene for his continuing commitment to helping \nothers and a hearty congratulations to the 31 hardworking high school \ngraduates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6113-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MARIA'S CHILDREN AND RUSSIAN ORPHANS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to advise our colleagues and \ntheir staff, and their constituents visiting Washington, of an \neducational exhibit in the Russell Rotunda next week. The exhibit will \ninclude examples of colorful murals used by the volunteer group, \nMaria's Children, a Moscow-based arts rehabilitation center, as arts \ntherapy and training for Russian orphans with learning difficulties. \nThis therapy has produced encouraging results.\n  Maria's Children is a Moscow-based foundation, with U.S.-based Board \nmembers and volunteers, established to help children in Russian \norphanages recognize their creative potential, thereby developing their \ntalents and self-esteem so as to improve their chances of successful \nintegration into Russian society. Created in 1993 by Maria Yeliseyeva, \na local Moscow artist, and her friends, the project quickly found that \nthrough art, these orphans could come to express themselves in ways \nthey had not known before, improving both their social and \npsychological development. Through a combination of arts therapy and \nexposure to normal family life, Maria's Children have literally given \nthese children a second chance. The program has expanded over time and \nhas started a summer art camp for orphans and is associated with Dr. \nPatch Adams annual clown tours of Moscow.

ARTHUR SALTZMAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and in \nmemory of a dear friend of mine, Mr. Arthur Saltzman, of Franklin, \nMichigan, who passed away on June 18, 2000, at the age of 79. Mr. \nSaltzman was not only a friend, but an inspiration--a man who dedicated \nmuch of his life to improving the State of Michigan.\n  Born in New York City in 1920, Mr. Saltzman came to Michigan to work \nfor Ford Motor Company, where he was in charge of training/management \nprograms for salaried employees.\n  After Mr. Saltzman retired from Ford, he worked for the Greater \nDetroit Chamber of Commerce, was a consultant with the U.S. Department \nof Energy in Washington, DC, and was Director of the Michigan State \nUniversity Advanced Management Program in Troy, Michigan. He also was \nDirector of the Michigan Economic Opportunity Office and a member of \nthe Oakland University Charter Board of Trustees.\n  Mr. Saltzman earned his Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral degrees \nfrom New York University. During World War II, he was with the Army \nSpecialized Training Program, serving in both the Philippines and \nTokyo.\n  Surviving Mr. Saltzman are his wife, Florence, with whom he \ncelebrated his 50th Anniversary on January 30, 1999; daughters Amie R. \nSaltzman and Sarah Saltzman; his sister, Doris Chartow of Syracuse, New \nYork; grandchildren, Joshua and Joanna; five nephews and four nieces.\n  Mr. President, Arthur Saltzman was a leader in the Michigan \nRepublican Party at both the State and County level. I had the \nprivilege to work with him on many occasions, and I found it to be a \nwonderful experience each and every time. Arthur was a man who truly \nenjoyed life, and his love for living was infectious. I am sure that he \nwill be deeply missed by everyone who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6113-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6113-S6114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHILD HANDGUN INJURY PREVENTION ACT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation, \nalong with my good friend from Ohio Senator DeWine, that will set \nminimum standards for gun safety locks. There has been a lot of \ndiscussion swirling around the U.S. Congress and in State legislatures \nthroughout the country about the use of handgun safety locks to prevent \nchildren from gaining access to dangerous weapons. In fact, just last \nweek New York became the latest State to require that safety locks be \nsold with firearms. Seventeen states have Child Access Protection, or \nCAP laws in place, which permit prosecution of adults if their firearm \nis left unsecured and a child uses that firearm to harm themselves or \nothers.\n  An important element that is largely missing from the debate over the \nvoluntary or required use of gun safety locks is the quality and \nperformance of these locks. Mr. President, a gun lock will only keep a \ngun out of a child's hands if the lock works. There are many cheap, \nflimsy locks on the market that are easily overcome by a child. In fact \njust last week in Dale City, VA there was an absolutely heart-wrenching \naccidental shooting of\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\na 10-year-old boy by his 13-year-old brother. The parents of these \nyoung boys purchased both a lock box and a trigger lock and I'm sure \nthey assumed that they were safely storing their weapon.\n  But, as was reported in Saturday's Washington Post, the boys easily \ngot past the flimsy lock box and then got around the lock. This \nincident ended in unspeakable, but all too common tragedy with the \ndeath of a 10-year-old boy at the hands of his brother.\n  Mr. President, the legislation Senator DeWine and I introduced \nyesterday might have prevented the accidental shooting of that young \nboy last week. Our legislation gives authority to the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to set minimum regulations for safety locks and to \nremove unsafe locks from the market. Our legislation empowers consumers \nby ensuring that they will only purchase high-quality lock boxes and \ntrigger locks.\n  Storing firearms safely is an effective and inexpensive way to \nprevent the needless tragedies associated with unintentional firearm-\nrelated death and injury. And I am pleased that several states, \nincluding my home state of Massachusetts, have required the use of gun \nsafety locks. Last July here in the U.S. Senate we passed an amendment \nthat would require the use of gun safety locks.\n  So, while I am encouraged by this trend of increasing the use of gun \nsafety locks, I am genuinely concerned that with the hundreds of \ndifferent types of gun locks on the market today it is difficult--\nprobably impossible--for consumers to be assured that the lock they are \npurchasing will be effective.\n  The latest data released by the Centers for Disease Control in 1999 \nrevealed that accidental shootings accounted for 7 percent of child \ndeaths and that more than 300 children died in gun accidents, almost \none child every day. A study in the Archives of Pediatric and \nAdolescent Medicine found that 25 percent of 3- to 4-year-olds and 70 \npercent of 5- to 6-year-olds had sufficient finger strength to fire 59 \n(or 92 percent) of the 64 commonly available handguns examined in the \nstudy. Accidental shootings can be prevented by simple safety measures, \none of which is the use of an effective gun safety lock.\n  As I have already mentioned, Mr. President, the use of gun safety \nlocks is increasing in the United States. Despite the growing use of \ngun safety locks, such products are not subject to any minimal safety \nstandards. Many currently available trigger locks, safety locks, lock \nboxes, and other similar devices are inadequate to prevent the \naccidental discharge of the firearms to which they are attached or to \nprevent access and accidental use by young children. Consumers do not \nhave any objective criteria with which to judge the quality of gun \nsafety locks.\n  My colleagues on both sides of the aisle should be able to support \nthis amendment. The legislation does not require the use of gun safety \nlocks. It only requires that gun safety locks meet minimum standards. \nThe legislation does not regulate handguns. It applies only to after-\nmarket, external gun locks.\n  The Senate has been gridlocked since last July over the issue of gun \ncontrol. And you can be sure that young lives have been needlessly lost \ndue to our inaction. This legislation--which I truly believe every \nSenator can support--would make storing a gun in the home safer by \nensuring safety devices are effective. It would empower consumers. And \nmost importantly it would protect children and decrease the numbers of \naccidental shooting in this country.\n  We simply cannot stand by any longer and watch our young children \nfall victim to accidental shootings. We cannot hear about tragedies \nlike the one last week in Dale City, VA without responding. This \nlegislation is a step in the right direction, one I believe every \nSenator should support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6114-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CAREY FAMILY REUNION\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nachievement of the Carey Cattle Operation in Boulder, Montana.\n  In the late 1800's Bart Carey settled in the Boulder Valley. Two of \nhis sons worked the mines and mills in Montana and Idaho hoping to \nstake their own ranches in the Valley.\n  Frank, the patriarch of the operation, followed the gold rush north \nto Alaska, enduring shipwreck and a winter living with an Eskimo \nfamily. After returning to the Valley he established a ranching legacy \nthat endures to this day. Frank and his wife Mary Ellen have 12 \nchildren and 45 grandchildren.\n  Their legacy of cussed independence, integrity, and determination \ninstilled in their children the qualities of hard work, responsibility \nand most importantly a deep abiding faith in God.\n  This attitude of responsibility fostered a deep sense of patriotism \nand resulted in their son, Martin B., answering his nation's call \nduring World War II. He was joined by four sisters--Lillian, Agnes, \nEleanor, and Josephine--who served as Navy nurses.\n  Service to our country, in spite of the demands of managing a \nthriving cattle operation, and the concessions that were available \nunder such conditions saw their youngest son Tom, the current \npatriarch, answering the call during the Korean conflict.\n  As the only remaining son, Tom and his extraordinary wife Helen, \ncarry on the tradition. Operating out of the main ranch they have \nendeavored to instill these same values in their children and \ngrandchildren. In spite of the current condition of American \nagriculture they are making every effort to ensure that their children \nand the children of Tom's siblings have every opportunity to continue \ntheir ranching legacy.\n  As the Carey family gathers for a reunion this Fourth of July they \nwill find a base of operation being restored to its original state. \nThey understand the importance of preserving history and their role in \nthis dwindling aspect of the great American west.\n  I would like to extend my congratulations and sincere best wishes to \nthe Carey family for high grass, plentiful water, and most importantly \na fair market price for the fruits of their labor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6114-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6114-S6115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF LOYAL CLARK AS NATIONAL FOREST SERVICE EMPLOYEE OF THE \n                                 DECADE\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of Ms. Loyal Clark, Public Affairs Specialist and \nadministrator of the Senior, Youth, and Volunteer Program in the Uinta \nNational Forest located in my home state of Utah.\n  Ms. Clark has been instrumental in developing a model volunteer \nprogram that is clearly the largest in the nation, averaging 10,000 \nvolunteers a year for the past decade. Ms. Clark has worked to ensure \nthat the Uinta National Forest can accommodate and provide quality \nexperiences for the numerous volunteer groups and individuals. When \nthere have been more volunteers than available work, she has not turned \nthem away, but has been able to direct their enthusiasm to adjacent \nforests and other state, county, and community projects. She is a key \ncontact with the community, ensuring that volunteers know about \nopportunities and that they are matched with jobs they want to do.\n  Ms. Clark developed and presented a proposal to the forest supervisor \nto establish volunteer coordinators on each of the ranger districts in \nthe forest. These coordinator positions have helped to provide the \nnecessary staff for the Uinta to manage its huge volunteer program and \nto complete millions of dollars worth of vital project work, increasing \nthe effectiveness of the Forest's budget by as much as twenty to thirty \npercent.\n  Ms. Clark has taken an active role to ensure various volunteers are \nrecognized and rewarded. She has organized volunteer award ceremonies \nin the forest and actively ensures the nominations of volunteers for \nforest, regional, and national recognition. She is currently the team \nleader for the Uinta National Forest partnership team, which is active \nin pursing new partnerships with the forest while also maintaining its \ncurrent relationships.\n  She has not only made a difference in the Uinta National Forest, but \nhas also visited many of the forest management teams throughout the \nIntermountain Region and shared her wealth of knowledge and experience \nin the management of effective volunteer programs.\n  Because of Ms. Clark's career-long commitment to working with \nvolunteers, the United States Forest Service recently presented her \nwith an award for being the National Forest Service\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\nEmployee of the Nineties. I congratulate Ms. Clark on her well-deserved \naward from the Forest Service.\n  In closing, I am pleased to recognize and thank Ms. Loyal Clark today \nfor her sustained efforts to enlist and encourage citizens to take \nownership in their national forests and communities through \nvolunteering.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6115-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO GARFIELD AND SUNNYSIDE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend two Idaho \nschools, Garfield Elementary School in Boise and Sunnyside Elementary \nSchool in Kellogg for their high standards and excellent teaching \nrecords.\n  Last month, these two schools were recognized by the U.S. Department \nof Education and the National Association of Title I Directors as \nDistinguished Title I Schools. These two elementary schools were among \nthe ninety schools nationwide to be recognized for their efforts toward \nstudent achievement in schools that teach students from low-income \nhouseholds. Garfield Elementary and Sunnyside Elementary exemplify \nIdaho's high education standards and I am honored to congratulate these \ntwo schools for receiving this national award.\n  This national honor is especially impressive when one recognizes that \nmore than fifty thousand schools across the country use Title I funds \nto boost the achievement levels of students from low-income households. \nThe distinction of 2000 Distinguished Title I School is awarded to \nschools whose programs offer children from educationally disadvantaged \ncommunities access to effective academic lessons. Education is crucial \nto the well-being of these future adults because it is often their \nmeans of upward mobility. Improved education opportunities allows these \nchildren to become better citizens and achieve their education and \ncareer goals, including higher paying jobs, and a better quality of \nlife.\n  Much of Sunnyside Elementary's success can be attributed to an active \nparent volunteer program. For example, while the school has only 300 \nstudents, approximately 124 parents volunteer their time at least once \na year and forty-nine parents volunteer at the school on a regular \nbasis. A web page, maintained by Principal Steve Shepperd and monthly \nschool newsletters inform parents of school activities and highlight \nways parents can get involved. The suggested tasks are often as simple \nas helping children with homework assignments.\n  Principal Shepperd says, ``Just because sixty percent of the students \nwe teach come from households that are at or near the poverty level, it \ndoesn't mean that they cannot learn. We concentrate on setting high \nstandards and we help the kids meet them by offering encouragement and \nextra assistance with their lessons.'' Principal Shepperd credits the \ndedicated teachers of Sunnyside Elementary for putting in extra time \nand for bringing so much of their energy into the classroom.\n  Garfield Elementary is noted for its tremendous community \ninvolvement. Student volunteers from Boise State University, most of \nthem studying to be teachers, regularly tutor students after school. \nGarfield hosts an annual Career Day in which professionals from the \ncommunity describe their careers and how they pursued them. The school \nalso has a fifteen-member mentor program. Although none of the tutors \nhave children of their own who attend Garfield, they come to the school \nfrequently during lunchtime to read with children. This extensive \ncommunity involvement is one of the reasons why the Iowa Test of Basic \nSkills for students at Garfield Elementary have risen as much as thirty \npoints on a 100-point scale for some grades.\n  In addition to volunteering, parents at Garfield Elementary are \nencouraged by Principal Elaine Eichelberg to join one of the school's \nmany committees. At the beginning of the year, each household receives \na questionnaire that lists specific ways to help and asks parents to \nindicate their interest and availability. Principal Eichelberg says, \n``One of the best things parents can do to improve their child's \neducation is to keep close tabs on their child's progress themselves \nand work with teachers when problems at school arise.''\n  The national recognition that Sunnyside Elementary and Garfield \nElementary have received reaffirms my belief that Idaho has some of the \nbest teachers and administrators in the nation. Backed by strong \ninvolvement from parents and encouragement from the community, these \nelementary schools have demonstrated success in teacher training, \nutilized community resources, and established partnerships with \nparents.\n  There has been much debate about the success of the Title I program \nin the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Schools like Garfield \nand Sunnyside show us that the programs implemented with the use of \nTitle I funds do work. When we invest in quality education programs \nthat focus on basic skills, such as reading and mathematics, our low-\nperforming students will improve. The methods employed in Idaho serve \nas a reminder that community and parental support often make the \nbiggest difference in elementary education.\n  I am very proud of the accomplishments of these two schools. Their \nsteady focus on hard work has put their students on a path of continued \nacademic success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6115-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF MRS. JACQUELYN STEWART\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and in \nmemory of a dear friend of mine, Mrs. Jacquelyn Stewart, who passed \naway on June 19 at the age of 59. Mrs. Stewart was not only a friend, \nbut a truly special woman. She believed deeply in the ideals of the \nRepublican Party, and worked extremely hard to fight for these ideals.\n  Mrs. Stewart was born in Detroit, Michigan. After attending Henry \nFord Community College in Dearborn, Michigan, she attended the Oakland \nCounty Police Academy. She spent 15 years as an investigator with the \nOakland County Prosecutor's Office.\n  On May 8, 1989, Mrs. Stewart was appointed to the Michigan Liquor \nControl Commission as an Administrative Commissioner. In 1997, Governor \nJohn Engler elevated her to position of Chairwoman of the Commission. \nFor her work in that position, Mrs. Stewart is credited with restoring \ncredibility to an agency that had fallen under controversy.\n  Mrs. Stewart also served the Oakland County Republican Party in many \nways, most prominently as one of the top aides to former prosecutor and \ncurrent County Executive, L. Brooks Patterson. In the mid-1980's, she \nled a petition drive that fell just short of placing a proposed \nrestoration of the death penalty on the Michigan ballot.\n  Mrs. Stewart is survived by her husband, Mr. James Stewart, former \nlongtime Huntington Woods Police Chief, as well as her sons, Chris and \nTimothy Boelter; daughter Elizabeth Rose; stepson James Stewart, and \ntwo brothers.\n  Mr. President, I consider it a privilege to have been able to know \nand work with Jackie Stewart. She was a woman of complete integrity, \nwho fought for what she believed regardless of the odds against her. \nHer energy and boundless efforts were an inspiration to men and women \nthroughout the State of Michigan, and I am sure she will be dearly \nmissed by everyone who knew her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6115-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6115-S6116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE CHALLENGER LEARNING CENTER OF ALASKA\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my \ncongratulations to the Challenger Learning Center of Alaska, its Board \nof Directors, and staffers, on their Official Launch Ceremony on July \n7, 2000.\n  The Challenger Learning Center of Alaska will be part of the national \nnetwork of 50 Learning Centers operating in the United States, Canada, \nand England established in memory of the 1986 Challenger Space Shuttle \ncrew. Located in Kenai, Alaska, the Challenger Learning Center of \nAlaska simulates space missions to give students the opportunity to \nexplore the endless possibilities available in science and technology \nfields.\n  Mr. President, currently 40 percent of America's 4th graders read \nbelow the basic level on national reading tests. On international \ntests, the nation's twelfth graders rank last in Advanced Physics \ncompared with students in 18 other countries. And one-third of all\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\nincoming college freshmen must enroll in a remedial reading, writing, \nor mathematics class before taking regular courses. If we are going to \nturn these dismal statistics around this country needs an innovative \napproach to teaching. The Challenger Learning Center of Alaska is \nworking towards ensuring that our elementary and secondary students of \ntoday are the best-educated and motivated college graduates of \ntomorrow.\n  The Challenger Learning Center programs will not only create an \nenvironment conductive to pursuing the sciences, they will also assist \nstudents in developing skills vital to every field. In the Alaska \nworkplace of the 21st century, survival will depend on teamwork, \nproblem solving, communication and decision-making. Like no other \neducational program, the Challenger Learning Center of Alaska will help \nall of Alaska's students develop these critical skills while providing \nthe solid educational content that promotes science literacy.\n  Mr. President, educators continue to site education as the number one \ndeterminate in an individual's success. I believe that the Challenger \nLearning Center of Alaska will profoundly affect the future of Alaska. \nI commend the Challenger Learning Center staff, Board of Directors, \nNASA and statewide communities for their tireless efforts and \ndedication to our young Alaskans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6116-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4680.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide a waiver of the oath of renunciation and allegiance for \nnaturalization of aliens having certain disabilities; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n  Waiver of Oath of Renunciation and Allegiance for Naturalization of \n                   Aliens Having Certain Disabilities\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenator Christopher Dodd and others, to introduce a simple but highly \nsignificant bill which will confer the treasured status of American \ncitizenship on individuals with disabilities.\n  Under current law, the Attorney General possesses the authority to \nwaive certain requirements of naturalization, such as the English and \ncivics test requirements, for disabled applicants. The law, however, \nhas been construed to stop short of granting the Attorney General \nauthority to waive the requirement for the oath of renunciation and \nallegiance for disabled adult applicants.\n  Consequently, even though such persons are able to fulfill all other \nrequirements of naturalization, or it is clear that the Attorney \nGeneral can waive them, certain individuals with disabilities may never \nbecome citizens.\n  This is the sad situation that a young man from my home state of Utah \nis facing. Gustavo Galvez Letona, a 27 year-old immigrant from \nGuatemala, suffers from Down's syndrome. Mr. Letona's entire family are \nalready\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\nAmerican citizens. But, while Mr. Letona is otherwise able to become a \ncitizen, despite his developmental disability, the fact that the \nAttorney General's authority to waive the oath is unclear will prevent \nMr. Letona from enjoying the same status as a naturalized American \ncitizen.\n  Imagine a family in which mother, father, brothers and sisters could \nbecome U.S. citizens, but one sibling could not only because of a \ndisability. I believe all my colleagues would agree that this would be \na sad and tragic situation. It is discriminatory to boot.\n  This bill would not affect a large number of people. A recent \nestimate was that only about 1100 individuals with disabilities would \npossibly be eligible for such a waiver. Moreover, I used the word \n``possibly'' because the waiver would not be automatic. The waiver \nwould be granted at the discretion of the Attorney General and is not \nintended to confer citizenship on individuals--regardless of a \ndisability--who would not otherwise qualify for citizenship. It would \nnot apply to every individual with a disability, most of whom would not \nneed such a waiver.\n  Today's legislation remedies this unfortunate scenario facing Gustavo \nLetona by extending the Attorney General's authority to waive the \ntaking of the oath if the applicant is unable to understand or \ncommunicate an understanding of the oath because of disability. This \nsimple solution allows Mr. Letona and others the privilege of becoming \nAmerican citizens.\n  I would like to express my gratitude to Senator Dodd for his \nwillingness to make this a bipartisan effort. I would also like to \nthank my Utah Advisory Committee on Disability Policy, and particularly \nRon Gardner, who brought this problem to my attention and who works \ntirelessly to protect the rights of the disabled.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be placed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2812\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF OATH OF RENUNCIATION AND ALLEGIANCE FOR \n                   NATURALIZATION OF ALIENS HAVING CERTAIN \n                   DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The last sentence of section 337(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1448(a)) is amended \n     to read as follows: ``The Attorney General may waive the \n     taking of the oath if in the opinion of the Attorney General \n     the applicant for naturalization is an individual with a \n     disability, or a child, who is unable to understand or \n     communicate an understanding of the meaning of the oath. If \n     the Attorney General waives the oath for such an individual, \n     the individual shall be considered to have met the \n     requirements of section 316(a)(3) as to attachment to the \n     Constitution and well disposition to the United States.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to individuals who applied for naturalization \n     before, on, or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with Senator Hatch, Senator Feingold, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator DeWine, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Kohl to \nintroduce a bill to resolve a rare but serious problem for some \nAmerican families.\n  I want to tell you a story about a young man named Mathieu, a \nresident of Connecticut. Mathieu's family--his mother, his father, and \nhis sister--have all become naturalized U.S. citizens. But Mathieu has \nnot been allowed to become a citizen because he's a 23-year-old low-\nfunctioning autistic man who cannot meet a very technical requirement \nof the naturalization process, namely that he be able to swear an oath \nof loyalty to the United States. His naturalization request has been in \nlimbo since November of 1996 because Mathieu could not understand some \nof the questions he was asked by the INS agent processing his \napplication for citizenship. All of the other members of Mathieu's \nfamily have become U.S. citizens. Now Mathieu's mother lives with the \nfear that when she dies her most vulnerable child could be removed from \nthe country and sent to a nation that he hardly knows, and where he has \nno family and no friends. Mathieu's mother--again, an American \ncitizen--wants what every American wants--she wants to know that her \nchild will be treated fairly by her government even when she's no \nlonger capable of taking care of him herself. Mathieu's life is here. \nHis friends and caregivers are here. His family is here. Mathieu's \nplace is here and but for his disability, he would be allowed to stay \nhere where he belongs. He would be allowed to become a citizen and his \nmother's fears would be relieved. Mr. President, this is a problem that \na compassionate nation can fix. This is a problem that we have the \npower to solve.\n  Under current law, a very small subgroup of people with severe mental \ndisabilities cannot become citizens because they lack the capacity to \ntake the oath of renunciation and allegiance. Since the Immigration and \nNationality Act (INA) does not contain explicit statutory authority for \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to waive the oath, \npeople with brain injuries and other mental disabilities are routinely \ndenied citizenship--even when the rest of their families are already \nU.S. citizens.\n  Congress has previously recognized the injustice of denying \ncitizenship to individuals based on their disabilities and has \nattempted to resolve the problem. In fact, in 1991 Congress created a \nprocedure for expedited administration of the oath for applicants who \nhave special circumstances, including disabilities, that prevent them \nfrom personally appearing at a scheduled ceremony. And in 1994, \nCongress exempted certain applicants with disabilities who are unable \nto learn from taking the English and civics tests. Unfortunately, these \nefforts have not effectively addressed the problem of individuals who \nare unable to take the oath because of mental incapacity, leaving the \noath as the only barrier to citizenship for such individuals.\n  The legislation we introduce today would amend the Immigration and \nNationality Act to give the INS the discretion to waive the oath of \nallegiance for certain individuals who lack the mental capacity to \ncomprehend the oath.\n  Waiving the oath is really a technical amendment. There is no \nindication that Congress ever intended to split up families or cast \ndoubt on the futures of family members not able to utter the oath by \nvirtue of a mental disability.\n  Waiving the oath does not defeat the purpose of Naturalization or the \noath requirement. Individuals with disabilities who receive oath \nwaivers would still have to fulfill the other requirements of \nnaturalization, including good moral character and residency. Remember \nthe main purpose of the oath requirement is to prevent the \nnaturalization of people who are hostile to the government of the \nUnited States, or the principles of the Constitution. People with \nsevere disabilities who lack the capacity to understand the oath cannot \nform the intent to act against the government. Waiving the oath poses \nno danger and manifests America's best, most compassionate \ncharacteristics.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this is not a problem that faces \nmillions of people--or even many thousands of people, but it is an \nimportant issue for the few families that are affected. Mr. President \nthe United States should not force the break up of families. This bill \nwill right an injustice and I urge its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2813. A bill to provide for a land exchange to fulfill the Federal \nobligation to the State of Arizona under the State's enabling act, and \nto use certain Federal land in Arizona to acquire by eminent domain \nState trust land located adjacent to Federal land for the purpose of \nimproving public land management, enhancing the conservation of unique \nnatural areas, and fulfilling the purposes for which State trust land \nis set aside, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n           The Arizona Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nauthorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior and the \nGovernor of Arizona to carry out a federal-state land exchange in order \nto protect environmentally significant lands in the state and enhance \nthe state education trust fund to benefit Arizona's schoolchildren.\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\n  I must first make mention that Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and \nGovernor Jane Hull of Arizona are currently involved in negotiating a \ncomprehensive state-federal land exchange agreement. The Secretary and \nthe Governor have been engaged in land exchange negotiations since \nJanuary of this year, which so far have been very productive and \npositive. If their negotiations are successful and a land trade is \nagreed upon, legislation will be necessary to authorize that exchange.\n  To express my strong support for a potential exchange, I am \nintroducing this bill as a place holder for the necessary authorization \nto implement any agreement for a land exchange. This legislation is in \nno way intended to override or influence ongoing negotiations, nor do I \nintend to force either party to accept a proposal that is not in their \nbest interests.\n  The purpose of this legislation is two-fold. One, it is simply a \nframework for a future agreement. It is intended to facilitate \ndiscussion to define the necessary legislative authority to implement a \nstate-federal land exchange in Arizona. If the details of a land \nexchange are agreed upon between the Secretary and the Governor, those \nspecifics can be incorporated into this legislation.\n  The second purpose is to define the necessary legislative language \nthat will accommodate existing Arizona Constitutional and Arizona \nEnabling Act restrictions that require state trust lands to be managed \nfor the benefit of education and other public purposes. In addition, \nthe bill recognizes the important goal of resolving the federal \ngovernment's land ``debt'' to Arizona as a result of not receiving the \nstate's full allotment at statehood. This legislation proposes to use \nfederal friendly-condemnation authority to effect other aspects of a \ncomprehensive exchange to address the current Arizona constitutional \nrestriction on land trades.\n  In recent years, the people of Arizona have embraced the idea of \npromoting conservation as part of the state's land management \nobjectives. Through public referenda and other proposals, the people of \nArizona have strongly supported the concept of a state-wide effort to \nconserve unique natural areas. The federal-state land exchange \ncurrently under discussion could ensure that ecologically important \nstate lands are placed under permanent conservation protection as part \nof an existing federal land management unit. In return, the state would \nreceive parcels currently owned by the federal government that may be \nmore suitable for revenue-generating activity in keeping with the \nrequirements of state law. Such an exchange could accomplish both state \nconservation and education goals. The opportunity to explore and effect \na means of serving these two important purposes should not be missed.\n  In the past, some of my colleagues and I have evaluated different \noptions to reduce the number of state inholdings on federal property \nand vice-versa--a situation that complicates resource management and \ndoes not serve the public interest. This legislation could be an \nimportant step forward in reducing state inholdings in federal land \nmanagement areas which makes good environmental, economic and \nadministrative sense.\n  Mr. President, let me make very clear once again, this legislation is \na starting point only. It does not represent by any means an \nendorsement of any particular lands for exchange that are currently \nunder negotiation. Nor is it my intention to fast-track any proposal \nthat does not abide by a fair and strict appraisal process. It is \nintended to encourage the Secretary and the Governor to forward a \nserious proposal to the Congress for consideration. Once a proposal is \nforwarded, I have every intention to consult with affected entities and \nengage in a thorough process of public input from local citizenry, \ngovernments and other interested parties.\n  I also recognize that such land exchanges do take time and it is very \npossible that a land exchange proposal may not be finalized this year. \nMy colleagues from Arizona recall as well as I do that it took three \nyears to negotiate and enact the Arizona Desert Wilderness Act of 1990 \nto preserve over two million acres as designated wilderness. We never \nwould have accomplished that feat without the front-line leadership and \nvision of Mo Udall who initiated the process by offering a legislative \nframework. I believe that this opportunity is one that Mo would have \nsupported. I hope that my colleagues and friends in Arizona will agree \nand that we can all work together on a comprehensive land exchange \nproposal that will accomplish educational and environmental objectives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include the full text of \nthe bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2813\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) when the State of Arizona entered the Union, the State \n     was granted more than 9,000,000 acres of State trust land to \n     be held in permanent trust to be managed on behalf of the \n     beneficiaries of the trust, primarily Arizona's \n     schoolchildren;\n       (2) the State is entitled to select additional land of a \n     value that is approximately equal to the value of 15,234 \n     acres of in lieu base land from vacant, unappropriated, and \n     unreserved Federal land to fulfill the entitlement arising \n     from the Act of June 20, 1910 (36 Stat. 557, chapter 310), \n     and the consent judgment known as the ``San Carlos Consent \n     Judgment'' entered in State of Arizona v.

A bill to amend title XI of the social Security Act to \ndirect the Commissioner of Social Security to conduct outreach efforts \nto increase awareness of the availability of Medicare cost-sharing \nassistance to eligible low-income Medicare beneficiaries, to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6124-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6124-S6141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE LOW-INCOME WIDOWS ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nintroduce the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act of 2000. Since 1988, \nCongress has established several programs to help pay the out of pocket \nmedical costs for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. These programs, \ncommonly referred to as Medicare Buy-in or QMB, SLMB, and QI-1, operate \nas federal-state partnerships and are funded through state Medicaid \nprograms. Depending on an eligible senior's income level, the programs \ncould cover the cost of Medicare Part B premiums, doctor visits, \ndeductibles, and co-payments.\n  Despite the availability of these programs, many seniors are not \naware that they may be eligible to receive these additional benefits. \nAccording to a 1998 Families USA study, there are somewhere between 3.3 \nand 3.8 million seniors in America who are eligible to receive these \nbenefits, but not currently receiving them. In my home state, the same \nstudy estimates that there are somewhere between 49,000 and 58,000 \nKentucky seniors who may be eligible for one of these assistance \nprograms but are not enrolled. While the actual task of enrolling \neligible seniors\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\nis left to the states, there are several important steps the federal \ngovernment, through the Social Security Administration (SSA), can and \nshould take.\n  A key component in improving participation in cost-sharing programs \nis the capacity of federal and state agencies to identify those \nindividuals who experience a reduction in income after they have \nalready enrolled in Social Security and Medicare. One group at \nparticular risk of reduced income in their later years is widowed \nspouses.\n  For anyone who has lost a loved one, the experience is often \noverwhelming both mentally and emotionally. The loss of a spouse leaves \nmany elderly with the difficult task of restructuring their lives in \norder to regain personal and financial stability. When SSA is informed \nthat a married individual has died, the agency recalculates the benefit \nto determine the new benefit level. Frequently, the widowed spouse's \nbenefit is lower than the amount the married couple received from \nSocial Security. This sets up a circumstance in which a widow who was \nnot previously eligible to receive QMB/SLMB benefits when she was \nmarried, would now be eligible to receive these benefits because her \nincome has fallen.\n  In an effort to address this serious problem, I am today introducing \nthe Low-Income Widows Assistance Act. This legislation directs Social \nSecurity to undertake outreach efforts designed to identify and notify \nindividuals who may be eligible for these expanded benefits. It also \naddresses the unique challenges facing widowed spouses by requiring \nthat when SSA recalculates the benefits for a recently widowed spouse \nand finds that he or she might be eligible for these assistance \nprograms, the agency must:\n  One, notify the beneficiary that he or she may now be eligible for \nthis additional assistance.\n  Two, notify the beneficiary's state that she may be eligible so that \nthey can begin their own outreach efforts.\n  In order to help better understand how the Low-Income Widows \nAssistance Act would work in practical terms, I would like my \ncolleagues to imagine the following scenario. Sally and Bob enjoyed 60 \nyears of marriage, but just last fall, Bob suddenly passed away. Since \nBob's death, Sally has been having a hard time making ends meet. She \nnow has a lot of expenses to take care of on her own: making the house \npayment, buying food and clothes, and paying for doctors' visits and \nprescriptions--and not to mention the ``extras'' like birthday and \nChristmas presents for her many grandchildren. While her expenses \nremain essentially the same, Sally's Social Security survivors benefit \nis lower than what she and Bob were receiving.\n  Under the Low-Income Widows Assistance Act, when SSA recalculates \nSally's benefit and finds that her monthly Social Security check has \nfallen below the $855 threshold for SLMB eligibility, the agency would \nbe required to notify Sally that she may be eligible for SLMB benefits. \nSSA also would be required to notify Sally's state government that she \nmay be eligible for these additional benefits. It is my hope that the \nstates would then use this information to conduct their own outreach \nefforts to enroll Sally and others like her.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, as well \nas Congressmen Lewis and Fletcher who are introducing similar \nlegislation in the House, to help low-income widows by enacting the \nLow-Income Widows Assistance Act of 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2815. A bill to provide for the nationwide designation of 2-1-1 as \na toll-free telephone number for access to information and referrals on \nhuman services, to encourage the deployment of the toll-free telephone \nnumber, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my \ncolleague, Senator Snowe, a bill to designate 2-1-1 as the nationwide, \ntoll-free number to access health and human services. Such designation \nis needed to simplify access to the maze of numbers and service \norganizations that currently exist. These organizations, which exist to \nhelp people, are useless if those in need do not know how to access the \nservices provided.\n  Imagine a single mother who needs shelter and dinner one night for \nherself and her children. Although she may know of a shelter providing \nthese services, there may be one closer that better fits her needs by \ncatering to children and women in need. 2-1-1 could provide her with a \ntargeted referral to a shelter specializing in child care and \nempowering mothers to get back on their feet. Or, visualize an older \nAmerican on a fixed income, who may need assistance paying her \nelectricity bill during a particularly cold month, can call 2-1-1 for a \nreferral to an agency to assist her with her need. Also, if someone has \ngoods or services she would like to donate to her community, she can \ncall 2-1-1 for a referral to an agency with a specific need for her \nitems or time. All 2-1-1 calls are confidential and unaffiliated with \ngovernment agencies.\n  The United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta has implemented 2-1-1 service \nwith much success. Not only has this consolidation of human services \nreferrals provided direction and aid to those in need, it also has \nhelped pool the resources of area charitable organizations. This \npooling of resources has eliminated duplication and highlighted gaps in \ncurrent service, which in turn has improved the delivery of services to \nthe citizens of Metro Atlanta. Because of the great success in Atlanta, \nthe United Way and other non-profit groups are attempting to replicate \nthis service in almost every state in the nation. Petitions to \ndesignate 2-1-1 as a referral to health and human services have been \napproved or are pending in several other states. However, 2-1-1 offers \nsuch an important service to communities, that I believe it is time to \nreserve this number nationwide. Several states have indicated \nreservations about pending petitions without direction from the \nappropriate federal agencies that 2-1-1 will not be used for another \npurpose. Senator Snowe and I believe it is time to indicate to state \nand federal regulators Congress's clear support for 2-1-1.\n  One of the unique aspects of 2-1-1 in Metropolitan Atlanta, which I \nbelieve can be replicated in the other states, is the generous support \nit has received from the community through private donations. This \nfunding model is one of the unique aspects of this legislation. \nSpecifically, the bill stipulates that none of the costs of 2-1-1 \nservice shall be passed on to telephone customers but will be supported \nby the organizations operating the 2-1-1 service.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit a letter endorsing this \nlegislation signed by the United Way of America, the American Red \nCross, the Alliance for Children and Families, Girls Scouts of the \nUnited States of America, United Jewish Communities, Lutheran Services \nof America, and Volunteers of America to name only a few. I realize \nthat N-1-1 numbers are finite in availability, but 2-1-1 is a service \nin the public interest that needs a national designation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation that will enable Americans, no \nmatter where they are, to obtain the assistance they need through the \nuse of a three digit number.\n  I ask consent that a copy of the United Way letter and a copy the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONWIDE DESIGNATION OF TOLL-FREE TELEPHONE \n                   NUMBER FOR ACCESS TO HUMAN SERVICES INFORMATION \n                   AND REFERRAL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) N-1-1 codes, or 3-digit abbreviated dialing telephone \n     numbers, provide Americans with easy, efficient, nationwide \n     access to emergency and nonemergency information that serves \n     the public interest.\n       (2) Individuals and families often find it difficult to \n     navigate the complex and ever growing maze of human services \n     agencies and programs and often spend inordinate amounts of \n     time in trying to identify the agency or program that \n     provides a service that may be immediately or urgently \n     required.\n       (3) Americans desire to volunteer and become involved in \n     their communities, and this desire, together with a desire to \n     donate to organizations which provide human services, are \n     among the reasons to call a center\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\n     which provides information and referrals on human services.\n       (4) The number ``2-1-1'' is easy-to-remember and \n     universally recognizable and would serve well as the \n     designation of a telephone service for linking individuals \n     and families to information and referral centers which could, \n     in turn, make critical connections between individuals and \n     families in need and appropriate human services agencies, \n     including both community-based organizations and government \n     agencies.\n       (5) United Ways and other non-profit and governmental \n     centers that provide information about and referrals to human \n     services have secured funding for the establishment, \n     implementation, and current operation in the United States of \n     three centers that provide such information and referrals and \n     are accessed through the telephone number 2-1-1.\n       (6) United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, Contact Helpline of \n     Columbus, Georgia, and United Way of Connecticut currently \n     utilize the telephone number 2-1-1 for the purpose of access \n     to information about and referral to human services.\n       (7) Since United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta and United Way \n     of Connecticut switched from 10-digit telephone numbers for \n     access to their centers of information and referral on human \n     services to the telephone number 2-1-1 for access to such \n     centers, the volume of calls received at such centers has \n     increased by approximately 40 percent. The centers of United \n     Way of Metropolitan Atlanta and United Way of Connecticut \n     each handled approximately 200,000 calls in 1999.\n       (8) Rapid deployment nationwide of the telephone number 2-\n     1-1 as a means of access to information about and referral to \n     human services requires coordination among State governments \n     and the information and referral centers of many localities.\n       (9) Alabama, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Utah have \n     approved petitions for the implementation of the telephone \n     number 2-1-1 statewide for that purpose, and implementation \n     of the use of that number for that purpose is underway. \n     Jurisdictions in Louisiana and Tennessee have also designated \n     the use of 2-1-1 for that purpose.\n       (10) Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin are \n     considering petitions to designate the telephone number 2-1-1 \n     for that purpose.\n       (11) Florida and Virginia have developed statewide models \n     for telephone access for that purpose.\n       (12) The use of 2-1-1 for that purpose is being consider by \n     nearly every other State.\n       (b) Designation of Toll-Free Human Services Access \n     Telephone Number.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 251(e) of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 251(e)) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) Human services access telephone number.--\n       ``(A) Designation.--The Commission, and each commission or \n     other entity to which the Commission has delegated authority \n     under this subsection, shall designate 2-1-1 as a toll-free \n     telephone number within the United States for access to \n     information and referral centers for information about and \n     referral to providers of human services, including \n     information and referrals for purposes of volunteering and \n     making donations.\n       ``(B) Applicability.--The designation under subparagraph \n     (A) shall apply to wire and wireless telephone service.\n       ``(C) Payment of Costs.--The costs of a telecommunications \n     carrier in providing access to a provider of information and \n     referrals through the telephone number designated under this \n     paragraph shall be borne by the provider of such information \n     and referrals.\n       ``(D) Call location information.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall be construed to require any telecommunications carrier \n     to provide call location information to a provider of \n     information or referrals on human services through the \n     telephone number designated under this paragraph.\n       ``(E) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       ``(i) Human services.--The term `human services' means \n     services as follows:\n\n       ``(I) Services that assist individuals in becoming more \n     self-sufficient, in preventing dependency, and in \n     strengthening family relationships.\n       ``(II) Services that support personal and social \n     development.\n       ``(III) Services that help ensure the well-being of \n     individuals, families, and communities.\n\n       ``(ii) Information and referral center.--The term \n     `information and referral center' means a center that--\n\n       ``(I) maintains a database of providers of human services \n     in a State or locality;

Since United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta and United \n     Way of Connecticut switched from 10-digit I numbers to 211, \n     the volume of calls received at both has increased by 40 \n     percent, with each handling over 200,000 calls in 1999.\n       A petition to nationally designate 211 for health and human \n     services I submitted by the 211 Collaborative, of which \n     United Way and the Alliance of Information and Referral \n     Systems are members, has awaited action by the Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC) for well over a year. FCC \n     inaction leaves current and ongoing 211 implementation in \n     state and local jurisdictions in jeopardy. Additionally, some \n     state public utility commissions have indicated they will not \n     take action on 211 petitions before the FCC makes its \n     decision. Further, with 211 being considered or implemented \n     in 45 states, if the FCC designates the number for a \n     different purpose, all current and future 211 call centers \n     would need to make significant expenditures and do \n     considerable outreach to convert to a new, 10-digit number.\n       Legislation designating 211 for human services I would \n     alleviate these concerns and would bypass a potentially \n     lengthy and uncertain FCC approval process.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to establish permanent recreation fee \nauthority; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               the recreational fee authority act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I come before you to today to discuss one \nof our nation's most valued assets--our National Parks.\n  Throughout the history of our country, visionary statesmen have \narisen to remind us of the natural resource heritage on which our \ncountry rests. As early as 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt, spoke of \nthe challenge at hand:\n\n       We must handle the woods, the water, the grasses so that we \n     will hand them to our children and our children's children in \n     better and not worse shape than we got them.\n\n  It is a challenge we still face today, and will into the future, in \nour role as stewards of the world in which we live.\n  Our system of National Parks and other public lands is the envy of \nthe world. It serves as a model for other countries, as they also seek \nto preserve their natural and cultural heritage. No other country has \nset aside as full a spectrum of public lands--from wilderness to urban \nparks--for people to use and enjoy. But to just set them aside is, of \ncourse, not enough. The feature that makes these lands remarkable--that \nthey are open and accessible to all Americans to enjoy--also threatens \ntheir existence in the future.\n  Mr. President, we face an ironic question: are we loving our national \nparks to death? The simple answer to that question is yes.\n  Earlier this year, the National Parks Conservation Association \nreleased its list of the Ten Most Endangered National Parks. We should \nall feel ashamed that they have so many endangered Parks from which to \nchose. This year's list includes National Parks across the country, \nfrom Alaska to Arizona, from Tennessee to Hawaii. It also includes \nEverglades National Park in my state of Florida, where decades of human \nmanipulation have led to ecosystem destruction.\n\n  This list of the 2000 Ten Most Endangered National Parks is \nunfortunately not comprehensive, but is representative. During the past \nyear I have visited several national parks to get a first hand view of \nthe problem. From personal experience, I can enlarge the list of \nendangered national parks.\n  At Ellis Island National Monument, a facade of immaculate buildings \nhides an inventory of dilapidated historical structures.\n  At Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico, lack of maintenance and \nvandalism is leading to the deterioration of historical artifacts.\n  I recently witnessed a similar deterioration of marine-related \nartifacts at a park in my own state of Florida.\n  In April I participated in my 359th work day at Biscayne National \nPark, a chain of subtropical islands protecting mangrove shoreline, \ninterrelated marine systems and the northernmost coral reef in the \nUnited States. This was my 4th workday in a National Park.\n  At Biscayne National Park, we Americans are in danger of losing a \npiece of our history. The HMS Fowey, an 18th century British warship, \nlies submerged in a highly unstable location. This very significant, \nnational register site has been weakened by looting, prop-wash \ndeflection, storms and other forces. The best choice available is to \nexcavate the wreckage and recover whatever of the historical record we \ncan. This kind of operation is well beyond the means of Biscayne \nNational Park's annual operating budget.\n  My feelings about the National Park System are truly of wonder. The \nwonder that I feel at the treasures in our park system is only matched \nby my wonder at how we can take such treasures for granted. The \nimportance of our National Parks should be reflected in our stewardship \nof the National Park System. We have failed to provide the National \nPark Service with the tools it needs to be good stewards of our \nNational Parks.\n  Today, with my colleagues Senator Akaka, Senator L. Chafee and \nSenator McCain, I am introducing the ``National Parks Stewardship \nAct''.\n  I would also like to include for the record a letter from the \nNational Parks Conservation Association expressing that organization's \nsupport for this legislation.\n  This legislation seeks to give the National Park Service the tools it \nneeds to prepare for the next century. It also includes many of the \nproposals of others who feel strongly about the importance of our \nNational Parks.\n  This bill gives park managers the protective tools needed to support \nthe stewardship challenges of Theodore Roosevelt. We provide three \ntypes of tools: resource protection, financial tools and human \nresources.\n  The first element in the resource protection section of my bill deals \nwith activities occurring outside park boundaries.\n  My inspiration for this was legislation introduced by the late \nSenator John Chafee who proposed the formation of ``park protection \nareas'' in 1986. John Chafee proposed that these areas be formed \noutside park boundaries to create the ``buffer zone'' needed for \nresource protection.\n  I identified strongly with this concept, having worked since the \n1970's on a state-federal partnership for Everglades restoration that \nfocuses heavily on providing a buffer zone for Everglades National \nPark. Today, the original boundaries of Everglades National Park are \nsurrounded by Big Cypress Preserve, an expanded park boundary, and \nundeveloped land on the eastern side of the park.\n  It is as a memorial to John Chafee that I echo his provision in my \nbill, which I hope will become a permanent component of National Park \nstewardship. It is an honor to have Lincoln Chafee, a fine statesman in \nhis own right, as a co-sponsor.\n  The federal government must be unified in its stewardship of the \nNational Parks.\n  My legislation requires that federal agencies taking action on lands \nbordering National Park units consult with the Department of the \nInterior to ensure such actions do not degrade or destroy National Park \nresources.\n  It also requires the Secretary of the Interior to prohibit actions on \nInterior lands that will adversely impact Park resources.\n  The second action I propose to protect park resources relates to park \nuses.\n  The National Park Stewardship Act requires that activities allowed in \nNational Parks pass the test of compatibility with natural, cultural \nand historical resource protection. As our parks are used and enjoyed \nby visitors, we must ensure that park resources are not inadvertently \ndamaged. For example, the Park Service recently issued regulations \nlimiting or prohibiting the use of personal water craft in some areas. \nThis action was only taken after the use of these water craft in some \nareas was allowed at intensities seriously degrading water and air \nquality, and threatening both park wildlife and other park visitors.\n  My bill requires the National Park Service to take action to protect \nthese resources before damage occurs. Activities must be analyzed and \nthe impacts understood before they are authorized. It also asks the \nNational Parks to seriously plan for the future, projecting visitation \nand use trends and identify needed personnel and facilities.\n\n  Another resource protection portion of the bill focuses on ensuring \nthat our National Park System fully represents the history of our \nnation. Each year, a smaller percentage of the American population can \ntrace its ancestry to those who landed at Plymouth rock, settled \nJamestown, or fought in the American revolution. Many Americans are \ndescended from people who crossed international boarders from the North \nor South, or landed at locations from the Florida Keys to the Aleutian \nIslands, from Ellis Island to the island of Oahu. All those who came to \nsettle write their history alongside, and often atop the history of our \ncountry's native peoples.\n  The bill calls for a comprehensive look at the ethnic and cultural \ncontent of our National Park System. It asks the National Park Service \nto report this review to Congress, and to make recommendations on sites \nthat might round out the American story. It encourages cultural/ethnic \ngroups to nominate sites important to their heritage for inclusion in \nthe System, and to recommend changes in the interpretation of present \nsites to improve historic accuracy.\n  America is etched with a rich historical record. I commend those who \nhave\n\n[[Page S6128]]\n\nsucceeded in adding important heritage sites to the National park \nSystem. Units like the National Underground Railroad Network to \nFreedom, authorized by Congress in 1998, and the Juan Bautista de Anza \nNational Historic Trail in California, tracing the path of a party of \nSpanish colonists in 1776, ensure that these events do not pass from \nour historical landscape. There are certainly many as equally important \nsites to consider.\n  Mr. President, I would like to include in the Record letters from the \nAmbassador of Spain and the Spanish Institute for Military History and \nCulture. These letters exemplify the willingness of those who \ncontributed to the history of the United States to help in this effort. \nThe Ambassador points out how the Institute's letter, ``opens the way \nfor a cooperation between the two institutions that could result in a \nmuch better use of the many historical sites, of Spanish origin, on \nAmerican soil. They could ``make the stones speak'' to many people in \nthis country who are still unaware of a very rich and common \nheritage.'' I am sure other countries will be willing to help \nillustrate how the history of our country is linked to their own \nhistory.\n  Our National Park System, the treasured sites of American history, \nmust contain the history of all Americans. If not, our National Park \nSystem is like a partially woven tapestry, depicting only part of the \npicture. Instead let our National Park System be woven, whole and \nbeautiful, from the multi-colored threads of history of the people of \nthese United States.\n  I hope this proposal will move us one step closer to a National Park \nSystem where all Americans should be entitled to see the role of their \npeople in the exploration, settlement and development of this country. \nAnd I see it as complementing Senator Akaka's bill, S. 2478, calling \nfor a study on the ``Peopling of America,'' which I am honored to co-\nsponsor.\n  The second major section of the National Parks Stewardship act deals \nwith financial resources.\n  Last year, I introduced legislation with Senators Reid and Mack, S. \n819, the National Park Preservation Act, that would provide dedicated \nfunding to the National Park Service to restore and conserve the \nnatural, cultural and historic resources in our park system. We \ncontinue to work toward final passage of S. 819. However, this bill \nalone does not meet all of the needs in our National Parks.\n  The need for construction and maintenance in National Parks is great. \nBacklog estimates range from 2 to 8 billion dollars, depending on the \nmethod of calculation.\n  In order to accommodate many visitors each year, some National Parks \nhave facilities and services that rival those of towns or small cities. \nAlong with these facilities come the problems of infrastructure \nmaintenance and repair that are beyond the reach of annually \nappropriated budgets.\n  Even at Yellowstone National Park, certainly a crown jewel of the \nsystem, a dilapidated sewer system leaking untreated waste befouls what \nshould be pristine streams and lakes. At Yellowstone, a park visited by \nover 3 million people a year, certainly we should provide the means for \nfinancing a new sewer system.\n  My colleague Senator McCain addressed this need through his bill, S. \n831, which would authorize a portion of park entrance fees to be used \nto secure bonds for these very necessary capital improvements. Bonding \nwould seem to be a workable approach, if we could find an appropriate \nway for a federal agency to issue revenue bonds.\n  The National Parks Stewardship Act introduced today calls for the \nSecretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior to study \nand report to Congress how National Parks could issue revenue bonds to \nmeet such large infrastructure needs.\n  The authority to issue revenue bonds places into the hands of \nNational Park superintendents a tool to generate the funds to make \nthese repairs.\n  The second revenue provision I propose is to make the recreation fee \nprogram in operation as a demonstration since its authorization in 1996 \ninto a permanent park program. The program has demonstrated that park \nvisitors can get a good return on the fees they pay; a return paid out \nin better maintained facilities, improved visitor services, and all-in-\nall, a more enjoyable park visit.\n  To underscore the importance of recreation fee permanence, I, along \nwith Senator Gorton, am introducing today the ``Recreation Fee \nAuthority Act of 2000,'' a stand along piece of legislation containing \nthese provisions.\n  In fiscal year 1999, the recreation fee demonstration program \ngenerated $176.4 million in fee revenue at National Parks, National \nForests, National Wildlife Refuges and Bureau of Land Management sites. \nEven more important than the amount collected is the fact that the \nlarge majority of the fees were retained at the site where collected \nfor use in Park operations, maintenance, resource protection and \nvisitor services.\n\n  Biscayne National Park, where I worked for a day in April, is one of \nthe units benefitting from the recreation fee demonstration program. \nLast year, that park collected over $20,000 in recreation fees. At \nBiscayne, these funds were used to:\n  replace the broken tables and grills in the picnic area;\n  restore a historic breeze way trail across Elliott Key; and\n  renovate the public showers and bathrooms on Elliott Key, improving \ntheir accessibility for people with disabilities.\n  When park visitors see their ``fees at work'' in the form of improved \nfacilities and services, research has shown that they understand and \nsupport the collection of an appropriate and reasonable fee. Over 95 \npercent of respondents to this year's National Survey on Recreation and \nthe Environment felt reasonable fees were acceptable as a means for \nfunding recreation services on public lands.\n  The recreation fee demonstration authority is temporary. If it is not \nextended or made permanent, Biscayne and other National Parks will lose \nthis very necessary means to get the job done. Let's instead make this \na permanent tool for National Park Stewardship.\n  In addition to revenue bonding and the recreation fee program, I \npropose the expanded use of Challenge Cost Share agreements, which \nallow the ``leveraging'' of Park Service appropriations with funds from \nthe private sector and other federal agencies.\n  The final tool I propose in this legislation focuses on the \nprofessional skills of those we employ as the stewards for National \nParks. Professionals typically attracted to the Service come from many \nfields, including education, recreation management, and the biological \nsciences. Today park managers must also demonstrate fiscal and program \naccountability and management planning, skills that are not found \nthroughout National Park Service ranks.\n  I am proposing a pilot program, ``Professionals for Parks'', to \nattract needed skilled professionals to National Park Service careers. \nIt will focus on recruiting at business schools across the country, \noffering talented graduates an entry level professional job within the \nNational Park Service and a student loan buy-back program.\n  Professionals for Parks will add to National Park Service ranks the \nbusiness management skills needed for better management, leading to \nlong term stewardship. And we know this can make a difference.\n  We're looking for people like Nick Hardigg, a recent graduate of the \nYale School of Management, who is now working as Chief of Concessions \nat Denali National Park. His financial analysis of the visitor \ntransportation system in Denali led to a newly negotiated contract with \nthe bus company. This contract allows for a healthy profit for the \noperator and for the first time in several years does not increase fees \nto park visitors. It also protects park resources by providing a \nquality transportation system.\n  It's a long way from the Ivy League to the Alaskan wilderness. Mr. \nHardigg has made that journey, and has put his business skills to good \nuse for National Park stewardship.\n  Mr. President, the National Park Stewardship Act is not calling for a \nrevolution in the National Park System. It recognizes the value of what \nwe have in the National Park System, recognizes what we stand to lose \nwithout immediate attention, and supplies the tools to the right people \nto tackle the job.\n  In closing I would like to recall the words of John Chafee, a \nvisionary\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\nstatesman who helped craft much of the foundation on which our system \nof environmental protection rests.\n  In 1994, he reminded us of the importance of our Parks stewardship \nrole:\n\n       I can think of no instance where the Government has \n     designated an area as a park and years later people have \n     looked back, regretted the decision, and tried to reverse it. \n     As we continue to develop and extract resources from the \n     remaining open spaces in our Nation, it is important that we \n     ensure that there will always be places where people can get \n     away and renew their spirits, breathe fresh air, and \n     appreciate nature's gifts.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                     Conservation Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2000.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The National Parks and Conservation \n     Association (NPCA) would like to commend you and your \n     cosponsors for the introduction of the National Parks \n     Stewardship Act. This bill includes many provisions that will \n     promote better protection and management of national park \n     resources.\n       As you know, the beginning of the 21st century is a \n     watershed moment for Americans and our National Park System. \n     One hundred and twenty-eight years after the establishment of \n     Yellowstone, we have a magnificent park system that stretches \n     from the coast of Maine to the tropical reefs of American \n     Samoa. Millions people visit and enjoy these parks every \n     year.\n       However, the National Park System also is severely \n     troubled. Threats to the health of the National Park System \n     fall into several broad categories: lack of funding; \n     activities that damage park resources from inside and outside \n     park boundaries; and poor management. As a result, basic \n     information about park resources is lacking, much of the \n     infrastructure and visitor services are in poor condition, \n     and parks are increasingly jeopardized by activities around \n     them.\n       Your National Stewardship Act addresses many of these \n     concerns by:\n       Facilitating the issuance of national park revenue bonds \n     that would help finance needed improvements at national \n     parks;\n       Requiring that all activities in national parks be \n     consistent with resource protection and preservation;\n       Ensuring that other federal government agencies respect the \n     integrity of national park lands;\n       Promoting the protection of the historical documents in \n     National Park Service collections;\n       Expanding the opportunities for national park managers to \n     develop public administration and business management skills.\n       The National Parks Stewardship Act also ensures that the \n     National Park System will better represent the diverse \n     heritage of all people of the United States. Support for the \n     National Park System runs deep in the hearts of millions of \n     Americans. That support, however, will wane if significant \n     numbers of people feel disconnected from the message and \n     meaning of the parks. To ensure continued public support, and \n     historical relevance, the National Parks Stewardship Act \n     requires that the National Park Service review existing sites \n     to determine if there are deficiencies in the accurate \n     representation of all peoples that contributed to the shaping \n     of the United States. We commend you for this farsighted \n     proposal.\n       Thank you for undertaking this effort to assure the \n     vitality of the National Park System through the 21st century \n     and beyond. We look forward to promoting this legislation \n     with you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas C. Kiernan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       El Embajador de Espana,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, I have read with the utmost interest your \n     proposed legislation on the role of the National Park Service \n     of the United States in conservation and promotion of \n     historic sites in this country.\n       With respect to the numerous monuments left by Spain in the \n     southern States, we would certainly welcome all possible \n     cooperation with the Park Service to give these venerable \n     ruins a real cultural and educational purpose. We believe \n     that solid support from historians and other experts from \n     Spanish official institutions such as our Ministry of Defense \n     or the Institute for the Protection of Historic Legacy, could \n     make these sites incite the interest of new generations on \n     pages of their past that they might have insufficient \n     knowledge of.\n       I have written to the two aforementioned Spanish cultural \n     institutions to ensure their willingness to collaborate with \n     the National Park Service on the goals set forth in the draft \n     Resolution.\n       In the meantime, let me assure you of our enthusiastic \n     support for your initiative that I certainly hope will muster \n     the necessary backing from the rest of the Senate.\n       Thanking you most warmly for your enlightened defense of \n     the cultural integrity of this great country.\n       I remain,\n           Yours very sincerely,\n     Antonio de Oyarzabal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       El Embajador de Espana,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2000.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, I am pleased to enclose the attached letter \n     from my friend General Penaranda, the Director of the \n     Institute for Military History and Culture in Madrid, in \n     response to my request for support to your initiative in \n     Congress, on behalf of the ``National Park Service.''\n       I think General Penaranda's very enthusiastic answer opens \n     the way for a cooperation between the two institutions that \n     could result in a much better use of the many historical \n     sites, of Spanish origin, on American soil. They could ``make \n     the stones speak'' to many young people in this country who \n     are still unaware of a very rich and common heritage.\n\n\n                                           Embajada de Espana,\n\n                                             Madrid, May 29, 2000.\n     His Excellency Ambassador Antonio de Oyarzabal Marchesi,\n     Ambassador of Spain to the U.S.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador and Friend: It gives me great pleasure to \n     be able to oblige you with regard to the wishes of the \n     National Park Service which you refer to in your letter of \n     April 26. I have consulted this Institute's Standing \n     Committee on Historical Studies (Comision Permanente de \n     Estudios Historicos) regarding the possibility of satisfying \n     the possible American request, and it could not be more \n     favorably disposed to the idea. It is very satisfying to be \n     able to cooperate in some way in the efforts to heighten the \n     historical value of the old Spanish military monuments in the \n     U.S. as well as that of any other collection of documents, \n     books or movables that can be considered part of this \n     important historical legacy.\n       This institute has a considerable collection of documents \n     and artifacts in its archives relating to the ancient \n     viceroyalty and overseas provinces. Most of the items have \n     already been catalogued (some have even been studied by U.S. \n     specialists). Now we are in the advanced stages of \n     negotiation with Puerto Rico whose Legislative Assembly has \n     already allocated a budget for cataloguing, microfilming and \n     digitizing all the material in our historical military \n     archives about matters related to that island.\n       In any case, Antonio, you know that you can count on the \n     Institute for Military History and Culture to initiate a \n     collaborative effort with the National Park Service. It would \n     be advisable to establish direct contact between the National \n     Park Service and this Institute so as to define the matters \n     of most interest to them. While we could begin in writing, a \n     trip to Spain by a director or historian of the Park Service \n     so that they might gain an understanding in situ of our \n     capabilities with regard to their projects would be very \n     fruitful. They will be most warmly received.\n       I am at your service!\n           With my best regards,\n                                     Juan Ma de Penaranda y Algar.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Graham, in introducing legislation today that seeks to \npermanently authorize the recreation fee program for the federal land \nmanagement agencies. Congress authorized the Recreation Fee \nDemonstration Program in the FY 1996 Omnibus Consolidated Recissions \nand Appropriations Act, and has extended the program through the \nInterior Appropriations bill several times since 1996.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, the fees collected by the National Park \nService and Forest Service have been a tremendous additional resource \nto provide improved campgrounds, trails, and other visitor facilities. \nAs chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, I have \nconsistently provided increases for operations, maintenance, and repair \nof park, forest, and refuge facilities. Regardless, this country's love \naffair with recreation and the great outdoors has begun to take its \ntoll on the public lands we enjoy so much.\n  Since I took over the chairmanship of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I also have been faced with an unending list of federal \nland acquisition proposals. The demand to increase the federal \ngovernment's land base cannot be considered in a vacuum, especially \nwhen we're faced with at least a $12 billion maintenance backlog on the \nlands we already own. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office \nrecommended last year that the federal government place a ten-year \nmoratorium on land acquisitions in an effort to address the backlog in \nmaintenance projects.\n  I don't support taking such an extreme step. Rather, I believe we can \nhave a reasonable level of land acquisitions, but we also need to \ncommit to\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\nfinding the additional resources to maintain what we already have. I am \ncommitted to providing access to our public lands, but this can only \nhappen if we have enough funding to maintain the land and facilities \ntreasured by Americans and visitors from all over the world.\n  Over the past five years of the fee demonstration project, the \nfederal agencies have tested various types of fees and collection \nmethods in preparation for the possibility of some day establishing a \nlong-term, consistent, and fair fee program. In general terms, the \nproject has been a great success, providing the federal land management \nagencies nearly $200 million last year in additional revenue for \nmaintenance and repair projects, and resources for improved visitor \nservices.\n  In 1999, at the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie Forest in my state, the program \nallowed this Forest to clear 739.6 miles of trail, hire 22 trail \nmaintenance workers, develop leveraged partnerships with non-profit \ngroups to accomplish maintenance work with volunteers, and maintain 67 \ntrailhead toilets and 136 trailheads. All of this vital work was \naccomplished by charging $3 for day passes or $25 for an annual pass.\n  Last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported the Interior \nAppropriations bill, which extends the Recreation Demonstration Fee \nProgram through the end of fiscal year 2002. Despite my resistance to \nusing the Interior bill to continue this program, I felt it was vital \nto provide the agencies certainty for another year. In fact, recent \nimprovements to the Forest Service fee program in the Northwest, \nincluding the new Northwest Forest Pass, would have been jeopardized \nwithout the extension.\n  With that said, I believe the Senate, through the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, deserves the opportunity to fully consider \nlegislation to permanently authorize the recreation fee program. The \nsuccess stories are abundant, but by no means am I blind to the \nproblems we've seen over the past five years. Most importantly, the \npublic deserves the opportunity to participate, both through hearings \nand contact with their elected representatives, to provide us the input \nwe need to authorize a permanent program.\n  That's why I have chosen to join Senator Graham today in introducing \na bill to begin the debate over how and whether Congress should \npermanently authorize the recreation fee program. The bill we've \ncrafted provides the framework for a permanent program that will build \nupon the successes and correct the problems we've seen so far.\n  I want to stress that this bill will serve as the starting point for \nwhat I hope to be a full and deliberative discourse on recreation fees. \nI intend to work with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to \nhold a series of hearings, including field hearings, so representatives \nof recreation groups, gateway communities, and other interested parties \ncan air their concerns and suggestions. My staff and I have spent a \nconsiderable amount of time meeting and talking with recreation groups \nbased in Washington state. I am certain there will be many ways we can \nimprove the legislation introduced today to address their concerns \nthrough the committee process, and I am excited to continue that \ndialogue.\n  It goes without saying that no one really wants to pay a fee to \nrecreate on public lands. The key to making a permanent program a \nsuccess in the future will depend on keeping the fees reasonable and \nthe results tangible. The most important component of the Recreation \nFee Demonstration Project is the requirement that 80 percent of the \nfees remain at the site the fees are collected. The legislation \nintroduced today maintains that requirement. In addition, Congress and \nthe Administration must make a firm commitment to uphold its \nresponsibility to continue to increase appropriations in the future to \nreduce the maintenance backlog. It's a two-way street, and we must all \ndo our part.\n  Further, I fully expect to address other issues raised by my friends \nin the recreation community. Although the situation has improved \nrecently, the multiple fee structures tested by the Forest Service \ncreated a confusing and frustrating situation for hikers and rock \nclimbers. In particular, rock climbers have been hit with multiple fees \nfor just one visit to the forest. Many recreationists are calling for \nmulti-agency passes. I find this idea intriguing and would urge further \ndiscussion through the committee process. I must note, however, that \nmulti-agency fees may distract from the expectation that fees remain at \nthe facilities and sites where they are collected. Further, some \noutdoor enthusiasts are concerned the fee program could inspire over-\nbuilding on our public lands to justify collection of the fees. I, too, \nam concerned with preserving the integrity of our public lands and \navoiding the impulse to provide unnecessary facilities. This \nlegislation directs the agencies to place a priority on deferred \nmaintenance projects. But again, these are topics that deserve \nthoughtful discussion, and I look forward to addressing them in the \nnear future.\n  Finally, many active recreationists have made a strong case for \ndeveloping a recognition program that rewards volunteers for dedicating \ntheir time to improving our public lands. Many forests and parks have \nwell-developed volunteer programs, while others do not. I am dedicated \nto working with recreation groups to provide the agencies appropriate \nguidelines in the bill to develop a consistent program that provides \nvolunteers reduced or free access to our public lands.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague from Florida for being a leader \nin the protection of the nation's public lands. I look forward to \nworking with him, and the members of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, to authorize a permanent program that provides necessary \nresources to maintain and improve these national treasures for \ngenerations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 2818. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nestablish a flexible fallow program under which a producer may idle a \nportion of the total planted acreage of the loan commodities of the \nproducer in exchange for higher loan rates for marketing assistance \nloans on the remaining acreage of the producer; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n           the food security and land stewardship act of 2000\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to amend \nthe 1996 farm bill. This legislation is really the culmination of at \nleast two years of work on the part of two agricultural producers from \nmy home State of South Dakota. These two individuals, Craig Blindert of \nSalem and Phil Cyre of Watertown, have devoted an enormous amount of \ntime and energy refining the proposal I am introducing today and I want \nto express my thanks and gratitude.\n  While some policy makers purport to have all the answers to \nagricultural policy and our current economic disaster in farm country, \nI am proud that two South Dakota farmers approached me with their plan. \nMr. Blindert and Mr. Cyre exhibit a quality inherent to a farmer that \nmost policy makers will never exhibit, something I call ``tractor seat \ncommon sense.'' Former President Eisenhower once said, farming looks \nmighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles away \nfrom a farm. Instead of pretending I have all of the answers, I think \nit just makes good practical sense to listen to farmers who know their \nbusiness better than anyone in the world, and that is what I have tried \nto do with this proposal.\n  Unfortunately, all of that expertise our farmers demonstrate about \nthe production of crops and livestock, marketing, and risk management \nmeans little when our farm policy and agribusinesses minimizes them \ninto mere price takers. The legislation I am introducing today attempts \nto allow farmers to become price setters in response to the free \nmarket, and it attempts to ensure responsibility from agribusiness to \nfinally offer a decent price for commodities.\n  The current economic setting and commodity price forecast for farmers \nand ranchers remains disastrous. Crop prices have absolutely collapsed \nwith corn prices at a 12 year low, soybeans prices at a 27 year low, \nand wheat prices that have not been so low since 1977. Meatpacker \nconcentration and unfair livestock dumping are still crippling \nlivestock producers. Prices paid for livestock have remained low in the \npork and lamb sectors while they have\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\nrecovered, at a very limited and still unprofitable rate, for cattle \nproducers. As a result, net farm income has plummeted to around $40 \nbillion this past year, plunging $9 billion from last year, without \ngovernment assistance. Agricultural exports are down over $11 billion \nfrom 1996, and constricted global demand for our agricultural products \nrestricts exports from boosting prices.\n  It is clear that once again this disastrous marketplace clouds the \nlandscape of rural America as a woefully inadequate farm bill continues \nto rip the safety net from beneath farmers and ranchers. If not for \ngovernment market loss assistance the last three years--a record level \nof $23 billion in 1999--many hard-working farmers and ranchers might be \nout of business.\n  The course of the last few years under the current farm bill has \ngiven all of us the opportunity to measure the theories of Freedom to \nFarm against the practical reality of experience. The measurable \nresults of that practical experience should convince Congress we cannot \ndelay to reform the current farm bill. Some tend to ignore this \nreality, choosing instead to overlook the flawed farm policy, in hopes \nthat over time our nation's family farmers and ranchers will find \nthemselves enjoying the prosperity of our booming economy. However, \nmost farmers merely read about this prosperity as they face escalating \nproduction expenses, eroding equity, and collapsing crop prices.\n  Delay in reforming farm policy is dangerous to the entire fabric of \nrural America. The other day a farmer remarked to me, ``the best time \nfor Congress to write a better farm bill would have been in 1996, but, \nthe next best time is today.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  Congress cannot continue to overlook the link between the current \nfinancial stress our family producers face and the 1996 farm bill \nprovisions which eliminated the financial safety net for farmers. \nConsequently, there should be no higher priority for this Congress to \naccomplish in farm policy than to restore a fair price from a truly \nfree marketplace.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is not a radical departure \nfrom the current farm bill. We try to reinforce the advantages of \nFreedom to Farm while improving upon other areas of our farm policy. \nCoined ``Flexible Fallow'' by the farmers who developed it, my proposal \nadds a voluntary, annual, conservation-use feature to the loan rate \nprovisions of the 1996 Farm Bill. Should a farmer desire to operate \nunder current farm bill conditions, my legislation ensures that \nopportunity. However, should a farmer need greater leverage over crop \nproduction and marketing, Flex Fallow guarantees that planting and \nmarketing flexibility.\n  Neil Harl of Iowa State University, arguably the most respected \nagricultural economist in the country, has enthusiastically endorsed my \nFlex Fallow proposal. In a letter to me he describes Flex Fallow as \n``the missing link to the 1996 farm bill.'' He believes this proposal \nwill function in a market oriented fashion and ensure that ``farmers \ncontinue to make production decisions based upon their own operations \nin a manner that makes economic sense.''\n  Mr. President, farmers electing to devote a portion of their total \ncrop acreage to conservation-use under my bill receive a higher loan \nrate on their remaining crop production. On an annual and crop-by-crop \nbasis, farmers can choose to conserve up to thirty percent of their \ntotal crop acreage.\n  An adjustable loan rate schedule is a key feature of this proposal. \nWith the exception of wheat and soybeans, the proposed base loan rates \nfor 0 percent participation in Flex Fallow (otherwise known as full \nproduction) are set at 2000 levels. Participation in Flex Fallow is \ndirectly proportional to increased loan rates. For corn, wheat, and \nsoybeans, loan rates increase by one percent for each one percent \nincrease in conservation-use.\n  In 1999, the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) \ncompleted an analysis of the Flex Fallow proposal. I believe the \nresults were very promising. In years and regions (areas of the country \nwith a wide basis) of low commodity prices, Flex Fallow encourages \nfarmers to voluntarily set-aside land in turn for a higher loan rate. \nYet in years of better commodity prices, farmers are inclined to \nproduce for the market, planting most or all of their land to crop \nproduction. The reduced plantings in years of poor crop prices, like \nthe last three years, would lead to higher crop prices. More \nspecifically, reduced plantings in the first two years of the program \nwould translate into the following higher crop prices. Corn prices rise \n27 cents per bushel over current levels, soybean prices climb 44 cents \nper bushel, wheat prices recover 29 cents per bushel, and cotton prices \nrise 9 cents per pound. The FAPRI analysis predicts a commodity price \nrecovery in the long-term, and the analysis found participation in Flex \nFallow to decline after 2002.\n  While I work on this amendment to the current farm bill, I am \nabsolutely open to other ideas and alternatives that revise our farm \npolicy. Unlike the authors of the 1996 farm bill, I do not cling to a \npride in authorship in a farm program. So, I want the opportunity to \nsupport as many viable alternatives as possible.\n  In summary, here are a few highlights of the Flex Fallow farm bill \namendment I am introducing today. Flex Fallow is flexible and \nadjustable enough to meet the needs of individual farm operations. Flex \nFallow is voluntary. Flex Fallow is market-oriented because it permits \nfarmers the freedom to plant for marketplace conditions. Flex Fallow \nemphasizes conservation practices. Flex Fallow updates yield data and \neliminates current base acres. Flex Fallow targets disaster assistance \nto producers who suffer from weather-related crop loss and price \ncollapse. Finally, Flex Fallow will result in a modest cost to \ntaxpayers. The FAPRI analysis finds net Commodity Credit Corporation \nexpenditures under Flex Fallow to compare with that of the 1996 farm \nbill without billion-dollar emergency spending additions.\n  In the coming months I anticipate a full airing of my Flex Fallow \namendment to the farm bill, alongside other pieces of farm bill reform \nlegislation that others in Congress may introduce. I expect to refine \nthis proposal after discussing it further with farmers and farm \norganizations across South Dakota and the entire country. As a result, \nit is likely I will introduce another piece of legislation similar to \nFlex Fallow in the next session of Congress, wherein two other \nsignificant issues will be addressed.\n  First, of critical importance to me is the need to design a farm bill \nin the future that targets the benefits to family-sized farmers and \nranchers. Too often, Congress and the Administration devise tactics to \nignore and plow under the existing farm program payment limitations. If \nwe have a limited amount of taxpayer funds in which to devote to price \nsupport for farmers, it simply makes sense to target those benefits to \nsmall and mid-sized family producers. While the amendment I introduce \ntoday does not alter current payments limits under the farm bill, I am \na strong supporter of targeting. As such, I will work to place \nsensible, responsible, payment limitations that provide benefits to all \nbut ensure targeted benefits to the small and mid-sized family farmers \nand ranchers who need and deserve greater attention from Congress.\n  Second, I believe Congress will be unable to develop a future farm \nbill without the support of those in the conservation and wildlife \ncommunity. I am a strong supporter of conservation programs that \nprotect sensitive soil and water resources, promote wildlife habitat, \nand provide farmers and landowners with benefits and incentives to \nconserve land. Flex Fallow can work very well with both short-term and \nlonger-term conservation practices. It is my goal to bring conservation \ngroups together with farm interests in order to develop a well-balanced \napproach to future farm policy that protects our resources while \npromoting family-farm agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Dr. Harl \nbe printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Iowa State University\n\n\n                                    of Science and Technology,\n\n                                         Ames, IA, April 17, 2000.\n     Senator Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: It is my understanding that \n     legislation based on the\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\n     ``Flexible-Fallow'' concept developed and advanced by Craig \n     Blindert and Phil Cyre of South Dakota is being prepared for \n     introduction. I would like to write in strong support of the \n     legislation and do so most enthusiastically.\n       Mr. Blindert called me in late 1998 with a request for a \n     half day to discuss a farm bill proposal. I was extremely \n     busy at the time but reluctantly agreed to set aside an \n     afternoon in late December. As the proposal was explained, I \n     could see that what Blindert and Cyre had developed was the \n     missing link for the 1996 farm bill. I wrote in strong \n     support of the proposal following that meeting--encouraging \n     an analysis by the Food and Agriculture Policy Research \n     Institute (FAPRI)-- and am even more supportive today.\n       The weak element of the 1996 farm bill was the downside \n     protection in the event of pressure on the supply side for \n     commodities. A series of normal to good weather years, a drop \n     of nearly 20 percent in exports and the relentless effects of \n     technology have combined to produce very low prices for most \n     crops.\n       What I find so appealing about the Blindert-Dyre proposal \n     is that--(1) the proposal would function in a market-oriented \n     manner; (2) it would be most appealing in the so-called \n     ``swing'' areas which are expected to shift land use patterns \n     when prices for intensively-produced crops are low and to \n     return to such production when prices recover; (3) the \n     proposal would self-correct when prices rise; (4) it would \n     entail only a modest amount of administrative involvement on \n     a discretionary basis; (5) it would enable producers to \n     continue to make decisions based on their own situation, in a \n     manner that makes economic sense to them; and (6) the cost \n     would be modest to taxpayers and to consumers.\n       I would be pleased to respond further in support of the \n     proposal. Mr. Blindert and Mr. Cyre are to be commended for \n     developing what I believe would be an enormously helpful \n     adjunct to the 1996 farm bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Neil E. Harl,\n       Charles F. Curtiss Distinguished Professor in Agriculture, \n     Professor of Economics and Director, Center for International \n     Agricultural Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2819. To provide for the establishment of an assistance program \nfor health insurance consumers; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                the health care consumer assistance act\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nJeffords today to introduce the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act. \nThis important legislation seeks to address a significant problem that \ncurrently exists in the health insurance market, the lack of a reliable \nsource of information and assistance for health care consumers.\n  In 1997, President Clinton's Health Quality Commission identified the \nneed for consumer assistance programs that allow consumers access to \naccurate, easily understood information and get assistance in making \ninformed decisions about health plans and providers. Earlier this \nmonth, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Consumer Reports \nmagazine released the results of a survey they conducted on consumer \nsatisfaction with their health plans. Their survey is part of a larger \nproject looking at ways to improve how consumers resolve problems with \ntheir health insurance plans. The survey found that while most people \nwho experienced a problem with their plan were often able to resolve \nthem, the majority of those surveyed were confused about where to go \nfor information and help if they have a problem with their health plan. \nEventhough a growing number of states have taken steps to give patients \nnew rights in dealing with their health insurance plans, most consumers \nare either unaware or do not know how to exercise those rights.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Jeffords seeks to \nremedy this information gap by providing grants to states that wish to \nestablish health care consumer assistance programs. These programs are \ndesigned to help consumers understand and act on their health care \nchoices, rights, and responsibilities. Under this bill, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services will offer states funds to create or \ncontract with an independent, nonprofit agency to provide a variety of \ninformation and support services for health care consumers, including \nthe following: educational materials for health care consumers about \nstrategies to resolve problems and grievances; operate a 1-800 \ntelephone hotline to respond to consumer inquiries; coordinate and make \nreferral to other private and public health care entities when \nappropriate; conduct education and outreach in the community; and \ncollect and disseminate data about nature of inquiries, problems and \ngrievances handled by the program.\n  The concept of a health care consumer assistance program has already \nreceived considerable support and several states have taken the \ninitiative to create these programs. Governors and state legislatures \nin many states including, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, \nNebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin \nhave introduced or enacted health care ombudsman legislation. While \nsome states have successfully launched their programs, other state \ninitiatives have faltered due to a lack of sufficient funding.\n  While important strides are being made to enhance health care \nconsumer information and resources, clearly more needs to be done to \nexpand access to these simple and cost-effective services to all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Americans deserve access to the \ninformation and assistance they need to be empowered and informed \nhealth care consumers. As the health insurance system becomes more \nconfusing and complex, it is critically important that as consumers \nnavigate this system, they have a place where they can go for \ninformation, counseling and assistance. As health plan options become \nmore complicated and the web of policies and principles governing those \nplans becomes more enmeshed, people need a reliable, accessible source \nof information, and state health care consumer assistance programs have \nproven their ability to meet this challenge. I look forward to working \nwith my colleague, Senator Jeffords, in advancing this important and \ntimely legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of my bill \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2819\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Consumer \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) People with health care insurance or coverage have many \n     more options with respect to coverage of, payment or payments \n     for, items, services or treatments. Also, their health plans, \n     coverages, rights, and providers are frequently being \n     reorganized, expanded, or limited.\n       (2) All consumers need information and assistance to \n     understand their health insurance choices and to maximize \n     their access to needed health services. Many do not \n     understand their health care rights or how to exercise them, \n     despite the current efforts of both the public and private \n     sectors.\n       (3) Few people with health care coverage have independent \n     credible sources of information or assistance to guide their \n     decisionmaking or to help resolve problems.\n       (4) It is important to maintain and strengthen a productive \n     working relationship between all consumers and their health \n     care professionals and health insurance providers.\n       (5) Federally initiated health care consumer assistance and \n     information programs targeted to consumers of long-term care \n     and to medicare beneficiaries under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) are effective, as are a \n     number of State and local consumer assistance initiatives.\n       (6) The principles, policies, and practices of health care \n     providers for delivering safe, effective, and accessible \n     health care can be enriched by State-based collaborative, \n     independent education, problem resolution, and feedback \n     programs. Health care consumer assistance programs have \n     proven their ability to meet this challenge.\n       (7) Health care consumers want and need reliable \n     information about their health care options that integrates \n     data and effective resolution strategies from the full range \n     of available resources. Health care consumer assistance \n     programs can provide that reliable, problem-solving \n     information to help in navigating the health care system.\n       (8) Health care delivered to individuals and within \n     communities can be improved by collecting and examining \n     consumers' experiences, questions, and problems and the ways \n     in which their questions and problems are resolved. Health \n     care consumer assistance programs can educate and inform \n     consumers to be more effective, self-directed health care \n     consumers.\n       (9) Many states have created health care consumer \n     assistance programs.

Mr. President, I am here today to join in introducing \nthe Health Care Consumer Assistance Act. This important bill has been \ncrafted to help Americans navigate our increasingly complex and ever \nchanging health care system. I want to recognize the leadership of \nSenator Jack Reed in bringing this issue forward for consideration.\n  Americans need and want help with their health care. In a recent \nnational survey, Consumers Report and the Kaiser Family Foundation \nlearned that half of all managed care plan members have had a problem \nwith their plan in the last year. The vast majority of those \n``problems'' were minor and successfully resolved in a very short \nperiod of time. However, a large number of Americans report significant \nfinancial consequences, lost time at work, or actual health declines as \na result of these disputes.\n  The same survey reports that 84% of Americans want ``an independent \nplace to turn for help'' with their health care rights. In fact, \nAmericans prefer, by a wide margin, an independent source of help, as \nprovided for in the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act, rather than a \nright to sue.\n  Three years ago, my own state recognized that Vermonters needed an \nindependent program to help them navigate the complex health care \ndelivery system. The state offices of the Division of Banking and \nInsurance and the Office of Vermont Health Access (our Medicaid agency) \njointly administer the Vermont Ombudsman. It has helped Vermonters find \ncare providers and use appeal procedures.\n  It is time for the federal government to play a constructive role in \naiding states like Vermont that will answer the needs of their citizens \nfor a consumer-focused, consumer-directed health care assistance \nprogram. This bill builds on the existing state-based programs to \nprovide an office that provides consumers with the basic and credible \ninformation they want and need to make all kinds of important health \ncare decisions.\n  The bill gives each State the opportunity to design a consumer \nassistance program that meets local needs. At the same time, the grant \nprogram calls upon the state to coordinate this overall health care \nconsumer assistance office's activities with its existing consumer \nassistance offices such as the long-term care Ombudsman program for \nlong term care consumers and its work in registering children and \nfamilies for S-CHIP.\n  Access to quality health care services is a priority for every \nAmerican family, every state, and this nation. It is clearly time for a \nfederal commitment to help families get the health care information and \nassistance they want and need.\n  Once again, I want to thank Senator Reed for this bipartisan effort \non such important health legislation. Health care consumers, plans, \nproviders, and states will be well served by enacting our legislation \nas soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (by request):\n  S. 2820. A bill to provide for a public interest determination by the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission with respect to repair, replacement, \nor refund actions, and to revise the civil and criminal penalties, \nunder both the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous \nSubstances Act; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n    the consumer product safety commission enhanced enforcement act\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce at the request of \nthe Administration and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission Enhanced Enforcement Act of \n2000. This legislation is designed to enhance the authority of the CSPC \nto prevent the manufacture and sale of defective products.\n  The legislation seeks to accomplish this goal in two significant \nways. First, it proposes to remove the cap that exists under current \nlaw on the maximum civil penalty that can be assessed to companies that \nmarket products in violation of federal consumer product safety \nregulations. Currently, the maximum civil penalty that can be assessed \nto companies that violate consumer product safety laws is $1,650,000, a \nfigure that is less than the amount that generally could be assessed by \nthe CPSC. According to the agency, in many instances, it seeks \npenalties against very large companies, which likely are not deterred \nby the $1,650,000 cap. Second, the legislation proposes to increase the \nCPSC's authority over recalls by authorizing the Commission to \ndetermine the manner in which a defective product is to be corrected. \nCurrently, a company that has marketed a defective product has the \nright to determine the remedy that is offered to the public, regardless \nof whether the selected remedy is the most effective solution. The \nproposed legislation alters this situation by permitting the CPSC to \nchoose the remedy that is best suited to protect the public as opposed \nto the company.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this act \non behalf of the Administration and the CPSC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 2823. A bill to amend the Andean Trade Preference Act to grant \ncertain benefits with respect to textile and apparel, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      the plan colombia trade act\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by Senators \nDeWine, Moynihan, Grassley, Dodd, Coverdell, and Biden, to introduce \nthe Plan Colombia Trade Act, a bill that would provide additional trade \nbenefits to the nations of the Andean Trade Pact, which includes \nBolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.\n  This bill is an important component of Plan Colombia, which seeks to \naddress not only the nation's crisis with respect to massive \nnarcotrafficking and insurgent and paramilitary forces, but also \nfocuses on Colombia's deep economic recession. The bill is consistent \nwith U.S. policy of promoting trade and combating drugs on a regional \nbasis, thereby ensuring that U.S. benefits and assistance provided to \none nation do not adversely affect other nations in the immediate \nregion. Such a strategy is the only way to avoid what is often \ndescribed as the ``balloon effect,'' which has meant that the drug \nproblem, at best, is displaced from one location to another. Finally, \nthe bill would re-assert our commitment to promote economic growth and \nregional stability throughout the Andean region, and to provide \nalternatives to the cultivation and exportation of illegal narcotics.\n  Passage of this legislation by the Senate will signal the United \nStates' support of the Andean Trade Pact's economic reform efforts, and \nwill boost the confidence of both domestic and international investors \nin pursuing\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\nbusiness opportunities that create jobs and enhance international trade \nin the Andean region, particularly in Colombia. In addition, this bill \nwould ensure that U.S. trade with these important nations is not \nadversely affected by the recent passage of the ``Trade and Development \nAct of 2000,'' which provided significant trade benefits to the \nCaribbean Basin.\n  To briefly summarize, the ``Plan Colombia Trade Act,'' would extend, \nfor approximately one year, additional trade benefits to Bolivia, \nColombia, Ecuador, and Peru-nations that currently benefit from the \nAndean Trade Preferences Act of 1991 (commonly known as the ATPA). New \ntrade benefits would include some--but not all--trade benefits extended \nto the nations of the Caribbean Basin under the ``Trade and Development \nAct of 2000,'' which was signed by the President on May 18, 2000. \nSpecifically, the bill would extend duty-free, quota-free treatment to \napparel articles assembled or cut in ATPA beneficiary nations using \nyarns and fabric wholly formed in the United States, thereby achieving \na measure of parity with the CBI nations, as well as expanding an \nimportant source of economic and employment growth for the U.S. textile \nand apparel industry.\n  In its March 2000 interim report, ``First Steps Toward a Constructive \nU.S. Policy in Colombia,'' a Council on Foreign Relations/Inter-\nAmerican Dialogue Independent Task Force--which I co-chair with Brent \nScowcroft--recommended the extension of the ATPA, to include the same \nbenefits as those contained under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. \nSpecifically, we recommended the following:\n\n       Indeed, Colombia's economic well-being is absolutely \n     critical, and in this area the United States can be more \n     helpful. Perhaps even more important than providing increased \n     assistance to the Colombian government to support employment \n     programs is assuring Colombia greater access to U.S. markets \n     for its products. Extending trade-related benefits to \n     Colombia would have a positive impact on the country's \n     prospects for higher growth and employment levels.\n\n  Although the bill provides benefits to all ATPA beneficiaries, it is \nparticularly critical to Colombia, which in 1998 exported 59 percent of \nall textiles and apparel from the Andean region to the U.S., two-thirds \nof which were assembled and/or cut from U.S. yarns and fabric.\n  This legislation addresses an important, albeit unintentional, \ncontradiction in U.S. policy towards Colombia. With the recent passage \nof enhanced trade benefits to the countries of Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, Colombia stands to lose up to 150,000 jobs in the apparel \nindustry. At least ten (10) U.S.-based companies that purchase apparel \nfrom Colombian garment manufacturers have already indicated their near-\nterm intentions to shift production to CBI countries due to the \nsignificant cost savings associated with the new trade benefits \nafforded to the Caribbean basin. Some of these U.S. companies have \nutilized Colombia as a manufacturing base for over ten (10) years, \nproviding desperately needed legitimate employment in the Colombian \neconomy.\n  In summary, the immediate reaction of these companies to enhanced \nCaribbean trade benefits clearly demonstrates the negative effects of \nthe CBI legislation on Colombia. It would be foolish for the Congress \nto approve a comprehensive aid package for Colombia, while \nsimultaneously implementing legislation that puts tens of thousands of \nColombians out of work. This bill will address that critical, \nunintended contradiction.\n  On a more comprehensive scale, passage of this legislation is \ncritical to ensure that all nations in the Western Hemisphere can \nmaintain their long-term competitiveness with Asian nations, \nparticularly in the textile industry. At present, the textile products \nof most Asian nations are subject to quotas imposed by the Multi-Fiber \nAgreement, now known as the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. This \nrestriction on Asian textiles has enabled the nations of the Western \nHemisphere to remain competitive, and further, the Andean region--\nspecifically Colombia--has become a significant market for fabric woven \nin U.S. mills from yarn spun in the U.S., originating from U.S. cotton \ngrowers.\n  However, in 2005, these Asian import quotas will be phased out. At \nthat time, textile production in both the Andean region and the \nCaribbean basin will be placed at a distinct and growing disadvantage. \nDisinvestment in the region will occur, reducing the incentive to use \nany material from U.S. textile mills or cotton grown in the United \nStates.\n\n\n                               background\n\n  Seventeen years ago, the U.S. Congress passed the first legislation \nto provide trade preferences to the twenty-seven countries of the \nCaribbean Basin. In 1983, the Caribbean Basin was a region inflamed \nwith violent conflict and rampant drug trafficking that threatened the \npolitical and economic stability of our closest neighbors, as well as \nour own national security. The primary goal of the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative (CBI) was to stabilize the region by building stronger and \nmore diverse economies, encouraging growth in international trade, \ndeveloping a strong economic relationship between the U.S. and the \nregion, and creating employment opportunities in the legitimate economy \nas an alternative to drug trafficking.\n\n  Following enactment of CBI, the U.S. trade position with the region \nimproved from a deficit of $3 billion in 1983, to a surplus of nearly \n$3.5 billion in 1998. Between 1983 and 1998, U.S. exports to the region \nincreased fourfold, while total imports from the region grew by less \nthan 20 percent. On a per capita basis, the U.S. trade surplus with the \nregion has consistently outpaced the U.S. trade surplus with any other \nregion of the world--in fact, since 1995, U.S. exports to the CBI \nregion have increased by almost 32 percent.\n  In 1991, after 8 years of resounding success in the CBI region, \nCongress passed the ATPA, providing CBI-like trade benefits to the \ncountries of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In the nine years \nfollowing enactment of ATPA, U.S. exports to the Andean region have \nmore than doubled--from $3.8 billion in 1991 to over $8.6 billion in \n1998. U.S. exports to Colombia account for over half of this increase, \ngrowing from $2 billion in 1991 to $4.8 billion in 1998. During the \nsame time period, Andean exports to the U.S. increased by almost 80 \npercent. In addition, in 1998, the U.S. achieved a $309 million trade \nsurplus with the ATPA nations. Under ATPA, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, \nand Peru enjoyed the same trade benefits that we had extended to the \nCBI region. However, on May 18, 2000, the President signed the ``Trade \nand Development Act of 2000,'' which extended additional trade \nbenefits--particularly with respect to textiles and apparel--to the \nnations of the CBI region. Therefore, our Andean trading partners are \nnow likely to lose significant trade and investment opportunities that \nwill shift to the CBI, given the additional trade benefits included in \nthe ``Trade and Development Act of 2000.''\n\n\n                Need for the ``Plan Colombia Trade Act''\n\n  The United States is at now a critical juncture with its neighbors in \nthe Andean region. As was demonstrated by the recent passage of the \n``Trade and Development Act of 2000.'' it is clear that we must \ncontinue enhance our trading relationship with our partners in the \nCaribbean and the Andean region.\n  In particular, these additional trade benefits should be extended to \nColombia, which is currently fighting a war for the survival of its \ndemocratic institutions, its free market economy and for the future of \nits people. Those challenging Colombia's future include drug \ntraffickers, guerilla groups (the FARC and the ELN) and other elements \nof society who seek to foster instability and fear. A comprehensive \nstrategy in response to the crisis in essential for Colombia.\n  The government of Colombia, therefore, has formulated Plan Colombia. \nThe United States government, in turn, has responded generously to \nColumbia's needs by considering a supplemental appropriations package \nof more than $1.6 billion to help the country in this time of crisis. \nThis will supplement over $4.0 billion being spent by Colombia itself.\n  Fundamental to Plan Colombia (and to the government's ability to \nsucceed in its efforts to safeguard the country) will be efforts to \nencourage economic growth and provide jobs to the Colombian people. \nToday in Colombia more than one million people are displaced, the \nunemployment rate is nearly 20 percent and Colombia is experiencing\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\nthe worst recession in 70 years. Without new economic opportunities, \nmore and more Colombians will turn to illicit activities to support \ntheir families or seek to join the growing numbers of people who are \nleaving the country to find a better, safer future for their families.\n  Measuring both imports and exports, Colombia is by far the most \nimportant U.S. trade partner in the ATPA region. In 1998, over 53 \npercent of U.S. exports to the Andean region went to Colombia, and over \n53 percent of U.S. imports from the Andean region originated from \nColombia.\n  Mr. President, to promote economic growth and regional stability, the \nCongress must consider additional trade measures that benefit the \nentire Andean region. Therefore, Congress should grant CBI parity to \nthe ATPA beneficiaries, specifically with respect to textiles and \napparel. During 1999, Colombia and its Andean neighbors exported \napproximately $562 million in textiles and apparel to the United \nStates. While insignificant in comparison to the $8.4 billion in \ntextile and apparel exports originating in the CBI region, Andean \ntextile and apparel production sustains more than 200,000 jobs in \nColombia alone--valuable jobs in the legitimate economy. Absent CBI \nparity, the Andean region will find itself at a significant competitive \ndisadvantage with the 27 countries of the CBI region.\n  Mr. President, upon final passage of CBI enhancement legislation, I \nstated that we had initiated the process of establishing true \n``partnership for success'' with some of our most important neighbors. \nAlthough that legislation was a good start, it was only the beginning. \nI urge my colleagues to look towards the future by supporting the \n``Plan Colombia Trade Act,'' and by taking advantage of the real \neconomic benefits that can be achieved by further enhancing our \nrelationship with all of the nations of the Western Hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2823\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor the Plan \nColombia Trade Act along with my colleague, Senator Bob Graham. This \nimportant bill will supplement Plan Colombia by expanding trade \nbenefits to the countries of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.\n  Plan Colombia is an important package that provides about a billion \ndollars to the government of Colombia, and other countries in that \nregion. These funds will go to fight drugs, eradicate the crops which \ncreate them, and provide for alternative development. Unfortunately, \nPlan Colombia does not provide for an important measure that we can do \nto help these countries, that is to stimulate their economy. We can \nachieve this by passing the Plan Colombia Trade Act, which will provide \nassistance to develop their textile and apparel industries.\n  Developing the apparel industry of these countries will encourage \nglobal trade, and offer the good people of that region a future filled \nwith prosperity. Additionally, the trade benefits outlined in this bill \nwill enhance peace, stability, and prosperity in that region, which \nwill ultimately yield a better quality of life for all involved. This \nbill will not only benefit the struggling economies of Colombia, \nBolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, but will advance the economy of the United \nStates as well.\n  As important as the assistance package to Colombia is, most of the \nmoney we provide will not reach ordinary Colombians. They also are \nengaged in the effort to combat illegal drugs. We need to ensure that \nthey are not penalized for doing so. The current bill helps us help \nColombians not with cash but with opportunity. It preserves legitimate \njobs in a country sorely beset with problems.\n  Most garments that are produced in Colombia are subject to a 20-30% \nduty rate upon importation into the U.S. As an example, swimsuits are \nsubject to a duty rate of 33%. By granting duty-free and quota-free \nbenefits to apparel assembled in these countries from U.S. made yarn, \nand U.S. made fabric, these countries will now be able to compete with \nother developing countries that currently enjoy duty-free and quota-\nfree benefits. It will also afford them the opportunity to participate \nin the global economy. This will encourage additional export of U.S. \nmade cotton and yarn, stimulate U.S. investment in the region and \ncreate needed jobs as well.\n  This bill is an opportunity to help rebuild a region which has been \nplagued by the drug trade. We can assist these countries, not by giving \nthem more money, but by providing these enhanced trade opportunities. \nBy helping our neighbors in the south to maintain political and \neconomic stability, we will in effect be securing the National Security \nof the United States. This legislation will provide these countries \nwith the opportunity build their industry and their struggling \neconomies and will improve the quality of their everyday lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill which will have a \npositive effect on the prosperity of our neighbors in Colombia, \nEcuador, Bolivia, and Peru.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 2825. A bill to strengthen the effectiveness of the earned income \ntax credit in reducing child poverty and promoting work; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n            the tax relief for working families act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be joined by Senators \nJeffords and Breaux in introducing the Tax Relief for Working Families \nAct of 2000. This bipartisan bill is designed to strengthen the \neffectiveness of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in reducing child \npoverty and promoting work.\n  Our bill will increase the EITC for families with three or more \nchildren. Families could qualify for almost an additional $500. \nObviously, raising a large family costs more, and these families have a \nhigher poverty rate of 29 percent, more than double the poverty rate of \nchildren in smaller families. Nearly three out of every five poor \nchildren live in families with three or more children.\n  A report by the Committee for Economic Development found that the \n``EITC has become a powerful force in dramatically raising the \nemployment of low-income women in recent years.'' The report also \nrecommended further expansions of the EITC. Since research shows that \nlarger families have greater problems leaving welfare for work, this \nlegislation should build upon our welfare reform efforts.\n  But even more compelling than national statistics are the real \nstories from West Virginia families. One woman in Huntington, West \nVirginia is struggling to raise five daughters and care for her husband \nwho was disabled in a roofing accident. That family is managing on \napproximately $13,000 a year. She works the night shift, but must \ncurrently rely on the public bus. Her shift begins at midnight, but the \nlast bus is at 9:00 p.m. so she takes the earlier bus, and spends \nseveral hours waiting for her shift instead of having time with her \nfamily. Last year, she used the EITC to pay her bills, including a \nwinter coat for one of her daughters. With an increase, she hopes to \nsave for a used car.\n  Another West Virginia mother is recently divorced and struggling to \nraise four sons, ranging in age from sixteen to seven. Her 16-year-old \nson has Downs Syndrome. Last year she earned $13,800 and she used her \nEITC to purchase a used van so she would have reliable transportation \nfor her 50-mile commute to work. Another year, the EITC helped pay for \nnew mattresses for her children's beds. With an increase, she'd like to \nsave a little money in case of an emergency or for better housing.\n  These are real stories of real families who are working hard to make \nends meet but need and deserve more help.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. We have closely consulted with leading \ngroups like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Catholic \nCharities U.S.A., the United Way of America, and the Progressive Policy \nInstitute.\n  In addition to increasing the EITC available to large families, our \nbill includes several bipartisan provisions to simplify the credit by \nconforming the definition of earned income and simplifying the \ndefinition of a dependent child.\n  Some may question the cost of expanding the EITC, but I believe, \ncompared to other tax proposals such as providing additional marriage \ntax relief, investing an additional $8 billion over the next five years \nis a reasonable investment to help low-wage working families. Most of \nthese families are married. All are struggling, but working hard to do \nthe right thing for their children. In its letter supporting our \nefforts, Catholic Charities U.S.A. describes our legislation is ``pro-\nfamily, pro-marriage, and pro-work.''\n  During the 1998 tax year, over 19 million working Americans got $30.5 \nbillion in tax relief, thanks to the EITC. In my state, about 141,000 \nWest Virginians claimed $210.7 million. About nineteen percent of West \nVirginia taxpayers benefit from the EITC. In my state, 84 percent of \ntaxpayers earn less than $50,000. I believe that this legislation to \nexpand the EITC for families with three or more children will help more \nWest Virginians than many of the other, more expensive provisions under \nconsideration as part of the marriage penalty relief debate.\n  We know that the EITC works. It encourages work, and it helps lift \nfamilies out of poverty. I urge my colleagues to join with Senators \nJeffords and Breaux to help hard working families raise their children.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senators \nRockefeller and Breaux to introduce a bill that will provide a third-\ntier earned income tax credit (EITC) for families with three or more \nchildren. I believe that the additional tax credit provided by this \nbill could be of significant help to working low-income families.\n  The EITC is a refundable tax credit to low-income families. It is \nonly available to taxpayers who work and earn wages. Indeed, the EITC \nwas enacted to encourage taxpayers to work--even at low-paying jobs--\nrather than relying on government programs. The EITC\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\nhas played a key role in reducing the poverty rate for families. By \nsome estimates, it has been the single most important factor in \nremoving children from poverty.\n  As currently structured, the EITC provides a credit to families with \none child, and a higher credit to families that have two or more \nchildren. Families with three or four children receive the same EITC as \nfamilies with two children.\n  For low-income families of four, we have seen significant progress in \nreducing the incidence of poverty. The combination of the minimum wage, \nthe EITC, and food stamps can raise a family of four with a full-time \nyear-round minimum wage worker close to the poverty line. But poverty \npersists in large families where there are more than two children. In \nfamilies with three or more children, the official poverty rate is 29 \npercent--twice the rate for families with two children. While children \nin families with three or more children were 37 percent of all children \nin the United States in 1998, they comprised 57 percent of the children \nliving in poverty.\n  It is not surprising that reducing poverty is more problematic in \nlarge families. As family size rises, so do family expenses. Welfare \nbenefits increase with family size; wages, however, do not. For a large \nfamily, moving from welfare to work may actually mean less money. In \naddition, with more children, child care is not only more expensive, it \nis also more complicated.\n  With surplus projections now reaching $1.7 trillion, there are a \nwhole host of tax reform proposals--many meritorious--circulating on \nCapitol Hill. In the debate about tax cuts, we must not lose sight of \nour most vulnerable workers. We should build on the proven success of \nthe EITC to help these workers. I believe a larger earned income tax \ncredit for families with three or more children will help put more low-\nincome families on the path to self-sufficiency, while at the same time \nhelping welfare reform succeed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2826. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of substitute adult day care services under the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the medicare adult day services alternative act\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as this Congress continues to deliberate \noptions of how best to care for our senior population, it is critical \nto consider, as well, the role that caregivers play in accommodating \nthe delivery of such care to loved ones. Family caregivers are often \nforced to make difficult sacrifices. By just one measure, it is \nestimated that the average loss of income to these caregivers is more \nthan $600,000 in wages, pensions and Social Security benefits. This \ndoes not have to be the case, though.\n  It does not have to be the case with the choices afforded by \nlegislation I am pleased to be introducing today along with Senator \nRockefeller of West Virginia aimed at reforming Medicare's home health \nbenefit. The Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act of 2000 would \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for home health benefits the \nchoice to receive those services in qualified adult day care centers, \nand simultaneously assist family caregivers with the very real \ndifficulties in caring for a homebound family member.\n  It is with America's Medicare beneficiaries and family caregivers in \nmind which makes the Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act a \nwinner for Medicare, for patients and for their caregivers. First, it \nwould allow patients to receive home health services in a setting that \npromotes rehabilitation by providing social interaction, meals and \ntherapeutic activities above and beyond the provision of the prescribed \nhome health benefit. Second, caregivers for homebound patients would be \nable to maintain employment outside of the home because they would know \nthat their family member is in a healthy, protected environment during \nthe day.\n  With this legislation, patients could elect to receive some, or all, \nof their home health benefit in a home or an adult day care congregate \nsetting. I think my colleagues would agree with me that the opportunity \nto interact with others with similar needs can improve patients' mental \nand physical wellbeing. While not expanding the existing eligibility \ncriteria for home health, this legislation offers Medicare \nbeneficiaries a greater sense of autonomy afforded by receiving \nnecessary care outside of their homes.\n  The adult day care center would be paid 95% of the rate paid to a \nhome health agency for providing the Medicare-covered service. But \nwithin that lump-sum payment, the adult day care center would also be \nrequired to cover transportation, medication management, therapeutic \nactivities, and meals.\n  The Medicare Adult Day Services Alternative Act recognizes the \nbenefit that will come to family members of Medicare recipients of this \nservice. These caregivers will be able to attend to other things in \ntoday's fast-paced family life, knowing their loved ones are well cared \nfor. This creative solution to health care delivery also adequately \nreimburses providers and is designed to be budget neutral.\n  I hope that members on both sides of the aisle will join me in \nadvancing this important issue for Medicare beneficiaries and their \nfamilies. As this Congress considers various proposals to improve \nMedicare's home health benefit, this proposal deserves the serious \nattention and consideration of my colleagues. I look forward to working \nwith them to enact this pro-beneficiary, potentially cost-saving reform \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2826\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center at Ft. Lyon, Colorado, to the State of \nColorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n         legislation to improve healthcare options for veterans\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to improve \nthe healthcare options for veterans in southern Colorado. To do this, I \nam expediting the transfer of the Ft. Lyon facility to the State of \nColorado, which will allow the Veterans Administration (VA) to \nimplement their plan to use the annual $8.6 million in savings from the \nclosure of Fort Lyon to provide better service to Colorado's veterans \nthrough new outpatient clinics in La Junta, Lamar and Alamosa and a \nsmaller, more efficient nursing home in Pueblo, CO.\n  Ft. Lyon is a historical building, but it is simply not more \nimportant than the needs of those who served us. I would prefer that \nthe money currently used to maintain the facility was instead used to \nprovide medical care for those veterans who need it.\n  This bill will lead to an improvement in medical services for \nveterans in several ways. With the estimated $8.6 million in savings to \nbe realized after the Ft. Lyon closure, clinics will be set up in local \ncommunities which will be closer and more responsive to their local \nveteran communities. This bill mandates that the VA must open the \nreplacement clinics before they convey Ft. Lyon to the State of \nColorado, to ensure there is no gap in service. This bill will help to \nensure that no service-connected veteran's needs are unmet. No veteran \nwill go homeless. Every veteran who needs a nursing home bed due to \nservice connected illness will still be granted one. Those veterans \ncurrently in Ft. Lyon will continue to receive nursing home care, at no \nadditional charges to them. The cemetery and historic Kit Carson chapel \nwill remain fully accessible to the public. And the people of the \nregion will also be assisted by the opening of a state facility to \nreplace Ft. Lyon in the local economy. Without this legislation, there \nare no guarantees any of this would occur.\n  I hope that this bill will be considered and pass quickly, so that \nthe savings and the improvements in veteran's healthcare can begin as \nsoon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Gregg, \n        Mr. Gorton, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 2829. A bill to provide for an investigation and audit at the \nDepartment of Education; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n      department of education investigation and audit legislation\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nrequiring an audit of accounts at the U.S. Department of Education that \nare susceptible to waste, fraud, and abuse. It is unfortunate that \nCongress has to be dealing with this issue, but unfortunately, it is \nall too necessary.\n  As Members of the Senate have been debating education this year, we \nhave stressed the need for accountability of federal funds. Before we \nstress accountability at the local level, though, we must ensure that \naccountability is also occurring at the federal level. It we are going \nto increase the budget for the Department of Education, as the Fiscal \nYear 2001 Labor, Health and Human\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\nServices, and Education Appropriations bill does, we have the \nresponsibility to determine whether the Department is properly \naccounting for the funding that they already have.\n  The U.S. Department of Education is already having problems \noverseeing the programs that it currently administers. For the second \nyear in a row, the Department of Education has been unable to address \nits financial management problems. In its last two audits, the \nDepartment was unable to account for parts of its $32 billion program \nbudget and the $175 billion owed in student loans. Every year, the \nDepartment is required to undergo an independent audit. Unfortunately, \nfor Fiscal years 1998 and 1999, auditors have declared the Department \nof Education inauditable.\n  The House Education and the Workforce Committee has been holding \nhearing on financial problems at the Department of Education, and has \nfound serious instances of duplicate payments to grant winners and an \n$800 million college loan to a single student. In its 1998 audit, the \nDepartment blamed its problems on a faulty new accounting system that \ncost $5.1 million, in addition to the cost of manpower to try to fix \nthe system. A new accounting system will be the third in five years.\n  The most recent 1999 audit showed that the Department's financial \nstewardship remains in the bottom quartile of all major federal \nagencies. It also sent duplicate payments to 52 schools in 1999 at a \ncost of more than $6.5 million. In addition, none of the material \nweaknesses cited in the 1998 audit were corrected.\n  These instances show that the Department is currently vulnerable to \nfraud, waste, and abuse. The House of Representatives has already \nindicated its support for a fraud audit at the Department of Education \nby passing its own version of this bill on June 13, 2000, by an \noverwhelming vote of 380-19. Before Congress entrusts the U.S. \nDepartment of Education with funding that is so important to our \nnation's schools and students, we must demand that the funds they \nalready have are well-managed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2830. A bill to preclude the admissibility of certain confessions \nin criminal cases; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the miranda reaffirmation act of 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its \nlandmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona. I applaud that decision. \nMiranda struck a balance between the needs of law enforcement and the \nrights of a suspect that has worked well for 34 years. There is no \nreason to upset that balance now.\n  Shortly after Miranda was decided in 1966, I became State's Attorney \nfor Chittenden County, Vermont. I remember clearly the immediate impact \nthat this momentous decision had upon law enforcement, prosecutors, \ncriminal defendants and the criminal justice system as a whole. The \nSupreme Court's pronouncement that all suspects in custody needed to be \nadvised of certain constitutional rights, including the privilege \nagainst self-incrimination, before being questioned was as new then as \nit is familiar today.\n  The Miranda decision put into place a fair and bright-line rule that \nboth protects the rights of the accused and has proven workable for law \nenforcement. Statements stemming from custodial interrogation of a \nsuspect are inadmissible at trial unless the police first provide the \nsuspect with a set of four specific warnings: (1) you have the right to \nremain silent; (2) anything you say may be used as evidence against \nyou; (3) you have the right to an attorney; and (4) if you cannot \nafford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.\n  These warnings are necessary to dispel the compulsion inherent in \ncustodial surroundings and so ensure that any statement obtained from \nthe suspect is truly the product of his free choice. As author and \nformer Federal prosecutor Scott Thurow wrote in an opinion article in \nWednesday's New York Times: ``The requirement to recite Miranda is an \nimportant reminder to the police that the war on lawlessness is always \nsubject to the guidance of the law.''\n  Over the last 34 years, the Miranda rule has developed into a bedrock \nprinciple of American criminal law. The required issuance of Miranda \nwarnings has been incorporated in local, State and Federal police \npractice across this nation. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say, as \nthe Court said this week, that Miranda warnings ``have become part of \nour national culture.''\n  Two years after Miranda was decided, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 3501, \nwhich laid down a rule that purported to overrule Miranda and to \nrestore the case-by-case, totality-of-the-circumstances test of a \nconfession's ``voluntariness'' that the Miranda decision found \nconstitutionally inadequate. The validity of section 3501 did not come \nbefore the Court until now because no Administration of either party \nsought to use it, out of concern for its dubious constitutionality. The \nissue was finally presented only because an organization of \nconservative activists maneuvered a case before the most conservative \nFederal appeals court in the country. To her credit, Attorney General \nReno declined to argue that Miranda had been invalidated by section \n3501. She also declined to ask the Supreme Court to overrule Miranda, \non the ground that it has proved to be workable in practice and in many \nrespects beneficial to law enforcement.\n  The Court's decision this week in Dickerson v. United States--\nannounced by the Chief Justice and joined by six other Justices--erased \nany doubt that the protections announced in Miranda are \nconstitutionally required and cannot be overruled by an act of \nCongress. Section 3501's attempt to authorize the admission at trial of \nstatements that would be excluded under Miranda is therefore \nunconstitutional, as I have long believed.\n  This week's resounding reaffirmation of the Miranda rule should put \nto rest the issue of Miranda's continuing vitality. Most law \nenforcement officers made their peace with Miranda long ago: It is time \nfor the rest to do the same. That is why I am disturbed by Justice \nScalia's parting shot in Dickerson. In a dissenting opinion joined by \nJustice Thomas, Justice Scalia vowed to continue to apply section 3501 \nuntil such time as it is repealed.\n  Mr. President, that time has come. I am introducing a bill today, \ntogether with my good friend, Senator Feingold, to repeal section 3501. \nI can think of no good reason to allow this patently unconstitutional \nstatute to remain on the books. On the contrary, leaving section 3501 \non the books is sure to invite more unwarranted attacks on Miranda by \nthe same conservative activists who brought us the Dickerson case. \nEnough is enough. Whatever you think of Miranda's reasoning and its \nresulting rule, seven Supreme Court Justices have reaffirmed its \nconstitutional pedigree. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to uphold their oaths to defend the Constitution by repudiating \nan unconstitutional statute.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2830\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Miranda Reaffirmation Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE 18.\n\n       Section 3501 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsections (a) and (b); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), and (e) as \n     subsections (a), (b), and (c) respectively.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend from \nVermont to introduce the Miranda Reaffirmation Act, a bill that repeals \ntwo sections of the United States Criminal Code because they directly \nconflict with the constitutional rule set forth by the United States \nSupreme court in the 1966 landmark decision of Miranda v. Arizona.\n  This week, nearing the conclusion of a busy term, the United States \nSupreme Court handed down several very important decisions. In one of \nthe more highly anticipated rulings, Dickerson v. United States, the \nCourt held by a 7-2 majority that the rule announced in Miranda is \nstill the supreme law of this\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\nland. As we are all aware, the Miranda rule instructs all law \nenforcement officers that prior to an in-custody interrogation they \nmust inform suspects of several important constitutional rights: the \nright to remain silent, the right to counsel, and the right to have \ncounsel appointed if they cannot afford one.\n  As the Court noted, ``Miranda has become embedded in routine police \npractice to the point where the warning have become part of our \nnational culture.'' Millions of American children have first learned \nabout their constitutional rights by watching police dramas on \ntelevision and hearing the famous Miranda warnings given to criminal \nsuspects.\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court's reaffirmation of the Miranda rule \nwas extremely important. In the Dickerson case, a private legal \nfoundation and a law professor intervened in a criminal case and \nquestioned whether Miranda warnings are constitutionally required. \nRelying on 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3501, they argued that law enforcement \nofficers should not have to inform suspects of their basic \nconstitutional rights before proceeding with in-custody interrogations \nas long as any confessions obtained were determined to be voluntary. \nWhile every administration since the law was passed in 1968 has refused \nto make this argument, a lower court in the Dickerson case agreed with \nit. Section 3501 was enacted in 1968, just two years after the original \nMiranda decision. It was a clear attempt by Congress to overturn the \nconstitutional rule laid down in that case.\n  It is a strange quirk of history that the validity of Sec. 3501 and \nCongress's attempt to overrule Miranda was addressed for the first time \nby the Supreme Court in the Dickerson case. The reason is that a series \nof Departments of Justice, under both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents assumed that the statute was unconstitutional and refused to \nproceed under it. In Dickerson, the Supreme Court agreed with that \nview.\n  Writing for a seven justice majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed \nout that ``because of the obvious conflict between our decision in \nMiranda and Sec. 3501 we must address whether Congress has the \nconstitutional authority to thus supercede Miranda.'' Second, the Chief \nJustice reiterated the established principle that ``Congress may not \nlegislatively supercede our decision[s] interpreting and applying the \nconstitution,'' and he concluded by ruling that ``Miranda announced a \nconstitutional rule that Congress may not supercede legislatively.''\n  Justice Scalia, in dissent, disagreed vehemently with the majority's \nanalysis. In a somewhat curious declaration of defiance he wrote: \n``[U]ntil Sec. 3501 is repealed, [I] will continue to apply it in all \ncases where there has been a sustainable finding that the defendant's \nconfession was voluntary.''\n  Mr. President, as a result of the Court's unequivocal ruling in \nDickerson, we now have a law on the books that the Court has ruled is \ninconsistent with what the Constitution requires with respect to \nconstitutional in-custody interrogations. That may seem to be a matter \nof little consequence, but the statement of Justice Scalia that he will \ncontinue to apply it in future cases shows that it is not. The bill \nthat we are introducing today eliminates this potential problem by \nremoving the unconstitutional provision from the criminal code.\n  This repeal will accomplish two things. It will bring our criminal \ncode into line with what the Supreme Court has now firmly established \nas the law of the land, and it will remove from the books an \nineffective law that Justice Rehnquist considered ``more difficult than \nMiranda for law enforcement officers to conform to, and for courts to \napply in a consistent manner.'' The prophylactic rule established by \nMiranda has worked well and stood the test of time. Law enforcement \nofficers, prosecutors, and defense attorneys have found that it is a \nfar better way to protect the constitutional rights of those accused of \ncrimes than the ``voluntariness'' standard that was in place before \nMiranda and that Sec. 3501 attempted to keep in place.\n  Mr. President, it is simply not appropriate for the existing criminal \ncode to conflict with what the Supreme Court has ruled that the \nConstitution requires. It is our duty to act to repeal a provision that \nthe Department of Justice has refused to apply and that the Supreme \nCourt has held, in any event, cannot be enforced. As the ranking member \nof the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nam proud to join the ranking member of the full Committee, Senator \nLeahy, in offering this straightforward and commonsense measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 2831. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to improve conservation and management of sharks and \nestablish a consistent national policy toward the practice of shark-\nfinning; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6141-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6141-S6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE SHARK CONSERVATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Shark \nConservation Act of 2000, legislation that will significantly improve \nconservation and management of sharks worldwide, and establish a \nconsistent national policy toward the practice of shark-finning. The \nbill would prohibit the practice of shark finning and transshipment of \nshark fins by U.S. vessels, set forth a process to encourage foreign \ngovernments to end this practice by their own fishing fleets, and \nauthorize badly needed fisheries research on shark populations. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by the Ranking Member of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Hollings.\n  Mr. President, sharks are among the most biologically vulnerable \nspecies in the ocean. Their slow growth, late maturity and small number \nof offspring leave them exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing and \nslow to recover from depletion. At the same time, sharks, as top \npredators, are essential to maintaining the balance of life in the sea. \nWhile many of our other highly migratory species such as tunas and \nswordfish are subject to rigorous management regimes, sharks have \nlargely been overlooked until recently.\n  The bill first amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act to prohibit shark finning, which is the practice of \nremoving a shark's fins and returning the remainder of the shark to \nsea, and provides a rebuttable presumption that shark fins found on \nboard a U.S. vessel were taken by finning, thus closing the \ntransshipment loophole. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) \nregulations in the Atlantic Ocean prohibit the practice of shark \nfinning, but a nationwide prohibition does not currently exist. Shark \nfins comprise only a small percentage of the weight of the shark, and \nyet this is often the only portion of the shark retained. The Magnuson-\nStevens Act and international commitments discourage unnecessary waste \nof fish, and thus I believe this bill ensure our domestic regulations \nare consistent on this point. Another goal of the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct--the minimization of bycatch and bycatch mortality--is an issue \nthat I have been particularly committed to over the years. Because most \nof the sharks caught and finned are incidentally captured in fisheries \ntargeting other species, I believe establishing a domestic ban will \nhelp us further reduce this type of shark mortality.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would also direct the Secretary of \nCommerce to initiate negotiations with foreign countries in order to \nencourage those countries to adopt shark finning prohibitions similar \nto ours. The establishment of a prohibition of shark finning by United \nStates fishermen, or in waters subject to our jurisdiction, will not \nreduce finning by international fishing fleets or transshipment or \nlanding of fins taken by these fleets. At present, foreign fleets \ntransship or land approximately 180 metric tons of shark fins annually \nthrough ports in the Pacific alone. The global shark fin trade involves \nat least 125 countries, and the demand for shark fins and other shark \nproducts has driven dramatic increases in shark fishing and shark \nmortality around the world.\n  International measures are an absolutely critical component of \nachieving effective shark conservation. Under my legislation, the \nSecretary would be mandated to report to Congress on progress being \nmade domestically and\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\ninternationally to reduce shark finning. Further, this legislation will \nestablish a procedure for determining whether governments have adopted \nshark conservation measures which are comparable to ours through import \ncertification procedures for sharks or shark parts. Imports of sharks \nor shark parts from countries that do not meet these certification \nprocedures are prohibited. I have also included provisions which would \nprovide technical assistance to foreign nations in an attempt to \npromote compliance.\n  Finally, my bill would authorize a Western Pacific longline fisheries \ncooperative research program to provide information for shark stock \nassessments, identify fishing gear and practices that prevent or \nminimize incidental catch of sharks and ensure maximum survivorship of \nreleased sharks, and provide data on the international shark fin trade.\n  Mr. President, the United States is a global leader in fisheries \nconservation and management. I believe this legislation provides us the \nopportunity to further this role, and take the first step in addressing \nan international fisheries management issue. In addition, I believe the \nU.S. should continue to lead efforts at the United Nations and \ninternational conventions to achieve coordinated international \nmanagement of sharks, including an international ban on shark-finning. \nI look forward to working with Committee members on this important \nlegislation.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2832. A bill to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            the magnuson-stevens reauthorization act of 2000\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I rise today to introduce a bill that will reauthorize the \nmost important Federal fisheries management law, the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act. In 1996, Congress last \nreauthorized this law through enactment of the Sustainable Fisheries \nAct (SFA). The SFA contained the most substantial improvements to \nfisheries conservation since the original passage of the Magnuson Act \nin 1976.\n  The SFA made wholesale changes in fisheries management. For the first \ntime, it required the regional fishery management councils and the \nSecretary of Commerce to prevent and end overfishing, reduce bycatch, \nprotect essential fish habitat, and consider fishing communities in the \nregulatory decision-making process. These provisions of the SFA have \npresented a great challenge to the National Marine Fisheries Service \nthe regional councils, and the fishermen who are regulated under this \nlaw. While the goals and intent of the SFA were certainly laudable, \nfour years later, we still have a significant amount of work to do in \nthat regard.\n  Therefore, today, Mr. President, I introduce the Magnuson-Stevens \nReauthorization Act of 2000 with several very specific goals in mind. \nFirst and foremost, this bill provides for a major increase in funding. \nWhile the demands on fisheries managers at the local and federal levels \nhave increased exponentially, funding has essentially remained level. \nOne of the most serious problems in fisheries management is a lack of \nbasic information on the resource. This bill, through increased funding \nand the establishment of two programs, will go a long way toward \nfilling existing critical gaps in our information databases. For the \npast several years, Senators Kerry, Gregg, and I have worked to \nestablish a cooperative research program in New England fisheries. This \nprogram, which requires federal and local scientists to partner with \ncommercial fishermen in the gathering and development of fisheries \ndata, has proven quite successful. Therefore, this bill would establish \na National Cooperative Research and Management program to be \nadministered by the agency in conjunction with the regional councils \nand local fishermen. In addition, the bill also establishes a National \nCooperative Enforcement program. This too is based on existing programs \nin several states, where state marine law enforcement officers are \ndeputized by their federal counterparts to help enforce conservation \nand management provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other marine \nrelated laws. Lack of enforcement of fisheries laws has been a constant \nproblem for fishermen and fisheries managers.\n  This bill also addresses one of the most serious and emotional \nquestions in fisheries management--individual fishing quotas (IFQs). \nThe SFA included a five year moratorium on new IFQ programs and \nrequired the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study the issue. The \nNAS report issued a series of recommendations on IFQs. The first \nrecommendation was for Congress to lift the existing moratorium on new \nIFQ programs and authorize the councils to design and implement new \nIFQs. The moratorium is set to expire on October 1, 2000.\n  This recommendation has received a lot of publicity. However, the NAS \nreport contained a number of other recommendations to Congress that \nwere to be considered in conjunction with the authorization of any new \nIFQ programs. These recommendations concern substantive issues, yet \nthey have not received the level of attention that they fully deserve. \nFor instance, the NAS recommended that Congress should encourage cost \nrecovery and extraction of profits from new IFQ programs through fees, \nannual taxes, and zero-revenue auctions. The NAS also recommended that \nthe Act be amended to allow the public to capture windfall gains \ngenerated from the initial allocation of IFQs. Additional \nrecommendations include requiring accumulation limits and determining \nrules for foreign ownership.\n\n  Mr. President, the NAS report contains important recommendations that \nshould be thoroughly examined by Congress and the public. I understand \nthat in some regions of the country, both commercial and recreational \nfishermen want to immediately move to the design and implementation of \nnew IFQ programs. However, it is clear that many of the important \nquestions associated with any new IFQ program have not been fully \nconsidered and immediate implementation of such programs could have \ndeleterious affects on fisheries and fishing communities. For that \nreason, the bill I introduce today contains a three year extension of \nthe existing moratorium.\n  This provision simply recognizes that fisheries conservation and \nmanagement must be approached from a long-term perspective. Widespread \nimplementation of IFQ programs will drastically alter the face of \nfishing communities and the way we pursue fisheries conservation \nmeasures. If IFQs are indeed the answer that many of their advocates \nclaim, then surely IFQs will still be a viable option in three years. \nBut, a short-term extension of the moratorium, as this bill proposes, \nwill force the Congress and fishing communities to consider the many \nother necessary questions related to IFQs. The NAS report recommended \nCongress provide guidance on these issues because they are clearly \nquestions of national concern, and I suggest that we follow that \ncourse.\n  Mr. President, this bill provides a number of other improvements, \nincluding increased flexibility to the agency to reaffirm the original \nintent of Congress that there is no ``one-size-fits-all'' solution to \nfisheries management. Moreover, the bill would provide for an expanded \nnational observer program to help collect critical information. It is \nwidely recognized that we need to increase our use of observers to gain \ndata on species composition, age structure, and bycatch. The bill also \nestablishes a pilot program to help fisheries managers begin the move \ntoward ecosystem-based management. While it is clear that we do not \ncurrently have sufficient information of resources to make a full shift \nto ecosystem-based management, it is equally clear that we need to move \nin this direction and a pilot program can illustrate for us how to do \nthis.\n  Finally, I would like to say that this bill represents a significant \namount of work by the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries. Over the \npast year, the Subcommittee held six hearings in various parts of the \ncountry on the Magnuson Stevens Act. We begin the process in \nWashington, DC, and then visited fishing communities in New England, \nThe Gulf of Mexico, the North Pacific and the Pacific. In this bill, I \nhave tried to incorporate many of the suggestions we heard from those \nmen and women who fish for a living and who\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\nare most affected by the law and its regulations. I view this bill as a \nbasis from which I intend to work with other members of the \nSubcommittee so that the Commerce Committee can consider it in \nexecutive session in July. I look forward to providing our fishing \ncommunities with a bill that will improve lives in a meaningful way.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2833. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nimprove the enforcement capabilities of the Federal Election \nCommission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n      Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 Amendments Legislation\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Today the Senate passed, and sent to the \nPresident for signature, the most significant campaign finance reform \nin the last 2 decades--the so-called section 527 reform. Clearly, our \ncampaign finance system is in need of further comprehensive reform. The \nMcCain-Feingold legislation, I believe, is still the most comprehensive \nand necessary reform that we could pass in the 106th Congress.\n\n  In the meantime, however, we must also strengthen the abilities of \nthe agency charged with enforcing the laws on the books today--and that \nis the Federal Election Commission. For that reason, I am today \nintroducing legislation to improve the enforcement capabilities of the \nFederal Election Commission.\n  Created in the wake of the Watergate scandal, the primary purpose of \nthe Federal Election Commission is to ensure the integrity of federal \nelections by overseeing federal election disclosure requirements and \nenforcing the federal campaign finance laws.\n  Regardless of the views of my colleagues with regard to the need for \ncampaign finance reform, it cannot be argued that Congress intended \nthat this enforcement agency be nothing more than a paper tiger. And \nyet, that is precisely what many view it to be. The legislation I am \nintroducing today is intended to put some teeth into this enforcement \nbody.\n  As a long time supporter of comprehensive campaign finance reform, I \nam not suggesting that my proposal is in any way a substitute for the \nMcCain-Feingold bill or any other comprehensive reform. But sadly, it \nis clear that a minority in this body will once again prevent a \nmajority of both houses of Congress from enacting meaningful reform \nthis year.\n  As has been the case for the last several congresses, the 106th \nCongress will likely come to a close without enacting comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform. In light of that reality, it is all the more \nimportant that we ensure that the campaign finance laws that are \ncurrently on the books are vigorously enforced. And that requires an \nagency that is fully armed with all the enforcement tools we can give \nit.\n  The legislation I am proposing today would give the Federal Election \nCommission the tools it needs to ensure compliance with the law. \nSpecifically, this legislation would give the Commission the authority \nto conduct random audits and investigations to ensure voluntary \ncompliance with the act. The potential of a random audit is a well-\nrecognized deterrent to potential violators and an authority given to \nmany federal enforcement agencies.\n  Secondly, this legislation would grant the Commission the authority \nto seek injunctive relief in the event that certain statutory \nconditions are met, including:\n  that there is a substantial likelihood that a violation of the act is \noccurring or about to occur;\n  that the failure to act expeditiously will result in irreparable \nharm;\n  that expeditious action will not cause undue harm or prejudice; and\n  that the best interest of the public would be served by the issuance \nof an injunction.\n  Finally, this legislation would increase the penalties for knowing \nand willful violations of the act from $10,000 to $15,000 or an amount \nequal to 300 percent. In order to ensure that the Commission has \nsufficient resources to carry out its statutory responsibilities, my \nlegislation provides for an authorization of appropriations for FY 2001 \nat the full amount requested by the Commission, or nearly $41 million.\n  Enhanced enforcement authority is not a substitute for comprehensive \nreform. But passage of this legislation should be something every \nmember of this body can support. Not to do so only confirms the \ncritics' views that this agency is a toothless tiger.\n  I urge my colleagues to give serious consideration to this \nlegislation.\n\n

Res. 330\n\n       Whereas current research indicates that more than 1.5 \n     million Americans, of all ages and of both genders, have had \n     amputations;\n       Whereas every year 156,000 individuals in the United States \n     lose a limb;\n       Whereas each month 13,000 individuals lose a limb;\n       Whereas each week 2,996 individuals lose a limb;\n       Whereas each day 428 individuals lose a limb;\n       Whereas becoming an amputee is a lifetime condition, not \n     just a temporary circumstance;\n       Whereas prosthetic care can range in cost from $8,000 to \n     more than $70,000 depending on the level of care and function \n     of the patient;\n       Whereas most insurance policies cover prosthetics with the \n     stipulation of one prosthesis per patient for life;\n       Whereas the average prosthesis lasts between three and five \n     years;\n       Whereas the general public is unaware of the plight of the \n     amputee community;\n       Whereas an increased awareness to the issues faced by the \n     amputee community will also bring about increased awareness \n     for further research; and\n       Whereas establishing ``National Amputee Awareness Week'' \n     will bring the cause of amputee awareness to the national \n     front: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week of September 24, through September \n     30, 2000, as ``National Amputee Awareness Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons to promote the awareness of the \n     amputee community, and to observe the week with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the Senate floor \ntoday to introduce a resolution to declare the week of September 24-30 \n``National Amputee Awareness Week.'' When passed, this resolution will \ndesignate a specific time around which the Nation's amputee community \ncan rally. Too often, we lose sight of many of those who are right in \nfront of our very eyes. By dedicating this week to their cause, we will \nmake certain that we no longer forget both the accomplishments and \nproblems of the large and diverse amputee community.\n  The loss of limb can strike anyone, at any time. Each year 156,000 \npeople lose a limb. This equates to 13,000 amputations per month, 2,996 \namputations per week, 428 amputations per day and 18 amputations per \nhour in the United States alone. People from all backgrounds have had \nto deal with the hardships associated with amputation. Over half of \namputations in the United States occur among elderly citizens as a \nresult of vascular deficiencies. From childhood to middle adulthood, \nthe most common cause of limb loss is from traumatic injuries. Other \nmajor causes can include primary bone malignancies and congenital limb \ndefects.\n  Although there have been great strides in prosthetic research, many \npeople are still limited by the financial burdens associated with \nacquiring an artificial limb. A new prosthetic device can cost between \n$8,000 and $70,000. These limbs must often be replaced every few years, \nadding to the burden placed on an amputee. Even when insurance does \ncover the cost of these new prosthetic devices, it is often a one-time \nreimbursement. This leaves the amputee to deal with any further care or \nreplacement devices that are necessary.\n  The prosthetic device is not the only cost incurred by the amputee. \nThere are many secondary factors that must be considered. Over 25,000 \npeople are readmitted to the hospital each year due to complications \nresulting from their amputation. Amputees must deal with both the \nphysical and emotional consequences of limb loss. Physical therapy must \nbe undertaken to learn how to perform the most basic tasks with a new, \nforeign limb. They must often also look for alternate occupations once \nlimb loss has made their current occupation infeasible. As a result, \namputees must often undergo counseling to help them come to terms \nemotionally with their altered lifestyle.\n  According to the Amputee Coalition of America, amputees hope to one \nday see the elimination of barriers to their full participation in all \naspects of life. In addition, they hope to see improvements in \nartificial limbs and prosthetic research. Finally they hope to see \nimproved outcomes for amputees in the areas of chronic post-amputation \npain and depression.\n  There are countless locally-based organizations in the United States \nwho provide services to amputees with very little recognition. One of \nthose such organizations is located in Oklahoma. The Limbs of Life \nFoundation is a nationwide non-profit organization established in 1995 \nin Oklahoma City to meet the needs of the amputee community. They do \nthis in part by providing limbs at a free or discounted rate to \nindividuals who would not normally be able to afford such devices. To \ndate they have provided over 4,700 amputees with a prosthetic limb.\n  However, Limb for Life's efforts are not limited to limb provision. \nThey also seek to raise awareness of the amputee cause. Each year this \nfoundation holds a bike ride from Oklahoma City to Austin, Texas to \nraise funds for their efforts. This year's ``Project 50-2000'' will \nprovide funds to purchase limbs for those in need and will bring \nnational attention to the amputee community. This is the type of effort \nthat National Amputee Awareness Week is designed to spotlight.\n  Mr. President, declaring the week of September 24-30 ``National \nAmputee Awareness Week'' would serve many purposes. At this point in \ntime amputees have only a fragmented network through which to address \ntheir concerns. This week would provide them with a point of cohesion \nduring which all amputees can come together in response to and in \nrecognition of their common cause. Not only will amputees benefit from \nthis week, the general population would also have the opportunity to be \ninformed of the unique needs and problems faced by the amputee \ncommunity. The amputee community and the general population would both \ngain from increased interaction that this week would bring.\n  In closing, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in creating this \nimportant awareness and outreach opportunity for the amputee community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/29/senate-section/article/S6145-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6145-S6146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 331--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND \n        LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN UNITED STATES V.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House of Representatives on the bill (S. 148), to \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to provide \nassistance in the conservation of neotropical migratory birds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 148) entitled \n     ``An Act to require the Secretary of the Interior to \n     establish a program to provide assistance in the conservation \n     of neotropical migratory birds'', do pass with the following \n     amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird \n     Conservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the \n     United States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and \n     the large majority of those species, the neotropical \n     migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean;\n       (2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable \n     environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits \n     to the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;\n       (3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once \n     considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to \n     the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in \n     jeopardy; and\n       (B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations \n     of those species is habitat loss and degradation (including \n     pollution and contamination) across the species' range; and\n       (4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across \n     numerous international borders each year, their conservation \n     requires the commitment and effort of all countries along \n     their migration routes; and\n       (B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve \n     migratory birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be \n     significantly strengthened and enhanced by increased \n     coordination.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical \n     migratory birds;\n       (2) to assist in the conservation of neotropical migratory \n     birds by supporting conservation initiatives in the United \n     States, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and\n       (3) to provide financial resources and to foster \n     international cooperation for those initiatives.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Account.--The term ``Account'' means the Neotropical \n     Migratory Bird Conservation Account established by section \n     9(a).\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\n       (2) Conservation.--The term ``conservation'' means the use \n     of methods and procedures necessary to bring a species of \n     neotropical migratory bird to the point at which there are \n     sufficient populations in the wild to ensure the long-term \n     viability of the species, including--\n       (A) protection and management of neotropical migratory bird \n     populations;\n       (B) maintenance, management, protection, and restoration of \n     neotropical migratory bird habitat;\n       (C) research and monitoring;\n       (D) law enforcement; and\n       (E) community outreach and education.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, the Migratory Bird Conservation Act which \nI introduced with the Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, and our late \ncolleague Senator Chafee, is designed to protect the habitat of the \nover 90 endangered species of migratory birds which spend the spring \nand summer months in the United States and the winter months in other \nWestern Hemisphere nations.\n  This will be the third time this bill has passed the Senate. It \npreviously cleared the Senate in 1998 and early 1999, but, until \nMonday's 384-22 House vote, the legislation was stalled in the other \nchamber.\n  Despite taking almost three years, this legislation remains very \ntimely. Many bird species of birds are threatened despite the growing \npopularity of birdwatching.\n  Every year approximately 25 million Americans travel to observe \nbirds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds at home. \nAccording to the Fish and Wildlife Service, bird watching and feeding \ngenerates fully $20 billion every year in revenue across America.\n  Protecting the various species of birds benefits the nation in a \nvariety of ways. The increased popularity of birdwatching is \nincreasingly reflected in the new tourist dollars being spent in small, \nrural communities. Healthy bird communities also prevent crop failures \nand infestations by controlling insect populations, thus saving \nhundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year to farming \nand timber interests. And yet, despite the enormous benefits we derive \nfrom our bird populations, many of them are struggling to survive.\n  In my own State we are working to bring the Kirtland's Warbler back \nfrom the brink of extinction. A few years ago, the population of this \ndistinctive bird has been estimated at approximately 200 nesting pairs. \nSince then, a great deal of work has been done by\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\nMichigan DNR employees to preserve the Kirtland's Warbler habitat in \nthe Bahamas, where they winter. Thanks in large part to this effort, \nthe number of breeding pairs has recently increased to an estimated \n800.\n  The problem we face in Michigan is simple. Since the entire species \nspends half of the year in the Bahamas, the significant efforts made by \nMichigan's Department of Natural Resources and concerned residents of \nMichigan will not be enough to save this bird if its winter habitat is \ndestroyed. The same story is likely true for at least one bird species \nin every other state.\n\n  Because migratory birds range across a number of international \nborders every year, we must work to establish safeguards at both ends \nof their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover areas along \ntheir way. Only in this case can conservation efforts prove successful.\n  That is why Senator Daschle, Senator Chafee, and I introduced the \nNeotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. This legislation will \nprotect bird habitats across international boundaries by teaming \nbusinesses with conservation groups, thus combining capital with know-\nhow.\n  These entities will then partner with local organizations in \ncountries where bird habitat is endangered to help teach the local \npeople how to preserve and maintain their critical natural habitat.\n  The 5 year demonstration project created by this Act will provide $5 \nmillion each year to help establish cost-sharing, habitat conservation \nprograms in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n  This legislation is proactive, avoids complicated and expensive \nbureaucratic structures and will bring needed focus and expertise to \nareas now receiving relatively little attention in the area of \nenvironmental degradation. And it has wide support in the environmental \nand conservation communities.\n  This legislation is endorsed by the National Audubon Society, Ducks \nUnlimited, the Nature Conservancy, the American Bird Conservancy, \nDefenders of Wildlife, the American Forest and Paper Association and \nthe Conservation Fund. These organizations agree that establishing \npartnerships between business, government and nongovernmental \norganizations both here and abroad can greatly enhance the protection \nof migratory bird habitat.\n  I want to thank the distinguished minority leader, my original \npartner for the past two and one half years, for his hard work and \nefforts on behalf of this legislation. His involvement and \nperserverance--long with those of Peter Hanson and Eric Washburn of his \nstaff--helped us overcome a variety of obstacles and pave the way for \nthis bill to become law.\n  I also want to thank Senator Bob Smith, Chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, for his efforts to move this legislation \nforward. The continuing commitment of the Senate Environment Committee \nwas essential to bringing this bill to the finish line.\n  And let me recognize the efforts of Kevin Kolevar of my staff, who \nbegan the work on this bill back in February of 1998.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to recognize the efforts of our former \ncolleague and friend, Senator John Chafee, who passed away earlier this \nyear. As chairman of the Environmental Committee, Senator Chafee was a \ndriving force behind this legislation. Senator Chafee and his committee \nstaffer, Jason Patlis, shepherded this bill through the Senate twice.\n  This legislation is yet another addition to the long list of \ncontributions made by Senator John Chafee to protect our natural \nresources for generations.\n  I can think of no better tribute to Senator Chafee than to send this \nbill to the President with a resounding bipartisan vote by the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the Senate agree to the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
